TIMES SQ. HOTEL WELCOMES ACK RESIDENTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
 By NICHOLE M. CHRISTIAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ They came on fot, by bus and in crammed taxis. One
man even traveled 20 blocks in his motorized wheelchair. The men
and women of the Woodstock Hotel returned home Thursday, toting
their belongings in large green trash bags and tattered cardboard
boxes.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the exile was over for 250 low-income elderly people
who were hoping to return to their former lives and all the
essentials left behind on the morning of July 21, when a temporary
elevator tower at the half-completed Conde Nast building in Times
Square collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   A portion of the scaffolding crashed through the Woodstock's
roof, killing an 85-year-old resident, Thereza Feliconio, and
forcing the evacuation of the other residents. While many found
things just as they had left them, others discovered unexpected
improvements and a few disorienting changes.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the returning residents blew through the lobby so fast
that neither the hotel's staff nor officials from Project Find, the
nonprofit social service agency that owns the Woodstock on West
43rd Street, had time to explain the changes to some rooms. Few
bothered to collect their Social Security checks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been waiting to come home for two months,'' said Ed
Boulanger, who guided his wheelchair from a YMCA on West 63rd
Street to the Woodstock's front door. ``I wasn't going to wait
another minute,'' he said, eagerly steering his chair toward a
lobby elevator. Moments later, he happily announced that his room
and belongings were intact.
</P>
<P>
   But when Mario Boutte, 66, turned the key to his two-room
apartment Thursday, his excitement dissolved. The three black
plastic crates he had kept stocked with cans of peaches, sardines
and collard greens were bare. Towels and other items he had kept in
tidy order in the bathroom were scattered on the floor and in the
sink.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel so violated,'' he said. ``My drawers, my towels. They
went through everything. I kept the stuff in my place neat. Why'd
they have to do this?''
</P>
<P>
   Other residents opened their doors to pleasant surprises. In
Roberta Taylor's room, someone not only cleaned a rickety electric
fan she had used for most of the summer but also replaced the worn
and missing screws.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's better than I expected,'' Ms. Taylor, 60, a recovering
alcoholic who also suffers from osteoporosis, said as she dragged
the rest of her bags into her room. ``God's been good to us.''
</P>
<P>
   Back in the lobby, dozens of residents like Boutte thronged the
counter and doorway, asking Cynthia Dial, Project Find's executive
director, and her staff for explanations about their missing
property. Many of the items, particularly canned goods,
refrigerators and shower curtains, were casualties of the cleanup,
Ms. Dial said.
</P>
<P>
   The building was so infested with mice, she said, that it had to
be fumigated and then stripped of any items with chemical residue.
The cleaning crew also destroyed several refrigerators because they
were filled with rotten food and overrun by roaches.
</P>
<P>
   To those residents reporting the loss of VCRs, watches and cash,
Ms. Dial promised to investigate the claims and replace as many
items as possible with money from the building's insurance company
and corporate donations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We realize how confusing it is to come home after all this
time and find that things are not quite like you left them,'' she
said. ``But we're going to make sure that everyone feels whole
again.''
</P>
<P>
   And she is working to insure that residents are not charged for
any phone calls made during the time they lived out of the
building. ``We're doing all we can to see that this entire ordeal
is put behind them as quickly as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   She said she was well aware that this is a fragile population
dealing with infirmities and poverty. (A typical resident's income
is less than $10,000 a year, with 30 percent going toward rent.)
</P>
<P>
   And for 20 residents, there is even more uncertainty about when
things will return to normal, because their rooms were among a
handful still under repair.
</P>
<P>
   But the most glaring reminder of the accident _ the Conde Nast
building itself _ will linger for a few more weeks while
construction is being completed, said Douglas Durst, the building's
developer. The first tenants are scheduled to begin moving in next
June.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators are still trying to determine what caused the
collapse of the giant scaffolding at the Conde Nast building, on
Broadway between 42nd and 43rd Streets. Four teams of forensic
engineers are poring over the twisted remains of the 700-foot
scaffold, which now sits on a Brooklyn pier under 24-hour guard,
and interviewing witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration is
continuing its investigation of the accident, as well as of the
death last June of a carpenter who was crushed in an elevator used
to haul building materials up the side of the tower.
</P>
<P>
   But for one resident, Dean Johnson, the most crucial question
about the accident was resolved Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``My bed and the building are still here,'' he said. As for his
missing refrigerator and the still unanswered question about the
scaffolding, Johnson said he could not care less. ``It's another
New York experience. You roll with it and keep surviving.''

WHITMAN SAYS THAT GOP IS READY FOR WOMAN TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By JAMES DAO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Gov. Christie Whitman of New Jersey says she
believes that the Republican Party is ready to nominate for
president or vice president a woman who supports abortion rights.
Someone, that is, like her.
</P>
<P>
   She also wants to move New Jersey's presidential primary from
June to March to increase the state's influence over choosing the
next Republican ticket _ which, she hopes, will include a candidate
who is fiscally conservative but moderate on social issues.
Someone, indeed, like her.
</P>
<P>
   And, by the way, she thinks governors make the best presidents.
</P>
<P>
   Those were some of the thoughts that Whitman shared with a group
of political reporters in Washington on Thursday at a gathering
known around town as an informal auditioning room for politicians
shouldering national ambitions.
</P>
<P>
   And although Whitman said she was not interested, for now, in
seeking national office, she managed to talk for an hour on matters
of national import, including the future of her party, abortion,
tax cuts, President Clinton and the rebuilding of her region's
fading political power.
</P>
<P>
   Even in her denials of White House ambitions, Whitman made clear
that she believed that someone with her views _ and sex and
geographic background _ would be ideally suited for the Republican
national ticket.
</P>
<P>
   ``I certainly think the party is ready to embrace somebody who
is not a litmus-test person and who may differ with others on some
of the social issues, abortion being obviously the main one,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   She added, ``It's important, I think, if you are going to win
nationally, to be able to deliver a message in the Northeast, in
the New Yorks and in the New Jerseys.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if it will be 2000,'' she went on, ``but within
the next 10 years I think we will see a woman, if not as a
presidential candidate, certainly vice presidential. And that may
happen a lot sooner than that.''
</P>
<P>
   The brunch on Thursday was just the latest in a string of events
in recent weeks that seem intended to restore Whitman's national
profile, which suffered somewhat after she barely won re-election
last November. She has helped Republican candidates raise money in
five Western states, given a foreign policy speech at the Richard
Nixon Library and Birthplace in California and appeared on the
television talk shows ``Politically Incorrect'' and ``Hardball.''
</P>
<P>
   Whitman also spent Thursday speaking at two fund-raisers for the
Republican Senatorial Campaign Committee in Washington and is
scheduled to go on campaign swings for Republicans in California,
Illinois and Colorado in the coming two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   This was hitman's first appearance at the brunch, organized by
Godfrey Sperling Jr., a columnist for The Christian Science
Monitor. It came several months after another Republican governor
with possible national aspirations, George Pataki of New York, had
a somewhat rough time in his inaugural appearance before the group.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman's appearance went more smoothly, perhaps because many of
the questions were on an issue she knows well: abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Though many opponents of abortion consider her ``the
Antichrist,'' Mrs. Whitman said, she believes they are a minority
in the Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   She also said that her position on abortion had been
misunderstood by many in the anti-abortion camp.
</P>
<P>
   When she vetoed a bill that would ban a form of late-term
abortion last year, Whitman noted, she told the legislature she
would sign legislation that prohibited abortions involving a
``viable fetus'' except in cases in which the mother's long-term
health was at stake.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is a really very comfortable position for a lot of
pro-life people,'' she said. ''
</P>
<P>
   Whitman also discussed her recent call for the resignation of
Clinton. She said she thought that his videotaped grand jury
testimony was pathetic and that he had lost all credibility.
</P>
<P>
   But she declined to say whether he should be impeached. And
while she defended the House Republican leadership's handling of
the Lewinsky matter, she also warned against Republican candidates'
using Clinton's troubles in the fall campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman, who opposed moving up the state's presidential primary
four years ago, said she changed her mind amid concerns that New
Jersey had become irrelevant in the nominating process. Her
preferred date, March 7, is when New York, Connecticut, California,
Maine, Massachusetts and Maryland will hold primaries. She said she
would also urge Pennsylvania and Delaware to hold their votes on
that day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then you'd have two big, bicoastal primaries,'' she said.
``And that means a much broader, I think, platform and program that
will yield a candidate who is in a better position to win a
national election.''

THERE'S A LINE FOR THIS DRIVER'S SEAT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL SCHLOTTER  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Ostensibly, La Canada road racer Tommy Kendall
will be in Houston this weekend as part of ABC television's
broadcast team at Sunday's CART Texaco Grand Prix of Houston.
</P>
<P>
   But the four-time Sports Car Club of America Trans-Am season
champ will have another agenda as well when his plane touches down
in the land of oil wells: putting himself behind the wheel of CART
champion Alex Zanardi's Reynard Honda racer _ permanently.
</P>
<P>
   With Zanardi departing CART for Formula One at the conclusion of
this season, his Target/Chip Ganassi Racing team is looking for a
new driver for 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Kendall plans to tell Ganassi face-to-face this weekend that
he's the man _ or should be.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like everybody else in the free world, I'm chasing after
Zanardi's job,'' Kendall said. ``I just plan to tell him that I
don't think anybody else is better prepared to win races for him
than I am.''
</P>
<P>
   Kendall, who won 11 races in a row en route to last year's SCCA
Trans-Am title, has a key Ganassi employee pulling for him _ driver
Jimmy Vasser.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vasser is pushing hard for me,'' said Kendall, who became
friends with the 1996 CART champion through several seasons of
racing together on the International Race of Champions circuit. ``I
think he wants a teammate he knows and can get along with.''
</P>
<P>
   Kendall said he is also being considered for the opening that
will arise with the Arciero-Wells CART team when Max Papis moves to
Team Rahal next season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm on a list that is five or six guys long,'' Kendall said.
</P>
<P>
   And he said he is confident Arciero-Wells, which has often run
near the back of the field over the past few years while developing
a new engine for Toyota, is making great strides toward making its
equipment competitive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm also pretty impressed with the team they've been building
over there,'' Kendall said.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Kendall said he plans to continue to be part of
the ABC/ESPN commentating crew. Network officials are interested in
re-signing him for next year's broadcasts if he doesn't land a
driving job.
</P>
<P>
   ``I enjoy working in television,'' Kendall said. ``But that's
not my first choice at this point.''
</P>
<P>
   Kendall will have another duty this weekend. He is scheduled to
award the SCCA Trans-Am title to this year's champion, Paul
Gentilozzi.
</P>
<P>
   A rare slip: For only the second time this season, Jeff Gordon
will not start Sunday's UAW-GM Quality 500 in the front group.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon qualified 26th on Wednesday and will take the green flag
Sunday in his second worst starting position of the year (He
started 29th at the Daytona 500). It is the first time in 21 races
that he has failed to make the top 10 in qualifying.
</P>
<P>
   All of which presents Gordon's No.1 rival, Mark Martin, with a
great chance to knock a big chunk off Gordon's 199-point lead this
week. Martin will start second next to Derrike Cope, who won the
first pole of his 16-year Winston Cup career.
</P>
<P>
   CART schedule grows by one: Championship Auto Racing Teams Inc.
announced its 1999 schedule this week, a 20-race tour that will
include a new stop.
</P>
<P>
   Premiering next season will be the Chicago Grand Prix, an Aug.
22 stop at the Chicago Motor Speedway in Cicero, Ill.
</P>
<P>
   Local CART stops will be made in the spring and fall. The Long
Beach Grand Prix will be run April 15. And the season will end with
the Marlboro 500 at Fontana's California Speedway on Oct. 31.
</P>
<P>
   Twelve of the races will be broadcast by ABC.
</P>
<P>
   Winning formula:Mika Hakkinen's victory in last week's
Luxembourg Grand Prix put him back in the lead for the Formula One
season championship with one race remaining.
</P>
<P>
   But because rival Michael Schumacher finished second, Hakkinen
was unable to wrap up the title and must now wait a month for the
tour's final race, the Japanese Grand Prix on Nov. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Hakkinen has a four-point lead over Schumacher, who must win
November's race and hope someone besides Hakkinen takes second in
order to claim the season crown.
</P>
<P>
   Fast bikes: Motorcycle racing returns to Southern California on
Saturday with the running of the U.S. National Speedway
Championship at the Orange County Fairgrounds in Costa Mesa.
</P>
<P>
   Racers present will include 1997 world champion Greg Hancock,
Brad Oxley, Gary Hicks, Sam Ermolenko and others.
</P>
<P>
   The driver's seat: Steve Grissom, recently let go by the Kodiak
Winston Cup team, will drive the No.96 Caterpillar Chevrolet this
week.... Mark Green will part company with the Brewco Motorsports
Busch team after the season.
</P>
<P>
   Nuts and bolts: Ricky Rudd's victory at Martinsville, Va., last
weekend ran his streak of winning at least one race per season to
16 straight, a modern-era record. Richard Petty has the all-time
mark of 18 straight seasons.... Rusty Wallace's string of races
since his last victory has reached 56. Al Unser Jr.'s is at 52....
Adam Petty, 18-year-old son of Kyle, grandson of Richard and no
relation to Tom, got his first win on the ARCA Bondo/Mar-Hyde
Circuit in his very first start last week. &QL;

NEW D'AMATO AD ATTACKS SCHUMER'S MISSED VOTES 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ADAM NAGOURNEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Signaling a new line of attack in his re-election
effort, Sen. Alfonse D'Amato on Thursday unveiled a television
advertisement that assailed his Democratic opponent, Rep. Charles
Schumer, for repeatedly missing votes in Washington because he was
campaigning in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year alone, Chuck Schumer missed over 100 votes in
Congress,'' the announcer says as the screen displays a gray-hued
photograph of Schumer's face against a blue backdrop of New York
City. ``The worst attendance record of the 31 New York
congressmen.''
</P>
<P>
   The commercial, which is to begin running Friday evening begins
what D'Amato's advisers said would be a new tack. They said the new
spots will be broadcast statewide and would augment, rather than
replace, D'Amato's dominant attack on Schumer as a ``liberal
Brooklyn congressman'' hostile to upstate _ an assault that has
been criticized by some Democrats as divisive.
</P>
<P>
   In a sign of how fast-paced this campaign has become, Schumer's
advisers Thursday produced three advertisements rebutting D'Amato
even before the senator's advertisements went on the air. The
Schumer spots are to start running Friday morning, which means that
viewers could see Schumer's response first.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer used a different measure of his attendance in trying to
rebut D'Amato, pointing to his lifetime attendance record of 92
percent, as opposed to his attendance this year of 77 percent. ``Al
D'Amato is lying again,'' the advertisement says. ``The truth? This
year D'Amato has one of the worst attendance records in the Senate,
and when he does vote, he votes against Medicare, against
education, and against new cops.''
</P>
<P>
   But Schumer's advisers did not dispute D'Amato's assertion that
he has the lowest attendance of any of the members of the New York
delegation, and that is a point that D'Amato's advisers returned to
throughout the day. ``It's like saying that Lexington Avenue is
west of Third Avenue,'' said Kieran Mahoney, one of D'Amato's
senior advisers. ``It's a stone-cold fact.''
</P>
<P>
   As a matter of tactics, D'Amato's charge that Schumer was
putting his political ambitions ahead of his congressional duties _
``Chuck Schumer always puts politics over people,'' the announcer
says _ is an attack that is used frequently, and often with
success, against incumbents.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, D'Amato is also trying to tie Schumer down in
Washington and prevent him from campaigning in New York, at least
until Congress' scheduled adjournment in mid-October. The criticism
is also intended to undermine Schumer's record in Congress, which
he has made central to his appeal.
</P>
<P>
   And it sets the stage for D'Amato to return to one of his
traditional re-election themes: That he is devoted to his
constituents.
</P>
<P>
   It is unusual, but not unheard of, for a candidate to introduce
a drastically new message so early in a campaign. As a matter of
practice, a candidate's message is often changed when campaign
strategists, who poll almost nightly to track public response to
speeches and advertisements, determine that a certain approach is
failing.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, the new advertisements came after D'Amato's attack
on Schumer as a liberal had been questioned by political analysts
as ineffective, while his assault on him as a Brooklyn Democrat had
been criticized as divisive. But D'Amato's advisers said they were
not backing off the earlier strategy, which they said they believed
remained highly effective, particularly among voters upstate, where
they believe the race will be decided.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato's campaign manager, Jon Lerner, said Schumer had missed
more than 100 votes this year, including bills designed to insure
the stability of Social Security, to increase breast cancer
research and to hire teachers.
</P>
<P>
   Still, D'Amato cast a wide net in counting the number of missed
votes. He included, for example, three times when Schumer neglected
to show up for such housekeeping votes as approving the House
Journal, the summation of the previous day's activities. He
included votes in which bills had been approved unanimously. And he
included votes on amendments that had been introduced by House
Democrats and defeated by House Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   To dramatize his points, D'Amato's advisers arranged a news
conference in New York City (the senator was in Washington, as was
Schumer) with advocates for breast cancer research, the elderly and
veterans. They all read statements denouncing Schumer, using many
of the same phrases that were included in D'Amato's news release.
</P>
<P>
   Marguerite Adams, the president of a center for the elderly,
strongly assailed Schumer for missing what she described as two
critical votes on Social Security measures. But when questioned by
a reporter, she was unable to say whether the measures had passed
(one passed, the other did not), and Lerner hurriedly cut off the
questioning.
</P>
<P>
   Lerner defended the count as an accurate portrayal of Schumer's
record. ``The point here is if you only need to show up when your
vote would break a tie, then why do we elect these people at all?''
he said. ``The people of New York know that Al D'Amato has always
been there for them.''

APPRAISAL: RESTORATION LIBERATES GRAND VISTAS, AND IDEAS 
</HEADLINE>
   (sidebar with NY-GRANDCENTRAL)  
 (bl)  
 By HERBERT MUSCHAMP   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Lasers, acrobats, a symphony for orchestra and train
whistle, flamenco dancers, a mariachi band, a 1{-ton cast-iron bald
eagle, vintage trains and even politicians: These were among the
attractions Thursday and Friday in New York's celebration of the
rededication of Grand Central Terminal.
</P>
<P>
   Such a grand and gaudy civic vaudeville show is entirely in
keeping with the spirit of this, the palace of all train stations.
Designed by Warren &AMP; Wetmore with Reed &AMP; Stem, Grand Central is the
mecca of preservationists, commuters and city-lovers alike.
</P>
<P>
   And the restoration of the 1913 landmark, by the New York firm
of Beyer Blinder Belle, is a triumphant piece of work.
</P>
<P>
   With the possible exception of Central Park's renovation, which
was started almost 20 years ago under the direction of Elizabeth
Barlow Rogers of the Central Park Conservancy, this is the greatest
feat of historical preservation in the city's history. The
restoration of the main concourse's ceiling alone, the perfect sky
for city-dwellers who seldom get to see much of the real one,
easily deserves aerial somersaults by the Big Apple Circus trapeze
artists scheduled to soar Friday evening beneath its twinkling
stellar constellation.
</P>
<P>
   But this year also is the 20th anniversary of the U.S. Supreme
Court decision that affirmed the city's right to protect Grand
Central and, by extension, other landmark buildings, from
destruction. That is reason for the whole town to burst into
flamenco. The Metropolitan Transportation Authority, the terminal's
owner, should be serenaded by mariachi players for investing $200
million in a project that conforms so enthusiastically to the
spirit of the court's decision.
</P>
<P>
   This week's festivities focus on the completion of work on the
main concourse, the station's architectural heart. The restored
Waiting Room, now used for exhibitions, parties and other events,
opened two years ago, and the food court taking shape on the lower
concourse will not be completed until next year. Impressive as the
building's major public spaces are, however, Beyer Blinder Belle's
greatest accomplishment has been to reveal that Grand Central is
above all a monument to movement. The Mercury figure in the
sculpture group facing Park Avenue South is not an idle idol. The
entire building is governed by ideas of freedom of access and
circulation.
</P>
<P>
   Who doesn't love taking a taxi on the viaduct that wraps around
Grand Central before plunging through the arches in the Helmsley
Building? The ride offers an exhilarating liberation from the urban
grid. The restoration has clarified the degree to which that sense
of freedom permeates the building itself.
</P>
<P>
   The architects have contributed two main architectural features
to the main concourse. The new eastern staircase, which threatened
to diminish the room's amplitude, has the opposite effect of
magnifying it. By increasing access to the concourse balconies, it
adds an observation deck that renders the scene below an epic urban
spectacle.
</P>
<P>
   Even more impressive is the uncovering of the ramps, located
just behind the ticket windows, that lead down to the lower level
and its fabled Oyster Bar. Instead of acting as a barrier, the
ticket booths now serve as a screen, enlarging the space and the
vista of possibilities. Along with the escalators leading to the
lobby of the Metlife Building, the ramps enhance the terminal's
identity as a place of vertical as well as horizontal circulation,
a hub where trains, subways, elevators, taxis and pedestrians
briefly converge before setting off in different directions.
</P>
<P>
   Beyer Blinder Belle has labored to make the station a
destination, a place for shopping and dining, like Union Station in
Washington. Rents from these operations will help finance the
renovations. Fortunately, unlike Union Station's designers, Beyer
Blinder Belle has accomplished this without destroying the
building's architectural grandeur. (Most shops will be located
along corridors leading from the concourse to Lexington Avenue.)
</P>
<P>
   More important, the architects have retained the idea that the
station is primarily a place of transition. Like Ellis Island,
whose restoration in 1991 was also designed by Beyer Blinder Belle,
Grand Central is one of the most thrilling symbols of the city's
receptivity, its openness to people and to ideas. Metaphorically,
it stands not just for the movement of people, but also for the
freedom of thought that occurs during movement _ the ideas, the
shifts in perspective, that arise from the refusal to remain stuck
in a fixed place or time.
</P>
<P>
   Much as I like all those trapeze artists, light shows and bald
eagles, I chose a more perverse way to celebrate Grand Central's
rededication. I rented a video of John Frankenheimer's 1966
thriller, ``Seconds.'' For those too young to have seen it, the
plot goes like this: a beaten-down, middle-aged banker is about to
board the train home to Scarsdale when a stranger hands him a note
with an address scribbled on it. This encounter leads the banker
into the clutches of The Company, a sinister outfit that stages
fake deaths for life's disappointed, overhauls their bodies, gives
them new identities and a fresh start in life. After much plastic
surgery and months of physical training, the banker emerges as _
Rock Hudson!
</P>
<P>
   Rock moves to Malibu and becomes a swinger, but eventually it
transpires that his new world is something like the town in ``The
Truman Show'' _ artificial and controlled. His neighbors are also
``reborns,'' or security officers from The Company. And when Rock
tries to escape, he finds that there's no getting out alive.
</P>
<P>
   Now the building where the banker met his fate has had a face
lift of its own. The results are stunning, better than Rock's. But
this transformation, too, has a noirish aspect. It has to do with
what the building itself is about: that literal and metaphorical
freedom of circulation. This freedom is one of New York's most
important traditions, but in recent decades it has become severely
circumscribed. Nowhere is this more evident than in New York's
failure to encourage architecture that is either artistically
first-rate or socially progressive.
</P>
<P>
   The anniversary of the Supreme Court's decision is indeed cause
for celebration, with lasers, symphonies, the works. But only the
wildest wishful thinking could imagine that a single building of
landmark quality has been constructed in Manhattan in the
intervening decades. This may or may not be coincidence. But it is
certainly true that landmarks preservation _ architectural history
_ has been asked to do the work of architecture. The result has
not, as yet, turned the city into a stage set like ``The Truman
Show.'' But it reflects a city that has turned in on itself, and in
doing so has lost its receptivity to change.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not drawing this parallel with a horror movie because I want
to rain on Grand Central's parade. On the contrary, I would like
the building's underlying message to be as clear as its beautifully
restored architecture.

TOOTS BARGER, 85, QUEEN OF DUCKPINS' WOBBLY WORLD 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Md.)   (bl)  
 By ROBERT McG. THOMAS Jr.   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Toots Barger, a perennial world's champion in a decidedly
regional sport, died Sept. 28 at a retirement home in Frederick,
Md. She was 85 and had long been known as the Queen of Duckpins.
</P>
<P>
   Her family said the cause was cancer.
</P>
<P>
   If duckpins doesn't ring a bell, chances are you didn't grow up
in or around Baltimore, where the squat-pin version of the familiar
10-pin bowling game was invented and became something of a
municipal mania.
</P>
<P>
   During the years that Mrs. Barger was virtually invincible, from
the mid- 1940s to the mid-1960s, the sport was so popular in
Baltimore that the prestigious annual tournament sponsored by The
Baltimore Evening Sun was regularly broadcast on local television,
and Mrs. Barger, who won the tournament 12 times in 22 years,
became such an acclaimed figure that she was regarded as the city's
premiere athlete until Johnny Unitas came to town.
</P>
<P>
   If the former Mary Elizabeth Ryan's record of 13 world duckpin
championships and 9 world scoring records doesn't sound impressive,
it's a safe bet you haven't stood at the head of a regulation,
60-foot bowling lane and tried to knock down 10 undersized (9-inch
tall) pins placed at the usual 12 inches spacing with a 3-pound
ball just 5 inches in diameter.
</P>
<P>
   If you had, you would not be surprised that in her reign in
duckpins, which has the same 10-frame scoring system as regular
bowling and the same theoretic perfect score of 300, Mrs. Barger
dominated the sport's women's division for the better part of two
decades without ever once reaching 200.
</P>
<P>
   But then one of duckpins' chief appeals has been that scoring is
so difficult that while there have been myriad perfect games in
regular bowling, no one has ever rolled a perfect game in
tournament duckpins, whose highest recorded score is 279. (Mrs.
Barger's best game was 198.)
</P>
<P>
   No wonder. In contrast to the 8.5-inch bowling ball, the duckpin
ball is small enough to roll between any two pins with plenty of
room to spare. As a result, even though duckpins has been called a
game of spares in contrast to bowling as a game of strikes, a spare
(knocking down all 10 pins in two rolls) is so difficult that a
third ball is allowed when a spare has not been scored.
</P>
<P>
   Because the lightweight duckpin ball, which has no finger holes,
is small enough for a child to handle, duckpins has long been
cherished as a family sport in Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Mrs. Barger, a Baltimore native who was given her
nickname by an aunt, seems not to have played the sport as a child,
perhaps because she was born only 13 years after duckpins' storied
beginning.
</P>
<P>
   According to Baltimore legend, it was invented in 1900 in an
upstairs bowling alley at a tavern owned by two of Baltimore's
premier sports heroes, the baseball figures John J. McGraw and
Wilbert Robinson.
</P>
<P>
   The game got its name, so the story goes, because the squat,
cut-down pins reminded the duckshooting owners of ducks.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Barger, whose husband, Ernest, was a plumber who later
operated a bowling alley managed by his wife, was the mother of two
children when she joined a housewife's duckpin league in the late
1930s and discovered that she had a rare talent for a difficult
game.
</P>
<P>
   Primarily because she played with dead solid oak balls in the
days before the lively plastic pin era, Mrs. Barger's records have
long since been eclipsed, and the sport itself, which once
proliferated along the Atlantic coast from New Hampshire to North
Carolina and as far inland as Indiana, has been in serious decline,
even in Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Mrs. Barger continued playing until three years ago and
remained such a well-known figure that in 1992 she achieved renewed
prominence leading a campaign to have duckpins named the Maryland
state sport.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign failed, perhaps because legislators felt duckpins
was just too odd to be the state sport, especially when Maryland
already had an official sport: jousting.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Barger is survived by a son, Ernest Jr., of La Jolla.
Calif.; a daughter, Mary Jane Joyce of Derwood, Md., four
grandchildren and six great-grandchildren. &QL;

SOWARD SKIPS CLASSES, PAYS PRICE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ R. Jay Soward's sore thigh muscle might be a
concern for USC, but for the coaching staff, the star wide
receiver's penchant for missing class could be a bigger headache.
</P>
<P>
   Soward has accumulated at least four 6 a.m. running sessions,
the result of missing two classes last week. When he failed to show
up to run the next morning _ which is coach Paul Hackett's standard
penalty for a missed class _ the running sessions were doubled.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Soward did not participate in practice Thursday to
rest his strained quadriceps muscle, he was running at 6 a.m. at
Howard Jones Field, working off one of his missed classes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to do one this morning,'' Soward said.
</P>
<P>
   So far, USC is not worried that Soward could be headed toward a
repeat performance of last spring, when his faltering academic
performance led Hackett to suspend him from the season opener
against Purdue.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just part of maturity,'' wide receivers coach Mike Wilson
said. ``These are young men who are maturing. It's a matter of
trying to get them to understand their years are limited before
they are on their own.''
</P>
<P>
   Or, as Hackett and Wilson put it, ``R. Jay's R. Jay.''
</P>
<P>
   Hackett said he's prepared to give Soward the benefit of the
doubt, at least until the school's first midterms take place.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll find out in about two to three weeks,'' Hackett said.
</P>
<P>
   As for his minor injuries, Soward has been bothered by a
strained thigh muscle and sore ankle, but appears as though he will
be OK for the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``My ankle's fine,'' Soward said. ``It hurt more last week.''
</P>
<P>
   Hackett said if the Trojans had played Arizona State on
Thursday, Soward would have been able to play.
</P>
<P>
   Morton a question mark: Tailback Chad Morton missed his third
straight day of practice with a strained back, and his status will
not be determined until Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Morton was also listed as questionable with the same injury two
weeks ago before the Oregon State game, but played and gained 123
yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had breakfast with him (before the Oregon State game) and he
said, `I don't think I'll be able to go,''' Hackett said. ``He
knows his body. If at all possible, Chad Morton will be in there.
If not, the other guys will have to pick up the slack.''
</P>
<P>
   With Morton probably unavailable on punt and kick returns,
Hackett will have to consider putting Soward back on punt returns
with Larry Parker.
</P>
<P>
   Soward fumbled twice on one play during a punt return against
Oregon State and has not been used since.
</P>
<P>
   ``I worry about R. Jay fumbling all the time,'' Hackett said.
``I told him, `Don't compound it. Get the fumble back.'''
</P>
<P>
   Injury report: Tight end Antoine Harris did not miss any
practice this week, and Hackett said he is pleased with Harris'
recovery from a sprained ankle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe after the season, they may have to do some cleaning out,
like with Jason Thomas,'' Hackett said. ``It appears there's some
scar tissue.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Thomas, Harris has not had ankle surgery before.
</P>
<P>
   Center Eric Denmon, another ankle sprain victim, has also
returned and will be available to play.

ROCKIES HOT AFTER LEYLAND
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Less than three hours after resigning as manager of the Florida
Marlins, Jim Leyland was on the phone with Colorado Rockies owner
Jerry McMorris.
</P>
<P>
   It appears the Rockies could offer their vacant managerial
position early next week, but Dodgers general manager Kevin Malone
says he still wants to talk to Leyland, who leaves Florida less
than one year after leading the Marlins to a World Series title.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jim Leyland is a proven winner and one of the top managers in
baseball,'' said Malone, who is in Arizona attending instructional
league. ``That is the kind of candidate we are looking for.''
</P>
<P>
   Malone considers Montreal's Felipe Alou the favorite to replace
Glenn Hoffman as the Dodgers manager. But the Expos are not
expected to grant Alou permission to talk with other teams until
early next week after the club learns whether local voters are
willing to help pay for a new downtown stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Other candidates for the Dodgers job include veteran managers
Davey Johnson and Kevin Kennedy, who were out of baseball last
season..
</P>
<P>
   Fox, the Dodgers' new owners, were hoping to hire Florida's Dave
Dombrowski as the new general manager. The day of his interview in
early September, Dombrowski signed to five-year, $5 million
contract extension to remain with the Marlins. Malone was hired two
days later.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Malone reassigned Hoffman to a coaching position on
the major-league staff and gave his coaches jobs in the
organization.
</P>
<P>
   Leyland led the Marlins to a World Series title last season
after three consecutive National League East titles with Pittsburgh
in the early 1990s. But after a purge by Florida ownership of top
talent, including pitcher Kevin Brown and outfielders Gary
Sheffield and Moises Alou, Leyland recognized that the rebuilding
process would be slow.
</P>
<P>
   This past season, the Marlins finished 54-108, the worst record
in the National League since the San Diego Padres and the Expos
each went 52-110 in their 1969 expansion seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Because of a clause in his contract, Leyland walks away from the
final three years, a total of $4.5 million. He will receive a
$500,000 buyout.
</P>
<P>
   The Marlins are expected to be sold by Wayne Huizenga to John
Henry, a Florida-based commodities trader. Henry has vowed to
increase the payroll, which was slashed from $53 million to $13
million this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``From a business standpoint, it didn't quite work out,''
Leyland said. ``I had to determine if I was willing to go at the
pace that new ownership wanted. I decided I don't want to do
that.''
</P>
<P>
   McMorris, who fired manager Don Baylor on Monday, was seeking
permission to talk to Leyland even before Thursday's announcement.
When Leyland resigned, McMorris was one of the first people to
call.
</P>
<P>
   ``The conversation went real well and he is definitely
interested,'' McMorris said on a conference call. ``We will meet
next week.''
</P>
<P>
   Detroit, for which Leyland began his career as a minor-league
manager in 1971, also is interested. But Tigers GM Randy Smith said
he is hoping to keep his payroll around $30 million until the club
opens a new stadium in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockies have a $49 million payroll and McMorris has
indicated he will pursue ``impact'' free agents Kevin Brown of San
Diego and Mike Piazza of the New York Mets.

FOR LEWIS, FAILED RUN THING OF PAST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ For Lancaster native and UCLA tailback Jermaine
Lewis, the failed fourth-and-1 run last year at Washington State,
with two minutes left and the Bruins trailing 37-34, simply will
not go away.
</P>
<P>
   This week, with his tormentors in town for the rematch, he's
answered dozens of questions about the play, some from the most
unlikely sources.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went back to Lancaster (last weekend) and they were asking
me about it,'' he said. ``I went to the mall, and people were
asking me that I didn't even know.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people are looking for big things from me.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis flushed his psyche clean last year in the weeks following
the defeat. His performance this season (176 yards and six
touchdowns in two games) indicates no lingering effects from his
decision to cut upfield, into the heart of Wazu's defense, instead
of following his blockers into the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Lewis ran the very play two weeks ago at Houston and
scored untouched.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's proved what he can do,'' Bruins coach Bob Toledo said.
``It took him a couple games. He was down in the dumps.... But he's
passed (the point of redemption).''
</P>
<P>
   On the mend: Receiver Freddie Mitchell is expected to recover
from his broken femur in time for spring practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way it looked, everybody was very concerned, as well they
should be,'' UCLA head trainer Geoff Schaadt said. ``But it's a lot
less debilitating than an (anterior cruciate ligament) tear. I
expect Freddie to be 100 percent for the spring. Everybody talks
about him losing a step, but there's no reason he should.''
</P>
<P>
   Close calls: Fullback and outside linebacker remain hotly
contested positions.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Wiley has recovered from his injured back and will start at
outside linebacker, with impressive redshirt freshman Santi Hall
getting plenty of snaps. Hall started against Houston and
intercepted a pass.
</P>
<P>
   Sylmar's Durell Price will start over Craig Walendy at fullback,
since Price's performance has not warranted a change. In two games,
Price has five catches and a slew of impressive blocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``There both really good fullbacks,'' Toledo said. ``That's one
of the reasons we wanted to redshirt Durell in the first place.''
</P>
<P>
   UCLA abandoned that plan when Walendy was sidelined with an
allergic reaction to a spider bite.
</P>
<P>
   No decision: UCLA athletic director Peter Dalis spoke Thursday
to his Miami counterpart, Paul Dee, but they made no decision on
rescheduling the canceled game.
</P>
<P>
   Making his mark: Former L.A. Poly star Leaford Hackett has
played well in his first season at Washington State after two years
at Valley College. In four games, he has 17 receptions and two
touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's one of the best JC transfers we have,'' Cougars coach
Mike Price said. ``He's done a great job. He's super at running
after the catch. We're very pleased.''
</P>
<P>
   Injury update: Defensive end Pete Holland and guard Oscar
Cabrera, both recovering from sprained ankles, are expected to play
Saturday but will not start. Jayson Brown will start at end, Jim
Ghezzi at guard.
</P>
<P>
   Ready for action: Watch for true freshmen Ken Kocher (No.97) and
Robert Thomas (No.8) to receive significant playing time against
Washington State.
</P>
<P>
   Kocher, a nose guard who's crucial to the defensive line's
development, is nearing a complete recovery from a lingering
sprained ankle.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas, the gifted inside linebacker, has six tackles despite a
broken bone in his right hand. The cast is expected to be removed
next week.
</P>
<P>
   Arrive early: A crowd approaching 65,000 is expected for the
12:30 p.m. kickoff.
</P>
<P>
   As usual, UCLA is operating a free shuttle from the Parsons
Engineering Building (at Fiar Oaks and Walnut) to the stadium.
However, there is a $4 charge for parking in the Parsons lot.
Service begins four hours before kickoff; return service begins at
the start of the third quarter.

PARCELLS PICKS TESTAVERDE OVER FOLEY AS STARTER 
</HEADLINE>
   (also see FBN-RHODEN-COLUMN)  
 (bl)  
 By GERALD ESKENAZI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. _ While hoping to avoid a quarterback
controversy, New York Jets coach Bill Parcells named Vinny
Testaverde on Thursday as the starter over Glenn Foley for the
pivotal game against the Miami Dolphins on Sunday at Giants Stadium
in East Rutherford, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Foley did not get into the Jets' last game, two Sundays ago,
when he was bothered by torn rib cartilage. Testaverde started
against the Colts and threw four touchdown passes in a victory. For
eight days, getting a chance to heal during the bye week, Foley has
said he is ready to throw.
</P>
<P>
   ``I grew up competitive,'' Foley said today. ``Three brothers,
fighting and scratching for everything. You want to compete, and
when they say you can't, it tears at you.''
</P>
<P>
   Parcells said Foley doesn't look quite right. ``I'm still
concerned about his ability to execute everything,'' the coach
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a game of this nature, it's uncomfortable for the coaches
to have a degree of uncertainty,'' Parcells said. In any event, he
contended that he told Foley ``you're back in the lineup when
you're ready.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, Parcells, despite attempts to be objective, must have
flashbacks to Foley's history of injury. When Parcells took over
last year, he admitted that a priority was to make Foley bigger and
stronger to avoid the two season-ending injuries he has had over
the years.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells believes that Foley isn't as sharp in practice as he
was before the season's opener against the 49ers. And against the
Dolphins, the 1-2 Jets are facing a team that is 3-0 with an
outstanding defense. A Jet victory would put them in a much
enhanced position since they would be 2-0 within the division while
Miami would be 2-1.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells cautioned the news media against pouncing on
Testaverde's selection as affirmation that Foley's job as the
starting quarterback is no longer secured.
</P>
<P>
   Does Parcells want Foley back as the starter? ``Why wouldn't
I?'' the coach said.
</P>
<P>
   Foley, though, isn't so sure.
</P>
<P>
   ``You should be rewarded if you play well,'' Foley said. ``What
if Vinny goes out and throws six touchdown passes?'' Foley pointed
out he beat out Neil O'Donnell last year after having played
better.
</P>
<P>
   To Foley the situation remains just as unclear as it was when he
was injured.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody's job is secure,'' he said. ``You still have to prove
yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   Testaverde, meanwhile, continues to act the good soldier despite
his obvious belief that he has shown enough to be the starter based
on his preseason performance _ and certainly his commanding
presence against the Colts.
</P>
<P>
   Did being named the starter against the Dolphins surprise him?
</P>
<P>
   ``I really didn't know what to expect,'' he said. ``But what I
think is irrelevant. I'm starting the game.''
</P>
<P>
   He recalled that early in training camp, the quarterbacks'
coach, Dan Henning, told both players, ``You're not only competing
against each other, but all the other quarterbacks in the league,
because if they become free agents, they have an opportunity to
come here.'' Thus, any Jet quarterback is in a sense on borrowed
time if there is someone available who is better.
</P>
<P>
   Testaverde's task is formidable: He brings in an 0-2 record as a
starter against the Dolphins. But in his only recent appearance
against them, last season for Baltimore, he connected on 32 of 47
passes for 331 yards and a touchdown. However, the Dolphins were in
command early, and more than two-thirds of Testaverde's yardage
came in a comeback attempt in the second half. Still, it was a
losing effort. Testaverde has played in only one winning campaign
in 11 seasons.

<P>
   Parcells would not be drawn into a ``what-if'' scenario,
refusing to speculate on whether he would stay with Testaverde if
he leads the Jets to a victory over the Dolphins.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to open a crack,'' the coach said, barely
cracking a smile.
</P>
<P>
   EXTRA POINTS
</P>
<P>
   _ Wide receiver WAYNE CHREBET will probably see action against
the Dolphins in a limited capacity as he recuperates from a
sprained ankle. Linebacker JAMES FARRIOR will probably not be used
at all because of his knee injury. DWAYNE GORDON and BRYAN COX
alternate replacing him at the weakside spot. . . . Coach BILL
PARCELLS was so impressed with the Jets' practice on Wednesday that
he decided to cut down Thursday's drills. He doesn't want them
peaking 72 hours in advance of game day.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Dolphins' two turnovers have resulted in only 3 points
against them. On the other side of the ball, they have converted
eight turnovers into 31 points. You have to go back to pre-DAN
MARINO days, 1982, to find the Dolphins in a top-five ranking in
total defense. Right now, they are second in the league at 241.3
yards a game. &QL;

TRAGEDY GAVE TOLEDO PERSPECTIVE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Riordan High ball carrier dropped his head, a
mistake far graver than dropping the football. A split-second later
the first-year player took a devastating hit. Bob Toledo won't ever
forget the way Bill Blanchard's head snapped back before he slumped
to the turf, an athlete _ (begin ital)his(end ital) athlete _
turned paraplegic right before his eyes.
</P>
<P>
   It was Toledo's first year of coaching and he had his whole
future mapped out. He was going to be the best high school coach in
the Bay Area, then the next Bear Bryant and ultimately the Second
Coming of Vince Lombardi. But after seeing Blanchard's life so
tragically altered Toledo nearly forsook all that.
</P>
<P>
   All these years later it's a sobering thought for UCLA's
second-year head coach and Bruin faithful alike: The man who has
persevered to become the coach of the fourth-ranked team in the
country and one of the 100 most influential people in the Southland
(it said so in the September issue of Los Angeles magazine) almost
didn't see his second season, much less his 30th.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt responsible for what happened to Bill,'' Toledo said
the other day, his normally nimble delivery slowing to a stammer.
``It was very, very difficult. It really hurt. There was a lot of
guilt. I was going to get out of coaching. It was the only time in
my coaching career I seriously thought about getting out.''
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles magazine included Toledo on its list of influential
people because his Bruins have won 12 consecutive games to steal
the headlines from a USC program long accustomed to hogging the
autumn spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   Toledo is flattered to be lumped in with the likes of the
self-proclaimed ``king of the world,'' James Cameron. But you won't
find him going overboard about it. He learned long ago that try as
he might to direct things, there's a higher power that can _ and
will _ arbitrarily change the script.
</P>
<P>
   No one felt more powerless than Toledo two weeks ago when he saw
Freddie Mitchell, his big-play receiver, writhing on the sideline
after being tackled while returning a kickoff in the first quarter
of the Bruins' game at Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Toledo was distressed and not simply because Mitchell was a
three-headed monster for opponents, dangerously adept at receiving,
running and returns.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell had toiled diligently in the classroom last year so
he'd be eligible to suit up this season. Having watched him turn
one corner, it sickened Toledo all the more to see the redshirt
freshman's left femur snap like a pencil, his promising career once
again detoured.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see this young man, he's starting to blossom as a true
student-athlete, and then all of the sudden he's there on the
sideline, in intense pain,'' Toledo said. ``It throws you. It's
very difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   Toledo knew his players would take their emotional cues from
him. So as soon as Mitchell went down, he adopted a mask of
composure that he wore for the rest of the game and during the long
flight back to Los Angeles. He continues to wear it, letting his
raw emotions surface only after he's safely inside the Westlake
Village home he shares with his wife, Elaine.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't lost on Toledo that for all his supposed sway over
L.A., he was helpless to control what happened to Mitchell. Nor
could he do a thing about Hurricane Georges, which roared in from
Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic and wiped out the Bruins'
nonconference game at Miami this past Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA needed that game, not for the East Coast exposure it would
have afforded its Heisman Trophy-contending quarterback Cade McNown
or the $700,000 payoff. The Bruins needed that game to get the
players who were spooked by Mitchell's injury back in the saddle,
so to speak.
</P>
<P>
   Toledo knows from experience that players who never considered
an injury more serious than a bruised ego are apt to hear
misfortune's footsteps on every play after seeing what happened to
Mitchell. He saw it come to pass with his Riordan team after
Blanchard's injury and later to one of his University of the
Pacific squads after one of its best players suffered a jarring
injury.
</P>
<P>
   Those teams became tentative, fearful. On Saturday the Bruins
open their Pac-10 season against a rebuilding Washington State
squad. If Danny Farmer can fly across the middle without wondering
if he's risking life or limb, if DeShaun Foster can return punts
without worrying about his next hit, and if Jermaine Lewis can
return kickoffs without getting queasy, the Bruins should be fine.
</P>
<P>
   If not, Toledo will be there to pick up the pieces. He's not
going anywhere, having just recently signed a contract extension
that will keep him in Westwood through 2003.
</P>
<P>
   Time was when Toledo stood back and surveyed his future like a
quarterback with happy feet. There was constant pressure to climb
the coaching ladder. The realization hit him relatively late in
life that he needn't aspire any higher.
</P>
<P>
   An NFL head-coaching job could be his some day soon but at what
price? His friend, Rich Brooks, aged noticeably while coaching the
Rams.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was younger my aspirations were different,'' Toledo
said. ``I intended to be the next Bear Bryant and Vince Lombardi.''
</P>
<P>
   An older, wiser Toledo is content to be himself. Experience has
taught him true happiness lies not in power but in perspective. &QL;

GUEST OF HONOR FOR SCHOOL DINNER STIRS DISPUTE
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Tenn.)   (sw) 
 By DAN BARRY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In a couple of weeks, the Culinary Institute of
America will hold its largest fund-raising event of the year, a
$500-a-plate dinner that attracts New York City's premier chefs and
restaurateurs. But a sudden uproar over the affair's guest of honor
may have organizers choosing bicarbonate of soda as their evening's
aperitif.
</P>
<P>
   The intended honoree is Ronald Magruder, a trustee for the
institute and president of Cracker Barrel Old Country Store, the
restaurant chain based in Lebanon, Tenn. But several city
officials, including City Comptroller Alan Hevesi, say that Cracker
Barrel has a history of discriminating against gay people, and they
say the institute should not honor Magruder.
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of the dispute is a decision by Cracker Barrel in
early 1991 to dismiss all gay employees because their life style
was inconsistent with the ``perceived values of our customer
base.'' The company rescinded the order in the firestorm that
quickly followed, but not before more than a dozen employees were
fired.
</P>
<P>
   Magruder was not working for Cracker Barrel at the time of the
directive, but that did not temper the outrage of Hevesi and three
gay officials from Manhattan, Assemblywoman Deborah Glick and
Thomas Duane and Margarita Lopez of the City Council.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's outrageous about the culinary institute's program and
fund-raising is to honor the president of a company that is so
blatantly bigoted,'' Hevesi said. ``This isn't subtle bigotry; this
was their policy.''
</P>
<P>
   Hevesi is custodian of the city's five employee pension funds,
which own $6.8 million in Cracker Barrel stock, but the officials
said that divesting the city of it would be too complicated.
Besides, they said, they would rather hold onto the shares so that
city officials can attend shareholder meetings and raise the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Dumont-Bengston, a spokeswoman for the institute, which is
based in Hyde Park., N.Y., said on Thursday afternoon that it was
proceeding with plans to honor Magruder. ``We chose him for all the
good reasons for why you honor an individual: support, commitment,
service.''
</P>
<P>
   She also pointed out that Magruder and his wife, Elizabeth, have
established a scholarship at the school for disadvantaged students,
``which includes minorities.''
</P>
<P>
   Cracker Barrel officials issued a statement saying that the
company based its hiring policies ``solely on experience, aptitude
and abilities.'' The statement continued, ``We do not tolerate
discrimination of any kind toward any individual or group.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cracker Barrel chain has about 300 locations offering grits
and country fried steak in its restaurants and maple syrup and
pecan logs in the adjacent country stores.
</P>
<P>
   The current furor over Cracker Barrel began when the culinary
institute decided to honor Magruder and sent a solicitation letter
for the dinner to Ms. Glick. Instead of buying a $500 ticket, she
and Hevesi sent a letter on Sept. 9 to the institute's president,
Ferdinand Metz, urging him to reconsider the choice of Magruder.
When they received a letter that they said dodged the issue, they
decided to go public.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is an insult to lesbians and gays in New York to have this
occur here in our city and to have an institution like the culinary
institute do this,'' Ms. Glick said, adding, ``We urge people not
to attend this dinner, not to support the culinary institute in
their embracing of a discriminatory and bigoted employer.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for Mayor Rudolph Giuliani said that the mayor had
not been invited to the dinner. She declined to discuss
specifically the matters raised by Hevesi, but said that Giuliani
had been ``very consistent in his opposition to any kind of
discrimination.''
</P>
<P>
   The fury of the elected officials caught the culinary institute
by surprise. But in a statement on Thursday, it said, ``We
understand that this issue, raised by Mr. Hevesi as an investors'
representative, is one of corporate governance and should be
pursued through appropriate channels other than the Culinary
Institute of America.'' &QL;

BRAVES' LATE RUSH STUNS CUBS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL VEGA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ While the rest of the baseball world was captivated
this summer by the mesmerizing feats of the New York Yankees and
the Bunyanesque home run race between Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa,
the Atlanta Braves quietly dominated their little corner of the
national pastime.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night in prime time, the Braves showed a nationwide
television audience what they're made of _ pitching, timely
hitting, and plenty of resiliency.
</P>
<P>
   Given up for dead, they rallied to beat the Chicago Cubs, 2-1,
on Chipper Jones's one-out single in the 10th inning at Turner
Field and grabbed a 2-0 lead in their best-of-five National League
Division Series.
</P>
<P>
   Just when it appeared the Braves had met their match in Kevin
Tapani, catcher Javy Lopez belted a homer with one out in the
ninth, tying the game, 1-1, and giving the Braves new life.
</P>
<P>
   Jones capitalized on it with his single to left off reliever
Terry Mulholland, who took the mound after watching his team
squander a golden chance in the top of the 10th.
</P>
<P>
   Now Atlanta is one win away from making its seventh NL
Championship Series appearance of this decade.
</P>
<P>
   Jones's hit made a winner of rookie reliever Odalis Perez, the
fifth and last Braves pitcher. With one out and runners at first
and third, Perez struck out ex-Brave Jeff Blauser. With Mickey
Morandini trying to steal second on the pitch, Lopez gunned him
down.
</P>
<P>
   With one out in the bottom of the 10th, Walt Weiss drew a walk.
Pinch hitter Tony Graffanino laid down a sacrifice bunt and reached
on an error by Mulholland, who fielded first baseman Mark Grace's
toss but missed the bag by a foot. Jones then drove Weiss home,
bringing an end a classic fall pitching duel dominated by Tapani
and Billerica, Mass., native Tom Glavine, who allowed just three
hits and a run while striking out eight in seven innings but seemed
destined to lose until Lopez took him off the hook.
</P>
<P>
   Having thrown 99 pitches through eight innings, Tapani took a
four-hitter to the mound for the finishing touch. He never got to
apply it, watching in horror as Lopez launched a 1-0 pitch into the
left-field stands.
</P>
<P>
   Then Jones left the Cubs demoralized.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; tomorrow &LR;  ``This is a momentum-builder for us,'' said Jones.
``We certainly didn't want to split here and go to that crazy place
in Chicago needing to win two more games.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones ensured that would not be the case when he belted
Mulholland's first pitch _ ``a cutter inside,'' he said _ down the
line in left.
</P>
<P>
   ``Terry Mulholland is a guy whose bread and butter is to saw you
off inside,'' said Jones, who struck out in his first three at-bats
against Tapani before collecting singles in the eighth and 10th.
``In that situation, I'm a prime candidate for a double play.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to avoid that fate, Jones stepped to the plate waiting on
a breaking pitch inside.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was looking for it on the first pitch,'' said Jones. ``I
didn't know how it stayed fair, but with the way things had gone
for me tonight, I thought it was poetic justice.''
</P>
<P>
   As the ball began to fall, well out of the reach of Cubs left
fielder Glenallen Hill, Jones mimicked the home run histrionics of
Red Sox postseason heroes past as he tried use a little body lean
to coax it to stay fair. ``I was doing a little bit of Carlton Fisk
and a little bit of Dave Henderson going down there to first,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   None of it would have been possible had it not been for Lopez.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were stymied by Tapani,'' said Braves manager Bobby Cox.
``We hit three balls hard in the first inning and didn't hit
another after that. Obviously, that homer by Javy was huge. We
thought we could win at that point, but we had one out and were
facing sudden death.''
</P>
<P>
   Glavine was no slouch, either, carrying a no-hitter through five
innings in which he allowed just one ball to leave the infield.
</P>
<P>
   Glavine finally faltered in the sixth when he gave up a leadoff
single to Morandini and a bloop single to right by Scott Servais.
Tapani advanced the runners with a sacrifice before Lance Johnson
scored Morandini with a grounder to second.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was really good; he was awesome _ really awesome,'' Cox
said of Glavine. ``But so was Tapani. One guy leaves with no runs
and the other guy leaves with one run. You can't pitch any better
than that.''

WHICH USC QB WILL STEP UP?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Two QBs, or not two QBs.... that is the question
for USC.
</P>
<P>
   A month into the season, and the Trojans remain undecided at the
quarterback position, splitting time between sophomore Mike Van
Raaphorst and freshman Carson Palmer.
</P>
<P>
   It's a situation that no one endorses, but seems likely to
remain in place for at least a few more games. Coach Paul Hackett
said he will make a decision at some point because the two-headed
quarterback system won't exist too long after midseason.
</P>
<P>
   ``At some point, it's going to have to declare itself
dramatically,'' Hackett said. ``But I don't feel as though we have
to do that (yet).''
</P>
<P>
   Although Van Raaphorst is the starter, neither quarterback has
exactly seized the job. Last week, the two went a combined 3 for 19
for 23 yards against Florida State.
</P>
<P>
   A two-quarterback system is not the preferred system for
success, but it has been utilized enough recently that it is not
necessarily discounted.
</P>
<P>
   USC went 9-2-1 in 1995 and won the Rose Bowl with Brad Otton and
Kyle Wachholtz sharing the position. It might have worked, but the
quarterbacks were never fully behind the plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I was pretty stressed out,'' Otton said. ``I think I
lost some things: Having fun, joking around, having fun in the
huddle. There's not as much pressure as far as completing every
pass when you play one guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Ohio State won the 1997 Rose Bowl with quarterbacks Joe Germaine
and Stanley Jackson splitting time. While Hackett is aware of Ohio
State's success, he says, ``I don't believe in that.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the Trojans (3-1) continue each week with fans
wondering whether Van Raaphorst will finally squeeze Palmer out, or
if the freshman is one impressive performance away from grabbing
the job.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, each quarterback quietly grinds his teeth and
keeps playing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so much easier being the starting quarterback,'' Palmer
said. ``It's hard to come in the third quarter and throw completion
after completion. It's weird sitting a whole half.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Palmer, who as a freshman might normally be pleased with
the slightest bit of playing time, doesn't think the
two-quarterback system will continue indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think so. I kind of hope not,'' he said. ``I don't
want to keep coming in the third quarter. There's no quarterback
that wants to split a game with someone. I think people are
expecting something to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Van Raaphorst claims to have ignored public sentiment that
favors Palmer, who made quite a splash in the season opener against
Purdue.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't matter. I really don't care what everyone else is
thinking,'' Van Raaphorst said. ``There's going to be times when
you don't have good games.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the physical performances, there's the mental side. The
battle for playing time could be disastrous in some instances, but
not with Palmer and Van Raaphorst.
</P>
<P>
   Both players have similar soft-spoken demeanors and have masked
their frustrations and feelings _ so far. Neither has sought out
Hackett.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think they let me see it,'' Hackett said. ``I think
they quietly do it. I think both guys keep that away from the
coaches.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, Van Raaphorst was diplomatic when asked what
suggestions he might give Hackett on how to improve the sputtering
passing game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if I want to touch that,'' Van Raaphorst said.
``I don't know if I'd have an opportunity to get his ear.''
</P>
<P>
   Their teammates don't even notice a significant difference
between the two.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess Carson would be quieter in the huddle. He's still
learning,'' wide receiver Mike Bastianelli said. ``He brings an air
of confidence with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mike's a little more outspoken, saying plays a little more
calmly. They're both kind of quiet people.''
</P>
<P>
   Hackett did slightly alter his stance on the quarterbacks this
week, splitting practice snaps evenly between Van Raaphorst and
Palmer. Van Raaphorst had enjoyed a 60-40 advantage in snaps, but
after he became ill before the Florida State game, Hackett decided
both quarterbacks needed an equal amount of work.
</P>
<P>
   Now, he's just waiting for one to distinguish himself, and
wouldn't mind if it happened against Arizona State on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best performer gets the most time,'' Hackett said. ``I'm
not prepared to (decide) right now. It's exciting. The competitive
part brings the best out of both of them.''

WORLDLY MANNER'S FATE A MYSTERY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARCADIA _ The morning after he was sold for $5 million, leading
2-year-old Worldly Manner took to the Santa Anita track for a
conditioning gallop, carrying exercise rider Larry Demore and a
shroud of mystery.
</P>
<P>
   Who owns him now?
</P>
<P>
   Why is the new owner taking him away from two-time Kentucky
Derby-winning trainer Bob Baffert?
</P>
<P>
   Where is he going after he flies from Los Angeles to Louisville,
Ky., on Sunday?
</P>
<P>
   What is his next race?
</P>
<P>
   Will he aim for the Nov. 7 Breeders' Cup Juvenile and the May 1
Derby or something overseas?
</P>
<P>
   Why all the hush-hush in the first place?
</P>
<P>
   As hard as it is to keep a secret at a racetrack, all those
questions remained unanswered Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I imagine it will leak out in the next 30 days,'' Dr. Greg
Fox, a veterinarian assigned to watch over Worldly Manner here,
said of the mystery owner's identity. ``But it ain't going to come
from me.''
</P>
<P>
   The prevailing rumor has Worldly Manner going to Kentucky
trainer Kiaran McLaughlin, whose clients include Dubai's Sheikh
Mohammed bin Rashid al Maktoum, the world's richest racehorse
owner.
</P>
<P>
   But Fox refused to say what he knew despite prodding from
reporters and even from Baffert, who trained Worldly Manner to
three victories in four races, including the Del Mar Futurity by
five lengths last month, for breeders and former owners John and
Betty Mabee of San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, not even the Mabees know the source of the $5
million, because the money came through a Kentucky bloodstock
agent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never been involved in such a covert operation,'' Baffert
joked.
</P>
<P>
   The colt, a son of Riverman, will be at Baffert's barn until he
ships on Sunday. Baffert said Worldly Manner is overdue for a
flat-out workout but the trainer is forbidden to give him one
because of the risk of injury.
</P>
<P>
   The Kentucky-based Fox, 36, has more or less taken up residence
in Baffert's barn as well, protecting the new owner's investment,
which is thought to have set a record for a private sale of a horse
at this early stage of his career.
</P>
<P>
   As Worldly Manner steamed past the grandstand at about 9:30
Thursday morning, Fox shielded his eyes from a hazy glare and
watched nervously.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love this horse,'' said Fox, who affirmed the horse's
soundness following an examination Tuesday. ``I saw him run at Del
Mar, and he's just a very, very special horse.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure, based on his pedigree and his looks, if you'd
expect what he's done. (And) generally speaking, 2-year-olds who
are this good now don't blossom at 3. But I think this will be the
exception.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could be wrong. I could be pumping gas this time next
year.''
</P>
<P>
   Or sooner, if anything happens to Worldly Manner or if Fox can't
keep the big secret.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, at Baffert's barn, the one with the plaque
commemorating the Derby victories by Silver Charm (1997) and Real
Quiet ('98), exercise rider Demore said this is the best 2-year-old
he's ever been on at this time of the season.
</P>
<P>
   And Baffert said he's disappointed but wishes the colt luck and
will follow orders for the next few days.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't bill anybody (for the week's training),'' Baffert
said, ``because I don't know who to bill.''
</P>
<P>
   Weekend highlight: Entries will be drawn today for Sunday's
$300,000 Oak Tree Turf Championship, the first Breeders' Cup prep
race of the fall at Santa Anita. The 1\-mile race is expected to
draw Bonapartiste, River Bay and Military _ 1-2-3 in the Del Mar
Handicap _ and Amerique and Legend of Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Baffert's plans: Silver Charm is due back from Kentucky on
Saturday and probably will face old rival Free House in the
Goodwood Handicap at Santa Anita on Oct. 17.
</P>
<P>
   But Real Quiet is out of training for at least another 90 days
and won't race until at least April, though Baffert said he isn't
injured.
</P>
<P>
   One to watch: A victory by Crowning Storm in the first race
Thursday was memorable not only because it gave trainer Ron
McAnally his 201st win in 30 Oak Tree meets, tying Charlie
Whittingham's record.
</P>
<P>
   Sidney Craig's Crowning Storm, a 2-year-old son of Storm Cat
making his second start, hit traffic leaving the gate and on the
clubhouse turn but swept to the lead at the top of the stretch and
won the mile race by 10 lengths.
</P>
<P>
   `Serious concerns': Hollywood Park said it will offer one
multi-million-dollar pick-six guarantee at its upcoming meet, on
Sunday, Nov. 29. The track management that introduced the
guarantees in June worries that other tracks are overusing the
gimmick.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have some serious concerns about the future of the
guaranteed pick-six,'' Hollywood Park chairman R.D. Hubbard said.
``For it to succeed, it must be done on a limited basis and the
racing must be extremely competitive.... Small returns aren't going
to excite anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood Park guaranteed pools of $1 million and $1.5 million
at its summer meet, the latter drawing a record $3.8 million in
wagers. Oak Tree plans a $2 million guarantee Oct. 10.
</P>
<P>
   It's the suspense: Trevor Denman had always announced at the
beginning of Santa Anita's nightly replays show if there was a
pick-six carryover, because the track figured it would catch more
potential customers that way. But now Denman has been asked to wait
until after the pick-six races are shown.
</P>
<P>
   The reason: Fans who play the pick-six but don't stay for the
races told track management they like to cheer during the replays,
which they can't do if they already know that nobody had a perfect
ticket. &QL;

FRESHMAN HURST MAKES FIRST START AGAINST ARIZONA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JIM MOORE  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ You have a better chance of seeing the potential than
the blur that is Willie Hurst.
</P>
<P>
   The glimpses in the first two games have been like previews at
the theater _ quick-hitters that make you want to see the
full-length feature. Saturday night, in what is anticipated by one
of his coaches to be a blockbuster debut, the 18-year-old Hurst
will start at running back for Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's going to do something special,'' said Husky recruiting
coordinator Dick Baird.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Arizona's terrific defense, here's what else Hurst
confronts at Husky Stadium _ history that says he is more apt to
find himself buried in the backfield than celebrating in the end
zone.
</P>
<P>
   Washington is 0-3 when a true freshman running back starts in
his first game since 1975.
</P>
<P>
   When Greg Lewis played against UCLA in 1987, he fumbled on his
second carry and did not return to the game after that. In 1976,
Joe Steele was slightly better, rushing eight times for 41 yards
before getting his bell run against Stanford. In Don James' first
year in '75, Greg Martin ran 16 times for 27 yards but did throw a
halfback pass for a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   Hurst is supposed to be spectacular. As Maurice Shaw's backup,
he has rushed 25 times for 60 yards, a 2.4 average in his first two
games. With Shaw nagged by a back injury, Hurst takes over as an
emerging legend. After Thursday's practice, he appeared excited and
confident.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the line holds the water, I'll tote the mail,'' Hurst said.
</P>
<P>
   This is an engaging youngster. Husky coaches talk more about his
personality than his ability.
</P>
<P>
   Baird likes Hurst's unselfish attitude. As a point guard for one
of the best high school basketball teams in the country, Hurst
preferred assists over points.
</P>
<P>
   Described by most as an inside runner on the football field,
Hurst was better known as a perimeter threat in high school. When
he goes north-south, it's usually Seattle to Compton, Calif., his
hometown. More often, Hurst is like the sun, traveling east-west,
providing rays of hope for Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's going to be a star,'' Baird said.
</P>
<P>
   At Dominguez High on Thursday, his coach recalled one of Hurst's
unforgettable runs. It sounded as if the opponent, Antelope Valley,
was a helpless dog trying to locate a flea.
</P>
<P>
   ``They shut the sweep down to the right, so he cut back down the
line of scrimmage and _ I'm not lyin' _ six guys missed him. Then
he planted on the left side and went back to the right and
scored,'' said Keith Donerson.
</P>
<P>
   There was another time when Hurst displayed his toughness. He
had sprained his ankle in the previous game and was not going to
suit up for battle against Downey.
</P>
<P>
   ``But he sneaked in and got dressed,'' Donerson said.
</P>
<P>
   With Dominguez trailing 10-0, Donerson needed a spark.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coach said: `Are you ready?' '' Hurst said. ``And I said
yes.''
</P>
<P>
   On the first play, Hurst raced 86 yards for a touchdown and
Dominguez rallied to win 26-10.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had a bad limp and everything, and they still couldn't
catch him,'' Donerson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to make people miss,'' Hurst said.
</P>
<P>
   The Wildcats like to make people pay. This will be a different
setting. Hurst acknowledged that the gang-tackling in college is
much more prevalent than what he faced in high school
</P>
<P>
   ``You get a lot of hits on the way down,'' he said. ``The whole
defense is coming after you.''
</P>
<P>
   That's what it takes to stop Hurst, who is a well-built
200-pounder. If he is 5-foot-10 as listed, it's in cleats. His
coach compares his running style and stature to Barry Sanders.
Coach Jim Lambright said Hurst resembles the Huskies' last
tailback, Rashaan Shehee, because of his ``short-distance
quickness.'' They happen to share the same number (1) too.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not a power runner, and he's not extremely herky-jerky
like Napoleon (Kaufman),'' Lambright said. ``He's somewhere
inbetween.''
</P>
<P>
   Baird believes Hurst is a ``linebacker's nightmare'' because of
his ability to cut against the grain after hitting the hole.
</P>
<P>
   With Hurst, you also hear elusive and slippery. Offensive
coordinator Scott Linehan said Hurst avoids taking the big hit. And
yet Baird said Hurst won't hesitate to put his shoulder down to
gain the tough yards.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona was a semifinalist in the recruiting sweepstakes, but
Hurst spurned the Wildcats in favor of Washington because of its
better and more consistent record over a 10-year period. He grew up
watching Lewis and Kaufman and Beno Bryant.
</P>
<P>
   ``I loved Washington football because they ran a lot,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The focus this season has been on quarterback Brock Huard and
the passing game. Saturday night, Huard will be checking off and
handing off to Hurst.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to give it to the guy,'' Linehan said. ``We want
him to gain some identity. He's going to carry the ball and
introduce himself to the fans.''
</P>
<P>
   This is who they will meet: a player who wants to be Pac-10
freshman of the year and someday help the Huskies win a national
championship.

BASKETBALL PAYS ULTIMATE TRIBUTE TO A RARE BIRD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Larry Bird's immortality will be guaranteed Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The former Celtic legend _ hence Bird's other name, ``Larry
Legend'' _ will be inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   Thirteen All-Star seasons, his career average 24.3 points, 10
rebounds and 6.3 assists, his three MVP awards, three Celtic
championships and the retirement of his fabled No. 33 were just
preludes to this important day.
</P>
<P>
   Even the humble Bird finds enshrinement a fitting tribute to his
Marine-like workmanship, his drive and uncanny knack at being the
ultimate winner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always thought I played the game at a level that I was
pleased with,'' Bird said on the eve of his big day. ``I always
tried to play as hard as I possibly could and I always prepared
myself to play.''
</P>
<P>
   Everyone knew it, then and now. Bird made an impact. He also
created a revolution _ one that no longer fits his exceptional
image.
</P>
<P>
   In 1984, the NBA and its players set out to decide on a salary
system that would help owners control themselves. So a cap on team
payrolls was instituted. It was just what the doctor ordered to
lend financial stability to each franchise and the league.
</P>
<P>
   Just one issue, though: How in this salary cap system do you
reward the stars of the league? How do you pay the exceptional
players who in the 1980s revived the NBA from a drug-ridden,
low-TV-ratings, financially unstable league into a bona fide
financial juggernaut?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the idea came from this side,'' NBA spokesman Chris
Brienza said Thursday, as the NBA and the players union continued
their stalemate, all but ensuring that the 1998 NBA season will be
the first ever to not start on time, or worse.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure if it was (the commissioner) David (Stern). But
the idea came from this side to make sure there was a system to
take care of guys who were the cornerstones of teams. And Bird was
about due for a new contract, so he was the real marquee guy this
clause was designed for,'' Brienza said.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever good was supposed to come from a clause designed to
reward exceptional players like Bird has turned into something
quite devastating.
</P>
<P>
   The so-called ``Larry Bird exception'' has been used by the
Bulls to pay Michael Jordan $35 million for his sixth NBA
championship season. That you can understand, because if any player
besides Bird deserves exceptional status, it's Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   No one else, however, can come close to Bird or Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   No offense to the franchise players who sell tickets and play a
great game (Gary Payton, Shaquille O'Neal and Grant Hill). But
there should be a distinction between players who deserve a ``Larry
Bird exception'' and those who are merely All-Star-caliber
contributors.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks used the ``Larry Bird exception'' to make Patrick
Ewing rich as a king, though he has never won an NBA championship.
The Charlotte Hornets made perennial underachiever Larry Johnson an
$84 million man.
</P>
<P>
   And, as the glaring symbol of a system gone awry, the
Timberwolves heaped a $126 million contract on a talented but
scrawny forward named Kevin Garnett _ all before winning his first
NBA playoff game.
</P>
<P>
   Now the NBA owners are crying for change, including a rethinking
of the ``Larry Bird exception,'' which allows teams to pay their
own free agents millions over the salary cap.
</P>
<P>
   The players union is holding its ground. The upper echelon
All-Star players will not accept any collective bargaining
agreement that does not preserve their inalienable right to make
more money than God.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps now, with the 1998 season in jeopardy, it's time to
rename this so-called ``Larry Bird exception.'' It no longer fits
the bill, certainly not under these contentious market conditions.
Associating the name Larry Bird with this negotiating point and
many less-than-deserving multimillionaires is just not right.
</P>
<P>
   The legend of Bird is just where he wants it _ on the basketball
court _ except for anecdotes about his poor-boy Indiana childhood,
his dropping out of Bobby Knight's program because the country Bird
was ill at ease on the Indiana campus, his early draft by the
Celtics, his fabled matchups with Magic Johnson first for the NCAA
title and later for NBA championships.
</P>
<P>
   But best of all are the stories that let you understand the
quiet, crafty, self-possessed and principled nature of Bird.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1992 Olympics, some NBA writers chronicled how Bird
was out on the town with his other millionaire Dream Teamers. He
ordered a bottle of his favorite beverage. But when the bartender
asked $7 for the beer, Bird told the man to keep the brew and
walked out of the bar.
</P>
<P>
   The message isn't just that Bird is a little cheap. To him, a $7
beer insulted his sense of justice. It was no different when, that
same year, Bird chose to retire because his chronically sore back
hurt too much for him to play at his own demanding level.
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics were said to have offered Bird $8 million if he
played 75 percent of the 1992-93 schedule. But he walked away.
</P>
<P>
   This is why Bird is exceptional.
</P>
<P>
   As for the rest who believe they are ``Larry Bird exceptions''?
</P>
<P>
   Sorry to say, not many deserve the title.

COUGARS TO FACE HOT BRUINS QB MCNOWN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ANGELO BRUSCAS  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; ufbystaff &LR; ANGELO BRUSCAS
</P>
<P>
   Some people prefer fine wine, but Mike Price is a connoisseur of
quarterbacks. He savors their statistics, their tight spirals,
their footwork and the finer points that the average head coach
might overlook.
</P>
<P>
   Normally, it's his own Washington State quarterbacks _ such as
Ryan Leaf last year and Drew Bledsoe in 1992 _ that make the Cougar
coach drunk with enthusiasm each time he goes to the film cellar.
</P>
<P>
   But not this week.
</P>
<P>
   When Price looks at film of Saturday's formidable opponent, the
UCLA Bruins, he gets absolutely giddy at how quarterback Cade
McNown has matured in four years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cade McNown is definitely better than any of the quarterbacks
we have faced in our first four games,'' Price said. ``He does it
all. Cade is a great field general, he can pick up blitzes and
knows who to get the ball to.''
</P>
<P>
   Price sees everything right in McNown that his own quarterbacks,
Steve Birnbaum and Paul Mencke, do wrong. The only bad taste comes
from the fact that the Cougars face a stronger, smarter, more savvy
McNown than they have ever seen before.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sure recall the first time he came into Martin Stadium, we
beat the heck out of that poor guy,'' Price said of his first
impression of McNown in 1995, when the Cougars beat the Bruins
24-15. ``It would take one hell of a blow to knock him out of the
game now. He is put together.''
</P>
<P>
   With McNown back for his senior year having started 33 straight
games, the Cougars face a legitimate Heisman Trophy candidate at
the peak of his skills, and McNown has had two weeks to rest up for
his final test against WSU. In three previous games against McNown,
WSU won two despite McNown's combined 44-for-85 passing performance
that produced four touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   In past years, the left-handed McNown was just one of the keys
to the Bruin offense, with running back Skip Hicks getting the
early Heisman attention last season. This year, with UCLA 2-0 and
ranked No. 4 nationally, it's all McNown.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a great team leader and the whole key to their offense,''
Price said. ``Not taking away anything from their offensive line or
any of the other players, but he makes that thing click. He's a
great person and a great kid.''
</P>
<P>
   In two games this season, McNown has completed 37 of 62 passes
(59.7 percent) for 654 yards, four touchdowns and two interceptions
in leading the Bruins to wins over Texas and Houston. His
efficiency rating of 163.1 is nearly as good as his 168.6 that led
the nation in 1997, and he is averaging 17.68 yards per completion.
He leads the Pac-10 in total offense, averaging 326.5 yards per
game.
</P>
<P>
   It's enough to make Price dream of what could have been had Leaf
decided to return for his senior season this year rather than split
for the NFL's San Diego Chargers. Price used to describe Leaf as a
player who had a coach's grasp of the game.
</P>
<P>
   Bruin coach Bob Toledo describes McNown with the same
terminology.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has matured really well,'' Toledo said. ``He has a great
grasp for the offense and he understands what defenses are doing to
him. We're scoring a lot of points and making a lot of big plays,
and that's partly due to him having the experience. ... When he's
out there it gives you a great feeling because it's like having a
coach on the field.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Toledo's favorite McNown play this season wasn't even a
pass. Facing Houston, McNown came to the line with a pass play
called, but saw that the defense had only four players lined up to
the right side of the field. He called an audible for a weakside
run, and ``we walked into the end zone,'' Toledo said.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-1, 214-pound senior from West Linn, Ore., always had
the raw skills to be a quality college quarterback. A decathlete in
high school, he was known as a scrambler with a strong arm, but now
he's seeking out receivers on the run rather than running for his
life.
</P>
<P>
   ``He makes things happen. He moves around. He makes people miss.
He gives them a second chance every time he drops back to throw,''
Price said. ``You have to cover receivers for four seconds or more
because he's going to give them that extra couple of seconds by
avoiding the rush and then looking downfield. That's the hardest
thing about defending that team.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Price, the quarterback coach as well as the head coach for
both Leaf and Bledsoe, Toledo started out as the offensive
coordinator and quarterback coach for McNown before he assumed
UCLA's head-coaching duties in 1996. McNown credits the coaching
consistency for much of his development at UCLA as well as keeping
him from getting too satisfied with his personal accomplishments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those guys are always in my ear about staying level and not
letting your highs be too high or your lows too low, and moving on
and not worrying about the last play,'' McNown said. ``These things
have been grinded into my head ever since I got to UCLA.''
</P>
<P>
   One of those last plays that he's had to get over is the final
UCLA offensive play against WSU last season. With fourth-and-goal
at the Cougar 1-yard line, WSU stopped freshman Jermaine Lewis and
escaped with a 37-34 win in Pullman. Ultimately, the win put WSU in
the Rose Bowl, while UCLA finished second in the Pac-10 race.
</P>
<P>
   But McNown doesn't spend too much time dwelling on what could
have been had he called another play or had Lewis been able to
score.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to try to make up for what we couldn't accomplish last
year, but that's not going to have a tremendous effect on the
game,'' McNown said of the rematch. ``How well we prepare this week
and how we execute on Saturday is really going to dictate the
outcome of the game.''
</P>
<P>
   It's the kind of answer Toledo would want from his prodigy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gives you real satisfaction as a coach to know that you
have a guy out there who really understands what's going on,''
Toledo said.
</P>
<P>
   Price can only taste what it would be like from the other side
of the field with McNown uncorked.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is hooked up, big, strong, physical, fast, smart. He's
everything you want,'' Price said.
</P>
<P>
   And he wishes that McNown would have followed in Leaf's
footsteps by leaving early for the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he should have come out last year,'' Price said.
``It's not too late, Cade.''

5 INDICTED IN DEATH AT ARIZONA BOYS RANCH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PAT FLANNERY  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Arizona Boys Ranch nurse who treated 16-year-old Nicholaus
Contreraz before he died has been indicted on child abuse and
manslaughter charges along with four other former employees.
</P>
<P>
   A Pinal County grand jury indicted registered nurse Linda Babb
and ``work specialists'' Troy M. Jones, Michael M. Moreno,
Montgomery C. Hoover and Geoffrey Sean Lewis. All are from Tucson
except Hoover, who is from Sierra Vista. None could be reached for
comment.
</P>
<P>
   All five face one count each of manslaughter and child abuse,
felony charges that could bring a maximum penalty of 12{ years per
count. The Wednesday indictments were released Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Boys Ranch spokeswoman Casandra McCray declined comment but said
the ranch's board of directors met late Thursday to discuss the
matter and might have a statement later.
</P>
<P>
   Connie Woodward, Contreraz's grandmother, praised the
indictments in a telephone interview from her Sacramento home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe Nickie will rest a little bit now,'' Woodward said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very relieved to know that it just wasn't pushed under
the rug like everything else.''
</P>
<P>
   The work specialists who were indicted had direct contact with
Contreraz in his final hours, said Charles Ratliff, a spokesman for
the Pinal County Attorney's Office.
</P>
<P>
   Babb worked at the Boys Ranch's Oracle campus when Contreraz
collapsed and died of a severe lung-related illness.
</P>
<P>
   Babb examined Contreraz several times in the days before he died
but didn't detect multiple infections in the lining of his lungs,
according to the Arizona Department of Economic Security.
</P>
<P>
   She also overlooked or did not investigate Contreraz's
debilitating bouts of diarrhea and many cuts, scrapes and bruises,
a DES report said. She later told Child Protective Services workers
that she didn't question Contreraz about the injuries because it
was common for boys to be hurt during work or exercises.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, embarrassed state officials on Thursday fired Lewis
from a job at the Arizona Department of Juvenile Corrections'
Rincon Mountain Diagnostic Center, a facility for juveniles
sentenced as adults.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis was hired at the Tucson prison after leaving the Boys
Ranch following Contreraz's March 2 death.
</P>
<P>
   Two other former Boys Ranch employees are still working at the
Tucson juvenile prison where Lewis worked, according to a
well-informed government source. They were among 17 former Boys
Ranch workers identified by the DES as having been involved in
events that led to Contreraz's death.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis and the other two former employees are on a DES list of
individuals with ``substantiated claims of child abuse'' against
them. They have appealed their placement on the DES list.
</P>
<P>
   Juvenile Corrections officials said they had not dismissed the
other two workers because they have not been indicted. The
unidentified workers could be dismissed if they are indicted or if
their placement on the DES child-abuse list is upheld.
</P>
<P>
   Ratliff said the Pinal County attorney's investigation of other
former Boys Ranch employees continues. The California Attorney
General's Office agreed Thursday to help by interviewing witnesses
now living in California.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't, by any means, the end of the case,'' Ratliff said.
</P>
<P>
   Contreraz's death prompted officials in California to remove
many youngsters from Boys Ranch. Like Contreraz, they had been
sentenced to the boot camp-style reform program by juvenile justice
authorities looking for alternatives to prison.
</P>
<P>
   Pinal County Attorney Robert Olson flew to Sacramento on
Wednesday to personally inform Contreraz's family of the
indictments, and met with aides to California Attorney General Dan
Lungren.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona's DES concluded recently that Contreraz was the victim
of systematic abuse at the hands of Boys Ranch employees who
ignored his pleas for treatment of his illness. The reports show
that Boys Ranch workers branded Contreraz an uncooperative whiner
who needed tougher discipline rather than medical treatment.
</P>
<P>
   DES recommended yanking Boys Ranch's operating license. The
recommendation was appealed, and negotiations could result in the
program regaining its license. However, state officials are
demanding a dramatic ``culture change'' and ``zero tolerance for
abuse'' to let the facility stay open.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are in the middle of negotiated-settlement meetings right
now,'' DES spokeswoman Lorraine Gordon said Thursday. ``We're
expecting that to be completed in a week or two.''
</P>
<P>
   The Boys Ranch board is searching for a replacement for longtime
president Bob Thomas, who was placed on administrative leave Sept.
1. Thomas' temporary replacement, Denice Fitchie, announced her
resignation in mid-September.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of the hiring of the former Boys Ranch workers,
state juvenile corrections officials are considering changes in how
they conduct employee background checks.
</P>
<P>
   Juvenile Corrections spokesman Steve Meissner said his
department and other state agencies are exploring ways to include a
DES background check.
</P>
<P>
   Juvenile corrections officials stumbled across a former Boys
Ranch employee two weeks ago when he was fired for an
``inappropriate take-down'' of a youngster at the Rincon unit,
Meissner said.
</P>
<P>
   Though that worker was not implicated in Contreraz's death,
Juvenile Corrections officials feared other former Boys Ranch
workers might have ended up on their payroll. They submitted a list
of employees to DES and asked the agency to check it against a list
of 17 former Boys Ranch workers implicated by the agency in
Contreraz's death.
</P>
<P>
   Meissner said DES found no other Juvenile Corrections workers on
its list.
</P>
<P>
   But Lewis' name was not on the Juvenile Corrections workers'
list, officials discovered Thursday, since Rincon workers were paid
by the adult Department of Corrections.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Lewis nor two other former Boys Ranch employees who
still work at Rincon have had disciplinary problems while employed
by the state, Meissner said. &QL;

INDICTED NURSE REMAINS FREE TO WORK IN FIELD, BOARD SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PAT KOSSAN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Linda Babb, a registered nurse indicted on manslaughter and
child abuse charges Thursday, is still free to work in nursing,
state Board of Nursing investigator Jane Werth said.
</P>
<P>
   Babb is being investigated by the Nursing Board, but Werth said
she would not confirm whether that investigation stems from her
role in the death of Nicholaus Contreraz, 16, at Arizona Boys Ranch
on March 2.
</P>
<P>
   The regulatory agency will complete its own inquiry, said Werth,
who didn't know when that investigation would be complete. Until
the board makes a decision, Babb's license is valid.
</P>
<P>
   Nursing Board officials cannot recall an Arizona nurse being
charged with manslaughter of a patient within at least the past
five years, Werth said.
</P>
<P>
   Criminal indictments against nurses usually stem from abuse of
patients, drug use or forgery or theft, Werth said.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, 81 nurses had their licenses revoked _ the strongest
disciplinary action by the licensing agency _ because of ``harm of
patients'' or repeated complaints.
</P>
<P>
   They were among 603 of Arizona's 80,000 nurses and nursing
assistants who were disciplined last year, up from 422 the year
before.
</P>
<P>
   ``The state has structures in place, and justice will be done,''
said Lyndall Eddie, executive director of the Arizona Nurses
Association, regarding Babb's indictment.
</P>
<P>
   Babb is one of five former Boys Ranch employees facing two
felony counts each. The Department of Economic Security has refused
to renew the program's operating license.
</P>
<P>
   This is the first time Babb, licensed since 1981, has faced
disciplinary action by the Nursing Board, Werth said. But a state
investigation of the boy's death indicates it is not the first time
she has been questioned about charges of abuse at Boys Ranch.
</P>
<P>
   Many nurses are unwilling to comment on Babb's troubles, saying
they need to understand the pressures she was under from her
employer.
</P>
<P>
   But one Maricopa Community College District nursing instructor,
who asked that her name not be used, said it is a lesson that will
be used by many nursing instructors throughout the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have an obligation to be a patient advocate,'' she said,
but sometimes that means nurses must buck the system, go over the
head of a supervisor and choose between their job or compromising
patient care.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one time you don't champion the patient, it's the kid who
gets pneumonia,'' she said. &QL;

BANK GUARD KILLS WOULD-BE ROBBER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LISA VAN PROYEN   and ALEX ROTH  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- A conspicuously disguised man claiming to have a
bomb was shot to death by a plainclothes security guard as he tried
to rob a Washington Mutual bank branch in suburban Tarzana.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard a loud voice saying, `I've got a bomb!' Next thing I
heard, pop, pop, pop, pop,'' said Ervin Goldstein, who was in the
safe-deposit area. He immediately propped a chair against the vault
door and hid his cash and collectible stamps.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was scared to death,'' Goldstein said.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles County Coroner's Office identified the would-be
robber as Ajang Khadivi of Winnetka.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles Police Department officers tried to revive Khadivi,
but he died of multiple gunshot wounds to his upper torso shortly
after the 10:50 a.m. incident in the 18400 block of Ventura
Boulevard, said LAPD Lt. Anthony Alba.
</P>
<P>
   Based on evidence collected from the man's vehicle, police
suspect he might have been involved in other robberies. Khadivi was
dressed in two layers of clothing to change disguises again after
the robbery and was wearing a black wig and baseball cap, Alba
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It appears this suspect was very much prepared for this
robbery,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   More than 100 customers and employees were evacuated from
businesses in the Tarzana Square area, and a busy half-mile stretch
of Ventura Boulevard was closed for 30 minutes as a bomb squad
searched for explosives in the suspect's black, four-door
Mercedes-Benz, parked east of the bank.
</P>
<P>
   Neither bombs nor weapons were found on the man or in his car.
</P>
<P>
   Bank customer Hengameh Massachi said she was waiting for a
teller when she noticed a ``very, very strange'' man sitting at the
manager's desk, wearing a black wig and gloves. A briefcase was at
his feet. And on several occasions he held a napkin to his face and
coughed into it, she said.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side of the desk was the manager, sitting next to a
safe.
</P>
<P>
   Massachi, a Tarzana real estate agent, said the man's behavior
was so odd that she asked the teller whether she should use her
cellular phone to call police.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, I know there's something wrong here; do you want me to
call the police?'' Massachi said.
</P>
<P>
   Then she heard the man demand money from the manager, who got up
from the desk and told several tellers to drop $10 and $20 bills
into a bag, Massachi said.
</P>
<P>
   The manager returned to the desk, dropped the bag on the table
and said, ``Take it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's it?'' the man responded.
</P>
<P>
   At that moment, two security guards ran into the bank and told
the suspect to ``freeze,'' Massachi said. ``He said, I have a
bomb.''
</P>
<P>
   The suspect opened his coat, and one of the guards began to
shoot. The manager was standing across the desk from the suspect
when the shots were fired, Massachi said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The manager, he was very lucky he didn't get shot,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   One female bank employee fainted during the ordeal and was
hospitalized, said Battalion Chief Terry Manning of the Los Angeles
Fire Department.
</P>
<P>
   Others left the bank with rattled nerves, some seeking refuge at
the nearest building -- a Wells Fargo bank inside a Vons
supermarket.
</P>
<P>
   Some were critical of the guard's decision to shoot inside a
crowded bank.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just breaks my heart. A guy doesn't have a weapon. There's
such a rush to kill,'' said Divi Miller of Van Nuys, who tried to
enter the bank after the incident.
</P>
<P>
   But Mort Smiley, a shopper in the area, supported the guard's
actions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the guy who shot him did it right,'' Smiley said. ``It
takes a lot of guts to shoot somebody. Hopefully, it will
discourage others from committing bank robberies.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for IPSA International, which employs the bank's
guards, said company officials would not discuss details about the
shooting. ``We are confident that all the actions were proper,''
Senior Vice President Tom Sutak said from the company's Oakland
headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Sutak nor police would disclose the identities of the
guards. Sutak said company officials are cooperating with the Los
Angeles Police Department and FBI.
</P>
<P>
   Sutak said at least one guard involved in the shooting is based
in the company's Orange office. He is licensed to carry the firearm
and also has a separate security guard license. But Sutak said that
in general, the company's guards don't carry weapons while on duty
in a bank.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have found over the years that there is not a need for
armed people,'' he said. ``It is a relatively infrequent need.
</P>
<P>
   ``This individual was armed, and he was supposed to be,'' Sutak
said, adding that he was not aware why the guard was armed. ``It
could have been a specific client request or something of that
nature.''
</P>
<P>
   Alba said the bank has had special problems in recent months and
that the security guards were hired for this reason. He would not
elaborate on the problems. Bank officials were not available for
comment.
</P>
<P>
   The bank had not been robbed in at least a year, Alba said.
However, a courier was robbed in the bank's parking lot within the
past couple of months.
</P>
<P>
   The guards were held for questioning but not arrested, said
Alba, adding that homicide detectives plan to inspect the crime
scene.
</P>
<P>
   Police officials called the robber's techniques unusual in
threatening with a bomb and said the investigation must be
completed before conclusions are drawn.
</P>
<P>
   ``This method of operation is not common,'' Alba said, adding:
``California state law allows anyone, even a civilian, to defend
himself if a threat is a present danger. A lot will depend on what
was said by the suspect and what the witnesses felt. . . .
Certainly a bomb (threat) ups the ante. The investigation is in
progress, and we'll withhold judgment.''

 By CARLTON THOMPSON  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
It's getting to the point where an Astros jersey seems to be the
next-best thing to a bulletproof vest.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Go ahead _ take your best shot at the Astros. But understand
they may absorb the bullet and come back firing with both barrels.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Padres pinch hitter Jim Leyritz threatened to shoot
holes in the Astros' spirits with a game-tying two-run homer off
Billy Wagner in the top of the ninth. But Bill Spiers proved to be
the better gunslinger in the bottom of the inning, delivering a
game-winning RBI single off Padres closer Trevor Hoffman to give
the Astros a dramatic 5-4 victory before 45,550 at the Astrodome.
</P>
<P>
   Spiers' heroics evened the best-of-five Division Series at a
game apiece and kept the Astros from heading to San Diego in an 0-2
hole. The series takes a break today before resuming with Game 3
Saturday at 10:05 p.m. at Qualcomm Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``That wasn't just the biggest hit of my career _ that was the
biggest hit of my life,'' said Spiers, who was 3-for-5 with a pair
of doubles. ``We know what kind of team we have, and we know what
we've done this year. Any time we get to the ninth inning, and it's
close, we feel like we have a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   And they should.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's victory marked the 28th time the Astros have won in
their final at-bat, and it improved their record in one-run games
to 30-19. Seven of the Astros' 11 games against the Padres have
been decided by one run, with the Astros holding a 4-3 advantage in
the close calls.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was just typical of the games we've played against them
all year,'' Astros second baseman Craig Biggio said. ``This was a
lot of fun. This is what you play for. No one in this clubhouse
wanted to go back to San Diego down 0-2 in a five-game series.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think (Wednesday's) off day was good for us, because it gave
us a chance to sort of let the salt sit in our wounds for a little
while. It gave us a chance to think about our situation, and we
knew what we needed to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Hitting had to be the top priority on that list. The Astros'
offense was completely shut down in Game 1, when Padres ace Kevin
Brown and Hoffman combined for 17 strikeouts and held the Astros to
four hits.
</P>
<P>
   The bats were back in working order Thursday, pumping out 11
hits, including four for extra bases. While scoring opportunities
were few and far between in Game 1, the Astros put runners in
scoring position in seven of the nine innings Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The National League's highest-scoring offense gave starting
pitcher Shane Reynolds a three-run lead after three innings, and
the veteran righthander kept the Padres off the board through the
first five innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just trying to throw strikes and keep the leadoff
hitters off base,'' said Reynolds, who didn't reach a three-ball
count after walking Padres second baseman Quilvio Veras to open the
game. ``I know how big this game was for us. I was nervous; I think
anyone would be nervous with a Dome full of people. It was a
nervous situation.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astros' most nervous situation occurred when Wagner took the
mound to start the ninth inning and allowed a one-out infield
single to Padres third baseman Ken Caminiti. After Greg Vaughn
lined out to center field, Wagner fired a steady dose of fastballs
to Leyritz, who worked the count to 3-2 before launching a shot
over the right-field wall.
</P>
<P>
   ``It shocked me,'' said Wagner, who converted 30 of 35 save
situations during the regular season. ``I can't believe that ball
stayed fair. When he hit it, I thought it was going foul. I made
the pitch where I wanted it. He just hit it out.''
</P>
<P>
   When questioned about his decision to throw Leyritz nothing but
fastballs, Wagner said: ``You've got to go with what you've got.''
</P>
<P>
   Astros catcher Brad Ausmus, who replaced Tony Eusebio in the
ninth inning, agreed with the pitch sequence.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't blame (Wagner),'' Ausmus said. ``I called all
fastballs, and he never shook me off. If he's going to get beat,
it's going to be on his best pitch.''
</P>
<P>
   Biggio led off the Astros' first inning with a single to center
and scored on a ground ball by Jeff Bagwell to give Reynolds an
early 1-0 cushion. Bagwell drove home two more runs in the third
with a single up the middle.
</P>
<P>
   The Padres pulled within a run in the sixth on an RBI double by
Steve Finley and a run-scoring single by Tony Gwynn. Astros manager
Larry Dierker sent righthander Jay Powell to the mound to start the
eighth inning despite the fact Reynolds had allowed just four hits
and had thrown only 74 pitches _ 55 of them for strikes. Powell,
who has appeared in both games of the series, retired the side in
order.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt pretty good,'' Reynolds said. ``But there's no sense in
me pitching the whole game with as good a bullpen as we have.''
</P>
<P>
   Dierker was ripe for second-guessing after Wagner's blown save,
but the offense took the manager off the hook with another
fantastic finish. Derek Bell's solo homer to left gave the Astros a
4-2 cushion before Leyritz's game-tying blow.
</P>
<P>
   Ricky Gutierrez singled off Dan Miceli to open the Astros' ninth
and moved to second on Ausmus' sacrifice. That prompted Padres
manager Bruce Bochy to summon Hoffman from the bullpen with Biggio
up.
</P>
<P>
   Gutierrez pulled off the play of the game, catching the Padres
by surprise with a steal of third base. That put the Astros
shortstop in position to score easily on Spiers' single to right,
which followed an intentional walk to Biggio.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stealing that base was the first thing that went through my
head,'' said Gutierrez, who stole the base without instruction from
the bench. ``They really didn't pay any attention to me, so I took
off. I took my normal lead, and when I saw his leg kick, I took
off.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they thought I would just let Bidge hit, but I was
trying to get to third to give us a better chance of getting the
run home. Billy came through with one of the biggest hits in the
history of Houston baseball. That just shows you the kind of
character we have on this club. We never feel like it's over.''
</P>
<P>
   And it usually isn't until Team Resiliency has had its final
say.

   &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
THE sound is in the ear of the beholder, the deep-throated rumble,
the roar, the hum of the engines. When 28 cars crank it up Sunday
in the Texaco Grand Prix of Houston, they will live the fantasy of
the typical Houston motorist _ to drive 185 mph through the city's
downtown streets, perhaps doing a wheelie in front of the
courthouse.
</P>
<P>
   So with the power vested in us, as the holder of a Texaco credit
card, we extend this official welcome to the owners, drivers and
crews who will compete Sunday in the first big-league road race
ever held here. Along with the glamour and excitement provided by
the Championship Auto Racing Teams, Houston will benefit in a more
material way. For the first time in the city's history, a nearly
two-mile stretch, from Austin Street to the Convention Center, will
not be under repair.
</P>
<P>
   When the drivers move on to the next circuit, they will leave
streets not exactly paved with gold. But they will be paved,
nevertheless, a big point in our favor.
</P>
<P>
   The Grand Prix provides the same risks and thrills and glory as
other forms of racing, except that in Houston you do not have a
true Gasoline Alley. What you have is a Petroleum Corridor.
</P>
<P>
   Also, there is the added tension of knowing that if a car misses
a turn _ there are 10 of them _ it might take out a clothing store,
a barbecue joint, a laundry and a pawnshop.
</P>
<P>
   Still, to be honest, when most Houstonians hear the phrase,
``Grand Prix,'' they think of Monte Carlo, and well-heeled
Europeans, comporting themselves like characters in a Sigmund
Romberg musical. In its soul, Houston is a chauffeur-driven pickup
truck, and on occasion can be spotted wearing designer jeans, with
a copy of the Wall Street Journal sticking out of the hip pocket.
</P>
<P>
   We are not turned off by fancy. The cars are awesome and the
drivers fearless, and the names we know are respected, starting
with Michael Andretti, of one of racing's family dynasties. Jimmy
Vasser is trying to nail down second place in the CART standings,
behind his teammate, Alex Zanardi, who owns the crown.
</P>
<P>
   Scotland's Dario Franchitti, a protg of the great Jackie
Stewart, has acquired a following, racing for Roger Penske. How can
a true racing fan resist an Italian who speaks with a Scottish
burr?
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it isn't possible to refer to this spectacle and not
take note of a glaring irony. The event and the hot young speed
merchants have come to the hometown of the most intrepid driver
auto racing ever knew. And A. J. Foyt, who has cast his lot with
the Indy Racing League, is nowhere in sight.
</P>
<P>
   Foyt wrote the history of motor sports in this town. This is the
short version: A.J. was 6 when he rode in his race car at old
Playland Park. He checked out most of the dirt tracks across
America, and when he made the leap to Indianapolis the Brickyard
still had bricks. He won his first of four Indy 500's in 1961. When
he won his second, three years later, Sports Illustrated referred
to him in a cover story as ``The Champion of the Old Guard.''
</P>
<P>
   The burly Foyt was 29 years old. That year he was voted the
runner-up to football's Jim Brown as the pro athlete of the year, a
breakthrough of no small import. Until Foyt came along, race
drivers were not generally accepted as athletes. Not unless you
considered catching a taxi a sport. A.J. helped change that
perception.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, he was never your average driver, any more than
Michelangelo was a guy who grubbed out a living paining ceilings.
A.J. has been a mythic figure, in a category with Babe Ruth and Jim
Thorpe and Jack Dempsey, as people who defined their games and
elevated them. He made the transition from a defiant,
kiss-my-tailpipe rebel to a national resource, revered by fans and
rivals alike. This is a path only a rare few can navigate. Joe
Namath did it, Muhammad Ali did it better.
</P>
<P>
   He brought Indy-type racing to Meyer Speedway, and two
generations of drivers followed him in and out of Houston. Ebb Rose
and Lloyd Ruby and John Henry Kirby started here. John Mecom Jr.,
already in the oil business, put together a team whose drivers
included Foyt, Parnelli Jones and Mario Andretti. Tony Bettenhausen
Jr. tasted his first beer in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Foyt competed into his mid-50s, driving everything but rickshaws
and Winnebagos. In 1967 he won Indy for the third time, went to
Europe and added a victory at Le Mans, in the 24-hour endurance
test, the race for fans with insomnia. Le Mans rarely had attracted
hard-core American drivers until then.
</P>
<P>
   When a French writer suggested that his international debut
would make him famous, A.J. bristled.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lissen!'' he snapped. ``I'll tell you what made me famous. You
see this here right foot? Well, that there foot is what made me
famous.''
</P>
<P>
   Gentlemen, don't forget to fasten your seat belts.

When the Championship Auto Racing Teams drivers take their cars on
the downtown course for the first time this morning in preparation
for the inaugural Texaco Grand Prix of Houston on Sunday, they will
have to hope the technical decision-makers on their teams have made
the right choices.
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Any time you come to a new place like this, you have to trust
your instincts and your engineers,'' said Mauricio Gugelmin, who
drives the Hollywood Reynard/Mercedes.
</P>
<P>
   At 1.68 miles, the Houston course is the second-smallest street
circuit on the CART schedule next to the 1.59-mile course at Long
Beach. But the Houston course is much more box-like in shape than
Long Beach because seven of the 10 turns on the Houston track are
90-degree angles to the left.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the drivers hopped on motor scooters Thursday and rode
around the course to get a feel for the layout. But the crew
members setting up the cars will play the biggest role in which
drivers get off to a fast start in practice and provisional
qualifying today.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, you just acquire as many facts as you can, then
it's essentially a best-guess scenario,'' said Tom Anderson,
managing director for the Target team of Alex Zanardi and Jimmy
Vasser. ``You never really know how close you are until you
actually get on the track. We've been close at some places, and
we've been a bit off at others, like Vancouver.
</P>
<P>
   ``You will know by the end of the first (practice) session who
got the setup right. If it's a real tight grid (similar speeds for
most of the cars) in the first morning practice, you know a lot of
guys are doing their homework.''
</P>
<P>
   Doing your homework is what it takes at a track where no one
ever has raced. The CART teams were on a new layout at Vancouver
one month ago, but CART has raced at that city for nine years.
Everything is new for everyone in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   To help eliminate the unknown factors, teams use computer
graphics and printouts to help them figure out how they need to set
up the cars for a new course.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of it is done with computers,'' said Rick Rinaman, crew
chief for Al Unser Jr.'s Marlboro Penske/Mercedes. ``You find a
track that is closest to the new one and make comparisons. But this
course is very unique.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be tough on the brakes. You have a lot of hard
braking, so we have to make modifications for brake cooling. And
you have to worry about your water temperatures when it's 95
degrees. The track doesn't have a lot of long straights that can
help cool the car down.''
</P>
<P>
   Rinaman said the key to a successful weekend is being close to
the proper setup when the cars first gets on the track.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a level playing field when we get here, but the team that
comes off the truck and guesses right has an advantage,'' Rinaman
said. ``As important as the setup is, it's also important that the
driver gets time on the track. When you only have a 90-minute
practice session, you can't be sitting in the pits every other lap
making adjustments caused by being so far off on the car setup.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you get close on the setup, your lap times are going to
pick up automatically as the driver gets more accustomed to the
course. That won't happen if you're changing shocks and things like
that. It's imperative to be as close as you can right off the
bat.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson said every aspect of the course was studied before the
teams arrived.
</P>
<P>
   ``CART has mapped the course in terms of length of the
straightaways and degrees of the turns,'' Anderson said. ``Reynard
has a computer simulation program, and their engineers put out
estimates on things like top speed and cornering force.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our engineers will study our data from other street courses
like Long Beach, Detroit and Vancouver and figure out what they've
learned at those places. Then we talked to Firestone about which
tire they are bringing and what kind of construction it is. They
had someone here actually studying the track surface, so we knew
coming in what the streets are like.''
</P>
<P>
   But even with all the complicated technical information,
Gugelmin said it's still an inexact science.
</P>
<P>
   ``There a lot of information you can't get until you get out
there,'' Gugelmin said. ``For example, are the roads heavily
crowned? Are there transitions between grippy and slippery
surfaces? Those are questions that can't be answered until you see
it and drive it.''

   &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
FIRST, the Astros had a Billy goat.
</P>
<P>
   But the day ended happily with a Billy gloat.
</P>
<P>
   Billy Spiers saved Billy Wagner's hide Thursday afternoon. He
also answered the Padres' lack of respect for him and, in the
process, pretty much saved the Astros' season. After this, after
Spiers poked a lunging, looping single into right field to drive
home the winning run in the bottom of the ninth off the most
celebrated relief pitcher in all of baseball, we must now call
Spiers William.
</P>
<P>
   William the conqueror?
</P>
<P>
   Trevor Hoffman, he of the 53 saves in 54 regular-season
opportunities, was himself sent home to San Diego answering to a
different moniker. Tremor.
</P>
<P>
   As for Wagner, like the German guy who wrote those long, loud
operas, our Billy maintains a maddening penchant for creating
overwrought dramas. Three times of late, Wagner has been stung by
costly home runs in situations where he is supposed to be saving
the day, not losing it.
</P>
<P>
   The way things turned out, though, Billy received an
ill-deserved victory instead. The other Billy, who's about as
unsung as any hero you'll ever meet, earned the save.
</P>
<P>
   ``Biggest hit of my life,'' Spiers said. ``It was backyard
stuff, what you dream about as a kid.''
</P>
<P>
   With a full count and two out in the top of the ninth, Jim
Leyritz took Wagner deep to right, transforming a presumed safe 4-2
Houston lead into a sudden, crowd-stunning tie at 4. It was the
kind of ball that really should have curved wide of the foul pole,
but for some reason it didn't, and the Astros found themselves
confronting a potentially devastating mood swing.
</P>
<P>
   I mean, here was a team that was 0-4 in postseason play dating
to last fall and most assuredly hadn't exactly been breaking
baseballs in half with its bats of late. While the Astros had
finally cut loose a bit against Game 2 starter Andy Ashby, who was
subjected to a relative barrage of six _ wow! _ Houston hits and
thus lasted just four innings Tuesday, their confidence had to be
badly shaken.
</P>
<P>
   They did, however, recognize the awful consequences of going to
San Diego in an 0-2 hole, and their resolve stiffened, as it should
have. After all, 27 of their victories in the regular season had
come in their final at-bat. Muscle memory ought to count for
something.
</P>
<P>
   Ricky Gutierrez led off the ninth against Dan Miceli, poking a
dribbler to short that Chris Gomez couldn't pick up in time to make
the play at first. Brad Ausmus, falling down backward on a Miceli
pitch that was high and tight, somehow bunted Gutierrez to second,
at which point the revered Trevor strode out to face Craig Biggio.
</P>
<P>
   After Gutierrez, who is a lot quicker than he is fast, dashed
madly to third for the most important stolen base of his life, a
high-level conference at the mound resulted in the decision to walk
Biggio to get to Spiers.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that Spiers had already whacked three doubles in his
previous five at-bats. Never mind that his personal extra-base-hit
count was equal to the Astros' team total over the aforementioned
four playoff defeats.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sort of thought they might walk me, too,'' Spiers said,
``but you can't go up there counting on it. I put that thought out
of my mind real quick.''
</P>
<P>
   The fact that Derek Bell, previously 0-for-20 in the playoffs,
had homered on his most recent plate appearance influenced Padres
manager Bruce Bochy's thinking. If not for that surprise blast into
the left-field orange seats, Bochy probably would have also walked
Spiers, given Bell's hapless prior mental state. Surely he would
have. Bell's ringer dinger then had the ancillary benefit of
keeping the bat in Spiers' steady hands.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman's forte is a changeup that behaves, Larry Dierker
suggested, ``like a (badminton) shuttlecock.'' It actually gives
the appearance of slowing down en route to the plate, so deceptive
is his arm motion.
</P>
<P>
   And he quickly stuck Spiers in a 1-2 hole with three changeups
in a row. Hoffman is as stubbornly married to his pitch as Wagner
is to the almighty fastball, but Hoffman's gaudy results are hard
to argue with. He may be the National League's Cy Young Award
recipient.
</P>
<P>
   ``He made me look like an idiot twice,'' Spiers conceded. ``You
bet I'd have thrown me another one.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman did. Spiers made decent contact, and the ball floated
out beyond second baseman Quilvio Veras' reach as Gutierrez stomped
on home plate.
</P>
<P>
   Astros, 5-4.
</P>
<P>
   ``Billy hung in there and battled him,'' Astros hitting coach
Tom McCraw said. ``You can't blame (Hoffman). Eight times out of
10, that pitch is going to be hit on the ground to the first
baseman.''
</P>
<P>
   McCraw, it should be noted, had a hand in this beyond-crucial
victory that evened the best-of-five Division Series. On
Wednesday's day off, he called a rare meeting with his hamstrung
hitters for the purpose of trying to get their minds right after
Kevin Brown and Hoffman had struck out 17 with a combined
four-hitter in Game 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``A three-minute speech,'' Mack said, pooh-poohing any notion
that he had climbed onto a soapbox or resorted to noisy
Gipper-esque gibberish.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just reminded them of how they'd hit all year,'' he said.
``I emphasized being patient and stroking the ball to all fields.''
</P>
<P>
   Observed Ausmus: ``Mack doesn't say a whole lot. When he decides
to talk, it's important. You'd better listen.''
</P>
<P>
   Spiers as well tends to measure his words carefully in that
wonderful, deep Carolina drawl of his. His bat, however, speaks
downright eloquently for him on occasion. William Shakespeare he'll
never be. But today, Billy deserves to be, yes, a William.
Absolutely.

THEY would rather be lying on a bed of nails than all wrapped up in
a down comforter.
</P>
<P>
   Their blood doesn't begin to boil until the hour gets late and
the situation is desperate.
</P>
<P>
   Like Ike and Tina Turner, the Astros never, ever do anything
nice and easy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Great drama,'' said Larry Dierker. ``But it might kill the
manager.''
</P>
<P>
   Not to mention the rest of us.
</P>
<P>
   This is a season that should be played in the ER, not the
Astrodome. Every seat should come with its own personal
defibrillator. Bring somebody in here with a set of actuarial
tables to determine how many years they are taking off a city's
collective life.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just a team that doesn't know when to quit,'' said
Jeff Bagwell.
</P>
<P>
   Or, apparently, when to put its feet up on the coffee table and
relax.
</P>
<P>
   Stubborn Billy Wagner serves up a steady diet of fastballs to
Jim Leyritz, and a 4-2 win in the top of the ninth turns into a
routine 5-4 trip to the cardio/intensive-care unit.
</P>
<P>
   Routine because the Astros have made themselves a home out there
on the ledge, their toes dangling over oblivion. They have walked
the high wire more than the entire Wallenda family.
</P>
<P>
   When big-stick Billy Spiers sent his third hit of the day into
right field, and Ricky Gutierrez sprinted down the line and took a
flying leap onto home plate to end it, the crowd of 45,550 finally
breathed a sigh of relief.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros acted like they had just finished mopping the floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the way this team has been all season,'' said Craig
Biggio. ``We don't get down on ourselves. We don't panic. We just
keep on playing and find a way to win.''
</P>
<P>
   On the afternoon when the Killer B's finally rediscovered their
stingers _ 3-for-11, three runs, four RBIs _ it still took Ricky
Gutierrez to conjure up one more late magic trick to get the Astros
over what had been growing into a rather large postseason hump.
</P>
<P>
   Gutierrez beat out a slow roller to shortstop for a leadoff
single in the bottom of the ninth, then moved to second base when
Brad Ausmus fell backward and still got down a huge sacrifice bunt.
Gutierrez took off and stole third when Padres closer Trevor
Hoffman wound up with his high leg kick, and that set the table for
Spiers, who followed an intentional walk to Biggio.
</P>
<P>
   Yawn. It's an old trick by now, the 28th time this season the
Astros won a game in their last at-bat.
</P>
<P>
   What made it just the slightest bit different and even more
impressive was the way this clutch win came just minutes after
Leyritz's smash sailed over the wall just fair down the right-field
line.
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't hang their heads or show any signs of sinking,''
Dierker said. ``When the guys got back to the dugout, they were all
moving around, bouncing, alive. No sense of fear. You could read it
on their faces that they knew they were going to get a run. They've
done it so many times.''
</P>
<P>
   Winning becomes habit-forming. Winning when all looks lost is
addictive.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's strictly a confidence thing,'' Dierker said. ``It's an
internal feeling that grows throughout the year when you do it
often enough. It spreads from one player to the next and almost
becomes a separate entity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll tell you, I saw Clyde Drexler out there today, and I
couldn't help but to think about our team in comparison to the
Rockets winning championships.''
</P>
<P>
   Drexler was on hand to throw out the ceremonial first pitch, and
he bounced it in the dirt before home plate. Dating to Game 5 at
Utah last May, that makes him 1-for-14. But it's the thought that
counts.
</P>
<P>
   So call this Clutch-hit City.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember those Rockets who came back two years in a row
trailing Phoenix 3-1 and went on to win it all,'' said Dierker.
``They just seemed to know that somehow they would find a way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we have equivalent talent to those Rockets. We have
talent that can play with any team in our league. But what's
important is having the chemistry efficiency to get the job done in
any situation. Even when we're knocked down, you know we're going
to get back up.''
</P>
<P>
   If Leyritz's homer had propelled the Padres to a victory, this
would likely have gone from a knockdown to a knockout, sending the
Astros reeling to San Diego in an 0-2 hole.
</P>
<P>
   They didn't want to talk about it openly, but the playoff losing
streak was becoming a monster. Four straight games by this Astros
team. Six straight postseason losses going back to 1986 against the
Mets. There is only so much strain a heart or one team can take.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to make something happen in that ninth inning,'' said
Gutierrez. ``When I hit my ball and it was going slow, I knew I had
a chance to beat it out.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I got on second base and I saw Hoffman wasn't paying
attention to me, I knew that was my chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Bold stroke. Great play. Clutch move.
</P>
<P>
   Just another day at the high-wire office for the Astros.

<P>
   ATLANTA _ At one point, the Chicago Cubs were two outs from
victory. But when Thursday night's game ended, they were one loss
from elimination.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to a dramatic home run by Javy Lopez, a game-winning hit
by Chipper Jones, and critical mistakes by the Cubs, the Atlanta
Braves have grabbed a commanding 2-0 lead in their
three-of-five-game playoff series.
</P>
<P>
   With one out in the bottom of the ninth inning, and the Braves
trailing, 1-0, Lopez hit a towering solo home run to left field
that sent the game into extra innings. Then in the bottom of the
10th inning, a one-out single by Jones scored Walt Weiss from
second base, giving Atlanta a thrilling 2-1 victory at Turner
Field.
</P>
<P>
   The Cubs had a hard time figuring out how they had let the game
slip away. ``The toughest loss of the year,'' said Mickey
Morandini, the Cubs' second baseman. ``It hurts. But this thing
isn't over.''
</P>
<P>
   It was an emotional victory for the Braves, and a deflating loss
for the Cubs, who were on the verge of tying the series, riding a
masterly pitching performance by Kevin Tapani. But it all fell
apart for the Cubs after Lopez hit one of the biggest home runs of
his career, a long drive over the left-field fence that sent the
Turner Field record crowd of 51,713 into a frenzy.
</P>
<P>
   Things continued to go badly for the Cubs in the top of the 10th
inning, when they squandered an opportunity to take the lead. A
walk to Glenallen Hill, a sacrifice by Gary Gaetti, an intentional
walk to Morandini, and a steal of third base by Hill gave Chicago
runners at the corners with one out. But on a 3-2 count, Jeff
Blauser struck out, and it turned into an inning-ending double play
when Lopez threw out Morandini at second base. Morandini threw down
his helmet in disgust, arguing that he was safe. Jim Riggleman, the
Cubs' manager, said that Morandini was running so that the Cubs
would avoid grounding into a double play.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he doesn't go, and we hit the ball on the ground, we hit
into a double play and the inning is over anyway,'' Riggleman said.
``With a left-hander on the mound, it's tough to get a good jump,
and Mick didn't get a good jump. Mick didn't think the tag was ever
made.''
</P>
<P>
   Then the Braves ended the game in the bottom half of the 10th
inning, scoring the winning run against Terry Mulholland, who took
over from Tapani, who allowed five hits in nine innings, with six
strikeouts and three walks.
</P>
<P>
   Weiss started the rally by walking with one out. Then the Cubs
made another mistake. Tony Graffanino bunted down the first-base
line, and Mulholland hustled to cover first base.
</P>
<P>
   But Morandini had also come over to cover first, and as
Mulholland grabbed the toss from first baseman Mark Grace,
Mulholland missed the bag as he tried to maneuver around Morandini.
Graffanino was safe, putting runners on first and second base with
one out.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the winning hit from Jones, a line drive to left field
that easily scored Weiss. ``I hit a cutter inside,'' said Jones,
who struck out in his first three at-bats against Tapani.
``Mulholland is a guy whose bread and butter is to saw you off
inside.''
</P>
<P>
   As Jones ran down the first-base line, he used body English,
trying to coax the ball to stay fair. ``I couldn't even tell you
what I was doing,'' he said. ``I saw the ball going into the
outfield, and I knew the fielder wasn't going to catch it. It was
just a matter of fair or foul. I was doing a little bit of Carlton
Fisk, and a little bit of Dave Henderson.''
</P>
<P>
   The Braves ran onto the field in celebration. The Cubs walked
off the field dejectedly. They will try to keep their season alive
in Game 3, Saturday night at Wrigley Field.
</P>
<P>
   Riggleman had his closer, Rod Beck, ready to pitch when Lopez
hit his game-tying homer, but the Cubs' manager decided to stay
with Tapani.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very tough decision,'' said Riggleman of allowing
Tapani to pitch the ninth inning. ``When you got a guy like Beck,
it's a great temptation to turn it over to him. I just felt that
Tap was doing a good job. It's one of those manager's calls. The
way I chose didn't work out, and I feel terrible for Tap and the
club that it didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the game was a pitching duel between Tapani and Tom
Glavine, Atlanta's starter, who went seven innings and allowed just
three hits while striking out eight. Chicago's run off Glavine, who
did not allow a hit through five innings, came in the sixth.
Morandini and Scott Servais singled, then Tapani moved the runners
up with a sacrifice. Lance Johnson's ground ball to second base
scored Morandini.
</P>
<P>
   Until Lopez's home run, it looked as if that run would be enough
for the Cubs and Tapani. But it wasn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a shame we didn't get this win, because Kevin pitched a
great game,'' Grace said. ``But I've learned in this game you have
to get 27 outs to win. We didn't finish the job. Now we have to
bounce back.''  &QL;

<P>
   ARLINGTON _ Darryl Strawberry, the oft-troubled slugger who has
rebuilt his career with the New York Yankees, Thursday was
diagnosed with colon cancer, the same disease that struck his close
friend Eric Davis of the Baltimore Orioles a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors at Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center in New York
confirmed Strawberry, 36, has colon cancer after performing a
colonoscopy and biopsies, according to a news release prepared by
the Yankees. The New York Daily News reported that a walnut-size
tumor was discovered in Strawberry's colon.
</P>
<P>
   He could have surgery as early as Saturday, according to Rick
Cerrone, the Yankees' director of media relations. The team's news
release said the location of the tumor and Strawberry's health,
which is otherwise excellent, point to a full recovery.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement came as the Yankees prepared to play the Texas
Rangers tonight at The Ballpark in Arlington in the third game of
the teams' American League division series.
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry had suffered abdominal pain and cramps for nearly two
months. He said the pain would begin in the morning after he woke
up and subside later in the day. He did not bring the matter to the
attention of the Yankees' medical staff until Monday because he did
not want to be excluded from postseason play. He was given
antibiotics Monday in hopes the drugs would clear up his symptoms,
but the pain returned the next two mornings.
</P>
<P>
   He had a CAT scan Wednesday and left the team before Wednesday
night's game at Yankee Stadium to prepare for the colonoscopy.
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry's colon cancer comes a year after the Orioles' Davis
underwent surgery and received treatment as a result of the
disease. Strawberry and Davis grew up together in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement released by the Orioles, Davis said: ``While the
coincidence that my friend and I both contracted the same disease
is amazing, the reality of colon cancer potentially effecting all
of us is something that we are hopefully helping people become
aware of.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to reporters on a conference call, Davis said he found
Strawberry in good spirits when they spoke Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``He feels real good about it,'' Davis said. ``Under the
circumstances, you don't have a choice. He's battling for his life,
same as I went through.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if there had been a lot to explain to Strawberry, he said:
``I didn't have to say a whole lot, because I'm a walking
witness.''
</P>
<P>
   Yankees players and others associated with the club said
Strawberry should be able to draw strength from Davis, who came
back this season to hit .327 with 28 homers and 89 RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees' Chili Davis said: ``It's pretty ironic that Eric
and ``Straw' are so close and this has happened to them both. But I
think that is a strength in its own way. Eric battled it and came
back, put up a very productive year and managed to go on with his
life.''
</P>
<P>
   After going through a workout Thursday afternoon at The Ballpark
in Arlington, Yankees players lined up on the field behind ESPN
baseball analyst Harold Reynolds, who was doing a live report on
the Strawberry story for the opening of SportsCenter, in a show of
support for their teammate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, Darryl was watching,'' outfielder Tim Raines said
later. ``We want to make sure he knows we are behind him and his
family.''
</P>
<P>
   Said pitcher David Cone: ``It's just a big slap in the face.
Reality sets in, and you realize what's really important.''
</P>
<P>
   After emerging as a star with the Mets in the 1980s, Strawberry
was beset by a series of highly publicized off-the-field problems,
including drug and alcohol abuse, spousal abuse and a tax-evasion
conviction. His career was on the wane until he joined the Yankees
in 1995 and helped them win the '96 world championship. He hit .247
with 24 home runs and 57 RBIs as an outfielder and designated
hitter this season.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps more important, he has been a mature presence in the
Yankees' clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no doubt that Darryl has had a lot of turmoil in his
life,'' Cone said, ``and he clearly had turned it around. He was
one of the most respected leaders in the clubhouse. He has the
strength to deal with this. Everyone on our team would say that.''
</P>
<P>
   Yankees manager Joe Torre said Strawberry called him to tell him
of the diagnosis and expressed his happiness that the Yankees had
taken a 2-0 lead over the Rangers in their best-of-five series.
</P>
<P>
   Torre said his address to the team about the situation unleashed
an outpouring of emotion.
</P>
<P>
   ``You think you're all together, and, all of a sudden, your
voice begins to crack,'' he said. ``You realize we are sort of
Darryl Strawberry's extended family. He probably spends more time
with us than he does his family.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was complete silence in the clubhouse. There was some
sobbing, some very sad people. You really don't know what's the
right thing to do, but, sure as hell, none of it is comfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry also called the Yankees' clubhouse and spoke to
pitcher Andy Pettitte, a native of Deer Park.
</P>
<P>
   ``He let me know he had cancer and they were going to remove it
Saturday,'' Pettitte said. ``It was really tough. He wanted me to
let everyone know he wasn't going to be around this season. He
wanted me to let everyone know how proud he was to be a part of the
team, not just because of the talent we have, but because of the
kind of team we are.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big thing was he asked for us to pray for him. He said he
was going to be fine, and he wanted us to go out and win this. He
said the Lord was going to take care of him.''
</P>
<P>
   Yankees principal owner George Steinbrenner, quoted in the
team's news release, said:
</P>
<P>
   ``I have always said this is a man of great character, and this
has certainly proved to be true. He is facing a serious crisis, and
his concern is for his teammates. This is extremely upsetting to
me, and it really shows that baseball is only a small part of life.
Our thoughts and our prayers are with Darryl, his wife, Charisse,
and their young children.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees' postseason no doubt now will be colored by
Strawberry's illness in the same manner that their run to the 1996
world championship was framed against the condition of Torre's
brother, Frank, who was then waiting for a heart transplant.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had some tough ones (days) in 1996 with my brother,'' Torre
said. ``But this just whacked me. I could see the other thing
coming with Frank, but this one, as far as being blind-sided, this
ranks right there as probably one of the worst things I have had to
deal with here.''
</P>
<P>
   Cone, who battled back from an aneurysm in his right arm three
years ago, was asked Thursday if he felt up to pitching in 24
hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, very much,'' he said. ``Probably wearing Darryl's number
on the back of my hat.''

 By NEIL HOHLFELD  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
ATLANTA _ The way baseball is played these days, it's rare that a
starting pitcher with a one-run lead is allowed to work the ninth
inning.
<TEXT>
<P>
   In nearly every case, the closer gets the ball to start the
ninth in that situation.
</P>
<P>
   But the way Chicago Cubs starter Kevin Tapani pitched the first
eight innings of the National League Division Series against the
Atlanta Braves on Thursday night, there was little doubt manager
Jim Riggleman would let Tapani go out for the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   Tapani was masterful for eight innings, allowing four singles on
only 99 pitches and nursing a one-run lead. But with one out in the
ninth, Atlanta's Javy Lopez burst his and the Cubs' bubble with a
home run.
</P>
<P>
   In the 10th, Chipper Jones gave the Braves a 2-1 win with a
one-out single off Terry Mulholland as the Cubs wasted Tapani's
effort.
</P>
<P>
   After a walk to Walt Weiss, the Cubs misplayed pinch hitter Tony
Graffanino's bunt. First baseman Mark Grace fielded the ball, but
second baseman Mickey Morandini didn't break for the base soon
enough.
</P>
<P>
   Mulholland tried to get over but was late, and then he missed
the base after catching Grace's flip. Mulholland got the error.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, who was 0-for-3 with three strikeouts against Tapani,
lined Mulholland's first pitch just fair down the left-field line
for a single that ended the game and could go a long way toward
ending the Cubs' season.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves took a 2-0 lead in the best-of-five series, which
resumes Saturday night at Wrigley Field.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a momentum-builder,'' Jones said. ``We didn't want a
split (in Atlanta) and have to go to that crazy place in Chicago
and have to win one game just to come back to Atlanta for a fifth
and deciding game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was huge, but we still have some business to take care
of.''
</P>
<P>
   If the victory continued the Braves' momentum, the defeat could
crush the Cubs as their postseason road misery continued.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, the Cubs don't have much recent history in this arena,
but their last postseason road victory came 53 years ago when they
beat the Detroit Tigers in the 1945 World Series.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the Cubs have lost six consecutive NL Championship
Series games on the road, and two Division Series games in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   For 8 innings, it appeared Tapani was going to erase that bit of
gloomy Cubs history. After the game, Riggleman came close to
second-guessing himself about leaving Tapani in rather than calling
on closer Rod Beck, who saved 50 games this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very tough decision,'' Riggleman said. ``When you've
got a guy like Beck, it's a great temptation to turn it over to
him. I just felt Tap was still strong, he was at the top of his
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was one of those manager's decisions. The way I chose
didn't work out, and I feel terrible for Tap and the club that it
didn't. That's just the way I chose to go, and the results weren't
good.''
</P>
<P>
   In the top of the 10th, the Cubs ran themselves out of a
possible scoring situation.
</P>
<P>
   With runners on first and third and one out, the Cubs sent
Morandini from first base on a 3-2 count to pinch-hitter Jeff
Blauser. Winning pitcher Odalis Perez struck out Blauser and
Morandini was caught stealing to end the inning with Glenallen Hill
at third base.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were playing up for the double play, so I wanted to send
him (Morandini) to stay away from the double play,'' Riggleman
said. ``If we (Blauser) had made contact, we get a chance to score
the run there.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, after Mulholland walked Weiss, the Cubs misplayed the
bunt to set up Jones' heroics. Mulholland made four errors during
the regular season for an .810 fielding percentage. His career mark
is .902.
</P>
<P>
   The error forced the Cubs to face Jones. Had Mulholland made the
play and retired Graffanino, the Cubs might have walked Jones
intentionally and brought in Beck to face Andres Galarraga.
Instead, Jones put a happy ending on what had been a pitiful night
for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no idea how it stayed fair,'' Jones said. ``But the way
my night went, maybe it was a little justice. I've never had a guy
even during the regular season pitch me like that, not a
righthander. I struck out three times in a game, but that was
against Randy Johnson. I certainly didn't expect it tonight, but he
kept us off balance all night.
</P>
<P>
   ``He really dealt tonight, keeping us off stride like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta starter Tom Glavine gave up three hits, one run and
struck out eight batters in seven innings. And Glavine, who won 20
games this season and is a leading candidate for the National
League Cy Young Award, was absolutely out-pitched by Tapani.
</P>
<P>
   Now Glavine knows how the rest of the pitchers around the league
feel like most of the time when they face him.
</P>
<P>
   Tapani moved the ball in and out and had the Braves off balance
all night. Lopez, who has been one of the Braves' top postseason
hitters over the last four years, ruined Tapani's shutout with one
swing.
</P>
<P>
   In 37 career postseason games, Lopez has six home runs _ none
bigger than Thursday's.
</P>
<P>
   From nowhere, the Braves were able to first extend the game to
extra innings before Jones sent them to Chicago winners.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were facing sudden death,'' Atlanta manager Bobby Cox said.
``We were down to two outs, and the way the guy (Tapani) was
pitching, it didn't look good. We didn't hit any balls hard for
about four, five innings against him.
</P>
<P>
   ``But Javy's the type of guy who can do that. How many times do
you hit a home run in that situation? He (Tapani) was still
throwing great.''
</P>
<P>
   Glavine had a no-hitter through five innings. The middle four
hitters in the Chicago order _ Grace, Sammy Sosa, Hill and Gary
Gaetti _ were 0-for-7 with five strikeouts and had not managed to
put one ball out of the infield in their first two trips to the
plate.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom of the Cubs order broke up Glavine's no-hit bid in
the sixth and also gave Chicago its first chance of the night.
Morandini bounced a single to right to start the inning. Scott
Servais looped a single to right to put runners at first and
second.
</P>
<P>
   Tapani's bunt put two runners in scoring position, and the
Braves elected to play the infield back even though runs were
scarce this night. Lance Johnson's grounder to second baseman Keith
Lockhart scored Morandini with the first run of the game.
</P>
<P>
   That run held up until the ninth, when Tapani's 104th pitch of
the game landed in the left-field seats. One inning later, the Cubs
were facing elimination in a hurry this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``I threw him (Lopez) a fastball up and in,'' Tapani said. ``It
wasn't a bad pitch. I tip my cap to him rather than kick myself.''
</P>
<P>
   There will be enough other people kicking the Cubs after this
loss.

<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON _ Facing a 2-0 deficit in a five-game playoff series
with the New York Yankees isn't necessarily the end of the world _
or at least it wasn't in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Yankees pitcher David Cone remembered Friday how his team was up
2-0 on the Seattle Mariners in the teams' 1995 American League
division series and how the Mariners came back to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``Randy Johnson pitched Game 3,'' Cone said, ``and, in one game,
the momentum swung their way. We had our chances in Game 4, had a
lead, and they came back to win it. The next thing you know, you're
in a panic mode, where you're up 2-0 and, all of a sudden, you're
facing a fifth game, a sudden-death type situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for the Texas Rangers, who must deal with the same
predicament this weekend, there are several excellent reasons why
they should not take heart in what the Mariners accomplished three
years ago:
</P>
<P>
   The last three games of the 1995 series were in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   The 1998 Yankees won more games than any team in American League
history.
</P>
<P>
   Randy Johnson does not pitch in North Texas.
</P>
<P>
   So it is that the Rangers-Yankees division series resumes
tonight with the Rangers expected to fade away, more likely sooner
than later. With the Yankees having won both games at Yankee
Stadium, the Rangers must win tonight and Saturday in Arlington and
Sunday in New York. What are the odds?
</P>
<P>
   Against this backdrop, Rangers manager Johnny Oates said his
message to his team was to forget the big picture and focus on each
element of the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't get three hits in one at-bat,'' Oates said. ``With
that being said, hopefully we can continue to pitch the way we have
been pitching, and, from an offensive standpoint, each hitter can
take care of business. Be selective. Hopefully get something going
early. Win that first one and put more pressure back on the other
side.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers got two well-pitched games from Todd Stottlemyre and
Rick Helling in New York, but the bats marked ``Texas'' somehow
were re-routed to Toledo. Shut down by David Wells and Andy
Pettitte, the Rangers collected 10 hits, five in each game, and
scored one run.
</P>
<P>
   Oates is hoping that the return to Arlington, where the Rangers
hit particularly well this year, will be a factor in picking up his
team. He must also hope that they can deal with Cone, a 20-game
winner this season and a battle-tested postseason performer.
</P>
<P>
   Cone said pitching with a 2-0 series lead on the road is a
challenge because of the pivotal nature of the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a five-game series, the momentum can swing in the course of
one game,'' he said. ``They're back in their home park. They play
well here. That's my job, to not let them get any momentum going
their way.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers' starter, Aaron Sele, will be making his first
postseason appearance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got our work cut out for us,'' Oates said. ``We've hit
much better at home this year than we have on the road. I'm hoping
being at home is going to awaken the bats some and that Aaron, who
has pitched well here this year, can pitch well so we can maybe
actually use (closer) John Wetteland in the ninth inning.''

   John P.Lopez
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
ARLINGTON _ It is like an autumnal allergy, sweeping in with the
wind and blowing a hitter's mind. It is an inexplicable postseason
affliction that seems to come from out of nowhere, with no warning,
and wreaks havoc on heavy-hitting baseball greats.
</P>
<P>
   But this ragweed of the reflexes, this hayfever of the hickory,
cannot be defined. It is like the Killer B's pollen that sucked the
life out of Astros hopes a year ago and in Game 1 of the National
League Division Series. And it is spreading across Texas like a
disease.
</P>
<P>
   As today Houston celebrates the apparent return of the B's, in
Arlington they are preparing for the end of the season, which could
come tonight, Saturday or Sunday. But it will come.
</P>
<P>
   The autumnal allergy has struck again, causing the Texas Rangers
to cough and wheeze like no one in the game could have expected.
Astros fans hope Thursday's victory over the Padres means all is
well again; in Arlington they are sniffling and wiping tears from
their eyes as big sticks have gone silent and the chance to win one
game in this American League series looks bleak.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers, at least offensively, were the AL version of the
Astros this season. They swung mighty bats and struck fear in
opposing pitchers, setting team records for hits and runs. No one
in the AL had a better team batting average than the Rangers' .289.
No one had more hits (1,637) or total bases (2,618). Only Seattle
and Boston had better slugging percentages than Texas' .463. Only
the Yankees had more RBIs than the Rangers' 894.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers didn't have the catchy nicknames, pitching or gritty
late-game determination of the 1998 Astros, but they had the
offensive production. And when it came to Juan Gonzalez, Will Clark
and Ivan Rodriguez _ the Rangers' Killer Bats _ few compared.
Gonzalez could win the league's Most Valuable Player Award after
knocking in a whopping 157 runs in the regular season. Clark and
Pudge accounted for 44 homers and nearly 200 RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know we can hit,'' Clark said before the series. ``We just
have to take advantage of the situation.''
</P>
<P>
   But they haven't. Hit, that is. Or taken advantage of anything
but the stroll in the grass from the plate to the dugout.
</P>
<P>
   Thus the situation is out of control. Rangers skipper Johnny
Oates conceded after Wednesday's 3-1 loss to the Yankees that:
``Winning three out of five is tough. Winning three out of three is
tougher.''
</P>
<P>
   It seems impossible for the Rangers to win this series. It
belongs to the mighty Yankees, who went nearly five months this
season without losing as many three games in a row. No one could
believe the Rangers could take three games in three days from the
Bombers, especially looking back at how the first two games went.
</P>
<P>
   All the Rangers hope for is a cure for the affliction. Forget
andro and creatine. These guys need Benadryl.
</P>
<P>
   They need a hit or two. Or 10. Maybe a win tonight, when the
series resumes at the Ballpark in Arlington. Then, maybe another
win in Game 4 on Sunday, then hey, a team can dream, can't it?
</P>
<P>
   ``Our offense isn't clicking right now,'' Rangers outfielder
Roberto Kelly said after Wednesday's 3-1 loss.
</P>
<P>
   To say the least, it is not clicking. The only understatement
you might hear greater than that would be if President Clinton
announced, ``Things have been a tiny bit embarrassing lately.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers' bats are sick, batting a mere .156 with 19
strikeouts in two games. With Wednesday night's Rangers loss to
Andy Pettitte, who had as much to do with the allergic reaction to
cowhide as Yankees ace David Wells had one day before, the Rangers
have just 10 hits and one run in the series.
</P>
<P>
   Sick. Killer B's sick. Specifically, Gonzalez, Clark and
Rodriguez seem to carry the germ. The usually mighty Texas
threesome went 2-for-11 in Game 2, making them 3-for-23 in this
series.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're making pitches, keeping the ball down, making us
battle,'' Rodriguez said of the Yanks. ``We're trying to make
something happen, but it's just not there.''
</P>
<P>
   It's like a disease. It's like what happens every autumn to some
poor, unfortunate souls. Impossible to explain. Seemingly
impossible to cure.
</P>
<P>
   And more than anyone else, Gonzalez has been knocked down,
wheezing into October as much as he was screaming into April and
May. Gonzalez enters tonight's game a mere 1-for-8 in the series,
hitting just two balls out of the infield.
</P>
<P>
   How does one explain this, considering that against virtually
this same Yankees team in the 1996 playoffs, Gonzalez hit five
homers and had nine RBIs in 16 at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm trying too much for my team right now,'' Gonzalez said.
``Pitchers are throwing in great locations, in and out, for
strikes. They're throwing great. There's no chance for the hitters.
We've got to do something pretty soon.''
</P>
<P>
   Somebody get some Benadryl.

GALAXY TORCHES THE BURN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT FRENCH  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ Any lingering residue from the Galaxy's
stunning ouster in last year's Major League Soccer playoffs had
been washed away before the Dallas Burn got off its first shot
Thursday night. The opener of their Western Conference semifinal
series was over by the 20th minute, a rout by the 32nd and a
laugher by halftime.
</P>
<P>
   The Galaxy, its inability to find the Burn net a year ago still
smoldering in its memory, scored seemingly at will, racking up a
6-1 triumph _ and a 1-0 advantage in the best-of-three series _
before 10,047 at the Rose Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   L.A., continuing on the course it followed through a
record-setting regular season, netted an MLS playoff-record five
first-half goals _ none of them involving Cobi Jones _ to quickly
render all the pregame talk of defensive tactics moot and make a
statement that the Galaxy plans to still be around come MLS Cup
'98.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think any coach can envision a score like this one,''
Galaxy coach Octavio Zambrano said when it was done. ``What I
envision is our team getting to the final. We won't let the guys
think of this as the end of what we've done. And even more so
because of the result, we need to keep our feet on the ground. A
win like this can give you the wrong impression.''
</P>
<P>
   That would be that the Galaxy, MLS's top club throughout the
regular season, is vastly superior to the Burn, which L.A. will try
to sweep in Sunday's Game 2 at the Cotton Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Everything went right for L.A.: Danny Pena, who last scored more
than a year earlier, and Carlos Hermosillo had two goals apiece;
Mauricio Cienfuegos and Martin Machon both dished off three
assists; and, even better, captain Dan Calichman got 13{ minutes on
the field, his first action since suffering a broken leg May 6.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no way you can predict this, and no way it can happen
again,'' said defender Robin Fraser. ``It was one of those nights
everything went right. It's definitely not the norm.''
</P>
<P>
   Benefiting from an intensity the likes of which hasn't been seen
in months, L.A. tore apart the Burn, tying its defense into knots
with a scintillating possession game and taking advantage of the
spaces that opened up after Pena scored the first goal in the 10th
minute.
</P>
<P>
   ``They put us on our heels,'' said Burn coach Dave Dir. ``And
when we started to open up, every time (sweeper) Chad Deering would
step forward, they'd expose the space behind him. There were
players coming out of midfield all night.''
</P>
<P>
   Pena's first goal, a header off a Machon cross after a short
corner kick, and Hermosillo's first, in the 16th minute, made that
possible. The Burn had to surge forward after falling behind, so
the Galaxy was off and running, usually against minimal opposition,
throughout the first 45 minutes.

PROTESTERS PREPARE TO DISRUPT GRAY WHALE HUNT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAUL SHUKOVSKY and MIKE BARBER  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEAH BAY, WASH. _ On the eve of what could be the first Makah
whale hunt in more than 70 years, a militant animal-rights group
promised to stop the tribe's hunt any way it can.
</P>
<P>
   The group Sea Defense Alliance distanced itself from more
moderate opponents of the whale hunt by vowing to harass the Makah
on the open sea, despite a 500-yard buffer called for by the Coast
Guard.
</P>
<P>
   The 500-yard radius around the Makah's whaling canoe is intended
to prevent dangerous conflict between vessels in the rough, open
waters of the Pacific. Depending on the weather and other factors,
tribal leaders said yesterday that they may begin hunting as early
as Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``... We are prepared to go all the way with whatever we need to
do to stop the hunt,'' Sea Defense Alliance member Alison Frost
said. She said the group's two speedboats were prepared to put
themselves between whalers and whale to prevent a strike by harpoon
or a shot by the .50-caliber military rifle the tribe will use to
deliver a quick death blow.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Paul, one of the founders of the alliance, says the
group has about eight core members who dedicate themselves to
protecting marine ecosystems. ``We are willing to risk arrest in
order to stop the whaling,'' Paul said. ``... Even if we felt there
was a risk of the Makah shooting at us, it would not change our
position.''
</P>
<P>
   Such threats will not stop the Makah should they decide to take
to the sea this morning in their hand-hewn dugout canoe crafted
from a single old-growth cedar. They hope to return with a gray
whale that could easily weigh as much as 40 tons.
</P>
<P>
   Although the alliance and the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society
are maintaining surveillance on the Makah, the whalers Wednesday
were able to slip out unseen to the waters off Cape Alava, where
they came within a few feet of several great gray whales.
</P>
<P>
   Keith Johnson, the tribal whaling commission president,
described the experience of silently paddling off the wilderness
beaches as an exhilarating communion with Makah ancestors. ``Being
ready to go, the heightened anxiety, the tension of the threat of
Sea Shepherd rushing us with zodiacs (inflatable boats) _ then we
realized there wasn't anyone there, and we settled into paddling.
Once we settled in, we spotted the gray whale.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said the Makah crew members ``have no fear in staying
the course. Our guys are ready for whatever happens out there.
Being on the water, being in the canoe, seeing the gray whale,
approaching it _ it was awesome. We practiced with our ancestors.''
</P>
<P>
   Makah tribal member Wayne Johnson, a backup gunner on the hunt,
said Wednesday's trip was an opportunity to work on stealthy
approaches toward the massive marine mammals.
</P>
<P>
   Tribal leaders said the hunt was delayed Thurday because of
weather and a bureaucratic snag with the National Marine Fisheries
Service over guidelines concerning hunting only migratory whales
and not those that regularly feed in the area. Of the 23,000
eastern Pacific gray whales, a few spend most of their time in one
area rather than migrating with the rest of the population. ``Our
intent, and the tribe's intent, is to target migrating whales,''
said National Marine Fisheries Service spokesman Brian Gorman.
</P>
<P>
   But Gorman noted that the National Marine Fisheries Service
argued successfully in court last month ``that if a few residents
were taken, it would cause no undue stress to the population.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the Makah Thursday seemed amused as the media descended
on this remote town with reporters waving cellular phones, while
big trucks with telescopic antennae assembled near the harbor.
</P>
<P>
   The feel was that of the start of a boat race, with everyone
jockeying for the starting line. Many of the 65 reporters and
photographers in attendance vied for the coveted 20 places on a
media chase boat that will be allowed closer access to witness the
hunt. Journalists came from Japan, Germany, Norway, Belgium,
France, Canada and dozens of media outlets around the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   While the Makah's training dugout remained tied to the dock, the
cameras aimed outward toward the Sea Shepherd Conservation
Society's big blue flagship, the Sea Shepherd, painted with murals
of sea life and whales, anchored just beyond a breakwater.
</P>
<P>
   Capt. Paul Watson said the ship will remain anchored while the
smaller Sirenia, a 95-foot former Coast Guard drug-interdiction
cutter painted an intimidating black, will patrol the area with
other boats, Watson said. It can hit a top speed of more than 20
knots, and carries two smaller boats and a crew of 12, he said.
</P>
<P>
   During the morning hours, after it was announced that there
would be no hunt Thursday, Watson brazenly skippered the Sirenia
into the heart of the Makah's marina and held an impromptu news
conference.
</P>
<P>
   But Makah police, under orders from the tribal council, declared
the marina off-limits to protesting vessels. Several that had been
ferrying media members to the Sea Shepherd were told to leave.
</P>
<P>
   Watson says he respects native rights, but believes the Makah
are dupes for nations such as Japan that are conducting illegal
commercial whaling hunts outside international agreements. The
Makah, he says, are being watched by other native indigenous people
who want a precedent to enter commercial whaling.
</P>
<P>
   The Sea Shepherd also carries the Mirage, a small Norwegian
submarine painted like an Orca, which Watson's crew has nicknamed
Robo-Orca. The sub will be used to blast orca noises, another gray
whale predator, in hopes of scaring away gray whales. Watson said
he alone will skipper the submarine to lay down an ``acoustical
curtain'' to warn whales away from the killing zone.
</P>
<P>
   Watson said the patrols will continue for several days, although
plans may change if the hunt is further delayed. In Port Angeles,
he loaded up on goods at a Safeway store, including among his stock
of provisions cases of watermelons and soft drinks.
</P>
<P>
   The Makah, meanwhile, said they don't mind the attention,
believing they have nothing to hide or to be ashamed of, and would
conduct the hunt regardless.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first whale is so important to us,'' Keith Johnson, the
tribal whaling commission president, said Thursday. The Makah's
identity is imprinted since childhood with whaling, and the
parallels between antique photographs of the last whale being
butchered nearly 80 years ago and the prospect of a similar scene
happening soon before video cameras is spiritually emotional, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully it will happen in a way that is respectful to our
people and culture,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said the tribe is concerned about violence from the more
radical groups. He said he trusts that Sea Shepherd skipper Watson,
``who has been good to his word so far,'' will live up to announced
intentions to do nothing to harm the young Makah men who make up
the whaling crew.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once we get a harpoon in a whale, what are they going to do?''
Johnson asked rhetorically. Cutting the rope would leave an injured
whale to suffer.
</P>
<P>
   ``They would need to stop the first harpoon,'' he said.

NEW REPORT ON ELECTRIC FIELDS DRAWS CRITICISM, SOME SUPPORT 
</HEADLINE>
   By CARL T. HALL  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Mixed reviews greeted a federal task force here
Thursday after the panel raised new concerns about the possible
cancer-causing effects of everyday encounters with electromagnetic
fields.
</P>
<P>
   Some public-health experts questioned the objectivity of the
task force, sponsored by the National Institute of Environmental
Health Sciences.
</P>
<P>
   About 50 people turned out for a public hearing on the volatile
issue of whether living and working around power lines, computers
and communications equipment may be contributing to such diseases
as childhood leukemia and breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
   The hearing in downtown San Francisco follows the release of a
report by the government-sponsored task force that differed sharply
from the key conclusion of a 1997 National Academy of Sciences
report.
</P>
<P>
   After an extensive review of the scientific literature, the 1997
study found minimal evidence of any health risks due to so-called
extremely low-frequency electromagnetic fields.
</P>
<P>
   But the majority of members on the new task force, after looking
back over essentially the same data, concluded that those same
invisible energy fields _ as common as toasters and cell phones _
should be considered ``possibly carcinogenic to humans.''
</P>
<P>
   Some experts, including those who testified during Thursday's
hearing, and several interviewed separately, insisted that the 1997
report was closer to the mark.
</P>
<P>
   J.D. Jackson, a researcher at the Lawrence Berkeley National
Laboratory, was one of several experts who said that some of his
peers may be trying to fan public worry about electromagnetic field
(EMF) hazards in part because that would justify juicier research
grants.
</P>
<P>
   Patricia Buffler, dean emeritus of the School of Public Health
at the University of California at Berkeley, said there are
``unresolved questions'' about the risks of exposure, particularly
in terms of childhood leukemia.
</P>
<P>
   But she insisted that the task force is taking the wrong
approach by reanalyzing what has already been done.
</P>
<P>
   ``This dubious process does not help at all,'' she said, adding
that the important answers depend on the outcome of major studies
under way. ``It serves to alarm the public.''
</P>
<P>
   But public-health advocates testifying during Thursday's hearing
said a heightened sense of urgency is just what is needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``What needs to be considered is the human costs,'' said Howard
Egeman, a local safety officer for the American Federation of
Government Employees, who likened the hidden dangers of EMF to
those of asbestos.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very concerned about this _ and very worried,'' said
Patricia Carey of San Francisco,
</P>
<P>
   She said she suspects her 45-year-old daughter is suffering the
ill effects of spending too much time near a high-powered antenna.
But Carey conceded that her daughter, who also smokes, doesn't
agree.
</P>
<P>
   ``She just thinks she's working too hard,'' Carey said.  &LR;

TEEN MALES WHO SMOKE RISK SPERM DAMAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   By CARL T. HALL  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Teenage males who smoke cigarettes appear to be risking sperm
damage that can cause genetic abnormalities in their children,
researchers said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   A small but intensive new study of sperm samples taken from
18-year-olds found disturbing links between a ``smoking lifestyle''
and potential birth defects.
</P>
<P>
   The research was done at the Lawrence Livermore National
Laboratory in Livermore, Calif., on samples taken in the Czech
Republic, all from young men living in the same region who had just
registered for military service.
</P>
<P>
   The work is a preliminary part of a much larger study of
environmental hazards and male reproductive health. Researchers
wanted to find out what role smoking might play as a cause of
health problems that otherwise might be linked to air pollution.
</P>
<P>
   Although the smoking portion of the study enrolled only 25 young
men for detailed analysis, the results were enough to trigger new
warnings about the potential hazards of cigarettes, especially
among young men who also drink alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   Significant evidence of chromosomal damage was found in the
teens who smoked compared with those who did not. All of the
smokers consumed at least two packs of cigarettes a day, and also
drank alcohol regularly.
</P>
<P>
   The cellular damage included abnormal duplicates of certain
chromosomes that children inherit from their fathers. Such defects
have been associated with mental deficits and shorter life spans in
some offspring, researchers said. If similar changes occur in other
chromosomes that the scientists are still examining, there can be
very severe consequences, including Down syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   The odds of this happening as a direct result of smoking have
not been determined, and in any case appear to be very small.
Still, smokers of reproductive age appear to be running a
significantly higher risk that their cigarette habits may have
results that may extend to future generations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one more thing that looks like smoking may be
impacting,'' said Sally Perreault, a researcher at the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency, which also participated in the
study.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've known all along about the risk to smokers of lung cancer
and other respiratory diseases. Now there's also a possibility that
you can be transmitting a genetic change to your offspring,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   The research was published Thursday in the medical journal
Fertility and Sterility.
</P>
<P>
   The samples were taken to Livermore for the detailed analysis
mainly because scientists there have developed new techniques for
microscopic examination of individual sperm cells.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took a year to do this work,'' said lead scientist Andrew
Wyrobeck, noting that roughly 10,000 cells from each of the 25
samples had to be examined one at a time.
</P>
<P>
   By looking at men from a single district in the same country,
all of exactly the same age, the researchers tried to focus on
lifestyle as a health hazard.
</P>
<P>
   ``The interesting thing about this study is it's one of the
first where we were able to eliminate a lot of variation that might
come about from different occupations, environmental exposures and
different ages of the subjects,'' Wyrobeck said.
</P>
<P>
   However, the researchers also found smokers also reported higher
consumption of alcohol and coffee, poorer nutrition and more use of
illicit drugs than did their nonsmoking counterparts. The EPA's
Perreault said that smoking may itself be a risk factor for the
other lifestyle choices.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the smokers were relatively heavy drinkers,'' she said.
``It may have to do with lifestyle of men who go to pubs a lot,
whereas the nonsmokers tend to stay away.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After terrorist bombs exploded at two U.S.
embassies in east Africa, killing more than 250 people late this
summer, they set off demands for tighter security at American
outposts around the world and something else, as well.
</P>
<P>
   The tragedy is raising questions about how American diplomacy
should be conducted in the age of faxes, e-mail and 24-hour news
broadcasts. Some experts are asking if the United States still
needs highly visible and vulnerable embassies in almost every
nation, regardless of size or influence.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the world's only superpower, the U.S. needs to have a
presence in every country, but that does not mean having
full-fledged, costly embassies everywhere,'' said John Schall, a
senior associate at the Henry L. Stimson Center in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The research center, with a steering committee that includes
several former cabinet officers and former Georgia Sen. Sam Nunn,
is one of two groups expected to unveil proposals this fall on how
American diplomacy could jump from an embassy system rooted in the
horse-and-carriage era into the 21st-century of instant
communications.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will have recommendations on what we call 'right-sizing'
embassy staffs'' and much greater use of communications technology,
said Schall.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, any attempt at a major overhaul is likely to meet
with resistance at the State Department, where the policy of having
an accredited embassy in every nation has long been treated as
sacrosanct when it comes to promoting U.S. interests abroad. In
addition, agency officials argue that it is not the
brick-and-mortar structure that is the true terrorist target, but
American ``ideals.''
</P>
<P>
   However, the deadly Aug. 7 bombings of the embassies in Nigeria
and Tanzania suggest that changes could be crucial, Schall said.
``The question is not only, 'Is the building sufficiently secure?',
but secondly -- and Washington hasn't begun to grapple with this
yet -- 'Maybe we had too many people as a big target?'''
</P>
<P>
   The United States now operates embassies in 162 countries in
addition to about 100 consulate and other smaller overseas
missions, for a cost of more than $2 billion a year. Rebuilding the
demolished embassies and reinforcing security for others is
expected to add $1.8 billion more in the coming year.
</P>
<P>
   Generally, an embassy requires at least one building, a
contingent of U.S. Marine Corps guards, and a staff of up to
several hundred Americans, usually including intelligence agents
working either tacitly in the open or undercover. That's in
addition to support staff, drivers, a motor pool, and a doctor or
nurse.
</P>
<P>
   The overseas presence has hardly been reduced in the past
decade, despite the end of the Cold War and its ideological
struggle against communism that once extended to the remote corners
of the globe.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the Cold War we had to make a statement about who we were
so that we could win hearts and minds'' and the votes of every
possible nation in the United Nations, said Charles A. Schmitz, a
retired State Department diplomat. That meant providing Peace Corps
volunteers, scholarships to U.S. colleges, as well as aid and
advice on issues ranging from currency to education, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Now an international business consultant and president of Global
Access Institute, Schmitz is among 63 experts who are developing a
blueprint for ``diplomacy in the information age'' to be issued
soon by the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a
private Washington research group.
</P>
<P>
   Embassies are ``bloated with functions and personnel'' and still
relying on out-moded cables for official communications instead of
computer e-mail, according to Schmitz. He said that the United
States has resisted new information technology that could reduce
overseas postings.
</P>
<P>
   Budget cuts have, in fact, forced the State Department to cut
its overseas personnel by more than 2,500 over the past decade. But
the total number of U.S. personnel abroad has remained static
because domestic U.S. agencies have simultaneously increased their
overseas postings -- by 25 percent between 1988-1998.
</P>
<P>
   Law-enforcement agents from the FBI and the Drug Enforcement
Agency are increasingly going abroad to investigate crime and
terrorism. The Agriculture Department is sending more workers
abroad to push credit sales of U.S. farm products, and Commerce
Department officials assist U.S. business interests overseas.
</P>
<P>
   In most cases, these disparate functions are housed at the U.S.
embassies, such as the one in Mexico City, which has so many U.S.
agencies that it is now a microcosm of the U.S. government.
</P>
<P>
   Schall defended some of the expansion abroad as necessary, but
added, ``Certainly a portion of this is some agencies ...
turf-grabbing. There's some over-staffing, no question about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the ideas that reformers say would improve the efficiency,
and perhaps the safety, for U.S. diplomats:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Regional hub'' embassies that could serve several countries.
The United States has experimented with that idea in Barbados,
where the ambassador has responsibility for seven nearby Caribbean
countries. Also, the British have ambassadors accredited to four
countries apiece in Africa. ``These could serve as models for a
U.S. diplomatic reorganization in other regions beyond the
Caribbean,'' said Benjamin F. Nelson of the U.S. General Accounting
Office, the investigating arm of Congress, in a report last year.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  A gradual shift from full-service embassies to much smaller
and less visible missions for many developing countries, including
several in Africa. ``By having a building and making it a big
symbol of ourselves with the flag and Marines, we're creating a
hostage for terrorists,'' Schmitz said.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Use of the latest communications technology to gather much of
the information that was once done by embassy staff.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. diplomats ``have only just scratched the surface of what
the information revolution makes possible,'' Schmitz said. The U.S.
government could hire private services to track developments in
smaller countries, rather than posting a highly paid foreign
service officer in an embassy to gather marginal information and
relay it to Washington.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  A new mobile diplomatic team that could be sent to reinforce
small missions in times of emergency. That approach would mirror
the rapid deployment forces used by the U.S. military, Schall said.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Scaling back big embassy staffs such as those in London and
Paris, now that the Cold War has ended some of the demand for
intelligence-gathering.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Leaving non-essential functions to private enterprise. For
example, the United States Information Agency and other government
news operations were part of the Cold War effort to ``sell'' the
American way of life. Now citizens of countries around the world
are buying Hollywood's movies and music, adopting American clothing
styles and tuning into American television programs and CNN's
international newscasts.
</P>
<P>
   Those studying such changes acknowledged that it would take a
major effort to enact them over the next decade.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, in an interview last week(CQ), Assistant Secretary of
State Patrick F. Kennedy rejected most of the ideas being examined,
starting with suggestions for reducing the overseas presence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not see that the State Department staff could be any
smaller than it is right now,'' said Kennedy, who oversees embassy
properties and security. ``These other agencies (with overseas
officials) have a mission which promotes U.S. national interests''
such as trade assistance for businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, he said that the end of the Cold War meant adding more
embassies, 14 new ones for the countries that were in the old
Soviet empire. As for the suggestion that a lower profile for U.S.
outposts would be a reduced target for terrorists, Kennedy said,
``That's a ludicrous concept to say that size has anything to do
with it. Terrorists attack our ideals, and they will attack us
wherever we are.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy readily acknowledged that his department was
technologically backward, however. ``Over half of our computer
systems, our telephone systems, and our overseas radio systems are
antiquated,'' he said, adding that they would be updated as soon as
funding permitted.
</P>
<P>
   As a measure of this backwardness, when Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright visited Moscow last year, she participated in an
interactive conversation with students on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Technology is bringing us closer together,'' she wrote on the
computer screen, according to a news release. ``This will make us
all wiser, quicker to understand each other, and better able to
work together on the world's problems.''
</P>
<P>
   The irony was that she was typing her message on computers that
belonged to the U.S. Information Agency because the State
Department's Moscow embassy had no link to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Updating the information systems as well as other updates for
U.S. diplomacy could be slow coming. ``You're dealing with a
culture,'' said Schall, whose Stimson Center study will be released
before the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough,'' he said. ``The State Department needs to come
into the 21st century, and it's still in the 19th.''

<P>
   MOSCOW _ One of America's newest embassy buildings has been
three decades in the making and tens of millions of dollars
over-budget.
</P>
<P>
   But don't blame simple government inefficiency, at least not
entirely.
</P>
<P>
   The main culprit was Cold War spying.
</P>
<P>
   The 10-story chancery building rising above the U.S. embassy
complex in downtown Moscow is cloaked in white tarpaulins to mask
the work inside from prying eyes.
</P>
<P>
   The tarps also are a reminder of one of the biggest blunders in
the history of international espionage.
</P>
<P>
   Begun in 1979 using Soviet workers and materials, construction
of the building proceeded apace until 1985. As the work was winding
down, mortified U.S. officials discovered the entire structure had
been laced with microscopic listening devices -- thousands of them.
</P>
<P>
   The red brick building was dubbed ``The Great Transmitter'' and
remained empty until work resumed several years ago with a target
completion date of late 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The reconstruction uses materials and construction workers are
imported from America and carefully screened by U.S. security.
Construction workers are not allowed to talk about their work or
even acknowledge the reason they are in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Workers have lopped off the top two floors of what was an
eight-story building and are rebuilding four new floors on top.
They were unable to extract all the bugs from the lower floors, but
stripped much of what they could.
</P>
<P>
   The building, originally projected in 1979 to cost $72 million,
will cost U.S. taxpayers $240 million or more. An early proposal to
raze the building and start over was rejected as too costly.
</P>
<P>
   The roughly 300 construction workers are housed in temporary
shelters on the site. It is not open to tours for the press or
public. Most embassy employees have never been inside either.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is unique for a working embassy. We have a construction
site in the middle of our complex that we can say very little
about,'' said embassy spokesman Michael Hurley.
</P>
<P>
   One reason for the secrecy is to mask the components of a
building that will house America's spies. The Cold War may be over
but their work goes on.
</P>
<P>
   The new upper floors will be occupied by embassy staff
conducting classified business -- presumably the CIA, defense and
political analysts and the ambassador and other diplomats. The
lower six levels, which still may have listening devices embedded
in the concrete foundations, will be used by staff conducting
non-sensitive work.
</P>
<P>
   The delay had one positive effect. The new building will include
modern anti-terrorism security features -- including reinforced
walls, doors and windows -- that did not exist when it was
conceived.
</P>
<P>
   It also will have air-conditioning, which the current main
building at the complex does not. The original brick will be
replaced with a white limestone and glass facade.
</P>
<P>
   The embassy compound covers a city block near the Russian White
House and includes offices, living quarters for some diplomats and
their families and facilities for expatriate Americans, including a
day-care center, school and swimming pool.

   Breast irregularities send the author, not yet 40, for her first
mammogram. In the waiting room she finds the peculiar intimacy and
comraderie of women facing the same fears. ``In a week, or a month,
we won't recognize each other on the street. But today, in this
place, there is a truth we both know: We are all in this

 By JACQUELINE RUBENSTEIN  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    I am sitting in a room with at least 18 other women, all of us
in standard-issue gowns. We are of varying ages, ethnicity, and
economic standing. We are in varying states of dismay, fear and
apprehension. We are here because of our breasts.
 &HT;    This is my first mammogram. Some irregularities noted while
nursing my baby have prompted my visit, making me, nearing 40, one
of the youngest women in the room. Soon, another woman who looks
about my age comes in and sits next to me, acknowledging me with
worried eyes _ only a problem would have brought us here before the
recommended time.
 &HT;    All of us here have our stories _ if not our body's own, than
that of a close friend, sister, mother, aunt, cousin, friend of
friend, mother of friend. Someone who has found a lump or been told
of a spot, and who has had to enter the world we all now fear to do
battle, endure, survive _ or not. Regardless of our ages or reasons
for being here, it is impossible not to be nervous.
 &HT;    We sit, for the most part, silently, thumbing distractedly
through magazines, watching the parade of womanhood pass in and out
of the various rooms. One group of older women has clearly come
together, strength in numbers. They have brought their knitting and
sit companionably around a table, chatting and counting stitches,
losing track as one or the other of them is brought in for an exam
or consultation.
 &HT;    As we take our turns at the machine (this will only hurt for a
second, dear, a bit of pressure is all) and come back to wait for
our results, we note who goes in before and after us _ each of us
tracking our potential for bad news by the order and flow of our
companions. As name after name is called, the woman next to me and
I exchange glances more frequently, certain at last that many who
were examined after us have been given leave to go.
 &HT;    ``This is how my mother found out,'' she confides, finally.
``Everyone else was coming and going, but they needed to take more
time with her.''
 &HT;    ``Maybe our charts are just in a pile that hasn't been picked up
yet,''I offer inanely, trying to stem the panic that is rising in
us both.
 &HT;    We are silent again, and I pull my robe closer around me,
feeling the protrusions that have brought me here. They have marked
other stages of my life _ their small size the bane of my
adolescence, their sudden growth the first sign of my pregnancy,
their ability to produce nourishment for my baby an endless wonder.
 &HT;    Finally, I am called in and receive good news _ the
irregularities are nothing more than that, unremarkable changes
that can occur with pregnancy and nursing. I come out with a smile
and am greeted with a thumbs-up from my acquaintance.
 &HT;    ``Walk right on out of here,'' she says. ``Don't stop.''
 &HT;    I start to follow her advice but find I cannot leave without
her. We have not even exchanged names, and, if her news is bad, she
may not want or find comfort in a stranger's presence. But still I
linger in the dressing room, making small adjustments, peeking into
the waiting room, until I see her being summoned. When she comes
out, her face is awash in relief _ her mother's fate not yet, if
ever, her own.
 &HT;    She is at first surprised to find me waiting for her, but then
we self-consciously laugh and grasp hands tightly in understanding.
In a week, or a month, we won't recognize each other on the street.
But today, in this place, there is a truth we both know: We are all
in this together.

 By MARIA ZATE  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    While channel surfing on a Sunday night, a familiar face pops up
on the TV screen. It's Giselle Fernandez, former anchor of ``NBC
Nightly News'' and currently anchor of the entertainment show
``Access Hollywood.''
 &HT;    She greets an enthusiastic crowd with the usual pleasantries,
and then slips the phrase ``muy caliente'' into her monologue. She
continues to speak in English and then drops another Spanish word.
She introduces her guest, actress Maria Conchita Alonso.
 &HT;    You check the channel. This isn't ``Access Hollywood.'' The show
is ``Cafe Ole with Giselle Fernandez'' and it's on Galavision, a
Spanish-language cable network.
 &HT;    But she's speaking English. Wait a minute, what's going on here?
 &HT;    Welcome to bilingual television. English-language format and
content are gaining a foothold in a market once occupied solely by
Spanish media. From TV programming to magazines and radio,
bilingual and English-language media continue to grow as a way to
reach the Hispanic market.
 &HT;    Consider recent news items: Emilio Estefan plans to produce a
Latin-themed, English-language TV program for Universal Television
Group.
 &HT;    Latina magazine, a national bilingual women's magazine backed by
the publishers of Essence, switches from quarterly to monthly
distribution.
 &HT;    The Los Angeles Times announces plans to capture more Hispanic
readers, perhaps through a special Hispanic section in English.
 &HT;    In radio, several stations in the top 10 media markets use a
bilingual format with ratings success.
 &HT;    Why this growth in English and bilingual media?
 &HT;    ``It's the next logical step of the evolution of the Latino
population in the U.S.,'' says Alex Nogales, president of the
National Hispanic Media Coalition in Los Angeles.
 &HT;    As immigration laws tighten, and as the second- and
third-generation population increases, marketers and programmers
will focus on capturing the attention of the assimilated and
acculturated Hispanics, he explains.
 &HT;    In fact, the impetus behind Galavision's decision to air
bilingual programming lies in the success of another show that
celebrates assimilation and acculturation. Last year Galavision
began running a weekly half-hour bilingual show called ``Que Pasa
U.S.A.,'' a situation comedy that first aired on PBS in Miami back
in the '70s. The show represents a microcosm of what's happening in
the Hispanic media landscape.
 &HT;    ``Que Pasa U.S.A.'' features a Cuban family, with members from
three generations living under one roof.
 &HT;    ``It's about their experience in trying to retain their culture
and also to assimilate,'' says Michelle Bella, director of
marketing and communications for New York-based Galavision, the
cable network of Univision Communications Inc. in Miami. Galavision
reports that it reaches 7.5 million homes in the United States.
 &HT;    When Galavision first started airing ``Que Pasa U.S.A.,'' the
Nielsen ratings showed that it connected with viewers. This alerted
network executives to try more bilingual programming.
 &HT;    ``Until now, the English-dominant and bilingual crowd has
largely been ignored on TV,'' says producer Jeff Valdez, who along
with partner Bruce Barshop co-manage Si TV, the company that
produces ``Cafe Ole.'' Based in Culver City, Calif., Si TV produces
English-dominant and bilingual programming with Latino appeal.
 &HT;    According to the latest census information on language use at
home, assimilated Hispanics represent about 54 percent of the
Hispanic market. Data from 1990 show that 46 percent of Hispanics
speak Spanish and also speak English ``very well.'' Another 8
percent speak no Spanish. There are 26 percent who speak
predominantly Spanish and don't speak English well or not at all.
The remaining 20 percent say they speak both Spanish and English
``well.''
 &HT;    ``So far, (Hispanic) programming has pulled only from the
Spanish-dominant side,'' Valdez says. The new Galavision fare
creates ``a more competitive programming environment,'' he
believes.
 &HT;    But programming goes beyond language, emphasizes Barshop at Si
TV.
 &HT;    ``It's not just about language. It's also about programming
produced in the U.S.,'' he says. ``Most Spanish-language programs
come from South America and Mexico. Si TV is about recognizing the
cultural difference.''
 &HT;    Coverage of Hispanic culture in English has proven successful
for publishers, as exemplified by the bilingual women's magazine
Latina in New York. Latina publisher Christy Haubegger says she
chose a bilingual format to reflect the assimilated Latina in the
United States. No other magazine addressed the market in this way,
she says.
 &HT;    ``As a second generation Mexican-American who is bilingual,
reading in Spanish is very difficult,'' she says. ``And the
magazines published in Latin America don't relate to my life here
in the U.S.''
 &HT;    Thousands of women appear to share Ms. Haubegger's perceptions.
Latina debuted in May 1996 as a quarterly and this year changed to
monthly distribution. The magazine reports an unaudited circulation
of 300,000. According to Ms. Haubegger, Latina has attracted
high-end advertisers that previously had never placed ads in
Hispanic media.
 &HT;    ``We are the only Hispanic advertising that Ralph Lauren has
ever done, and that the Gap and Tommy Hilfiger has ever done,'' she
says.
 &HT;    Latina illustrates the growing support among advertisers for
English-language Hispanic media. However, many Hispanic advertising
agencies feel threatened by the use of English in the Hispanic
market. But the agencies created this problem in the first place,
says Nogales at the National Hispanic Media Coalition.
 &HT;    ``For years these agencies have been telling advertisers that
they will deliver the Latino market. And they've been telling
clients the only way to do it is to reach them in Spanish,'' he
says. ``They decided to put everything into the Spanish-speaking
game and now they're reaping what they sowed. These agencies are
going the way of the dinosaurs.''
 &HT;    The advertiser's message, including its language, must fit the
target audience.
 &HT;    Levi's, the San Francisco-based clothing manufacturer, launched
its first bilingual ads this summer for its jeans. Created by
Bromley, Aguilar &AMP; Associates in San Antonio, the ads, which ran on
Univision and Telemundo in Los Angeles and Houston, feature young
Hispanics who speak mostly Spanish with some English.
 &HT;    Michelle Vasquez, marketing manager at Levi's, says research
showed bilingual ads were the best way to reach the product's
target market _ young males ages 15 to 25.
 &HT;    ``We looked at the census data and found that 74 percent of this
group are bilingual,'' she says.
 &HT;    Despite an increase in English media that targets Hispanics,
Spanish-language advertising will continue to keep growing, says
Alejandro Ruelas, director of ethnic marketing at Anheuser-Busch in
St. Louis.
 &HT;    ``I think the political climate and the anti-Hispanic
initiatives out there will instill more pride in our people and
ultimately bring us back to our language,'' he says. ``There's the
growth of retro acculturation where a lot of Hispanics are making
an active effort to learn Spanish and consume Spanish-language
media. The Spanish language is here for the long haul and it will
continue to grow by leaps and bounds.''
 &HT;    So far, broadcast heavyweights Univision and Telemundo don't
perceive a threat on the language front. In fact, Univision
recently asked McDonald's to re-edit its latest TV commercial
``English Lessons'' for the air. The spot contained too much
English dialogue.
 &HT;    Univision accepts only all-Spanish advertising, says a company
spokeswoman in Los Angeles.
 &HT;    ``Our success comes from ads and programs being 100 percent
Spanish. Our viewers keep coming back because they are most
comfortable with that programming,'' she says.
 &HT;    At least one man is confident that Hispanics welcome culturally
relevant English media.
 &HT;    ``I've been getting (negative) comments about the viability of
targeting this market since the beginning,'' says Valdez at Si TV.
 &HT;    ``I say to those people, `Laugh all you want to now, but the
times, they are a-changing.'''

 c.1998 Hispanic magazine  
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   On Sept. 16, 1997, a group of Republicans met in a conference
room at the Marriott Hotel in downtown Washington, D.C., to launch
the party's latest program to enlist minorities. The meeting ended
on an upbeat note, but it had started with a lot of soul-searching
and apologies.
</P>
<P>
   The sense was that Republicans were running out of chances with
Latino voters. This time they vowed they would get it right.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the hosts _ Republican National Committee chair Jim
Nicholson and co-chair Patricia Harrison _ the attendees included
House Speaker Newt Gingrich, Sen. Ben Knighthorse Campbell
(R-Colo.), Rep. Henry Bonilla (R-Texas), Rep. J. C. Watts (R-Okla.)
and some prominent minority Republicans who had been enlisted to
lead the new charge.
</P>
<P>
   It had been almost a year since the Republicans had received one
of their worst thrashings from the Democrats in the presidential
elections. The Latino vote had flexed its muscle in almost total
repudiation of the Republican presidential candidate and platform.
</P>
<P>
   Months later some Latino communities still rankled with
anti-Republican sentiment. Warning signs flashed all over the
Republican domain.
</P>
<P>
   An unsolicited report prepared by Republican pollster Frank Lunt
stated, ``Our majority is at stake. Republicans barely maintained
their congressional majority in 1996, and a major reason their
support dropped from 1994 was the utter collapse of the Hispanic
vote.''
</P>
<P>
   The report concluded, ``The Hispanic vote is up for grabs, and
it is up to individual Republican candidates to say in plain
English and prove by their actions that they deserve it.''
</P>
<P>
   Party strategist Stu Spencer, in a memo to California GOP
leaders, warned that they would be committing ``political suicide''
if they continued to alienate Hispanics instead of courting what
many party philosophers contend are natural allies.
</P>
<P>
   Citing Hispanic disenchantment, Spencer added, ``The trend is
obvious, and the political danger is real. We are dramatically
losing market share of the fastest growing segment of the
electorate.''
</P>
<P>
   The RNC is concerned about its political standing with Hispanics
but not necessarily impressed with the Luntz and Spencer
appraisals, which an RNC spokesperson considered exaggerated and
overly alarmist.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, if such ominous warnings sound like Chicken Little
to some, the party leaders now seem to accept that the sky could
fall on them if they don't move more decisively and intelligently
to rebuild their minority constituency, particularly Hispanics, to
the heights of the Nixon and Reagan years.
</P>
<P>
   Banking on a new vehicle to attract minorities to the party, the
GOP unveiled the New Majority Council at the September meeting. It
sounds and looks a bit like Jesse Jackson's Rainbow Coalition,
encompassing Hispanics, African Americans, Asian Americans and
Native Americans in a collegial effort with the emphasis on the
word ``majority,'' which the Republicans say foretells the future
status of the ethnic electorate.
</P>
<P>
   On the Hispanic side, statistics tell it better. Today's U.S.
population is 72.5 percent non-Hispanic white and 27.5 percent
minority, with Hispanics making up 11 percent. According to the
U.S. Census, within 50 years the adult population will transform
into 52.8 percent non-Hispanic white and 47.2 percent minority,
with Hispanics making up 24.5 percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
   RNC co-chair Harrison says, ``We have to stop minority thinking
because we are now talking about a new majority. It's up to us to
move toward people we want at the table and not up to the people to
find the table.''
</P>
<P>
   She credits the late Lee Atwater, the former RNC chairman and
premier political swami, as the originator of this idea. Atwater
was developing what he called the ``big tent'' for the Republicans
at the time of his death, and Harrison says she is just building on
this concept.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the NMC will achieve its goal is another matter. The
council's message of ``heritage, hope and opportunity'' is not
exactly revolutionary, and it relies on the GOP's basic planks of
family values, quality education, crimefighting, entrepreneurship
and less government.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bonilla, who is emerging as the Republicans' Latino star,
says Latinos, by virtue of their culture and values, are ready-made
Republicans, but the party has been slow to mine this bountiful
lode of voters. He credits his own success to dogged community
outreach.
</P>
<P>
   Bonilla is a three-term Republican congressman from an area long
known as a Democratic power base. He was the first Latino
Republican congressman elected from Texas, and he has won each
contest with 60 percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   Bonilla attributes his success to delivering the right message _
the Republican message, not a specially crafted Hispanic one _
personally to his constituents and listening to their concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to show up at these communities as I do,'' he says.
``I try to get this across to our people, but it's the hardest
thing to make them understand that it's not hard to do and that we
don't have to change our message or our values.''
</P>
<P>
   To start making inroads with Hispanics, the GOP must overcome a
notoriously bad reputation of late for antagonizing Hispanics. The
Republicans are also known for constantly shooting themselves in
the foot on Latino sensitivities.
</P>
<P>
   The Pete Wilsons and Bob Dornans of the party don't help.
Neither do the issues of immigration, affirmative action and
English-only, all attributed to Republican politics.
</P>
<P>
   In the last presidential campaign, the Republican candidate, Bob
Dole, practically ignored the Hispanic constituency. Latinos
responded in kind by helping Clinton clobber him, delivering 72
percent of the Latino vote to the president. Hispanics nationwide
voted 21 percent for Dole, the lowest support among Hispanics for
any presidential candidate in the past 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic congressional candidates also got 72 percent of the
Hispanic vote.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans contend that the Dole shellacking was an aberration.
They insist that better measures of Republican-Latino affinity are
Richard Nixon, the first candidate to seriously court the Latino
vote, and the Great Communicator, Ronald Reagan, still a hero to
many Latinos. Both won the Hispanic vote by large margins,
generating the largest Latino turnouts in a presidential election
up to now.
</P>
<P>
   Republican strategists point out that Latinos will respond to
the right message and messenger. They cite mayoral races in two
cities with large Hispanic populations.
</P>
<P>
   New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani received 40 percent of the
Hispanic vote, and Richard Riordan of Los Angeles got 48 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, who is building a
large Hispanic following that supporters are confident will
mushroom into a national constituency if he decides to run for
president.
</P>
<P>
   If Democrats have dominated the Latino constituency, it is
largely because they are better _ a lot better _ at exploiting the
issues and playing to Latino emotions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Latinos have no problem with voting Republican,'' says Arturo
Vargas, executive director of the National Association of Latino
Elected Officials Educational Fund, which counts 5,400 members.
``They have shown it in the past, like in l984, when they gave
Reagan over 40 percent of their vote. It means the Republican Party
has the potential to attract Latinos. The Republicans have to
examine what has succeeded and what has driven Latinos away.''
</P>
<P>
   Antonio Gonzalez, president of the Willie C. Velasquez
Institute, suggests that the GOP was punished in 1996 by Latino
voters for its so-called extremist positions, but it doesn't mean
that Latinos have banished it forever.
</P>
<P>
   ``1998 will be the measure of whether this is a long-term trend;
I don't think it is,'' he says. ``The issues will not be the same,
and if you examine the polling trends, many Latinos consider
themselves undecided or independent.''
</P>
<P>
   A Tomas Rivera Policy Institute poll that asked if Latino voters
``lean'' toward Democrats, Republicans or ``neither way,'' 64
percent in California, 67 percent in Florida and 69 percent in
Texas gave the last answer.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans and their NMC are aware of Latino voting
tendencies by now, but since gaining a majority in Congress in
1994, Republicans have provided proof for critics who say the party
is anti-Latino.
</P>
<P>
   Every bit of English-only legislation was sponsored by a
Republican, and welfare and immigration reforms were spearheaded by
Republicans. If the Republican Party can acknowledge past mistakes
and make an honest effort to win Latinos to its style of
government, it's in for better times.
</P>
<P>
   If it fails once again, the consequences will again be
self-inflicted, and, many predict, long-lasting.

 &HT;    
 By CRISTINA SARALEGUI  
 From ``My Life as a Blonde'' 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Keeping my head above water in the world of television wasn't
easy. First of all I had to shed my old body, face, hair _ my
entire appearance _ along with everything I had grown used to
during the past 20 years af my life.
 &HT;    I had been a writer and magazine editor; I worked at a desk like
a slave. When I took a break, I wolfed down anything I could find
in the vending machines.
 &HT;    Today, when I look at the videos from the first year of ``El
Show de Cristina,'' I'm horrified. I see myself as ridiculous,
strident. I look like a prize pony at auction, draped in scarves,
chains, bracelets, three-tier earrings, everything dangling and
clanking against the microphone.
 &HT;    Eventually we polished my image and paid attention to audience
reaction. I worked really hard to find my own personal style. Now I
keep my hair at shoulder length, and I like my makeup light and
wear simple clothes.
 &HT;    I learned to eat low carbohydrates, low fat, and low sugar and
to eat small quantities of protein every three hours, in order to
maintain a stable energy level to function better all day.
 &HT;    The result was that for the first time, I looked great on
television, and again for the first time in my life, I understood
what it was to be an attractive woman, because when I arrived
somewhere, people turned to look at me even if they didn't know who
I was. That had never happened to me before, and I was 41 years
old!
 &HT;    Another factor about my appearance was that I am fair-skinned,
blonde and blue-eyed.
 &HT;    When the show first aired, letters poured in from my Hispanic
brothers and sisters all across the United States, in which they
wrote that I was ``too white,'' too ``guera'' (the Mexican word for
``blonde'') to represent Hispanics.
 &HT;    Those viewers had to understand that what they were doing to me
was as racist as what Anglos were doing to them. The acceptance
took six months of letters from the public telling me I should wear
more blush!
 &HT;    Once an older woman came up to me and chided, ``Cristina, all
you talk about is sex.''
 &HT;    My response: ``No, senora, I talk about everything! From flying
saucers to breast cancer. You only remember the programs about
sex.''
 &HT;    I air themes on sex because apart from the enormous need for
information on that subject, every time I include a segment on a
sexual topic, the ratings go off the charts, and numbers outweigh
hypocrisy.
 &HT;    Instead of calling a radio station to complain about a program
or writing incensed letters, why not just turn off the set when the
topic comes on? But no_ooo! Just the opposite. More and more sets
are turned on.
 &HT;    It's obvious that many people don't have the least idea what
human sexuality is, and someone must offer them the truth. Their
parents certainly haven't assumed that responsibility, despite the
fact that the duty for the sexual and moral education of our
children rests squarely on us parents.
 &HT;    In June 1992, with ``Cristina'' established as No. 1 in its
category in Spanish-language television, I took a shot at the
coveted crossover into English.
 &HT;    It was simply titled the ``Cristina Show,'' and I was delighted
at the challenge, it goes without saying. But for CBS to hire a
communicator with a Latin accent was nothing short of
revolutionary.
 &HT;    At first there were the usual comparisons, and reporters asked
if I was trying to knock off Oprah. ``Are you kidding?'' I'd ask
jokingly. ``Oprah is like a supersonic transport. I'm a fly
requesting permission to land.''
 &HT;    The concept of the program was to feature topics that
demonstrated the pluralism of U.S. society, emphasizing the
immigrant roots shared by all of us, even the oldest North American
families, whose ancestors also emigrated from other countries.
 &HT;    We chose themes that reflected that concept in all its
ramifications. For example, on one program we called ``White Like
Me,'' several plastic surgeons explained the operations people of
different races _ Asian, African American, or Hispanic _ underwent
to alter their features to make them look ``white.''
 &HT;    We discussed prejudice against black peoples. We presented black
Haitians, immigrants into the United States, who complained that
black Americans discriminated against them because of their
nationality and their accent.
 &HT;    At the end of the 11 weeks, the average ratings augured a nearly
guaranteed success. Some years later, Jonathon Rodgers (president
of the group of CBS stations that gave me the chance to work in
English) explained to us that the program had obtained a higher
average rating than any other beginning program since that time.
 &HT;    But when we began to negotiate, the CBS management offered us a
budget we didn't consider adequate. Just the opposite; the amount
was lower than the current budget of our program in Spanish, when
equivalent formats in English spend two or three times that sum and
more.
 &HT;    So Marcos and I decided not to renew.
 &HT;    What I never understood, though, what I never will understand,
is how it was reported in the trade publications again and again
that our show had failed and that we were canceled because of poor
ratings.
 &HT;    For anyone who may believe that, let me tell you: Ratings in the
United States are public property. If the reporters had verified
the facts, as was their responsibility, they would have realized
that what they were writing was not true.
 &HT;    I had to pay for all that. I'm still paying, in the sense that
every time someone mentions our 1992 venture into the
English-language market, the invariable comment is that we
``failed'' and that we were ``canceled.'' That's still
inconceivable to me.
 &HT;    No one ever told me that a woman looks young until suddenly,
when she approaches the decade between 45 and 55, she runs out of
estrogen and the years suddenly show. Her hands (and her vagina)
begin to dry up, and all you can think about is your little-girl
hands that are gone forever.
 &HT;    Thank God, everything my mother didn't warn me about I found in
a book titled ``Silent Passage'' by Gail Sheehy, which become my
bible. Until I read it, I not only didn't recognize the stage I was
going through in my life but also didn't know what had to do to
survive it and to continue succeeding, without allowing that series
of hurdles to slow down my life.
 &HT;    How do I feel as I approach 50? What am I like in this stage of
my life? Vigorous, curious, sensual, sexual, in good physical
condition, flexible and creative.
 &HT;    I define myself as an adult woman who has struggled very hard to
be able to determine the destiny of her own life. I think that one
can achieve everything she sets out to, although not always all at
once. That is the secret.
 &HT;    I completed a cycle of comfort, of working for 22 years for the
company that formed me professionally. I was I able to have my
children, to stay home, to marry twice, to cook for my parents....
 &HT;    I did all these thing! I completed those cycles.
 &HT;    We're told we can't have everything in life. That's not true! We
can have it all (or enough), as long as we know how to choose. Life
is nothing more than an endless rosary of choices and lessons, one
after the other.

 &HT;    Antz is a picnic for all ages
 &HT;    By Dave Larsen
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Children will love the computer-animated adventure's charming
insect characters, voiced by such Hollywood titans as Woody Allen,
Sylvester Stallone and Sharon Stone. Adults will enjoy the story's
slightly sophisticated humor and theme. Both will be dazzled by the
film's brightly colored, magnificently detailed visuals.
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood's second full-length computer-animated feature doesn't
match the technical or creative level of Disney's 1995 blockbuster,
Toy Story , which earned director John Lasseter a special Oscar.
However, the DreamWorks film does have a six-legged leap on
Lasseter's A Bug's Life , a Disney CGI (computer-generated imagery)
production with a similar story and characters, which opens Nov.
25.
</P>
<P>
   That insects would be the next step in CGI evolution isn't
surprising. Their hard, stiff exoskeletons suit the new medium's
limitations as well as plastic toys.
</P>
<P>
   Antz tells the story of Z-4195 (Allen), a worker ant who thinks
there's got to be something better out there. Playing off Allen's
neurotic persona, Z is introduced on his psychiatrist's leaf,
complaining that the colony's strictly ordered caste system makes
him feel insignificant. ``You are insignificant,'' the therapist
replies.
</P>
<P>
   Princess Bala (Stone) is similarly dissatisfied with her place
in the social scheme. Bristling at the thought of her arranged
marriage to Gen. Mandible (Gene Hackman), as well as pumping out
millions of babies a day once she inherits her mother's throne,
Bala slips off to the workers' bar, where she asks lowly Z to
dance.
</P>
<P>
   He breaks formation with his own Pulp Fiction -inspired moves,
impressing the princess and losing his heart.
</P>
<P>
   Determined to see Bala again, Z persuades his best friend Weaver
(Stallone), a soldier ant, to trade places with him for a royal
military review. But the deranged Mandible hatches a diabolical
plan to racially purify the colony, and marches Z and the troops
into war with acid-spewing termites.
</P>
<P>
   The frantic battle scene, from which Z emerges an unlikely hero,
may be too frightening for very young viewers. A
dung-beetle-derived gag helped earn the film its PG rating.
</P>
<P>
   Ostensibly a children's movie, Antz takes an adult view of
colony politics, portraying Mandible as a fascist and quoting Karl
Marx _ ``The workers control the means of production'' _ as Z
inspires an individualist revolution.
</P>
<P>
   Z also kidnaps Bala, who is less than taken with the ``soil
relocation engineer.'' Like Toy Story 's Woody and Buzz, they find
themselves in the outside world, where they must depend on one
another to survive.
</P>
<P>
   The animated arthropods have a carved, three-dimensional look.
Their body motion is sometimes jerky and puppet-like, yet their
faces are fluidly expressive. Most impressive are the crowd scenes
featuring 10,000 or more moving ants. The rousing climax, with
62,100 ants in the shot, would have made Cecil B. DeMille proud.
</P>
<P>
   None of the ants but the muscle-bound Weaver resemble their
human counterparts. The voice cast also includes Anne Bancroft,
Christopher Walken, Jennifer Lopez and Danny Glover. Former
``Coneheads'' Dan Aykroyd and Jane Curtin are reunited as a pair of
snobbish wasps named Chip and Muffy.
</P>
<P>
   Acknowledging the actors' personas is Antz 's greatest strength.
Allen, in particular, infuses his character with his own wry
sensibility. When Mandible crows that Z ``laughs in Death's face,''
Allen makes a self-effacing aside about preferring to ``make
belittling comments and snicker behind Death's back.''
</P>
<P>
   The little bug looks like a big hit.

 &HT;    Comic draws ace with Rounders part
 &HT;    By Hap Erstein
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   For 35 weeks of the year, Sal Richards makes his living doing
stand-up comedy in country clubs and condo community centers in
South Florida, as well as in Atlantic City and Las Vegas.
Occasionally, his agent calls with an opportunity to ply his
avocation _ movie acting.
</P>
<P>
   Since the early '70s, when he made his big screen debut in The
Godfather, because, as Richards puts it, ``They were looking at
every Italian in New York and Brooklyn,'' he has appeared in about
a dozen films, a few television pilots and countless commercials.
His latest is the poker flick Rounders, in which the area resident
plays one of the few to bluff card shark Matt Damon.
</P>
<P>
   It is a short scene _ about a minute _ lengthened by Richards'
ad-libbing at the poker table, which pleased and amused director
John Dahl. Creating that scene took an 18-hour shooting session in
early January.
</P>
<P>
   ``They did it from so many angles,'' says Richards, sitting in
his home in an upscale development west of Florida's Turnpike near
West Palm Beach. ``My point-of-view looking at (Damon) and his
point-of-view looking at me. Then a full shot, then a wide shot,
then a hand shot, then a belly shot, then the bet shot. They took a
shot of me just counting the money, then dropping it in, then
raking it. We ran the whole scene, every time.''
</P>
<P>
   Between camera set-ups, Richards got to spend time with Damon,
who was loose and carefree. ``Oh, he was fantastic,'' Richards
says. ``We hung out by the craft services, where they put all the
food out and we ate doughnuts and coffee, like a bunch of guys
talking on the street. He loves to tell jokes and we laughed and
had fun all day.''
</P>
<P>
   Edward Norton, the only other principal actor that Richards met,
was more standoffish. ``I think Norton wanted to stay in character,
to more or less stay the sleaze that he was. Whereas Matt Damon,
his character was as he was off-camera, he was charming and
easygoing.''
</P>
<P>
   The scene takes place late in the movie, as Damon is on a roll,
clipping a succession of pigeons, trying to make enough money to
pay off his buddy Norton's escalating debts. He is making progress,
until he sits down at a golf club game and meets his match in
Johnny Gold (Richards).
</P>
<P>
   Richards says he almost didn't accept the role when he learned
that the handful of lines that he auditioned with were all he would
have. Further complicating matters was the shooting date, which was
very close to a lucrative comedy booking in Michigan. But director
Dahl would not accept his turndown, guaranteeing Richards would
finish in time to make the concert date, with the film company
paying his airfare. He suspects they ended up spending more for his
transportation than the $2,800 he got for his one-day performance.
``I'm glad I did it now,'' he says, pleased with his scene and with
the contacts that he made on the set. ``John Dahl said to me after
the filming. `Maybe next time there'll be more for you.' They
remember actors' work. If something comes up that's right for me, I
wouldn't doubt that there's a possibility that he might call for
me.''
</P>
<P>
   It seems unlikely, though, that there will be a role more suited
to Richards. Asked to describe the character, he says simply,
``Johnny Gold was me with the name changed. I didn't feel that I
had to act.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't required that Richards be a poker player, but it
probably helped. ``That's all I do when I go to Atlantic City. I
play poker,'' he says. Not that he leaves his night club salary
behind at the card tables. ``I don't play big stakes, I may play
2-4-and-6,'' referring to a two dollar ante and a six dollar
maximum bet. ``You buy in for 50 bucks and if you play tight
enough, you can sit there for four, five hours without having any
problems. It passes the time, it unwinds me after a show.''
</P>
<P>
   Richards, a native of Brooklyn, has been in show business for 40
years, starting out as a singer with a rock 'n' roll band and
adding comedy a couple of years later when the emcee didn't show up
one night. He moved to Palm Beach County in 1989 with his wife of
38 years, Rose Ann, and continues to perform around the country.
</P>
<P>
   The movie career began as a fluke, he concedes, but at least he
started at the top with The Godfather. ``They called me and told me
they were going to put me in the wedding scene (as an extra),'' he
remembers. ``I got upgraded to a day player and then I got a
contract. So now, every time The Godfather is on TV, a check comes
in the mail. I'm up to 10 bucks now.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the movies in Richards' resume are The Eyes of Laura Mars
with Faye Dunaway, The Taking of Pelham 123 with Walter Matthau and
Cat's Eye, based on stories by Stephen King. His most extensive
film work was a 15-week shoot playing a mob boss, co-starring with
Steven Seagal in 1991's Out for Justice. And according to his wife,
his best performance is in a vigilante picture called Fighting Back
(1982), in which he plays a neighborhood patrol member, alongside
Tom Skerritt and Michael Sarrazin.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the reason he accepted the role in Rounders is that
Richards still regrets letting a part get away two decades back.
``I made a mistake years ago. I turned down a role in Raging
Bull,'' he says with a wince and a shrug. ``They wanted me to play
the comedian that introduced Jake LaMotta (Robert DeNiro) in the
lounge at the Copacabana. So I said to my agent, `I don't want to
play a comedian in the movie. That's what I do. I want to be an
actor.'''
</P>
<P>
   Following The Godfather, he tried to concentrate on films as his
prime income-maker, but found it even more precarious than stand-up
comedy. So in January, after 18 straight hours of shuffling,
betting, bluffing and blustering as Johnny Gold in Rounders, he
exchanged phone numbers with Damon, shook Dahl's hand, gathered his
bags and bid his movie career goodbye again _ for the moment at
least _ saying, ``Thank you very much, and now back to show
business.''

 &HT;    He reached top, but paid top dollar
 &HT;    By Greg Stoda
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Patrick Leyland, with his father and his father's World Series
ring in hand, toddled off to first grade at St. Bernard's in Mt.
Lebanon, Pa., for a show-and-tell class on a recent morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``How much did it cost?''
</P>
<P>
   That was the first question posed to Patrick's dad, Jim,who, an
hour or so after visiting his son's school, phoned his Florida
Marlins employers and told them he was quitting as their manager.
</P>
<P>
   So, honestly, Leyland could have answered the boldly inquisitive
child by saying, ``About $7,000 and my job.''
</P>
<P>
   Because, in a convoluted way, that's the truth.
</P>
<P>
   The price of the Marlins' improbable run to the 1997 baseball
championship was simply too high. Many of the players who carried
the team to the title were traded in an effort to reduce costs this
season. Leyland was left to lead what was left of the Marlins, who
promptly dissolved into the worst team in the sport.
</P>
<P>
   Which is why Leyland's decision to skip town should come as no
great surprise to anyone who paid attention as he squirmed through
a 108-loss season.
</P>
<P>
   The man will be 54 years old by the time spring training rolls
around again, says his next gig will probably be ``my last
go-'round'' and wants no part of a rebuilding process let alone the
kind of massive reconstruction the Marlins have only begun to
undertake.
</P>
<P>
   South Florida?
</P>
<P>
   See ya.
</P>
<P>
   Leyland said all the right things during a Thursday morning
teleconference. He had been ``so fortunate to be a Florida Marlin''
and the two years were a ``great ride, in many ways'' and he'd
always remember ``we accomplished the ultimate.''
</P>
<P>
   Leaving with three years remaining on his contract, he said,
amounted to simple resolution of a ``business decision that didn't
work out.''
</P>
<P>
   Oh, it worked out well financially for Leyland. He's a wealthy
man.
</P>
<P>
   But the baseball part of the deal fell apart just when it
appeared the Marlins were on the verge of establishing themselves
as a force. The problem arose when team owner H. Wayne Huizenga,
only now in the process of selling the team after announcing his
intention to do so 16 months ago, found the cost of winning those
championship rings too expensive for his taste.
</P>
<P>
   The purge began in the wake of Florida's victory in the World
Series last October.
</P>
<P>
   Leyland said Thursday he was ``surprised and disappointed, but
not angry'' when he he first heard in June 1997 of Huizenga's plan
to sell. But his sense ``that something wasn't right'' in the
middle of that summer grew until he was ``shocked that everything
happened so fast'' as the team was dismantled.
</P>
<P>
   Leyland had no fun this year.
</P>
<P>
   He respected the kids who swallowed the losses and stood up to
the ridicule, but that's all.
</P>
<P>
   He's tired of baseball's shaky economics, which have forced him
out of Pittsburgh and Florida since the end of the 1996 season.
That's why _ when the phone rings with someone offering a job with
a team on good financial ground and not so far removed from playoff
possibilities (see: Colorado) _ Leyland will go.
</P>
<P>
   Is being with a contender so important?
</P>
<P>
   ``To be honest, yes,'' Leyland said.
</P>
<P>
   Other than the World Series season, he has managed teams to
losing records five of the past six years. And losing is what these
Marlins will be about for quite a while.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at the ring,'' Leyland tells himself these days.
</P>
<P>
   And try to forget what it cost.

 &HT;    Leyland's `great ride' ends; Boles to take over
 &HT;    By Dan Graziano
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jim Leyland didn't ``shock the world'' recently, but he did
finish off the dismantling of the 1997 World Series champion
Florida Marlins.
</P>
<P>
   After two years with the Marlins _ the first of which ended with
a World Series title and the other with 108 losses _ Leyland
announced that he would skip the final three years of his contract,
accept a $500,000 buyout clause, and look for work elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a great ride in many ways,'' Leyland, 53, said from his
home in Pittsburgh. ``We accomplished the ultimate, and then
everybody knows about this year. But I had to determine if I wanted
to go at the pace the organization was going to set, and I didn't
want to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Marlins will waste no time naming Leyland's successor. John
Boles, the vice president of player development who managed the
Marlins to a 40-35 record in the second half of the 1996 season,
will be the team's next manager, and the official announcement
could come today.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wouldn't be right for me to say anything,'' Boles said
Thursday night, declining to confirm his own appointment. ``I
wouldn't want to say a word about anything.''
</P>
<P>
   But one high-ranking Marlins official confirmed that the team
already had decided by Thursday afternoon to name Boles.
</P>
<P>
   Boles replaced Rene Lachemann at the All-Star break in 1996. The
Marlins hired Leyland in October of that year, and owner Wayne
Huizenga began a free-agent spending binge that resulted in the
team beating Cleveland in the 1997 World Series.
</P>
<P>
   Last November, five months after Huizenga announced he was
selling the Marlins, Leyland decided to stay on for at least
another year. He then guided a team stripped of its high-priced
talent and loaded with minor-league players.
</P>
<P>
   Now, despite John Henry's pending purchase of the franchise,
Leyland decided he doesn't have the patience to suffer through more
mediocrity before the Marlins can contend again.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't until yesterday (Wednesday) that I finally decided I
was going to cut the ties,'' Leyland said. ``And it was hard for me
to do that, because I really like the young players the
organization has. This is a very emotional time for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Leyland had said Wednesday night that he ``just might shock the
world'' with his announcement. And although few were shocked by his
decision, Leyland believes he surprised some people.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is a major shock,'' Leyland said. ``I really
believe some of the coaches and players thought at the end of the
day that I was going to make a decision to stay.''
</P>
<P>
   The Colorado Rockies called Leyland just hours after his
announcement, and they are the front-runners to sign him. The only
thing that might hold up a move to Denver is if Leyland decides to
wait until the playoffs end and see if teams the Cleveland Indians
or the Chicago Cubs are interested in him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the only one we've talked to,'' Rockies owner Jerry
McMorris said. ``Jim is clearly at the head of our list. I wouldn't
say he's the only candidate, but he's at the top of our list.''
</P>
<P>
   Leyland is interesed in the Rockies, but he does have some
reservations.
</P>
<P>
   ``That may be the toughest place in the major leagues to
manage,'' Leyland said of Coors Field. ``It's beautiful, and it's a
great franchise, but for the home manager it's a tough place.''
</P>
<P>
   But Colorado does have something more to offer than thin air and
a haven for home-run hitters _ financial stability. Sellout crowds
at Coors Field give the Rockies, who came into the majors the same
year as the Marlins, guaranteed revenue. So the team can spend to
win _ that's a promise Leyland thought he had when he left
Pittsburgh and came to Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he went to Florida, he was told this team would be a
contender for a long time, and that the payroll would stay up,''
said Marlins third base coach Rich Donnelly, Leyland's closest
friend. ``They changed their minds, so he had a right to change his
mind. If we had that same team as last year, we all would be here
until they threw us out.''
</P>
<P>
   Donnelly, first base coach Tommy Sandt, bullpen coach Bruce Kimm
and hitting coach Milt May will likely follow Leyland to his next
stop. Pitching coach Rich Dubee and outfield/baserunning coach
Lorenzo Bundy, both of whom were promoted from the Marlins' minor
leagues last winter, likely would stay on Boles' major-league
coaching staff.
</P>
<P>
   Last week Henry had a breakfast meeting with Leyland, outlining
his plan for the franchise. Henry wants to increase the payroll
slowly for a year or two, let the young players develop, then
accelerate the the payroll back to a contending level in 2001 or
2002 _ if he can get the public to help build a new stadium.
</P>
<P>
   But that timetable didn't fit Leyland.
</P>
<P>
   ``He meant a lot to all the baseball fans in South Florida,
including myself,'' Henry said. ``He'll be missed by everyone in
the organization.''
</P>
<P>
   Marlins General Manager Dave Dombrowski wouldn't say that Boles
would be the next manager, but he did make a reference to
``stability within the organization'' as a determining factor in
picking Leyland's successor.
</P>
<P>
   ``We respect Jim's decision, and we wish him the best,'' said
Dombrowski, who recently signed a five-year contract extension.
``There's no question in my mind, without his leadership in 1997,
that we wouldn't have the rings we all have to put on our
fingers.''
</P>
<P>
   No matter where he ends up, Leyland and those who go with him
will always have the same feelings.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was magic,'' he said. ``We just hoped the magic show would
continue for a few years.''

 &HT;    Baseball rises from ashes of past blunders
 &HT;    By Gary Borders
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Baseball has been berry, berry good to me.''
</P>
<P>
   --Sammy Sosa, imitating an old ``Saturday Night Live'' skit
during a recent interview.
</P>
<P>
   The night I'm writing this, Sosa and Mark McGwire both have 65
home runs.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers are about to win the AL West. The Red Sox, bless
their hearts, are going to squeak into the wild-card spot despite a
typically miserable September. The Yankees will eat their lunch, I
fear. Boston's ace, Pedro Martinez, will probably lose out in the
Cy Young contest to ex-Bosox Roger Clemens _ now with Toronto. He's
a UT grad I used to shoot photos of in college, and is continuing a
long streak of former Boston players who went
</P>
<P>
   on to greater glory after leaving Fenway, a tradition started
with the trade of Babe Ruth, about the time my family first cast
their fortunes with the Beantown gang.
</P>
<P>
   It's been a long dry spell.
</P>
<P>
   The Houston Astros, my second-favorite team, are a dead lock for
the playoffs, and they look like the team to beat in the National
League after they stole Randy Johnson from Seattle. With his
stringy hair, 6-10 frame and unshaved face, The Big Unit, as they
call him, strikes fear into the hearts of most sane men. I would
rather get in the ring with Evander Holyfield than in the batter's
box against Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Cal Ripken ended his consecutive-game streak with typical class,
sitting down during the Orioles' final home game, which happened to
be against the Yankees, Lou Gehrig's team. The Yankees came out on
the dugout steps and applauded him. He wasn't hurt or injured, just
tired of dealing with the streak. Never say never, but that streak
won't be broken in my lifetime. Bet on it.
</P>
<P>
   This is the sport most pundits declared DOA in 1995 after a
players' strike left us without a World Series, and fans, including
me, gave up and found other ways to occupy ourselves. Golf. The
Learning Channel. Bob Vila and Hometime. If I ever want to, I
believe I could sheetrock and floor a basement now. I still can't
putt, though.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball is back. Reports of its death were exaggerated. Sure,
the players make a ridiculous amount of money, still spit too much
and have all adopted goatees that give even a .235 utility
infielder a vaguely menacing look.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, the owners are still largely a group of buffoons who made
fortunes elsewhere while casting gimlet eyes at their teams,
viewing them primarily as money machines. Lovely ballparks like
Fenway in Boston face destruction because an owner can make an
extra gazillion bucks with a new stadium financed with tax money,
containing rows of luxury boxes sold to other gazillionaires.
</P>
<P>
   But it is still baseball, a game whose rules and strategy have
changed little in more than a century. It's a game that most of us
have played, whether in Little League or at a company picnic. It is
a game of grace and heroic moments, of teamwork and individual
achievement. It is still America's pastime, a welcome respite from
sex scandals, terroristic acts and falling stocks. It's a game one
can sit and watch with a 6-year-old nephew, explaining strategy,
looking in admiration at his baseball card collection and nodding
as he proclaims his intention to play for the Rangers someday.
</P>
<P>
   Even now, five years after I finally retired from softball to
devote my exceedingly limited athletic abilities to golf, I still
get a hankering to go outside and play catch. My Fred Lynn
signature glove is still supple. I bought it two years before I
decided it was impossible to reconcile a golf swing and a baseball
swing. It takes a while for my arm to loosen up, to get back in the
rhythm of snapping up one-hoppers and lazy fly balls. But soon I'm
back in the groove, playing the game my dad taught me nearly 40
years
</P>
<P>
   ago. One of my minor regrets is never having a son to teach
baseball to; my daughters weren't interested. My teen stepson is
past that stage. Often as not, it's my wife and I out there tossing
the softball back and forth on a lazy fall afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   This sport was redeemed this season by two unlikely heroes, a
huge white guy with arms the size of sawlogs, and a skinny black
man from the Dominican Republic who once had a reputation for
having an attitude. I don't care which one finally wins this
incredible home-run derby. I'm rooting for both of them.
</P>
<P>
   Long as I'm breathing, I'll never forget walking in from mowing
the lawn a few weeks back, flipping on the TV, and promptly
watching McGwire hit number 61 out of the park, a chip shot that
barely cleared the left-field fence. And then watching Sosa run in
from right field to give him a bear hug.
</P>
<P>
   I don't know why, but it brought tears to my eyes. For all the
obscene money, the gold-chained prima donnas and dootbrain owners,
it is still a wonderful game _ to play and to watch.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe this is the year the Red Sox will finally break their
80-year dry spell in the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   Hope springs eternal, in baseball.

 &HT;    My house is overrun with ball caps
 &HT;    By Mary McCarty
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ball caps. It's a hobby of my husband's, or so I thought, this
collecting of ball caps, and so we have Atlanta '96 ball caps,
Savannah ball caps, National Folk Festival ball caps, you name it.
</P>
<P>
   I never attached much meaning to it, until Jim's indignant
reaction this week to an NPR piece about the proliferation of ball
caps among follically challenged Baby Boomers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reporter made fun of men for wearing ball caps to cover up
their bald spots,'' Jim huffed. ``He thought it was so funny. I'll
bet the guy was one of those Gen-Xers with a 31-inch waist and a
full head of hair.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Touchy, touchy,'' I teased, but who am I to talk? I'm the one
standing as judge, jury and executioner against any strand of white
hair with the audacity to show itself in the mirror.
</P>
<P>
   Here we are _ well past the stage when, as children, we
considered our parents hopelessly middle-aged _ still clinging to
our illusions of youth.
</P>
<P>
   The aging process has gone on long enough, you'd think Jim and I
would be well past the denial stage and into acceptance. It was
seven years ago, after all, that Jim discovered (some years and
months after the rest of us) the softball-shaped clearing on the
back of his scalp.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's this?'' he demanded, pointing to a photo from our son's
baptism.
</P>
<P>
   ``You mean your bald spot?'' I asked innocently.
</P>
<P>
   ``My what?''
</P>
<P>
   At his next haircut, he confronted Howard the barber: ``Why
didn't you tell me?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought you knew,'' Howard said mildly, too polite to point
out that it would hardly be good for business to send clients
notarized certificates of hair loss. ``I just thought you were
taking it awfully well.''
</P>
<P>
   Fat chance. We are Americans of a certain age, and we are not
going to take anything about aging ``awfully well.'' We've
worshipped youth as our generational false idol, and darned if we
are going to let it go without protest.
</P>
<P>
   Not that I blame Jim for fretting. He isn't 40 yet, but he's
rounding third and headed for home. Landmark birthdays undermine
even the healthiest self-esteem. But what about the generalized
whining I'm hearing? More and more, friends make pitiful pleas for
sympathy: ``I'm feeling old and haggard lately.''
</P>
<P>
   I never miss my cue. ``You're crazy, sweetie, I'm surprised you
don't still get carded.''
</P>
<P>
   Remarkably, neither Jim nor I nor any of our friends have aged
appreciably, so such reassurances are hardly a fib. (No, really,
don't trouble yourself to drag out any of those old photo albums.)
</P>
<P>
   By what about that sad day when the ravages of age can no longer
be denied? We'll be mature and self-actualized about it, no doubt.
I'll tell Jim the truth: ``Yes, darling, at last you look your age,
and what a wonderful age it is. Why, that maturity, that seasoning,
most of all that alluring bald spot, make you more attractive than
you've ever been.''
</P>
<P>
   No? He's not buying it? Jim wants nothing of Rogaine, hair
transplants, or combovers, either. Picky, picky man.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ball caps are the way to go,'' Jim says.
</P>
<P>
   That's his story, and he's sticking to it.

 &HT;    Old aircraft still looks new for 21st century
 &HT;    By Timothy R. Gaffney
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ The C-130 Hercules cargo plane has been flying
since 1955, but the model that visited Wright-Patterson Air Force
Base in Ohio recently looked like something Bill Gates might have
dreamed up.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the snubnose cockpit of the four-engine propjet is a
``glass cockpit'' _ an instrument panel stuffed with computer
screens instead of the traditional round gauges. Transparent
screens mounted above the panel are see-through displays that allow
pilots to read critical flight data without looking away from where
they're flying.
</P>
<P>
   The updated airlifter, dubbed the C-130J, also sports six-bladed
propellers with distinctively curved blades. Older models commonly
have four paddle-shaped blades on each propeller. The new engines
and propellers are quieter and more powerful, according to the Air
Force.
</P>
<P>
   Lockheed Martin Corp. makes the plane in Marietta, Ga., but the
Air Force manages the procurement of C-130s through the
Aeronautical Systems Center at Wright-Pat. The C-130J stopped at
Wright-Pat mainly for the benefit of the 40 workers in the C-130
Development System Office, which has been working on the C-130J
program since 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Nicknamed the ``Herc,'' the C-130 is one of the most versatile
airplanes ever made. C-130s have been modified into gunships and
electronic eavesdroppers, to mention a few unusual uses. A small
number are flown by the ``Hurricane Hunters'' of the 53rd Weather
Reconnaissance Squadron that recently tracked Hurricane Georges.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the Hurricane Hunters are in line for the new Hercs.
Last week, the C-130 office at Wright-Pat signed a contract with
Lockheed Martin to modify six C-130Js for weather reconnaissance,
replacing 1960s vintage planes. The initial value of the contract
is $46.9 million, and an option for four more could increase it to
$59.2 million.
</P>
<P>
   Wright-Pat spokeswoman Helen Kavanaugh said the Air Force has
orders for 23 C-130Js under contracts valued at $1.3 billion.

 &HT;    How to read a poker face
 &HT;    By Jeff Houck
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bill Clinton thinks he has trouble with the independent
prosecutor. He better pray he doesn't tangle at a poker table with
Mike Caro.
</P>
<P>
   Known in poker circles as ``the Mad Genius of Poker,'' Caro says
Arkansas' tainted son would be an easy mark.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's a very convincing actor,'' Caro said. ``He's
better at convincing people to feel the way he wants them to feel
than anyone I've ever seen.
</P>
<P>
   ``But from a poker point of view, he's a simple man to read. All
you have to do is believe the opposite of everything he's trying to
make you believe,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Caro should know. He's made a handsome living selling books and
videotapes disclosing his tricks for deciphering opponents' hands
by reading their body language.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's mostly in the eyes,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Caro was recently accorded a nod of respect in the hit poker
movie Rounders, which stars Matt Damon. Early in the film, the box
from one of Caro's instructional videotapes is used to stash some
cash for a payoff.
</P>
<P>
   Damon and co-star Edward Norton did extensive research to
prepare for the film, including studying Caro's approach to poker
and sitting in for a few hands at this year's World Series of Poker
in Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   Though Caro was in attendance, he didn't see Damon play. But he
said Doyle Brunson, two-time World Series winner, was impressed
with the young actor's poker skills.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hand that he (Damon) got knocked out with was played
correctly,'' Caro said. ``From what Doyle told me, I think that if
you gave me two weeks with Matt Damon, I could make him a
world-class poker player.''
</P>
<P>
   Caro was around Damon's age _ in his early 20s _ when he started
playing poker in the '60s, winning small pots in neighborhood
games. But the mental angle of poker _ the strategies and
statistical probabilities _ is what really intrigued him.
</P>
<P>
   Working with computers, Caro created a model for human behavior
at the poker table. Not only could he decipher what it meant when
an opponent avoided his gaze (a player's attempt at aloofness or
disgust generally indicates a strong hand), but Caro could tell
what cards a player was likely to be holding.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unlike craps or roulette, if you play long enough, the outcome
is certain in poker,'' Caro said. ``In poker, your decisions
matter. In craps or roulette, the money flows from the house to the
player. In poker, good players beat bad players and money flows
from the bad players to the good players.''
</P>
<P>
   And unlike craps or roulette, the strategies needed to be a
successful poker player can translate to everyday life, Caro said.
</P>
<P>
   Consider Caro's Threshold of Misery theory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Think of it this way,'' Caro explains. ``Let's say you go into
a poker game thinking you can comfortably lose $1,000 and you wind
up losing $2,000. The next hand comes and you lose an additional
$80. By that point, you've crossed a threshold of misery, so you
start thinking that it no longer matters. But it does matter.
You're still down $2,080.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like that in life,'' he said. ``If a romance goes sour
and then your business turns sour, you've crossed a threshold of
misery and you start to think that whatever happens next doesn't
matter. But they do. You can't afford to lose any more.
</P>
<P>
   ``My theory is that you have to play your best game in poker and
life at all times. That $80 means something.''
</P>
<P>
   He pauses and laughs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Poker has been good to me... but sometimes while I'm
programming a computer for a statistical analysis, I start to
think,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my heart, I know I'm doing players a lot of good, but I
think, `Man, I could have been putting all this to better use in
biochemistry or something.'''

 &HT;    Rounders guru: Watch the eyes, the chips, the smoke they blow
 &HT;    By Jeff Houck
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mike Caro has more than a couple theories in his book, Caro's
Fundamental Secrets of Winning Poker, and his Caro's Pro Poker
Tells videotape.
</P>
<P>
   His main theory: If you watch closely enough, your opponents at
the poker table will tip you off by how they talk, smoke, move in
their chairs or bet their chips.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people think, `...If I don't disguise my hand, people
will see right through me,''' says Caro, known as the Mad Genius of
Poker. ``That's why a majority of these pitiful people will respond
by acting weak when they're strong and strong when they are weak.''
</P>
<P>
   More insights from the Mad Genius:
</P>
<P>
   Pay attention to how players stack their chips. The frivolous
stacker is more likely to bluff. If the chips are neatly stacked,
the player is conservative and won't likely bluff.
</P>
<P>
   If a player has just won a big hand, he has to take time to
stack his chips and likely won't get involved in a hand unless he
absolutely has to play. If he chooses to play, it means he has a
strong hand and likely won't be bluffing.
</P>
<P>
   The next time a dealer deals you a card, don't look at it.
Instead, look at your opponents and see how they react to their
cards.
</P>
<P>
   A player is more likely to look at a card immediately if he or
she already has a strong hand. If the hand is weak, they'll stare
at the hand longer.
</P>
<P>
   A player glances at his chips only when he's considering a bet
and almost always when he's helped his hand after taking additional
cards.
</P>
<P>
   When someone at the table is looking away and avoiding eye
contact, it's because they are trying to act uninterested so you'll
bet more. Players staring at you are usually less of a threat than
players staring away.
</P>
<P>
   If someone reluctantly raises the ante, he usually has a strong
hand.
</P>
<P>
   Someone who bets by laying their chips down softly or in a very
orderly manner usually is not bluffing. They're serious about
winning.
</P>
<P>
   The longer a player takes to bet, the more likely it is that he
has a weak hand.
</P>
<P>
   Smokers at poker tables are easy to read. Those who blow smoke
and move the cigarette around in their mouths as they talk are
relaxed and want you to bet big so they can win the pot. A smoker
with a weak hand tends not to move around or blow smoke _ or even
exhale.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who goes out of his way to act disgusted usually has a
strong hand.
</P>
<P>
   When a player's hands shake as he lays down a bet or takes
cards, he probably has a tremendously strong hand of cards. Fear,
Caro says, the trembling bet.
</P>
<P>
   Ranking those poker hands
</P>
<P>
   Before you see the movie Rounders, starring Matt Damon and Ed
Norton, it might help to brush up on poker hands:
</P>
<P>
   Royal straight flush: The top five cards of the same suit; ace,
king, queen, jack, 10. Odds: 650,000 to 1.
</P>
<P>
   Straight flush: Any five cards from the same suit in consecutive
order, such as 2,3,4,5,6. If two players have the same hand, the
higher sequence outranks the lower one. Odds: 75,000 to 1.
</P>
<P>
   Four of a kind: Four of any one card. For example: four 7s or
four queens. Fifth card doesn't count. Odds: 4,150 to 1.
</P>
<P>
   Full house: Three of a kind and a pair. Example: three queens
and two fours. Odds: 700 to 1.
</P>
<P>
   Flush: Five cards of the same suit; the cards don't have to be
in sequence. When two players have flushes, the highest card in
each flush determines the better hand. Odds: 500 to 1.
</P>
<P>
   Straight: Five cards of consecutive rank (in numerical
sequence), but the cards can be in any suit. Odds: 250 to 1.
</P>
<P>
   Three of a kind: Also known as triplets, this hand consists of
three cards of the same numeric value, together with two unmatched
cards. Odds: 47 to 1.
</P>
<P>
   Two pairs: Four cards in two pairs and an unmatched fifth card.
Ties are decided by the value of the top pair, then the value of
the second pair, and finally by the spare card. Odds: 20 to 1.
</P>
<P>
   One pair: One pair and three unmatched cards is the second
lowest hand. Odds: You pick up a hand with a pair in it twice in
every five hands.
</P>
<P>
   High card: The weakest hand, high card means five unmatched
cards. The top card in the hand determines the better collection.
Odds: 1 in 2.

 &HT;    Dove hunting becomes platform for Ohio election
 &HT;    By Dale Dempsey
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mourning dove hunting occupies two relatively short seasons in
Ohio, but when the political argument turns to whether the small,
migratory songbirds should be shot, the big guns come out.
</P>
<P>
   The duel over mourning doves is fast becoming one of this
election's most compelling _ and competitive _ contests.
</P>
<P>
   It's not a new battle. Mourning dove hunting is a 30-year Ohio
political tradition, and both sides have lined up support from
large, national lobbying groups.
</P>
<P>
   Issue One on the Nov. 3 statewide ballot would restore the ban
on hunting mourning doves if it passes. As the ad wars begin, there
appears to be little middle ground between the two camps.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents say dove hunting is cruel and unnecessary, as the
small birds yield little food. Proponents charge that animal rights
groups have the hidden agenda of eliminating all hunting in the
state _ and they are handing out recipes for dove.
</P>
<P>
   ``We eat them,'' said Rob Sexton of the Ohioans for Wildlife
Conservation, the group pushing for no votes on Issue One. ``One
might not make a meal, but two or three might.''
</P>
<P>
   Ohioans for Wildlife Conservation has raised $2.3 million from
volunteer groups in each county, according to Sexton. The group
began running television ads on Sept. 21 claiming that out-of-state
groups such as the Humane Society of the United States, Fund for
Animals and People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals are opposed
to all hunting, fishing, livestock farming and animal medical
testing.
</P>
<P>
   Save the Doves, the group working to pass Issue One, filed a
complaint with the state elections commission, saying the ads are
intentionally misleading.
</P>
<P>
   ``We find it ironic that the ads don't mention the word `dove,'
'' said Aime St. Arnaud, coordinator for Save the Doves. ``They
know they can't win on the issue of dove hunting alone.''
</P>
<P>
   The group is distributing a video that shows footage of doves
that are wounded and not retrieved. ``There is a high crippling
rate,'' said St. Arnaud. ``Around 30 percent of those shot are just
wounded, according to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.''
</P>
<P>
   Save the Doves has raised about $300,000 and will run its own
ads nearer to the election.
</P>
<P>
   St. Arnaud said the group has no agenda beyond dove hunting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Half of our members are hunters,'' she said. ``I can't go back
next year and say no deer hunting. Ohioans have 48 species they can
hunt.''
</P>
<P>
   Arnaud said the group is just trying to restore Ohio's 80-year
tradition of no dove hunting.
</P>
<P>
   In July, after opponents gathered enough signatures to put Issue
One on the ballot, the Ohio Department of Natural Resources printed
and distributed pamphlets promoting hunting. The use of state money
to back one side drew complaints and the pamphlets were withdrawn.
</P>
<P>
   Sexton said his poll shows the contest running about even. St.
Arnaud said their polls show a slight majority of voters want the
issue to pass.
</P>
<P>
   Dove hunting in Ohio was banned from 1917 until 1994, except for
a brief season in 1975 that was revoked the next year. The
political arguments, however, have been waged for almost as long.
</P>
<P>
   After a long lobbying effort, hunters finally won the right to
shoot doves in 1994 by one vote in a lame-duck Ohio legislature.
The first season was in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since hunting was restored, the number of dove hunters in the
state has grown to 45,000,'' said Sexton. ``It is the most popular
game hunting in the country, with 2.5 million hunters in 38 states,
including Ohio.''
</P>
<P>
   Sexton said that some of the groups backing Save the Doves have
a record of opposing other forms of hunting in other states. ``They
have run campaigns in California, Oregon, Michigan, Massachusetts,
Idaho and Colorado,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The mourning doves in Ohio and most other states in the country
are not the white dove that is the symbol of peace. They belong to
the Columbidae family and are closely related to pigeons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it would be near as much of an issue if it was
called a pigeon,'' said Sexton.
</P>
<P>
   Mourning doves breed two or three times a year. About five
million are born in the state each year. About 60 percent only
survive a year, dying of natural causes. They are highly migratory.
Birds born in Ohio and banded have been reported as far away as
Florida, Texas and Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Hunters harvest about 10 percent of the flock, so the dove is
not in current danger of becoming extinct.
</P>
<P>
   Charlotte Mathena, vice president of the Dayton Audubon Society,
said she found the pro-dove hunting TV ads, ``kind of inflammatory
and pretty off base.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What they have done is they took a songbird off the songbird
list and put it on the game bird list,'' said Mathena. ``There are
people who just want it put back on the songbird list. They are not
anti-hunting or anything. It has been a songbird for a long time.''

 &HT;    Grandmother faces manslaughter charges
 &HT;    By Lawrence Budd
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   A Franklin, Ohio woman who gave her 17-year-old step-grandson an
apparently fatal dose of painkillers after a family night of beer
drinking will spend six months in a minimum-security jail in
Dayton.
</P>
<P>
   Kathy Smith, 49, was ordered by Warren County, Ohio, Common
Pleas Court Judge Daniel Fedders to get treatment for her drinking
problem while being held at the Monday Community Correctional
Institution in Dayton.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some things about your life that have to be
straightened out,'' Fedders said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Smith was also sentenced to five years probation.
</P>
<P>
   In late August, Fedders sentenced Smith's step-daughter, Kathy
Jean Smith, 36, to 15 days in jail and two years probation for her
part in a drinking party in February that resulted in the death of
her son, Joseph D. Blair, 17, from an overdose of beer and
Darvocet, a prescription painkiller.
</P>
<P>
   According to police reports, Blair and the step-grandmother went
next door to her home on Cedar Street after a night of drinking
beer at his mother's home. Blair, who had already downed 12 beers
at his mother's home, drank another four at his step-grandmother's
home. After he complained of a headache, the grandmother gave him
two 650-milligram Darvocet pills, according to police reports.
</P>
<P>
   The grandmother found Blair unconscious on her couch the next
morning. The county coroner ruled he died of an overdose caused by
the lethal combination of beer and painkillers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what I can do to make you hurt more,'' Fedders
said.
</P>
<P>
   Blair's mother was charged with child endangering and
contributing to the delinquency of a minor. The step-grandmother
faced these charges, plus involuntary manslaughter, because she
gave the teen the painkillers to ease the headache, reportedly
brought on as the teen began sobering up.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the kind of judgment that a lot of family members make
without understanding how dangerous it is,'' said defense attorney
Jeff Kirby.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Kirby revealed another doctor who had examined
Blair found evidence of a brain hemorrhage _ caused when his mother
banged his head into a medicine cabinet about two weeks before in
an argument _ that might have contributed to his death.
</P>
<P>
   While accepting responsibility for the death, the elder Smith
insisted she loved Blair like ``my own flesh-and-blood grandson.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I only did what I did to ease the pain,'' she said

 &HT;    Commentary: The restroom watch
 &HT;    By Vicki Marsh Kabat
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   I have spent a lot of time hovering outside men's restrooms. No,
this isn't a confession. It's a fact of life for any mother of
small boys.
</P>
<P>
   When my sons were infants, I thought the day would never come
when they'd be able to go to the restroom by themselves when we
were out in public.
</P>
<P>
   The years of diaper changing at the mall and potty training take
their toll. Potty training, of course, merits its own column.
Several of them.
</P>
<P>
   I'll admit right up front, I bribed my toddlers with M&AMP;Ms. Every
time they successfully accomplished their mission, they got five
M&AMP;Ms and I got five handfuls. We all grew from the experience.
</P>
<P>
   Once the children are potty trained, however, we moms still have
a grace period when they usually will concede to accompany us to
the women's restroom _ that is, unless they have older brothers who
promptly inform them they're going into a ``La-a-dies Bathroom!
Eeewww!''
</P>
<P>
   That usually elicits a wail of anguish from the younger brother,
although he has no idea why. It just seems to be the expected
response. The mother then has to resort to dragging her youngster
into the facility.
</P>
<P>
   This routine helps moms become expert at creating a scene. We
get so used to it, we no longer notice the outraged looks of
bystanders. You think you can do better, buster? Here, be my guest.
</P>
<P>
   The day does come, though, when it just doesn't seem appropriate
to take the little tyke into the women's restroom. Not that you
mind, but he certainly does. A lot. So, fearing we're about to do
permanent psychological damage, we take the plunge and begin
hovering.
</P>
<P>
   We do not, however, send our sons into this potential minefield
without detailed instructions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, you go in there and find an empty stall. Be sure it's
empty. Do NOT crawl under the door. Make sure there's paper in
there if you have to do Number 2. Don't put anything else into the
potty. Give me that G.I. Joe. Flush when you're done. Give me that
other G.I. Joe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Remember to wash your hands. Don't talk to anybody. Don't look
at anybody. If anybody looks at you, scream for Mommy. Then come
RIGHT back out here. I'll be waiting right here. If you need me,
just holler. OK? ``
</P>
<P>
   Nearly overwhelmed by the responsibility suddenly cast upon him,
the little fellow manfully hitches his britches and ventures in.
</P>
<P>
   That's when we hover.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you all right in there?'' we call in through the door.
</P>
<P>
   No answer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you OK?'' we holler again.
</P>
<P>
   No answer.
</P>
<P>
   Passersby stare at us as we stand shouting into the doorway of
the men's bathroom. We glare back at them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you finished yet?'' we call in.
</P>
<P>
   At just this moment, a burly man walks out the door. ``Yeah,
lady, I am. Happy?''
</P>
<P>
   Then comes that moment of truth when we can bear the anxiety no
longer. Do we cover our eyes, open the door just a crack and call
his name? Do we ask a male store clerk to go in and check on him?
The seconds drag on like hours.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, out walks the little guy, toilet paper stuck to his
shoe, the waist of his shorts folded twice over, his hands dripping
wet, and a big smile on his face.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did it Mommy, all by myself!''
</P>
<P>
   You smile encouragement even though you know otherwise. No, son,
you didn't. You had moment-by-moment verbal instructions. Never
mind that I was ready to call in the National Guard, not to mention
your platoon of G.I. Joes.
</P>
<P>
   We survived it, though. With any luck, it'll be another 30
minutes before you have to go again.

 &HT;    Just as true as his blue Texas skies?
 &HT;    By John Kelso
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ He's a retired Austin cop whose friends call him
``Pooh.''
</P>
<P>
   He says ``awl'' for oil and ``bidness'' for business.
</P>
<P>
   Like any true Texan, he says what he thinks. When called on the
carpet by the boss to explain why he called a guy an !??!, he said,
``'Cause he is.''
</P>
<P>
   He knows all of Patsy Cline's songs and sings along to them. His
favorite decor is early hunting season. ``I told you we have two
deer heads flanking a gun cabinet in the hallway, didn't I?'' said
Gail Phillips, his wife.
</P>
<P>
   He pitches washers and horseshoes and wears a belt buckle the
size of a candy dish.
</P>
<P>
   He's Michael ``Pooh'' Phillips, 49, of Round Rock, one of about
20 people entered so far in the American-Statesman's Tallest,
Truest Texan contest. Gail nominated him.
</P>
<P>
   There's still time to enter the contest, but the clock is
ticking. All entries have to be submitted by Monday, Oct. 12. So
get after it, darn it.
</P>
<P>
   Just tell me in 100 words or less why you, or somebody you know,
best defines what it means to be a real professional Texan. Surely
you have an aunt who can open a longneck on a Chevy fender. Turn
her in.
</P>
<P>
   Tell me by e-mail (jkelsostatesman.com) or write me at this
newspaper, P.O. Box 670, Austin, TX 78767. The winner gets a gas
grill.
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, I know. As a couple of y'all have pointed out, no real
Texan would be caught dead cooking on some yuppie gas grill. But
look at it this way. Y'all are getting off easy. If I'd been in
charge of picking first prize, it would have been a weekend for two
in Hoboken, N.J., so the winner could enjoy some cultural exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, second and third prizes are fitting _ an Armadillo
Roadkill Cake from the Lone Star Bakery in Round Rock, and Frito
pie for two at the Texas Chili Parlor on Lavaca Street.
</P>
<P>
   So stop lollygagging and enter somebody worthy of the honor,
before time runs out.
</P>
<P>
   We've had some great entries, but we could always use more.
</P>
<P>
   The kids at Dell Pickett Elementary School in Georgetown entered
their principal, Brent Buck, because he:
</P>
<P>
   ``Loves to eat jalapenos with his fried chicken.
</P>
<P>
   ``Buys and sells livestock at the Jarrell Auction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sings in a country western band once a month at Possum Creek
Saloon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Always says things to us like. `Now y'all behave yourself real
good today.'''
</P>
<P>
   He's in the running.
</P>
<P>
   Here's another entry I like, from Kim McConnell of Austin, who
nominates her brother, Shawn Mason, a Waco firefighter. Kim points
out that Shawn:
</P>
<P>
   Had an uncle Billy Bob who drove a Lone Star beer truck.
</P>
<P>
   ``When kidded about his accent by his wife's family from New
York, replied: `Me??! Heck, you're the one with the accent!'''
</P>
<P>
   And ``dated some girls that also dipped,'' as in snuff.
</P>
<P>
   Really? ``I used to tease him about that; I thought it was kinda
gross,'' Kim said.
</P>
<P>
   So who was the gal who dipped snuff?
</P>
<P>
   ``The one that comes to mind was Wanda,'' Kim said.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was a nice-looking blonde, but you probably wouldn't want
to cross her, if you know what I mean.''
</P>
<P>
   Sounds to me like somebody needs to enter Wanda in the contest.

 &HT;    Teacher charged with abuse of disabled students
 &HT;    By Brian D. Crecente
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   OKEECHOBEE, Fla. _ An Okeechobee High School teacher has been
charged with 12 counts of child abuse for allegedly physically and
mentally abusing six of her disabled students over a 16-month
period.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth M. McDeavitt, 48, a special education teacher for 12
years at the school, turned herself in Sept. 24 after the sheriff's
office had been investigating for two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Over the 16-month period, beginning in May 1997, McDeavitt
allegedly pushed, smacked and pinched students even after a
teachers aide and a student's family members complained to the
principal, according to police reports.
</P>
<P>
   District officials said they didn't learn of the alleged abuse
until they were contacted by the sheriff's office last month. The
sheriff's office was contacted by a child-abuse hotline.
</P>
<P>
   Among the charges of abuse against McDeavitt:
</P>
<P>
   _ Hitting a 13-year-old student on the hand with a stapler in
one instance and in another, grabbing the student by the hair and
hitting him on the chest over his pacemaker until he cried.
</P>
<P>
   _ Hitting a student in the arm with a phone and later throwing a
chair and stapler at her.
</P>
<P>
   _ Taking students into a bathroom and hitting them until they
cried.
</P>
<P>
   A teacher at the school told police that McDeavitt was
particularly hard on one student, yelling and screaming at the
student so loud that she could be heard in other classrooms. After
one episode, McDeavitt allegedly told the other teacher, ``If you
don't take him, I'm going to kill the little bastard,'' according
to police. The student was transferred to the other teacher's
class.
</P>
<P>
   McDeavitt of 4240 S.E. 128th Ave. could not be contacted for
comment Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Okeechobee School Assistant Superintendent Lee Dixon said he is
investigating the incidents, involving students 13 to 17 years old,
and the manner in which the incidents were reported.
</P>
<P>
   McDeavitt is still working at the district's administrative
office until the school and criminal investigations are concluded,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's working in a capacity where she is not with children,
just as a precaution,'' Dixon said.
</P>
<P>
   Sheriff's detectives interviewed two teacher aides, two
therapists, two counselors and another teacher who reported seeing
or hearing physical and verbal abuse. Detective Brad Stark said he
is still investigating.
</P>
<P>
   Several of the children's parents contacted Thursday said the
abuse should have been discovered sooner.
</P>
<P>
   The uncle of a 15-year-old girl and 16-year-old boy who were hit
and shoved said family members spoke to Principal Deborah James
about the children's complaints and were told the accusations were
unfounded.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first they were afraid to tell their parents,'' the uncle
said. I think the principal should have gone to the class and
talked to the students privately after we went to her.''
</P>
<P>
   Another boy's father said he suspected last year that his son
was being abused by McDeavitt.
</P>
<P>
   He said he visited the classroom and saw McDeavitt sitting at
her desk sewing while most of the students sat in a semi-circle
doing nothing. His son sat at a desk. McDeavitt told the father
that his son was at the desk because he had been bad.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I started to leave, my son started to cry,'' he said.
``Three or four times after that he was crying in the morning and
didn't want to go to school.
</P>
<P>
   ``These kids are all mentally handicapped children, they don't
comprehend that she isn't allowed to do this and that they should
tell someone when she does,'' the father said.
</P>
<P>
   Dixon said he is investigating whether those reports to the
school principal were followed up as they should have been.
</P>
<P>
   ``So far I have not found anything that would be a problem,'' he
said. ``I'm still looking into it and I'd rather not comment any
further.''
</P>
<P>
   Superintendent Phoebe Raulerson said of the allegations, ``I
have no tolerance for this, but she is innocent until she is proven
guilty and we have to live with that. There have been other
incidents of child abuse in the past. We are trying to become
sensitive to this problem.''
</P>
<P>
   On April 7 a popular Okeechobee High School special education
teacher was charged with four counts of sexual battery on a child
in custodial care for allegedly raping three students at the
school.
</P>
<P>
   Stevan E. Suarez, who had been working for the district for less
than a year, was suspended without pay. He was released on $200,000
bond on April 22.
</P>
<P>
   Dixon said the district is worried that two sets of accusations
have occurred so close together but said officials will have to
wait for the outcome of the trials before they decide if any
procedural changes are in order.
</P>
<P>
   ``We reviewed our hiring practices after the Suarez
accusations,'' he said. ``I don't think there were any problems
with personnel procedures in this case.'' He said there were no
complaints about McDeavitt prior to this.
</P>
<P>
   One parent said he is going to talk to the school board about
installing monitors in classrooms with disabled children to prevent
this from happening again.
</P>
<P>
   ``My wife and I are both pretty upset about this but there is
really nothing else we can do,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   McDeavitt was released on $30,000 bond on Sept. 24.

 &HT;    Interview with Joel and Ethan Coen
 &HT;    By Chris Garcia
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Recently, Joel and Ethan Coen took a gander at
their first feature film, ``Blood Simple.'' And then they engaged
in mutual wincing.
</P>
<P>
   What a difference 14 years make.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were a little shocked at it's quality,'' says a laughing
Ethan, ``and not in a positive way. That's sort of why we've been
working on it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah,'' adds Joel, ``that's sort of the reason for `Blood
Simple 2000,' as we call it now.''
</P>
<P>
   Joining the ``director's cut'' frenzy spawned by the quantum
advances in postproduction technology, the Coen brothers are giving
a face lift to the trailblazing crime-thriller Filmmaker magazine
has stationed at No. 9 on its ``50 Most Important Independent
Films'' list and Entertainment Weekly placed on its ``Greatest
Indie Films of All Time'' list.
</P>
<P>
   Largely credited with renewing interest in noir, ``Blood
Simple'' has deeply influenced a generation of young filmmakers.
``Pulp Fiction,'' ``Shallow Grave,'' even the Coens' ``Fargo'' owe
style debts to the gleefully macabre caper, which deftly mixed
blood and belly-laughs.
</P>
<P>
   The prospect of messing with the low-budget flick, which was
filmed in and around Austin, has left disciples of the brothers
Coen rubbing their goatees. Like, what's to fix? As Austinite Harry
Knowles, great Buddha of all that is Hollywood on the Web,
protests: ``I can't imagine a recut of `Blood Simple,' but whaaat
ever.''
</P>
<P>
   But think about it. Consider the first thing you ever made so
many years ago. Try not to gag.
</P>
<P>
   That's what happened when the Coens were approached to put
together a special laser disc reissue of the movie. ``We said OK,''
says Joel, ``but that we'd like to work on the movie before we do
it.''
</P>
<P>
   The result is a rejiggered edition of the film, which, depending
on whom you ask, has been retitled ``Blood Simple 2000'' or ``Blood
Simple _ Forever Young.'' The Coens will introduce the new version
Saturday at the Paramount Theatre as part of the Austin Film
Festival. At that time, they promise, they will explain the new
title, whichever one they decide on.
</P>
<P>
   Also expected to attend are original cast members M. Emmet Walsh
and John Getz, as well as cinematographer Barry Sonnenfeld. Frances
McDormand will be stuck in New York, where she's starring in an
off-Broadway play.
</P>
<P>
   During a conference call from their Manhattan office, the Coens
report they've cut 4 1/2 minutes from the original 96-minute
running time, remastered the entire soundtrack _ upgrading it from
mono to stereo _ and remixed Carter Burwell's original score. Some
scenes have been reordered ``in a very minor way,'' Joel says.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not that different,'' he adds, ``but in some ways it's
substantially _ `` He cuts himself off, then gingerly proceeds:
``There have been changes made.''
</P>
<P>
   Talking with the Coens is like that. They are cryptic and not a
little odd. They laugh way too much, in unison and at the wrong
things. You ask something pretty straightforward and then they
laugh like horses. You would blush (They're mucking with me . . .
help . . . ) but you're alone on the other end of 1,500 miles of
phone line. They can't see you. You blush anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``We added a laugh track,'' says Ethan, who's now placing first
for title of Wisenheimer of the Year.
</P>
<P>
   The new version, he says in a sober moment, ``does look better.
The movie proper is different than what you've seen. It's revisited
and somewhat improved.''
</P>
<P>
   Ethan is the younger brother, and maybe that accounts for his
random laughing jags, which have a whiff of spooky solipsism to
them. It's a theory that would vaporize under scientific scrutiny.
Ethan is 40.
</P>
<P>
   Joel (lower voice, longer answers, fewer guffaws) is 43. Which
means the brothers from Minnesota were mere babes _ 26 and 29 _
when they conspired to fashion one of the wickedest debuts in
modern low-budget film.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the team _ Joel directs, Ethan produces, both write
and edit their films _ has forged an oeuvre that includes some of
the most ambitious, visually flamboyant, downright strange movies
in recent American film. From the postmodern noir of ``Blood
Simple'' and ``Fargo'' to the surreal fantasias of ``Barton Fink''
and ``The Big Lebowski,'' the Coens tangle the cinematic panache of
Orson Welles, dadaesque high jinks of the Marx Brothers and
slow-burn violence of David Lynch into one dazzling knot.
</P>
<P>
   They are well-versed film geeks: Ethan studied philosophy at
Princeton University and Joel studied film at New York University,
with a one-semester stint at the University of Texas. This Austin
interlude weighed big on the brothers' decision to set ``Blood
Simple'' here.
</P>
<P>
   ``It actually did influence the script to the extent it was a
place where we knew people who would be interested in working on
the movie . . . people who were cheap, cheap, cheap,'' Joel says.
</P>
<P>
   Austinites might recognize the old Pecan Street Cafe on Sixth
Street as the barren loft where Frances McDormand's character
shacks up after fleeing her husband (Dan Hedaya), and Mount
Bonnell, where M. Emmet Walsh's and Hedaya's characters plot some
murders. A Round Rock bar and several spots in Hutto were also used
in the film.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's screening is the world premiere of the revamped
``Blood Simple,'' which will be theatrically released in the
spring. ``We wanted to do it in Austin because we shot it there and
a lot of people who worked on the movie lived in Austin or still
live there,'' Joel says. ``We thought this would be a nice way of
showing it to the people who worked on it originally.''
</P>
<P>
   While ``Fargo'' has been the Coens' most spectacular hit to
date, winning Oscars for best screenplay and best actress (for
McDormand, Joel's wife), it was ``Blood Simple'' that heralded the
arrival of an exciting new film force.
</P>
<P>
   Like the similarly bloody-funny ``Reservoir Dogs'' eight years
later, ``Simple'' took the indie world by storm, playing at the New
York Film Festival to rapturous notices and winning the Grand Jury
Prize at Sundance and best director and best actor (for Walsh)
trophies at the Independent Spirit Awards.
</P>
<P>
   Not every critic was smitten. ``The movie has a kind of tawdry
flamboyance that draws attention to itself,'' noted an early
review. ``(It's) too brightly polished.'' Another quibbled that the
movie had ``the heart of a Bloomingdale's window and the soul of a
re(accent)sume(accent).'' Some believed the film's conventional
slickness was there simply to catch Hollywood's eye.
</P>
<P>
   ``It certainly wasn't intended that way,'' Joel says. ``There
weren't any motives behind it, except to get a movie made and do
this particular story the way we thought was the best and most
appropriate way to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Blood Simple's'' stylish bravura still startles. The creepy
thriller seems to move on greased roller skates, its camera a
propulsive engine, gliding over shiny bar tops and barreling
warp-speed across suburban lawns. The cinematography by Barry
Sonnenfeld, who now directs blockbusters like ``Get Shorty'' and
``Men in Black,'' strip-mined the visual vocabulary, alluding to
the lurid lighting and topsy-turvy angles of noir classics like
``Touch of Evil'' and adding his and the Coens' own flourishes.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the visual motifs _ ceiling fans ominously chopping the
air, spreading pools of blood, rays of light beaming through bullet
holes _ have become neo-noir touchstones.
</P>
<P>
   The Coens owe a lot of their flair to Sam Raimi, the visionary
auteur who loosed the demented horror spoofs ``The Evil Dead'' and
``Evil Dead 2.'' Joel worked with Raimi on ``Evil Dead'' and Raimi
later worked on the brothers' ``Hudsucker Proxy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was most influenced by Sam, to be honest,'' Joel says.
</P>
<P>
   With the mother of invention hard in labor on his micro-budget
sets, Raimi contrived ways to mimic dolly and crane shots with
hammer and nails. His greatest creation was the ``Shaky-Cam,''
whose swooshing effects can be seen in ``Blood Simple.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a poor-man's Steady-Cam,'' Joel laughs. ``You put a real
wide lens on a camera, put it in the middle of a two-by-four, and
run with it. It's a low-budget thing.''
</P>
<P>
   It's this sort of innovation that's sustained ``Blood Simple's''
legacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It continues to buck the trend of the indie film as
introspective and just a bunch of talking heads,'' says Mike Jones,
associate editor of Filmmaker magazine. ``It showed what indie
filmmakers can do, and that's tell stories with the actors and
camera, not the dialogue. The movie introduced the Coens as
filmmakers of subtlety. They didn't linger in dialogue, they
lingered in body language.''
</P>
<P>
   Some argue that it also introduced the now-overemployed device
of mingling gore and guffaws.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a funny thing,'' Ethan says. ``You hear it once in a
while, in spite of the fact it's patently not true. It's not as if
there weren't murders and laughs before we came along.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the Coens insist they don't see it. For them,
``Blood Simple'' induces winces, not awe. ``I'm not aware it has
any importance,'' Ethan says. ``I'm surprised some people still
remember it.''

 &HT;    What Dreams May Come just feels like an eternity
 &HT;    By Dave Larsen
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Heaven and hell are what we make them in our minds, according to
What Dreams May Come , a romantic drama based on the fantasy novel
by Richard Matheson. For art lovers Chris and Annie Nielsen,
paradise is a warmly hued Maxfield Parrish painting. Hades is
Hieronymous Bosch.
</P>
<P>
   For viewers, however, hell may very well be this movie.
</P>
<P>
   What Dreams May Come sets its cloying tone with the cute meeting
between Chris (Robin Williams) and Annie (Annabella Sciorra) on an
idyllic mountain lake. In short order, they fall in love, get
married and have two children _ who are killed before the title
sequence is through. The maudlin parade of death continues with
Chris being crushed in a spectacular car crash. Flash back to Annie
putting the family dog to sleep for good measure.
</P>
<P>
   Heavy-handed pop philosophy is piled on just as thickly once
Chris arrives in his own personal version of heaven _ Annie's
Parrish-like painting of the lake where they met. Paintings, as the
late neurosurgeon told a young patient, ``are the most important
thing in the world.'' With wet, brilliant colors squishing
underfoot, Chris and his spiritual guide, Albert (Cuba Gooding
Jr.), engage in shallow new-age musings on the nature of existence,
while the dead Dalmatian trots behind.
</P>
<P>
   It's a bunch of head-scratching hokum delivered in the
annoyingly calm, measured tones of a condescending therapist.
</P>
<P>
   The story, adapted by Ron Bass ( Rainman ), is pure melodrama.
Chris is reunited with his children, who take on unexpected forms
in the afterlife, and together they resolve their personal
conflicts, revealed in narrative-stopping flashbacks. Annie,
meanwhile, is wracked by guilt over the many deaths and commits
suicide.
</P>
<P>
   ``Suicides go somewhere else,'' Albert informs Chris. A surreal
Bosch triptych over Annie's bed foreshadows the setting. Aided by a
wise old tracker (Max Von Sydow), Chris defiantly follows in search
of his ``soul mate.''
</P>
<P>
   What Dreams May Come is visually breathtaking, from the
Victorian-garbed figures who fly through a gilded city to the pale
lost souls who encircle and engulf Chris' boat as he sails into the
underworld. Director Vincent Ward ( Map of the Human Heart )
changed Annie's occupation from a caterer in the book to a painter,
allowing heaven and hell to be portrayed as a series of paintings

   But it's like an elaborate frame around an empty canvas. Ward's
dreamlike film has no emotion beyond touchy-feely sentiment, and it
moves at an agonizingly slow pace.
</P>
<P>
   Williams and Gooding Jr., back-to-back Oscar winners for Good
Will Hunting and Jerry Maguire , can't compete with the scenery or
do much with the inane dialogue. Williams resorts to an irksome,
impish grin, with occasional flashes of shtick. Gooding Jr. spends
the first third of the movie as a blurry special effect.

 &HT;    Walton may find starter seat filled by Applewhite
 &HT;    By Mark Wangrin
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN _ Richard Walton may get his cast off next week.
</P>
<P>
   He may never get his job back.
</P>
<P>
   When the Texas Longhorns' quarterback returns from a broken hand
suffered against UCLA on Sept. 12, he'll have to battle Major
Applewhite to win back his starting job, Coach Mack Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our philosophy is we play the guy who'll give us the best
chance to win a ballgame,'' Brown said. ``It's not our philosophy
that a guy can't lose his job because of injury.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown said he changed his approach over the years to be more
fair, and to make certain each player knew a bad week of practice
could mean a good seat on the bench.
</P>
<P>
   ``That fits in with our philosophy that every spot, except for
Ricky's (Williams), is up for grabs every week,'' Brown said.
``Part of the decision will be on how (Walton's) doing in practice
when he comes back. We'll start whoever's best that week in
practice.''
</P>
<P>
   Applewhite has been a pleasant surprise to the Longhorns
coaches, who were concerned that his inexperience and preseason
inconsistency would seriously hamstring the offense. Instead, the
redshirt freshman has been efficient calling audibles and has shown
an ability to do what teams have dared him to do _ throw deep.
</P>
<P>
   His teammates have accepted him as a leader to the point of
good-natured razzing _ receiver Wane McGarity, who's been his
favorite target, whistled the theme from ``The Andy Griffith Show''
as Applewhite (a.k.a. Opie) held a press conference Monday.
</P>
<P>
   One of Applewhite's most effective qualities has been his grasp
of his role in the offense. He was seated in front of the
microphone Monday when word came that Williams needed to get his
interview session out of the way because he had a pressing
commitment. Before the request was finished, Applewhite jumped out
of the chair and was soon standing inconspicuously off to the side.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quarterbacks lose games with their egos,'' Applewhite said.
</P>
<P>
   Walton, a pre-med student, showed a fine grasp of the offense
and has a stronger arm. At 6 feet, 5 inches, he is four inches
taller than Applewhite, which allows him better downfield vision.
</P>
<P>
   Statistically, they have both done very well.
</P>
<P>
   Applewhite is connecting on 55.4 percent of his passes, is
averaging 8.6 yards per completion, and has thrown three touchdowns
and two interceptions. The Horns have scored on 43 percent of the
drives he has engineered and have averaged 2.9 points per drive.
His NCAA pass efficiency rating is 136.31, 28th in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Walton is completing 67.4 percent of his passes, is averaging an
impressive 11.1 yards per attempt and has thrown one touchdown and
no interceptions. Texas has scored on 52 percent of his drives; his
average points per drive is 3.3. His rating is 168.49, which would
rank him 10th nationally if he had enough attempts to qualify.
</P>
<P>
   That has given Brown one of those good problems _ deciding
between two positives instead of the lesser of two evils.
</P>
<P>
   Brown's track record backs up his stance that Walton would not
get special consideration for being a fifth-year senior who
patiently backed up James Brown for three seasons before getting
his chance, or for being the incumbent starter.
</P>
<P>
   At North Carolina, Brown benched starter Jason Stanicek for the
Sun Bowl in favor of Mike Thomas. During the last two seasons,
Chris Keldorf and Oscar Davenport have taken turns winning and then
losing the starting job.

<P>
   Translating a Saturday Night Live sketch to the big screen is a
hit-or-miss proposition. For every Wayne's World , there's a slew
of stinkers such as Stuart Saves His Family and It's Pat .
</P>
<P>
   The Roxbury Guys, two head-bobbing, club-hopping losers in
iridescent suits, seem prime candidates for the latter heap. Their
shtick is pretty much limited to relentless come-ons, furious
nose-scratching and spastic contact dancing, set to the throbbing
techno beat of Haddaway's What Is Love .
</P>
<P>
   The entire act is played out during the opening titles of A
Night at the Roxbury .
</P>
<P>
   Yet the latest SNL spinoff isn't as terrible as one would
expect. Sure, it's blissfully idiotic, and it feels much longer
than 84 minutes, but the inane comedy provides a few chuckles _ as
well as genuine laughs at its conclusion with a clever send-up of
the emotional climaxes from Say Anything and Jerry Maguire .
</P>
<P>
   Put it just below Coneheads in the hierarchy of expanded sketch
movies.
</P>
<P>
   Steve and Doug Butabi (Will Ferrell and Chris Kattan) are
would-be swingers who live at home, work at their father's plastic
plant store and spend their evenings at LA's hottest nightspots.
Make that trying to get into LA's hottest nightspots.
</P>
<P>
   Tall, easygoing Steve and wiry, assertive Doug aren't nearly as
cool as they think. They dream of opening their own club, but they
would be happy just to get past the doorman at the ultra-hip
Roxbury. Fortune smiles on them when their delivery van is
rear-ended by a litigation-shy Richard Grieco, looking bloated and
oily as himself, who happily escorts the Butabis past the velvet
rope into ``hottie'' heaven.
</P>
<P>
   Believe it or not, there's a nod to Charlie Chaplin's City
Lights as the boys' chance to realize their dream is crushed by the
insensitive chauffeur ( SNL 's Colin Quinn) of Roxbury owner Mr.
Zadir (Chazz Palminteri). The brothers are driven further apart by
a seemingly shy neighbor ( SNL 's Molly Shannon) determined to
manipulate Steve into marriage and a merger of the family
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   The story by Ferrell, Kattan and Steve Koren is loaded with lame
gags and gross-out humor, but works better than the tapped-out
television sketch.
</P>
<P>
   Wait to see A Night at the Roxbury some night at the Danbarry.
You should have no trouble getting in.

   GLASS-COLUMN _ TV sets can now be found in 99.7 percent of U.S.
homes, capturing over-the-air, cable and satellite signals. The
images we watch are sharper, usually in color and larger than they
were six decades ago. But basic transmission standards, which
impose a limit on overall quality, are the same as in 1939. That is
about to change in November with the rollout of digital television,
or DTV. (Glass, Cox News Service) MOVED
</P>
<P>
   TEEPEN-COLUMN _ The disturbing partisanship of the House
impeachment process so far stands in dramatic contrast to
Congress's sober management of the impeachment inquiry into the
Nixon presidency. The signs are few that procedures even
approximating bipartisanship are likely to evolve. (Teepen, Cox
News Service) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   KLEINBERG-COLUMN _ The first thing to understand about the
English language is that it is not like the Ten Commandments; there
are no rules sent down by a higher authority. Prescriptive rules of
the English language are based on usage. (Kleinberg, Cox News

</P>
<P>
   MURRAY-COLUMN _ LUFKIN, Texas _ The Lufkin Daily News has
dedicated a new flagpole in memory of Thomas R. Meredith, complete
with a granite marker that notes his tenure as publisher, 1965-78.
(Murray, Cox News Service)

<P>
   BORDERS-COLUMN _ Baseball is back. Reports of its death were
exaggerated. Sure, the players make a ridiculous amount of money,
still spit too much and have all adopted goatees that give even a
.235 utility infielder a vaguely menacing look. (Borders,
Nacogdoches Daily Sentinel) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   MCCARTY-COLUMN _ Ball caps. My house is overrun with ball caps.
I never attached much meaning to it, until Jim's indignant reaction
this week to an NPR piece about the proliferation of ball caps
among follically challenged Baby Boomers. (McCarty, Dayton Daily
News) MOVED.

   KELSO-COLUMN _ AUSTIN, Texas _ He's a retired Austin cop whose
friends call him ``Pooh.'' He pitches washers and horseshoes and
wears a belt buckle the size of a candy dish. He's Michael ``Pooh''
Phillips, 49, of Round Rock, one of about 20 people entered so far
in the American-Statesman's Tallest, Truest Texan contest. (Kelso,
Austin American-Statesman) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   KABAT-COLUMN _ I have spent a lot of time hovering outside men's
restrooms. No, this isn't a confession. It's a fact of life for any
mother of small boys. When my sons were infants, I thought the day
would never come when they'd be able to go to the restroom by
themselves when we were out in public. (Kabat, Waco Tribune-Herald)

 By IVOR DAVIS 
 Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Hollywood seems to be taking note of the fact that the century
is racing to its conclusion. And just like the Victorians at the
end of the 19th century, with their seances and their interest in
the occult, movie makers are preoccupied with some very strange
stuff.
 &HT;    Witness the current and future spate of movies dealing with
death, dying, angels, the afterlife, heaven and hell.
 &HT;    Just out is Robin Williams in ``What Dreams May Come,'' a
romantic drama complete with special effects, set in the afterlife.
Williams literally goes through hell to be reunited with his former
wife and soulmate (Annabella Sciorra).
 &HT;    He's in heaven after dying in a car crash. His wife, however, is
down below _ after killing herself from grief at losing her husband
and family. Robin makes the journey from paradise to the underworld
to rescue his true love.
 &HT;    In November, Brad Pitt plays the Grim Reaper himself in the very
offbeat ``Meet Joe Black,'' inspired by the l934 Frederic March
classic ``Death Takes a Holiday.'' Death assumes the face of the
recently killed Pitt, who while vacationing from his gruesome
duties falls madly in love with businessman Anthony Hopkins'
daughter (Claire Forlani) and discovers there's more to life than
death.
 &HT;    ``There was much talk of death on the set and how we would like
to die,'' recalls Hopkins, who last worked with Pitt in the movie
``Legends of the Fall.''
 &HT;    Pitt may seem rather unlikely casting for a fellow usually
depicted in a hooded robe carrying a scythe, but Hollywood seems to
have a penchant for turning death into a pretty face. Remember
Robert Redford as the unwelcome visitor to a very old lady played
by Gladys Cooper in an early episode of ``The Twilight Zone''?.
 &HT;    Director Martin Brest says they chose Pitt to avoid being
gruesome and heavy handed about the topic. ``I thought Brad had
that slightly otherworldly presence we needed,'' he told
Entertainment Weekly.
 &HT;    Nicole Kidman also takes a foray into the realm of the
supernatural, teaming up with Sandra Bullock in ``Practical
Magic,'' a spiritual tale about two women who happen to be New
England witches. The film, which opens Oct. 9, is based on Alice
Hoffman's novel.
 &HT;    Also upcoming (Nov. 6) is ``Jack Frost,'' with Michael Keaton as
a musician who dies in a Christmas car crash and comes back to life
... as a snowman. ``He's a funny, hip guy,'' says Keaton, ``who's
been transferred to a new body and finds cool things to do with
it.'' (That's cool as in snow, presumably). Keaton stepped into
this role after George Clooney, who took over from Keaton as
Batman, dropped out.
 &HT;    Earlier this year Nicholas Cage stepped out of the afterlife in
``City of Angels,'' as the angelic being who falls in love with
surgeon Meg Ryan and decides he wants to enjoy earthly joys with
her. He makes it back in the land of living _ just as Meg
unfortunately exits. The weepy romance was quite a hit among teens.
 &HT;    Woody Allen, for whom a preoccupation with dying is nothing new,
this past year gave us ``Deconstructing Harry,'' which included his
rather hilarious descent by elevator into hell, accompanied by Old
Nick himself, played by Billy Crystal.
 &HT;    Of course, Hollywood long ago learned that movies about dying
can be very profitable. Films like ``Ordinary People'' (1980),
``Terms of Endearment'' (1983) and ``Philadelphia'' (1993) all told
stories in which key characters died.
 &HT;    In the same vein, Meryl Streep plays a mother dying of cancer in
``One True Thing,'' based on Anna Quindlan's l995 novel. The
performance will certainly earn Streep another Oscar nomination for
best actress.
 &HT;    In the tearjerker ``Stepmom'' (opening in December), Susan
Sarandon is a wife and mother who discovers she's dying and
reluctantly coaches her ex's new wife Julia Roberts to step into
her shoes.
 &HT;    And in ``The Theory of Flight'' (opening, believe it or not, on
Christmas Day) Helena Bonham Carter is dying of a neurological
disease and must use a wheelchair. She wants to lose her virginity
before she dies _ and asks Kenneth Branagh to help her achieve her
goal. (This is the couple's first on screen pairing since their
offscreen romance went public.)
 &HT;    In ``Patch Adams,'' Robin Williams is back as a doctor who tries
to treat his terminally ill patients with humor, ``looking at death
lightheartedly,'' as the actor puts it. In l999 Williams will show
up in ``Jakob The Liar,'' this time a cheery story about death and
the Warsaw ghetto. ``Yeah--that was a nice double bill,'' he muses,
``to go from 'Dreams' to 'Jakob the Liar.'''
 &HT;    How are we expected to take all this dwelling on the dark side
without running from the theater in panic? Meryl Streep for one
thinks the answer is perfectly natural. ``We need to feel something
when we go to movies,'' she says. ``We need to cry ... It's OK.''
 &HT;    She cites ``Titanic'' as the ideal death movie. ``Leonardo
DiCaprio goes down in the depths and the kids cry and they put down
their money to go again and again.''

WHY WASHINGTON IS STUCK ON FLYTRAP 
</HEADLINE>
  By DAVID PLOTZ 
 (www.slate.com) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Everyone in Washington has a theory about why we are frothing
about a scandal that no one else much cares about.
</P>
<P>
   I have counted at least 20 of them, speculation about everything
from Washington's innate prudery to its unconscious desire for
parliamentary government.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the theories, or at least most of the convincing ones,
fall into one of five categories, presented here in ascending order
of relevance.
</P>
<P>
   Law: In a recent National Journal article, Jonathan Rauch makes
the case that Washington's Flytrap rage partly stems from our legal
culture. The majority of D.C.'s opinion elite, I would bet, holds
law degrees, and legalism is the city's lingua franca. This makes
D.C. especially susceptible to Flytrap, because the scandal looks
worse to lawyers than to anyone.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton lied under oath: In legalistic D.C., that is more than
enough cause to damn him. The rest of the country, which doesn't
share our legal fixation, has the good sense to recognize that some
kinds of lies (even under oath) are more innocent than others.
</P>
<P>
   Moral One-Upmanship: In its soul, Washington is no more upset
about adultery and fooling around with interns than the rest of the
country is. But we are extremely sensitive to charges of moral
laxity: We're terrified of being depicted as licentious, godless
hedonists who tolerate a Caligula. So we fake outrage, certifying
our moral credentials by acting holier than thou.
</P>
<P>
   Geography: Or, rather, proximity. At a distance, the Clinton of
Flytrap is an everyday sinner. But at a pore's-eye view, with six
years of his lies fresh in your memory, he seems pathologically
manipulative, deceptive, and sex-crazed. The more we learned about
Flytrap--cigars, phone calls, etc.--the worse he seemed.
</P>
<P>
   Furthurmore, elite Washington, by virtue of proximity to
Clinton, takes Flytrap personally. Outside the Beltway, no one
knows who John Podesta is or cares that Clinton lied to him. But in
Washington, Clinton's lies to aides were a slap, a betrayal of one
of us.
</P>
<P>
   Economics: Flytrap serves Washington's economic self-interest.
As Watergate made the careers of scores of pols and journalists, so
investigative reporters (Michael Isikoff), editorial writers
(Howell Raines), pundits (you name 'em), and politicians (any
Republican on the House Judiciary Committee) have hitched their
wagons to Flytrap. Hence, we have every incentive to keep the tar
boiling.
</P>
<P>
   Sociology: The least appreciated reason for D.C.'s Clinton mania
is the city's peculiar social organization. Nicholas Lemann, who's
writing a book on elites, argues that Washington in the '90s is
America in the '50s. The rest of the nation has become
entrepreneurial and individualistic, but Washington, says Lemann,
is still home to the organization man. In D.C., we work for big
institutions, believe in them, and expect wisdom from the smart,
honorable people who rise to the top of them. By Washington's
standard, then, Clinton's greatest crime is not that he lied or
leched. It is that he shamed our institution. If government and the
presidency are embarrassed, then we are diminished. Our self-worth
depends on the worth of our institution.
</P>
<P>
   Most Americans, fortunately, couldn't care less. They are too
busy getting and spending for themselves to worry much about the
respectability of Clinton and the strength of his organization.
It's not their institution that's being disgraced. It's not their
loyalty that's being tested. It's not their problem.

GREENSPAN'S UNSURPRISING MOVE 
</HEADLINE>
  By JAMES SUROWIECKI 
 (www.slate.com) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   At some point in the last couple of weeks, it became a foregone
conclusion that the Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee would
announce an interest-rate cut Tuesday afternoon. In fact, it became
such a foregone conclusion that investors began speculating
about--and in some cases anticipating--that the rate cut would not
be a mere quarter-point cut, but rather a half-point cut. Hopes of
that probably contributed to a run-up in stock prices Tuesday, and
to a more generally bullish tone on the Street in the past week.
</P>
<P>
   Those hopes were, of course, dashed at 2:15 p.m., when the FOMC
announced that, as expected, it would be trimming the Fed Funds
rate by a quarter point.
</P>
<P>
   Hopes for the half-point cut were essentially idle ones, since
Greenspan's reputation for caution is well-deserved and since the
Fed remains populated by inflation hawks, even in these
deflationary times.
</P>
<P>
   More to the point, there was an unhealthy undertone to much of
the pleading for a larger rate cut. This undertone suggested that
the Fed would be well-served to give U.S. stock prices a boost in
these turbulent times, and that a half-point cut would send the
signal that the bull could resume its run.
</P>
<P>
   Needless to say, Greenspan has no interest in propping up still
historically-high stock valuations, and the dreams of a rate-cut
rally smacked of the lamest sort of pie-in-the-sky thinking.
</P>
<P>
   From one angle, in fact, if the Fed had instituted a half-point
cut (or if it had cut the discount rate instead of the Fed Funds
rate), investors would have a better reason to sell than with the
quarter-point cut. A half-point cut, after all, would have been a
sign that the Fed thought real trouble was just around the corner,
and that only a flood of credit into the economy could save it from
recession.
</P>
<P>
   What the quarter-point cut sends instead is the message that
we've grown accustomed to Greenspan sending: Things are dicier than
they've been, but the United States is still in good shape. It's a
message you can disagree with, but it's not a message anyone should
have been surprised to hear.

HOWARD STERN IS OBSOLETE 
</HEADLINE>
  By JEFFREY GOLDBERG 
 (www.slate.com) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Over the past year, I've learned three new things about Howard
Stern: He's possibly the tallest Jew in the world; he carries a
gun; and, as a cultural phenomenon, he is very much over.
</P>
<P>
   For this last, most pertinent, fact, he has the Office of the
Independent Counsel to thank.
</P>
<P>
   Stern's new TV program, ``The Howard Stern Radio Show,'' which
appears Saturday nights on an ever-shrinking number of CBS-owned
and affiliated stations, is a nonstarter. (Two stations--one in
Arizona and one in Texas--have dropped the Stern show since it
premiered Aug. 26, citing offensiveness. Its ratings hover just
above zero.)
</P>
<P>
   The show's problems go deeper than bad writing or crappy
production values. Imagine watching Lenny Bruce perform in 1990.
That's what it's like listening to Stern today. He was the Vasco da
Gama of porn radio, a man who sailed fearlessly into the uncharted
sea of lesbian mud wrestling and jigaboo jokes. He was--and this
seems so quaint--enemy No. 1 of the Federal Communications
Commission and of middle America.
</P>
<P>
   But time has passed him by. What Starr can say, Stern can't. Now
that the insertion of cigars into female genitalia is a
prosecutable offense, sex is no longer funny. And if sex is no
longer funny, Stern is no longer funny.
</P>
<P>
   Stern's technique is to bully second-tier celebrities into
revealing embarrassing facts about their sex lives; Starr's
technique is to bully Starr-created celebrities into revealing
embarrassing facts about their sex lives in exchange for
transactional immunity. It is the promise of immunity, I think,
that makes Starr's interviews so much more raunchy.
</P>
<P>
   Two days before the Clinton deposition videotape aired, I
watched on tape this exchange between Stern and a woman named
Kendra, described by Stern as ``the chick in the tabloids who slept
with Jerry Springer'':
</P>
<P>
   Stern: You grabbed his crotch?
</P>
<P>
   Kendra: Yes.
</P>
<P>
   Stern: Over his pants?
</P>
<P>
   Kendra: Yes.
</P>
<P>
   Stern: You didn't put your hand down his pants?
</P>
<P>
   Kendra: Yes, I did.
</P>
<P>
   Stern: Oh, that's so sexy. You are a bad girl. ... Did he put
his hand under your dress?
</P>
<P>
   Kendra: Yeah, I think so.
</P>
<P>
   Here is an exchange between President Clinton and a member of
Starr's staff, Solomon Wisenberg (far too weighty a name for a man
engaged in such bawdy proceedings):
</P>
<P>
   Wisenberg: The question is, if Monica Lewinsky says that while
you were in the Oval Office area you touched her breasts, would she
be lying?
</P>
<P>
   Clinton: That is not my recollection ...
</P>
<P>
   Wisenberg: If she said that you kissed her breasts, would she be
lying?
</P>
<P>
   Clinton: I'm going to revert to my former statement.
</P>
<P>
   Wisenberg: OK. If Monica Lewinsky says that while you were in
the Oval Office area you touched her genitalia, would she be lying?
And that calls for a yes, no, or reverting to your former
statement.
</P>
<P>
   And so on.
</P>
<P>
   The flaw of Stern's show is not that it's offensive but that
it's boring. The problem is apparent early on: It's impossible to
listen to Stern in a stationary position. Like many bands--have you
ever tried to listen to Aerosmith in your living room?--Stern can
really only be enjoyed while driving or doing something else, like
washing your car.
</P>
<P>
   But about the gun, which brings us to the outmoded idea that
Stern is a dangerous force in society:
</P>
<P>
   Early this spring, while I was transacting a piece of
journalistic business at New York Police Department headquarters,
the police commissioner, Howard Safir, asked me if I wanted to meet
Stern. I was raised on Long Island, and the only island celebrity I
had previously met was Dee Snider from the band Twisted Sister, so
how could I say no to Stern?
</P>
<P>
   There was quite a buzz of anticipation running through police
headquarters--New York City cops, particularly those residing on
Long and Staten islands, make up the hardest core of Stern's fans.
But police brass, like most conservative, middle-aged men, tend to
</P>
<P>
   view Stern as a subversive force worthy of surveillance.
</P>
<P>
   ``What do I say to this guy?'' the commissioner asked me, as if
I should know. It turned out that Safir was only vaguely aware of
Stern's mission, which was to thank the NYPD for renewing his gun
license.
</P>
<P>
   Stern was escorted into the commissioner's office, and the two
men shook hands. Stern looked, not to put too fine a point on it,
dirty, and I noticed that Safir steered him clear of the shiny oak
desk once used by Teddy Roosevelt. I also noticed that Stern is
incredibly tall, taller even than Safir, who was, at that point,
the tallest Jew I thought I had ever met. Height, a first name and
a tribe are all they had in common.
</P>
<P>
   ``When did you get your license?'' Safir asked Stern.
</P>
<P>
   ``Five years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Good. No one can blame me,'' Safir said, and you know he meant
it.
</P>
<P>
   Stern was rattled: ``I get all nervous around here. Lot of
cops,'' he told the commissioner. Stern explained that fear of
unstable fans had led him to seek a gun permit. They talked for
another minute, and then Stern escaped.
</P>
<P>
   Later, in the elevator, the commissioner said, ``I half expected
that guy to show up in handcuffs,'' and he was serious. I could
tell that Safir, like many other adults, misinterprets Stern's role
in society. Stern is not a subversive but a clown, and a tired
clown at that. To him, sex is a joke. The real subversives are
those who use sex to destroy people's lives. Howard Stern can't
compete with that.

HEDGE? THAT'S EASY TO EXPLAIN 
</HEADLINE>
  By BRUCE GOTTLIEB 
 (www.slate.com) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Newspapers report that Long-Term Capital Management _ the
high-profile hedge fund run by a hotshot bond trader and two Nobel
laureates _ nearly plunged the world into financial ruin last week.
</P>
<P>
   And it's not just journalists who say so. Intent on forestalling
global financial disaster, a group of big-money Wall Street banks
convened by the Fed ponied up almost $3.5 billion to bail out the
fund.
</P>
<P>
   What are hedge funds? Why are their meltdowns so spectacular?
</P>
<P>
   A hedge fund is nothing more than a pool of money which a
manager invests for a group of wealthy investors (minimum buy-in is
often $10 million). Hedge funds promise an investment strategy that
makes money when the market rises and when it falls. The hedge fund
manager takes 15 to 20 percent of profits, the rest goes to
investors.
</P>
<P>
   Long-Term's manager, backed by a star-studded research division,
dealt in so-called derivatives. Derivatives are financial creations
whose value is based upon, or derived from, the price of some
underlying item, like stocks, bonds, commodities or currencies. For
example: Stock options are a wager on the future price of, say,
AT&AMP;T stock; commodity futures are a wager on the future price of,
say, pork bellies.

   Derivatives permit a fund manager to reduce certain kinds of
risk. Suppose the manager is holding a portfolio whose value rises
when interest rates rise but falls when interest rates fall. Adding
an appropriate derivative _ one which bets for an interest rate
fall _ to the portfolio mitigates losses if, in fact, interest
rates fall. (Hence the name ``hedge funds'' _ one investment
position offsets, or hedges, another investment position.)
</P>
<P>
   Of course hedge fund managers do more than just bet both for and
against some outcome. At the end of the day, they must bet on
something, right? It seems that Long-Term was betting on the yields
of bonds from G-7 countries (no one is sure since Long-Term won't
disclose details of its dealings). By analyzing historical data,
Long-Term developed predictions about the relative rates of return
on different countries' bonds. The firm used a series of
hedges--which means buying derivatives _ to make sure that they
were insulated from general rises and falls in interest rates,
stock exchanges etc... That's the beauty of hedging with
derivatives _ they let you bet on precisely what you want to. In
theory, other perturbations are not supposed to affect your assets.
</P>
<P>
   One key feature of derivatives is they can get you in a pot of
trouble very quickly. If you buy stock, and its price falls by 10
percent, you've simply lost 10 percent of your money. But if, for
instance, you buy a so-called call option (which is a bet that the
stock will rise) and the stock falls by 10 percent, you may lose
all your money. (A call option allows you to buy the stock at a
specified price, known as the strike price. If the market price
falls and stays below the strike price, then the option is
worthless.)
</P>
<P>
   There are even derivatives _ such as futures contracts _ with
which you can lose more than your original investment if you bet on
the wrong horse. No one but Long-Term really knows what Long-Term
held, but the fund's asset pool has reportedly shrunk to one-tenth
the size it was in January.

TEST PREPARATION COMPANY OFFERS VIRTUAL LAW DEGREE 
</HEADLINE>
  By PAMELA MENDELS 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Thanks to the Internet, a company best known for its courses to
prepare students for college admissions exams now plans to offer
degrees.
</P>
<P>
   But a big question faces Kaplan Educational Center's new Concord
University School of Law, a four-year juris doctorate program
offered entirely online: Can virtual classes provide the kind of
education that trains students to think like well-spoken lawyers?
</P>
<P>
   Concord and Kaplan officials are convinced the answer is
``yes,'' but others are not so sure.
</P>
<P>
   Scheduled to launch October 6, Concord University plans to
charge $4,200 a year for its four-year program -- a fraction of the
$6,500 to $26,000 charged yearly by ``bricks and mortar'' schools.
</P>
<P>
   Kaplan is targeting working professionals and others who cannot
make it to a classroom regularly, but desire a legal education and
are willing to get it from an unaccredited school. Jack R. Goetz,
dean of the school, which is based in Los Angeles, said Kaplan has
received about 2,000 inquiries from potential students and
``dozens'' of applications since the venture was announced last
week.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a wide array of people, working professionals and
others, who just want legal education,'' he said. ``There are tons
of people who just can't put down everything at 5 p.m., quit their
jobs and make it to evening class to begin legal education.''
</P>
<P>
   Goetz believes that technology can replace what goes on in a
conventional classroom. The Concord program will rely on
video-streamed lectures from law professors, supplemented with
standard textbook readings and discussions that will take place via
e-mail, by phone or in virtual chat rooms. ``We are able to offer a
quality legal education at less than the cost of fixed facility
schools,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Carl C. Monk, executive director of the Association of
American Law Schools, is among those who question whether ``cyber''
can adequately substitute for ``real'' when it comes to
jurisprudence. ``I am very skeptical of a degree offered totally
through online instruction,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, Monk pointed out, law schools are increasingly
offering students the opportunity to work under supervision with
real or simulated clients -- an experience that demands
face-to-face interaction.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps more important, Monk and others say, is that an
essential task of law school is training students to think and
respond quickly. Although not as favored today as it was in the
past, the Socratic teaching method, in which a professor asks
students probing questions to elicit well-thought out responses, is
still common in legal education.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a courtroom, if you are asked a question by a judge, you
can't say 'I need a day or so to look that up on the Web,''' said
James L. Hoover, associate dean and professor of law at Columbia
University's School of Law.
</P>
<P>
   Goetz responds that students can learn clear thinking through
Concord's writing and research requirements. In addition, he
questions how often law students really get to exchange ideas with
their professors. ``Mostly today you have 110 people stuffed in a
lecture room and one professor engaged in a Socratic dialogue with
one student,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, one thing is clear: Concord officials do not
expect to get the blessing of the American Bar Association, the
main national accrediting body for law schools. Students who
graduate from one of the 182 ABA-approved schools in the United
States may take the bar examination, a licensing requirement, in
any state.
</P>
<P>
   Concord graduates, on the other hand, will face certain
obstacles if they want to practice law. They will be able to sit
for the California bar examination, the prerequisite for a license
to practice in that state, if they first pass the state's ``baby
bar,'' an exam given to students at unaccredited law schools after
their first year, according to Goetz.
</P>
<P>
   If they wish to practice elsewhere, they may be eligible to take
the bar in 10 to 15 other states -- but only after practicing in
California for three to 10 years, Goetz said.
</P>
<P>
   Concord officials have not applied for ABA accreditation
because, among other things, the organization's guidelines
currently call for at least 1,120 hours of ``in residence'' study.
``We recognize that an online law school doesn't fit into these
guidelines,'' Goetz said.
</P>
<P>
   Another issue is that the American Bar Association does not look
kindly on correspondence courses. Kurt S. Snyder, assistant
consultant on legal education to the American Bar Association, said
a big question if Concord were to apply would be whether its course
of study amounted to a correspondence course or to something
different, such as an online forum that provided for meaningful
professor-to-student and student-to-student exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Goetz believes that chat rooms, e-mail discussions, phone
conversations and electronic feedback on tests are good
substitutes. And Jonathan Grayer, Kaplan's chief executive officer,
hopes one day to apply for bar association recognition and make the
case.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Goetz is convinced that Concord will attract
what he believes is a large body of potential lawyers and students
who do not necessarily want to practice law, among them scholars
who want to deepen their knowledge of jurisprudence and business
people who think knowing the law will help them in the workplace.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not competing with ABA law schools, the Harvards and
the Yales of the world,'' he said. ``We are competing for people
for whom law school is otherwise inaccessible.''

ARTS(AT)LARGE 
 TRACKING A VOYAGE OF 600 FEET 
</HEADLINE>
  By MATTHEW MIRAPAUL 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ward Shelley's latest work is quite a departure for him. In
fact, he left Sept. 19.
</P>
<P>
   Atop the Voyage Platform, a wooden deck that sits 10 feet off
the ground, Shelley, a New York sculptor, and two compatriots have
embarked on a week-long journey that will take them across the
art-laden terrain of the Socrates Sculpture Park in Long Island
City, Queens _ a distance of about 600 feet.
</P>
<P>
   The trio will stay on the 120-square-foot platform until their
mission is completed. They move the stilt-legged structure by
disassembling the back section and rebuilding it in the front. As
of Sept. 23, they had passed the halfway point.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're sort of leapfrogging across the park,'' explained
Kathleen Gilrain, the director of the 4.5-acre outdoor museum on
the banks of the East River, which boasts an expansive view of the
Manhattan skyline.
</P>
<P>
   Like so many modern-day adventurers who document their travels
with electronic postings from exotic locales, Shelley is
chronicling the voyage online, the small-scale nature of his trip
unintentionally mocking the tedious travelogues that clog the Web.
His equipment is appropriately low-tech: with a cellular telephone,
he calls a friend with brief reports, which are then added to the
project's Web site.
</P>
<P>
   ``We realized that not that many people are going to see us do
this, and that the main thing was to tell the story,'' Shelley said
in a telephone interview. When the trip is done, he said, the team
intends to expand the Web site with a more complete account.
</P>
<P>
   Shelley and his collaborator, William R. Kaizen, a Web-savvy
Brooklyn artist, describe the Voyage Platform project as ``an
expedition into the unknown, within the familiar.'' Part sculpture,
part performance, the work encourages viewers to reconsider the
notion of statuary as static objects.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a beautiful piece,'' said Simon Lee, the park's education
director. ``It's actually quite a complicated piece of work. It's
about space. It's about crossing space. It's about traversing the
park, about navigating through the sculptures to get from one side
to the other.''
</P>
<P>
   Shelley was inspired by Ole Olaussen, a Norwegian expeditionist
and writer who took the sculptor on a mountain-climbing trip last
year. He recalled: ``I decided we should do something that was a
bit more like the mountain-climbing adventure, that had this goal
you tried to reach. I tried to think what you could do with the
park, and this just popped into my mind.''
</P>
<P>
   The Socrates selection committee approved the project, and
Shelley, Kaizen and Olaussen, who became the team's third member,
began conceptualizing in earnest. They developed the platform's
architecture with a computer-aided design program and, modeling
themselves on the Challengers of the Unknown, a 1950s comic-book
quartet, exchanged character profiles via e-mail messages.
</P>
<P>
   Matching the lineup of the vintage comic book's everyday heroes,
Shelley is a redhead, Kaizen has brown hair and Olaussen is a
blond. ``Roy'' is the fourth member of the party, a human-sized
figure sporting an Elvis Presley wig.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't find a black-haired guy to do it with us, so we
made a dummy for him,'' Shelley explained. ``You can see we had too
much time to plan this.''
</P>
<P>
   The Voyage Platform is a contemporary version of Kon-Tiki, the
balsa-wood raft that another Norwegian, the explorer Thor
Heyerdahl, sailed from Peru to Polynesia in 1947.
</P>
<P>
   But since the team set out on Sept. 18, its greatest challenge
has been not the Pacific but the park's drainage ditch. The
structure is designed for relatively flat terrain, and the crew
disagreed over the best technique for bridging the shallow valley.
</P>
<P>
   The team has also had to alter its southerly route to
accommodate the park's new exhibition, which opened Sept. 20.
``They put a lot of sculpture in this park that we hadn't planned
on,'' Shelley said. ``We have to make a lot of turns, and this
thing is really designed to go straight.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the resilient individuals who strive to set new
roller-coaster and kissing-contest records, the Voyage Platform
crew gets no five-minute breaks, although a catwalk under the deck
affords a small measure of privacy.
</P>
<P>
   Shelley is an experienced sailor, so he is accustomed to packing
for extended journeys away from land. Dinner on Sept. 21 was chili
and rice. There are tents for sleeping, and a tripod rigged with
motion-sensing devices alerts the crew to nighttime intruders. So
far, only a dog and a lightning storm have triggered the warning
system.
</P>
<P>
   As the trio learns the ropes, they have stepped up their pace.
Kaizen is insisting that they will reach their goal by Sept. 25.
Shelley said, ``We're working hard to increase our speed. It's
become more athletic, more competitive.''
</P>
<P>
   When the trip is done, the crew would like to saw off some of
the stilts and leave the platform behind, listing at a severe
angle, as a sculptural reminder of the journey -- a proposal the
park's safety experts have yet to approve since local children are
likely to want to clamber on it, as they do the site's 50 other
pieces.
</P>
<P>
   Long Island City is an ethnically diverse community and the
park, an illegal dump site that the sculptor Mark di Suvero
reclaimed for art in 1985, is visited regularly by residents of a
nearby low-income housing project.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a high degree of fascination from the local community
about what (Shelley's) doing, especially from kids, where it's a
little bit magic,'' Lee said. ``Here are these grown-ups who are
behaving like kids. They're getting a lot of attention.''
</P>
<P>
   Shelley said neighborhood visitors all ask the same thing: ``Are
you really not coming down?'' He gives a straightforward response:
``This is like a raft on stilts, and we're building it across the
park. We're living here while we do it. We're not coming down.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes they have to ask the question twice, but this is New
York, so people are used to weird things. Most people seem to be
really tickled by the idea,'' he said.

CAN A WEB LINK BREAK COPYRIGHT LAWS? 
</HEADLINE>
  By CARL S. KAPLAN 
 Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Suppose a Web site links to a site that links to another site
containing illegally reproduced photographs. Can the first site be
sued for illegal linking?
</P>
<P>
   That's just one of the many head-scratchers that were raised by
an unprecedented copyright infringement lawsuit filed and then
withdrawn by Gary Bernstein, a veteran Hollywood glamour
photographer. The suit charged J.C. Penney Inc. and other parties
with copyright infringement.
</P>
<P>
   Bernstein quietly withdrew his lawsuit Sept. 21 after he lost a
preliminary round in the legal contest. But the fundamental issue
he raised -- liability for linking on the Internet -- is still
alive and will come up for court review another day, legal experts
said.
</P>
<P>
   Bernstein's lawsuit is ``fascinating and also really scary,''
said Jessica Litman, a copyright expert and law professor at Wayne
State University. ``If people are going to be liable when they link
to material that they have no reason to think is infringing, then
everyone, everyone who links, will be dragged into court all the
time. That doesn't make good policy sense.''
</P>
<P>
   On Sept., Los Angeles Federal District Court Judge Manuel A.
Real appeared to pour cold water on Bernstein's case when he
dismissed one of the defendants. Conopco Inc. had argued in legal
filings that Bernstein's suit had ``no support in the law, and
would effectively eviscerate the Internet as a medium of
communication.'' Real did not issue an opinion in the matter, but
his decision prompted Bernstein's withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
   Bernstein, 50, is the author of nine books on photography and a
30-year veteran behind the camera, having snapped Sophia Lauren,
Johnny Carson, Elizabeth Taylor and other celebrities. His foray
into cyberspace law began last year when he was surfing the Web and
came across J.C. Penney's home page. He noticed that the company
was promoting sales of Elizabeth Taylor's ``Passion'' perfume,
which is made by Elizabeth Arden Co. and Parfums International
Ltd., both divisions of Conopco.
</P>
<P>
   Bernstein knew the perfume well. In 1989, he had created and
licensed an elaborate photo of Elizabeth Taylor -- which Bernstein
dubbed the ``Pink Lady Image'' -- in connection with the
advertising and promotion of ``Passion.'' He also took pictures of
Elizabeth Taylor on other occasions, notably in 1986 for the cover
of Petersen's Photographic Magazine. Bernstein calls that shot the
``Lavender Image.''
</P>
<P>
   Bernstein discovered during his visit to the J.C. Penney site
that by clicking on a series of hyperlinks to get additional
information on Elizabeth Taylor, he was taken from J.C. Penney's
``Passion'' subpage to a site called the Internet Movie Database --
which is not affiliated with J.C. Penney or the makers of
``Passion'' -- and then to a site in Sweden called SUNET, for the
Swedish University Network. The site contains a large collection of
celebrity photos, apparently placed on the Internet by fans. It
included two images of Ms. Taylor -- the Pink Lady Image and the
Lavender Image.
</P>
<P>
   After learning of Bernstein's claim that the SUNET site
contained illegally reproduced images, J.C. Penney removed its link
to the movie database site. As of Oct. 1, the movie site still
linked to the Swedish site from its collection of information on
Ms. Taylor, with a disclaimer of liability for linking.
</P>
<P>
   Bernstein sued J.C. Penney, the perfume makers, the Internet
Movie Database and other parties in April, claiming that they were
liable for copyright infringement. Specifically, he claimed the
defendants' use of multiple links intentionally drove Web surfers
to the pirated Taylor photos on the Swedish site.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, he claimed that if J.C. Penney and the perfume
makers wanted to use his pictures, they should have paid him
directly -- instead of indirectly linking to the photos and reaping
the benefit but escaping the fee.
</P>
<P>
   J.C. Penney denied the charges in court filings, and a spokesman
for the company declined comment on the dropped case. The perfume
companies moved to have themselves dismissed from the suit.
</P>
<P>
   Conopco's lawyer, Roger Myers of Steinhart &AMP; Falconer in San
Francisco, argued that the J.C. Penney site was not guilty of
direct copyright infringement because it didn't make a copy or
distribute the Taylor images. The pictures remained on the site in
Sweden.
</P>
<P>
   Myers, who has represented The New York Times in some legal
matters, further argued that Penney and his client could not be
guilty of ``contributory'' copyright infringement. This requires
that the guilty party have knowledge of the first infringement and
take some action to aid that infringement.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, he said, there was no evidence that the J.C.
Penney site or the perfume maker knew the series of links would
eventually lead to a set of pirated pictures abroad. He also
asserted that the chain of links -- six in all -- on the road to
the pirated photos was too long to meet the legal standard for
assisting another's infringement.
</P>
<P>
   One wrinkle in the case has some legal experts especially
worried. Bernstein asserted that any Web surfer who viewed the
pirated Taylor images on the Swedish site was technically guilty of
direct copyright infringement, and that the defendants are guilty
of contributing to infringement. After all, he claimed, a user's
computer makes a copy of the images viewed, and when the images are
illegal, the copy is illegal.
</P>
<P>
   In his court filings, Myers said that such copying by an end
user was a ``fair use'' -- thus immunizing the average Web surfer
from such a lawsuit. But the question has not been answered by a
federal appellate court, which would set a powerful precedent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The case law is not clear on the liability of end users for
copyright infringement,'' said Mark Lemley, a visiting professor at
Berkeley's Boalt Hall School of Law and a professor at the
University of Texas law school, adding that ``fair use'' was a
strong argument. ``The consequences of holding an end user liable
for copyright infringement would be disturbing for the Net... It
might deter surfing. It might also give some unscrupulous groups
the power to suppress speech or critics.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey R. Kuester, an intellectual property lawyer with Thomas,
Kayden, Horstemeyer &AMP; Risley in Atlanta, said he was glad the
Bernstein case was withdrawn. He said he believes there should be
freedom to link on the Net, a right that is protected by the First
Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   He added, however, that there might be exceptions to the rule if
there was strong evidence that a Web site, in bad faith, linked to
another site in a knowing effort to evade copyright law -- evidence
that he thought was lacking in the Bernstein case.
</P>
<P>
   The best solution, said Kuester, is for the injured party to go
after the pirate site, rather than the linking sites. ``The
wrongdoer here is the pirate site,'' he said. There should be
international treaties and conventions to punish people for posting
copyright-infringing material, he said.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Bernstein agreed that linking on the Net should be
encouraged. But he said he will continue his crusade for
``responsible linking'' in the court of public opinion via magazine
articles in the near future.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want to be a poster boy for hurting the Internet or
for trying to limit the freewheeling spirt of the Net,'' he said,
referring to his decision to withdraw his lawsuit. ``But a couple
of companies were trying to get away with murder.''

GATEWAY'S SOLO 2500LS PACKS IT ALL 
</HEADLINE>
  By STEPHEN C. MILLER 
 Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   I'm always amazed at what Gateway charges for its computers. The
company seems to bundle everything but the kitchen sink with their
systems and still charge rock-bottom prices.
</P>
<P>
   Take, for example, the Gateway Solo 2500LS. The unit I reviewed
was a 233-Megahertz Pentium II with MMX technology. It has a 12.1
inch SVGA, TFT active matrix display, an enhanced TouchPad (more on
that later), a 4GB hard drive, 2Mb of video RAM, a CD-ROM, a floppy
disk drive, two USB ports, an NTSC external video connector (for
displaying the output of TVs, VCRs and camcorders,) a 56K modem,
Windows 98, Microsoft Office Small Business Edition and a quite
nice carrying case. I upgraded the memory from 32 to 64 Megabytes
of RAM (an additional $100). All of this was priced at $2,349.

   Price alone makes this an attractive laptop, but it also stands
out on its own merits as well. The 2500LS beats a couple of systems
I've reviewed that cost a whole lot more. I threw everything at it
and it more than held its own. I loaded it with all my standard
stuff -- three Web browsers, two e-mail packages, software for the
Palm Pilot, some proprietary software for connecting to The Times'
Atex system, Adobe PhotoShop, Gizmos98 (a real system hog,) and my
current crop of system-intensive games.
</P>
<P>
   The system didn't even seem to breathe hard. It even survived a
heart-stopping, totally unplanned drop test. Some rowdy school kids
bumped into me and the unit slipped off my shoulder and bounced
onto the concrete platform of the Times Square subway station. The
bag obviously provided some protection, but I know of a couple of
units that would not have survived the fall. The 2500LS booted
right up with no sign of any problem with the unit.
</P>
<P>
   The 2500LS is an all-in-one laptop. An all-in-one unit is one
that contains a built-in CD-ROM and floppy disk drive and often a
network connection. These units are heavier, but you don't need to
carry any external devices like a CD-ROM or a floppy disk drive.
Those two devices add a couple of pounds to a laptop. A light 4-lb.
unit goes up to 6-plus lbs. with the added external equipment.
</P>
<P>
   But if you need to run an application that requires a CD or want
to save information to a floppy, you have to carry them and their
cables and connectors with you. The weight ends up being the same
but with lots of extra stuff that is not necessary when the laptop
has everything integrated. The Solo 2500LS weighs 7.1 lbs. It's one
ounce over my 7 lb. limit for laptops, but in this case, I'll make
an exception.
</P>
<P>
   I have made no secret that I'm not a big fan of TouchPads. But
the new enhanced TouchPad that comes with the 2500LS is turning me
around. It may be that the documentation for how to use the
TouchPad is so good. This is the first time that I've had a
detailed explanation on how to use a TouchPad effectively.
</P>
<P>
   The enhanced TouchPad has new features that make it more
user-friendly. I'm a right mouse button user. I find the shortcuts
available through the right mouse button options increase my
productivity. Tapping with 3-fingers on the TouchPad brings up the
right mouse button options.
</P>
<P>
   The enhanced TouchPad also has a scrolling option along the
right side of the unit. Scrolling through Web pages or long
documents is a breeze with the TouchPad. I can't say enough about
the documentation provided with the 2500LS. The text is in English
and the graphics are clear and helpful.
</P>
<P>
   I can't let the 2500LS off with an entirely clean bill of
health. The tiny LCD screen that tells you of the system's status
battery life, hard drive/CD-ROM activity and whether you're using
AC -- is unreadable in low light conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Picky, Picky.

GATEWAY'S SOLO 2500LS PACKS IT ALL 
</HEADLINE>
  By STEPHEN C. MILLER 
 Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   I'm always amazed at what Gateway charges for its computers. The
company seems to bundle everything but the kitchen sink with their
systems and still charge rock-bottom prices.
</P>
<P>
   Take, for example, the Gateway Solo 2500LS. The unit I reviewed
was a 233-Megahertz Pentium II with MMX technology. It has a 12.1
inch SVGA, TFT active matrix display, an enhanced TouchPad (more on
that later), a 4GB hard drive, 2Mb of video RAM, a CD-ROM, a floppy
disk drive, two USB ports, an NTSC external video connector (for
displaying the output of TVs, VCRs and camcorders,) a 56K modem,
Windows 98, Microsoft Office Small Business Edition and a quite
nice carrying case. I upgraded the memory from 32 to 64 Megabytes
of RAM (an additional $100). All of this was priced at $2,349.
</P>
<P>
   Price alone makes this an attractive laptop, but it also stands

TOWN FACING HUGE MALL SEES IRONY IN DEVELOPER'S PASTORAL SETTING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, Oct. 4)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

<P>
   SKANEATELES, N.Y. _ Locals still remember when red neon from
Morris's Grill blazed over Genesee Street. But the sign has been
dim for at least 10 years, stashed indoors as owner Burt Lipe hopes
for the town to ease its zoning laws.
</P>
<P>
   It could be a long wait. This historic suburb of Syracuse, with
its pristine landscape and spit-shine streets, has managed to
preserve its quaint character with a philosophy boldly imprinted on
a sign that greets people entering town: ``Zoning Laws Enforced.''
</P>
<P>
   Neon, strip malls and other outgrowths of modern living are
strongly discouraged. Lake-front Skaneateles boasts dozens of
boutiques, but only one chain store: the P &AMP; C grocery. It hosts a
variety of restaurants, but no McDonald's. And the only neon
illuminating the skyline downtown hangs unobtrusively over the 1853
Masonic Temple door.
</P>
<P>
   Buffered from the competition of large retail stores, village
life has flourished: everything from the village mechanic to the
local bank remains within walking distance.
</P>
<P>
   The same traits that have made the town of 7,500 a
tourist-destination have also lured executives of the largest mall
and shopping center owners in the Northeast, Pyramid Cos. The
company's founder, Robert Congel Sr., owns a mansion on the lake
that includes a 70-acre property known as Sandy Beach, formerly a
public swimming area. Pyramid partner Gary Dower just got critical
approval for a village sewer hook-up that will allow him to build a
32-room inn to accommodate the growing demand for tourist-lodging.
Pyramid partner Bruce Kenan has personally fought to preserve the
feel of the village, incorporated in 1833, during his 22-year
tenure on the planning board.
</P>
<P>
   But some 150 miles away, in the Albany suburb of Guilderland,
the irony isn't lost on critics of a plan that would transform a
local mall into the second largest shopping center in America.
</P>
<P>
   The same people who gobble up properties and pave over landscape
reside in a town where mall is a four-letter word.
</P>
<P>
   ``They (Pyramid) would be at the head of the line holding
placards to say, `No mall in our town,' said Anne Rose, a member of
the Guilderland Town Board. ``I think it's ironic they've chosen to
live in a lovely town and don't want us to be lovely anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Based in Syracuse, Pyramid owns 17 malls in New York and
Massachusetts and is in the process of expanding 11 of them,
including the Crossgates Mall in Guilderland. The $100 million
expansion plan includes a multilevel parking garage and 12-story
hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Officials with Pyramid did not return calls for this story.
</P>
<P>
   Since they announced their plans to double the size of
Crossgates to 3.6 million square feet in March, company officials
have said little publicly about the project. Amid growing resident
opposition to the project, the town is considering zoning law
amendments that include a ban on high-rise buildings, multilevel
parking and retail centers larger than 1 million square feet. Last
month, Pyramid filed a petition protesting the amendments. Company
officials haven't indicated whether they will sue if the amendments
pass.
</P>
<P>
   The success of Skaneateles, where small business has triumphed
over megamalls and giant retail outfits, stands in contrast to
Guilderland. Since 1984, when the mall rose from 180 acres of town
pine barrens, the shopping center has doubled in size, to 1.6
million square feet. On a much smaller scale, something like
Crossgates Mall also threatened the Skaneateles way of life
beginning 20 years ago. That's when plans for a 150,000-square-foot
shopping center were first proposed. After several false starts,
the plan appeared to be headed for approval in the early 1990s,
which prompted an outcry by residents.
</P>
<P>
   At about the same time, the town called several building
moratoriums and drafted a comprehensive master plan. The zoning
code was then revised and the changes took effect in 1996. The
changes include limiting the size of commercial buildings to 45,000
square feet _ which effectively scuttled plans for the shopping
center.
</P>
<P>
   To developers like Allan Storch, who proposed the shopping
center, the town's zoning laws are oppressive. ``The town has
tightened its zoning laws to restrict development to what they feel
is appropriate,'' said Storch, who filed several lawsuits
challenging the restrictions and lost. ``They basically don't want
any retail that competes with the village merchants.''
</P>
<P>
   The zoning laws in Skaneateles, along with rules established by
the Historic Landmarks Commission, can be daunting. But it's a
trade-off that small business owners don't mind making. When Jim
Higbee, the owner of Village Choices, wanted to attach a small
flower planter to his storefront, it took more than an hour to get
in-person approval from the landmarks commission.
</P>
<P>
   Higbee, who owns an eclectic gift-shop, downplayed the
inconvenience.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the same token, you don't find Wendy's, McDonald's and
Burger King,'' he explained. ``People come here because its an
alternative. Bob at the hardware store calls it `an island
surrounded by a sea of chaos.'''
</P>
<P>
   Higbee, who also promotes the town through various festivals he
helps organize as president of the Merchant's Association, said the
laws help small-business owners _ and even their patrons.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't have to look very far to see what happens when you
put a strip mall on the outskirts of any city,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   During the mid-1980s, when Morris's Grill was forced to take
down its neon sign, the village began to make other improvements to
restore its historic character.
</P>
<P>
   Telephone and electrical wires were diverted underground,
cast-iron street lamps and brick-covered sidewalks were added.
</P>
<P>
   This is the town that Supervisor Bill Pavlus, 71, a trucker
turned town postmaster, inherited when he took office in 1996. The
son of Czech immigrants, Pavlus grew up on a 50-acre farm, where
his roots have remained.
</P>
<P>
   ``You couldn't drive me out of here,'' he said from his office
at Town Hall that looks onto downtown. ``I've traveled a lot of the
country, north and back, west and back. I've seen a lot of pretty
country but I like what we have here.''

   WESTON, Vt. _ Sit yourself down in this wooden chair right here,
by the potbelly stove and the pickle barrel. Chilly sweat is
dripping off bottles of sarsaparilla in the oak-and-glass
refrigerator. Checkers your game? A faded board awaits a skillful
move. The penny candy counter overflows with Mary Janes, Root Beer
Barrels and Jaw Breakers. Flies are stuck to the fly paper.
</P>
<P>
   After all, this is the Vermont Country Store, nostalgia central
to southern Vermont.
</P>
<P>
   In the small towns of Vermont, folks still gather at the country
store ``for anything from milk to nails to social conversation,''
said Elaine Young, director of communications for the Vermont State
Chamber of Commerce. This month, the locals will have company, as a
crush of tourists descends on the state seeking foliage and quaint
surroundings. The leaves should peak sometime in the next week or
two, Young said.
</P>
<P>
   But if outlet shopping in busy Manchester gives you an instant
headache, there is Weston, a tiny hill village in the West River
Valley about 30 miles southeast of Rutland. Touted by residents as
``a village untouched by time,'' it often smells, tastes and looks
like the days of yore.
</P>
<P>
   Vermont can help you go back to a place you never want to leave.
Stunning white birches. Deep, dark ponds. Calm dispositions. The
Vermonter ``does not go off half-cocked,'' Wallace Nutting wrote in
``Vermont Beautiful'' in 1922. ``He does not grow excited. Like
Dewey, who calmly ordered his officer to fire when ready, the
average Vermonter fires when ready, neither before nor after, and
with a cool head and untrembling arm he hits the mark, if anybody
can.''
</P>
<P>
   Moose Crossing. Antiques Ahead, declare the road signs near the
state border. License plates turn an affable green. The mountains
draw closer. Maple tree leaves appear red as tomato soup.
</P>
<P>
   Weston, listed on the National Register of Historic Places, with
an oval village green in its center, has an old mill dam, the
Weston Playhouse, Vermont's oldest professional theater, the
restored 1797 Farrar-Mansur House and, to the north, the Weston
Priory, a Benedictine monastery which welcomes the public to daily
prayer.
</P>
<P>
   Getting there can be slightly frustrating on the weekend. On one
recent day, a string of cars followed two RVs in a slow crawl
toward the village's white clock tower. Then, to a car, they
turned, directly into the parking lot of the Vermont Country Store,
joining shoppers from Maine to Wisconsin. All seemed bent on
revisiting their childhoods. Inside the store, above the dark
broadcloth pajamas, woolen socks and mufflers, hang the antiques
from a pair of hook-eye boots to a poster touting ``Gargling oil
for horses.'' It's like a museum. But you can touch. And buy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember those,'' shoppers say, passing a glass display case
filled with gleaming silver toasters. A fleet of worn sleds is
docked on the ceiling beams. Owner Lyman Orton, whose father Vrest
Orton opened the store in 1946, likes to collect things, said
customer service manager Dana McNair. ``If it's old and it's
available, we're really into getting it for our customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have rouge, real honest-to-goodness rouge. This is your
grandmother's rouge.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides the Vermont Common Crackers and cheese off the wheel,
the store and popular catalog sells such hard-to-find items as
rubberized Pucker girdles, Glass Wax and vinyl bowl covers.
Recently, there was a rush on Blue Waltz perfume.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the weirdest, coolest things,'' McNair said. A
Manhattan soap opera actress recently asked her dad to buy her six
boxes each of Frownies &AMP; Wrinklies, adhesive patches created in
1889 to smooth facial lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a blast from the past,'' said Mary Ann Mazza, 51, a nun
from Maryland on a three-week trek with fellow Sister of Mercy
Joanna Sinko. ``I haven't had Sen Sen (Licorice Bits) since I was a
kid!''
</P>
<P>
   Oil-cloth table covers and Porter's Lotion are other treats,
said Mazza and Sinko, as they walked their golden retriever on the
village green. ``You can't find them other places,'' Sinko said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our wives are part stockholders,'' laughs Bill Noll, a
frequent store visitor with his wife Josephine and friends Bob and
Margaret Nothstein of Pennsylvania. ``While they shop, we do the
sampling of the foods,'' Bob Nothstein added.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came all the way up here for a pie crust cover,'' said
Margaret Nothstein as she emerged from the store. ``It takes you
back.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside, Jim Savage of Gilford, Conn., in a Polo shirt and
Docksiders, sank into a hammock and sang the praises of Bag Balm, a
Vermont-made salve farmers use on milk cow udders and their own
hands. Many shoppers ate lunch by nibbling on the array of free
samples of cheese, crackers and relishes in the store. For the
truly hungry, however, The Bryant House Restaurant next door offers
a pure Vermont lunch _ maple-smoked ham and melted cheddar
sandwiches _ served on red gingham napkins and old-time jelly
glasses sold at the store. For desert, warm, dark gingerbread
beneath an avalanche of fresh whipped cream.
</P>
<P>
   Upstairs there is a small exhibit of a 19th century bedroom,
including the 1876 mahogany bedroom set bought at the World's Fair
in Philadelphia by John and Maude Bryant.
</P>
<P>
   For those seeking nourishment of a spiritual sort, the Weston
Priory just three miles north offers public devotions on a
beautiful hilltop setting.
</P>
<P>
   The Nolls and the Nothsteins caught both morning and evening
services last Friday. The Brothers, known for their singing in
churches nationwide, sell their CDs at the Priory gift shop. ``We
sing a lot of their songs in our church choir,'' Noll said. ``It's
so peaceful up there. You don't hear any cars.''

ROLLING DOWN THE HUDSON WITH HISTORY IN TOW 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, Oct. 4)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAUL GRONDAHL  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union

<P>
   ABOARD AMTRAK TRAIN NO. 256 _ Engineer Charlie French sounded
the high, mournful wail of the whistle, nudged up the throttles and
Amtrak Train No. 256, the Hudson Valley service, rumbled out of the
Rensselaer station southbound.
</P>
<P>
   The train pulled five railroad cars and was powered in a
push-pull method by two 1,800-horsepower gas turbine engines, one
in front and one in back, each controlled by a throttle.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has its own feel that you get to know from experience,''
said French, 49, who has worked on the railroad since he was 20.
</P>
<P>
   It takes five minutes and eight miles for French to accelerate
to the top speed of 110 mph on the 18 miles of high-speed track
between Rensselaer and Stuyvesant in upstate New York. The
riverside is a blur of texture and color. Walls of purple
loosestrife, carpets of water chestnut streak by in ravines and
shallows. The nuisance weeds choke off acre after acre, essentially
walling off large stretches of shoreline access.
</P>
<P>
   A mile passes every 33 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   But French, who has made this Hudson River run since 1986, sees
the cumulative effect of time and nature outside the train window.
</P>
<P>
   ``You hardly saw any of those weeds five years ago and now
they're taking over everywhere all the way down,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   French is a student of the river's history who helped write a
10-page Amtrak guide to points of interest along the Hudson between
Rensselaer and New York City.
</P>
<P>
   ``That just scratches the surface,'' French said. ``It's so rich
with history, you'll never know it all.''
</P>
<P>
   French soaks up Hudson stories at every opportunity. On this
day, he heard another engineer, Ralph Favicchio, 49, on special
duty assignment as a trainer, recall his childhood in the town of
Athens and ice skating across the river.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Fleischmann, a 46-year-old technician and Catskill native,
recounted swimming at Catskill Beach in the 1950s until a riverside
dump encroached and wrote the obituary for the beach.
</P>
<P>
   Across the river, on the west shore where he once worked freight
trains, French alluded to the railway rivalry between east and west
along the Hudson.
</P>
<P>
   William H. Vanderbilt had the east side corridor sewn up and
enjoyed a rail monopoly with the New York Central Railroad when
interloper Pennsylvania Railroad created the West Shore Railroad in
1881.
</P>
<P>
   Vanderbilt's crony, J.P. Morgan, arranged a truce. Vanderbilt
took control of the faltering West Shore Railroad, which had filed
for bankruptcy in 1884. Passenger service between Weehawken, N.J.,
and Albany ended in late June 1958.
</P>
<P>
   Today, only chunks of the old West Shore line remain and it is
limited to freight service because the track condition and terrain
set the maximum speed at 50 mph.
</P>
<P>
   The river's once-bustling commerce is a ghost of its former
self. Only one cement plant at Alsen across from Germantown remains
active in the foothills of the Catskills. The region was once known
as the cement capital because limestone was mined in the hills,
processed in riverside mills and shipped by barge to build the
concrete jungle of Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Old-timers told me the cement dust was so thick in the heyday
of the mills that they had to cover their car windshields with
burlap bags at night,'' French said.
</P>
<P>
   From the engineer's seat, the Hudson was a moving diorama.
Clinton Point, known as Camelot, once a booming rock quarry
community that fed the New York City construction beast. Only a
memory now. Hyde Park and the Vanderbilt Mansion somewhere up there
on the hillside, hidden by thick foliage. Cold Spring, so named
according to legend because George Washington stopped and took a
refreshing drink from a spring. Storm King Mountain, dubbed
Klinkersberg by Henry Hudson, an environmental cause celebre in the
1960s by a grass-roots defeat of a proposed electric-power
generation station.
</P>
<P>
   The ruins of Bannerman's Castle on Pollepel Island are a
compelling site. Francis Bannerman constructed it out of old paving
stones from New York City and filled it with antique firearms and
weaponry. It is just a jagged outline now after fire destroyed the
main structure.
</P>
<P>
   Past Constitution Island now, where a massive chain was
stretched across the Hudson by American troops during the
Revolutionary War to discourage British warships from sailing
north.
</P>
<P>
   The Hudson Highlands enchant with their grandeur, possessing the
same teasing quality that fooled Hudson into believing their
impressive scale signaled the gateway to the Northwest Passage.
</P>
<P>
   Washington Irving's Sunnyside estate at Tarrytown is a gabled
jewel. ``Irving got the railroad to make a special stop right in
front of his house because he had to travel into New York City so
often for his writing,'' French said.
</P>
<P>
   The Harlem River roils into the Hudson at Spuyten Duyvil, where
a drawbridge carries the train over the waterway. The Dutch were
wary of its fierce currents and considered those who dared to swim
it ``in spite of the devil'' to possess a death wish.
</P>
<P>
   The train slows and slides under the George Washington Bridge,
dwarfed by the steel immensity of one of the world's largest
suspension bridges.
</P>
<P>
   The train plunges into darkness through a long tunnel under the
West Side Drive, a spooky netherworld where homeless people live.
The gleaming glass of the Javits Center twinkles in the final gulp
of daylight before the mile-long tunnel leading into New York's
Penn Station.
</P>
<P>
   French negotiated the Rensselaer-to-New York run this day in 2
hours and 45 minutes. ``Not bad,'' the engineer said. ``That's
about 15 minutes behind schedule. There's a lot of track work going
on that slows us down. Yesterday, I was 45 minutes late.''
</P>
<P>
   After a 2 1/2-hour layover, French would take the controls again
aboard the 5:40 p.m. departure northward, Amtrak Train No. 293, the
Ethan Allen service, rounding out another shift working on the
railroad.
</P>
<P>
   As the train reached the midway point between New York and
Rensselaer, an oil barge French had passed on the downriver run was
still churning slowly upriver, bucking the tide, reminding one of
the advantages of rail travel.

POWER OF OFFICE COMPENSATES FOR HUMAN WEAKNESS 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ALBERTO HUERTA  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Despite human foibles, British writer Graham
Greene (1904-1991) remained optimistic about the human condition.
</P>
<P>
   In phone conversations with Greene in the last 10 years of his
life, usually in an attempt to meet with him in one of those far
flung corners of his literary and political world, he reminded me
of the Catholic distinction between the man who holds office and
the office itself.
</P>
<P>
   His 1940 novel, ``The Power and the Glory,'' later made into a
Hollywood movie, is witness to the wisdom of the Latin term ``ex
opere operato'' _ the office compensates for the office holder's
weakness. It is a spiritual distinction that salvages Greene's
wayward whiskey priest who, though derelict in his personal life,
executes his office decisively when he is obligated to hear a
confession.
</P>
<P>
   The priest suspects a trap by his political adversaries, who
have outlawed such ministry. He risks his life, is arrested,
hastily tried and condemned.
</P>
<P>
   When the founding fathers wrote the U.S. Constitution, they were
concerned about the separation of the three powers of government:
the executive, legislative and judicial. They wanted to prevent
abuses by any single branch. They did not document any idea about
the power of the office having special influence upon the elected
official who swears to uphold that privilege against all enemies _
domestic or foreign. Greene's awareness of this distinction is
cause for thought, since it influenced his optimism about the power
of the office upon human weakness.
</P>
<P>
   We have a president who has erred. Some have suggested an abuse
of power. Instead of seeing a president overwhelmed by his personal
weakness, we see a man compelled to carry on the business of
government. It almost seems as if the office of the presidency is
effecting an intrinsic will over the man who was embroiled in a sex
scandal.
</P>
<P>
   And contrary to what citizens might have hoped for from their
representatives, Congress is sullying its office by irresponsibly
releasing videos and tapes with details having little to do with
dignity and civility. The founding fathers might have blushed at
these self-righteous postures. Congress is making a circus out the
human condition of the commander in chief. Clinton is a contrite
president who, like three-quarters of Americans, wants to move
forward with more important issues.
</P>
<P>
   Greene was convinced of the power of the office, even when the
office holder failed personally. The founding fathers believed the
separation of powers assured that the democratic government would
be an honest political experience.
</P>
<P>
   America is not great because of its democratic form of
government with its checks and balances. America is great because
its citizens believe that when a person who holds office fails, and
recognizes that failure, he or she can move forward to let the
power of the office they hold express its good with dignity and
civility.
</P>
<P>
   Greene's protagonist regains his self-respect and the admiration
of his persecutors when he realizes the true nature of his office.
The office appropriates and ultimately effects an inherent dignity
in time of personal and public crisis. It is a challenge Congress
now faces.

DILBERT OFFERS NEW WORKPLACE ADVICE FOR THE CAREER-SAVVY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JO-ANN JOHNSTON  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Dissatisfied workers everywhere, take note:
Dilbert's back, he's ready to act out and willing to show you how
to act out at work too.
</P>
<P>
   Workplace humorist Scott Adams' latest book, ``The Joy of Work;
Dilbert's Guide to Finding Happiness at the Expense of Your
Co-Workers'' (HarperBusiness, $22), is here. Follow the pranks
Adams suggests in this book, he says, and you'll probably get
fired. But with the labor market so tight right now, ``at least
you'll get a better job'' after your firing.
</P>
<P>
   Adams, 41, once inhabited cubicle 45700R at Pacific Bell before
turning to a life of cartooning. Dilbert, the comic strip that
satirizes the American workplace, now appears in 1,900 newspapers
worldwide. The characters have spawned calendars, dolls and other
merchandise.
</P>
<P>
   Adams grew up in Windham, N.Y., before earning an economics
degree from Hartwick College. He later earned a master's degree in
business administration from the University of California at
Berkeley. He now lives in California with his girlfriend, Pam.
</P>
<P>
   During a recent telephone interview, the cartoonist discussed
his work:
</P>
<P>
   Question: What inspired ``The Joy of Work''?
</P>
<P>
   Answer: The job market is so good. A lot of people are still
bitter about 10 years or so of downsizing, and it's a great time to
get revenge. So I compiled some of my own evil thoughts along with
others.
</P>
<P>
   Q: But now we're moving into a precarious situation.
</P>
<P>
   A: The job market is still great.
</P>
<P>
   Q: So you don't worry that we could have a global recession and
job cuts?
</P>
<P>
   A: It seems like all the rules keep changing ... Could we have a
strong job market and total global meltdown? Yeah, probably.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You make fun of all the functional areas of companies:
marketing, technology, sales, accounting. Are there are new areas
you'd like to skewer?
</P>
<P>
   A: I think I need to start making fun of Web development people.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you have any hope for workplaces becoming less
dysfunctional?
</P>
<P>
   A: No. There are individuals who will make a better situation
for themselves. But as soon as you put three people in a room, two
of them will start fighting with the other one. It's the nature of
people that we only get along up to a point.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Why is it that companies can do dumb things and be made up of
smart people?
</P>
<P>
   A: Everybody's an idiot once in a while, including me. And
everyone is selfish ... That causes people to behave in
(destructive) ways.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Are there any workplaces or business leaders you actually
admire?
</P>
<P>
   A: ``I tend to be perverse. I like Bill Gates. I think he does a
great job of bending the rules. Whether or not some people get
crushed in the process is an entirely different question.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Where do you get your workplace material now that you've been
working on your own for several years? Do you get it from your
girlfriend Pam's experience?
</P>
<P>
   A: She left her day job, too, but anybody I talk to is eager to
tell me how terrible their day is. And several hundred people
e-mail me messages a day. So I get it from all angles.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How will Dilbert handle the new millennium and the year 2000
problem?
</P>
<P>
   A: We wrote a whole episode about that for the UPN television
show in the spring. He's trapped in a company that doesn't think
it's a problem.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Does Dilbert have any hope of finding personal happiness?
</P>
<P>
   A: As long as there's new technology, that's all he needs. He's
got his dog. He's got his computer. He'd like to get married so he
can procreate, but he doesn't need much.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How would you describe your readers?
</P>
<P>
   A: They inevitably wear glasses. If you could make one
generalization, that would be it. And they are of above-average
intelligence and have inexplicable sex appeal. I say that so people
won't admit they aren't readers.

 &HT;    Tree-to-lumber process takes time, patience
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The question of what to do with green wood, and how to deal with
unwanted hardwood trees, has arisen again, so for the newcomers
we'll go over it all again.
</P>
<P>
   If you have a hardwood tree in your yard which you want to be
rid of, don't start dreaming of making big bucks by selling it to a
sawmill. Certainly, mills have paid thousands upon thousands of
dollars for a single fine walnut tree, but that's a rarity.
</P>
<P>
   Few if any sawmills want any part of a yard tree, no matter what
kind or how fine, because there's a good chance it's going to have
metal in it _ nails, bullets, pieces of chain, wire, you name it.
These things are hell on sawblades and veneer knives.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves us with using the wood ourselves, or forming a
little co-op with other woodworkers. To begin with, all the usual
caveats about felling trees. Be sure it's done by people who know
what they're doing. You can get killed and destroy your house with
one wrong move.
</P>
<P>
   The lengths into which the trunk and big limbs should be cut
depends on a number of things _ whether the tree had to be taken
down piecemeal; what, if anything, you have in mind for it; and
what kind of room you have for storing the lumber.
</P>
<P>
   Slicing the tree up into boards is best done with a portable
bandsaw mill such as a WoodMizer. Since these things can run into a
lot of money, you won't want to buy one unless you're going into
the wood-cutting business. You can call the company 800-553-0219 to
find out who's operating them in your area.
</P>
<P>
   The beauty of the Woodmizer is that there's so little waste. If
you want to go cheaply as possible, do the work yourself and
tolerate a great deal more waste, there are a number of kits to
make chainsaw mills on the market. You'll need a heavy duty chain
saw with a long _ I'd say at least 20-inch _ bar and ripping chains
to put on it. Investigate this before you jump into it; it's a huge
amount of brutal work.
</P>
<P>
   Before you begin slicing up the boards, decide where you will
store them for initial drying. You want a place that's outdoors but
covered well enough to keep the rain off the wood. You might have
to build a shed or lean-to if you're going to have a lot of wood.
Ideally the storage place should be where whatever wind or breeze
is available can reach it; i.e., not up against the back of the
garage.
</P>
<P>
   Have the logs cut into planks thicker than you want them,
because you're going to lose a good bit in shrinkage. To get
nominal 3/4-inch boards, for instance, cut them at least an inch
thick.
</P>
<P>
   Coat the ends of each plank with paint, with paraffin solutions
made for the purpose, or by dipping them into hot wax. The idea is
to retard the loss of moisture through the end grain, which
otherwisde will be so rapid that severe cracking will result. There
will be some cracking no matter what you do, but you want to keep
it to a minimum.
</P>
<P>
   The planks should be taken to the appointed drying place and
stickered in the same sequence in which they were taken from the
log, if it was sawn through and through. Use concrete blocks or
something similar to keep the bottom planks off the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Stickering means separating each plank from the one above it by
inserting sticks of wood about 3/4-inch thick. They should be
placed about every three feet, so the wood isn't allowed to sag.
The idea here is to allow air to circulate freely over every
surface of the wood.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, place heavy weights at the top of each stack, or bind
each stack tightly with rope _ which will have to be tightened as
the stack shrinks. This will help cut down on twisting and warping.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on the thickness of the planks, the wood will need to
remain outdoors from a year to two years. Then it can be moved into
an indoor or totally protected area that is neither heated nor air
conditioned, and left there for at least a year. Then you can move
it into your shop, and begin testing it. Cut a one-inch-square
block from a plank and weigh it. Do this every couple of weeks with
a fresh block until the blocks no longer exhibit any weight loss.
This means the wood is as dry as it's going to get _ hopefully
around 8 percent moisture content in the Atlanta area _ and it's
ready to work. n

LEFTISTS TAKE ON THE LOCK-'EM UP MENTALITY 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM WONG  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A recent conference at the University of
California at Berkeley was a throwback to the radical 1960s. Even
though the university maintains a liberal image, there are large,
if not overwhelming, numbers of centrists and conservatives now.
</P>
<P>
   So an international conference on the growth of the
prison-industrial complex _ concerning not only the number and size
of our prisons, but America's growing reliance on the prison system
as a solution for society's ills _ seemed both a natural and
counter-intuitive to our current political climate.
</P>
<P>
   Called ``Critical resistance: Beyond the Prison-Industrial
Complex,'' the conference drew some 3,000 people, surprising
organizers since only 1,200 had registered in advance. I was at the
Sunday afternoon closing plenary session, and if that one session
typified the three-day conference, one is left wondering whether
the radical left and liberals _ pariahs in our New World Order of
global capitalism and conservatism _ are beginning to mount a
spirited comeback.
</P>
<P>
   Angela Davis, the longtime prison-reform activist and leftist
theoretician, was one of the conference's principal organizers. She
was joined at the closing session by another icon of the '60s left
_ Bernadine Dohrn, a former Weather Underground leader who now
works on child and family issues. Geronimo Pratt, a Black Panther
who was granted a new trial after spending 25 years in prison on a
murder conviction, was also there.
</P>
<P>
   They and other speakers roused the crowd with inspirational
messages that were part 1960s rhetoric about struggles and
movements, and part New Age talk.
</P>
<P>
   Pratt reflected on the need for leftist reformers to give
strokes to colleagues. Left and liberal groups are famous for
trashing one another over sometimes arcane points of dogma, and for
personality and ego conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the emotional send-off to conferees to continue fighting
against the spread of the prison-industrial complex will yield
progress is anyone's guess. Given our current political culture,
one can't be too optimistic about changing the will of the American
people, for whom leftist radicalism is all but anathema.
</P>
<P>
   This is not to say that prison reformers ought to give up.
America needs to be reminded of what we stand for as a nation when
our willingness to finance more prisons outstrips our willingness
to help needy people before they get into trouble. It is much
easier to ignore the fact that the number of Americans in local
jails and in state and federal prisons has risen almost 60 percent
since 1990. Many Americans now favor a ``lock 'em up and throw away
the key'' approach.
</P>
<P>
   Prison reformers and others who object to punishment as our
society's preferred strategy for dealing with people who break our
laws are clearly fighting an uphill battle. Just consider the
November elections for governor, U.S. senator, and attorney general
in California.
</P>
<P>
   Candidates from both major parties are crawling all over one
another to prove to voters they are toughest on crime. Either by
implication or explicitly, major-party candidates favor the
continuation of the prison-industrial complex that the conferees
objected to. Other than standard platitudes about improving public
education, there is almost no talk about more public attention to
drug- and alcohol-treatment programs, family services or other
human-resources initiatives to turn around potentially troubled
young lives before they fall into the law-enforcement abyss.
</P>
<P>
   Californians ought to be embarrassed that corrections takes up a
larger percentage of the state budget than higher education. And
aren't we bothered by the fact that the state prison guards' union
has grown so powerful that it can demand, and get, a huge pay raise
from Gov. Pete Wilson? Reviving weary 1960s chants may not be
original, but restoring some balance to the law-and-order
discourse, as the Berkeley meeting tried to do, is a step whose
time has come.

 &HT;    COLUMN: Lott in an uphill battle
 &HT;    By Jay Bookman
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Trent Lott must lie awake nights, staring at the ceiling and
trying to puzzle out why an overwhelming majority of Americans
opposes impeachment of that low-down, lyin', cheating',
draft-dodgin' adulterer.
</P>
<P>
   But when Lott rolls out of bed each morning, puts earth beneath
his feet again and stares at himself in the bathroom mirror, the
answer to his question stares back at him.
</P>
<P>
   Because fear of Lott and others like him is the main reason that
Bill Clinton is likely to survive this scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past two decades, American politics has seen the rise
of a movement inspired by belief in its moral superiority and eager
to use government as a weapon to force that morality on others.
Lott, the Senate majority leader from Mississippi, has been a
prominent leader of that movement. Others, such as House Speaker
Newt Gingrich, may not fully subscribe to the notions of the
movement but have enlisted to advance their own ambitions.
</P>
<P>
   For six years, that moralistic movement has focused much of its
passion and energy on Bill Clinton, seeing him as the embodiment of
all that they most fear in modern culture. The depth of that
animosity is almost unparalleled in U.S. history. ``Impeach
Clinton'' bumper stickers appeared on cars before he had even taken
office, and wildly implausible conspiracy theories involving
Clinton have long been standard fare on talk radio.
</P>
<P>
   Many within the movement have never accepted Clinton's
presidency as legitimate. Echoes of that sentiment can be heard
when Lott argues that mere ``bad conduct'' by a president is enough
to justify impeachment. In other words, if Clinton's crimes do not
rise to the level of impeachment, Lott proposes to lower
impeachment to the level of Clinton's crimes.
</P>
<P>
   However, the national conversation over the past few weeks has
made it clear that most Americans do not see Clinton's behavior as
the central issue in this scandal. Rather, they see this
controversy as the decisive battle _ the Gettysburg, so to speak _
of a long and bitter cultural war in which Clinton is only a
symbol.
</P>
<P>
   That is true for those on both sides of the issue. Those who
demand Clinton's removal often argue that failure to impeach will
cement this country's final and irredeemable moral collapse. Those
who oppose Clinton's removal speak in similar terms, arguing that
if we surrender Clinton to those who have long demanded his head,
we also surrender our own right to privacy and personal freedom.
</P>
<P>
   They defend Clinton not because he is innocent, but because they
see the attack on him by Lott and others as an attack on
themselves. Likewise, they see Ken Starr not as an unbiased
investigator, but as the embodiment of government intrusion into
private affairs that they fear most from the right wing. And while
an affair with an intern is not exactly the high ground that most
of them would have chosen to defend, it is the ground that has been
forced upon them.
</P>
<P>
   In that sense, Bill Clinton is a lucky man. The details of his
misbehavior almost don't matter anymore. As in many a bitter family
battle, we have left behind the specific issue that touched off
this brawl and gone on to fight about the things that really bother
us. In fact, it seems as though we have subconsciously itched for
this fight for a long time.
</P>
<P>
   The struggle ahead promises to be nasty and brutish, but not
short. After hearings and debates, the House Judiciary Committee is
almost certain to vote along party lines in favor of impeachment.
That would mean _ at the least _ a bitter fight and vote on the
floor of the House. If a majority of the House supports
impeachment, the controversy will carry over into the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Those who argue that this is not Watergate are correct; in
cultural terms it will be something much larger, a fight over who
we are as a people.
</P>
<P>
   That's a daunting prospect for Lott, Gingrich and others. They
have turned Clinton into the devil incarnate among their political
base, and to placate that base they have no choice but to fight
hard to oust him. But the harder they fight, the more they confirm
the fears of a majority that already distrusts them. This is a
battle that they dare not avoid, but probably can't win.

`VIRGIN CANDLES' HAVE MANY ADVANTAGES OVER PARAFFIN 
</HEADLINE>

   ALBANY, N.Y. _ If you're having a problem with your paraffin
dinner candles burning out before you leave the table or because
they drip, try pure beeswax candles. They burn longer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Poured beeswax candles will outlast paraffin candles
four-to-one,'' said Joan Borghi, who with her husband, Victor, owns
Miss Bee Haven Apiaries in New Concord, N.Y. ``They also burn a
white flame instead of the yellowish glow of paraffin candles.
Beeswax candles also are smokeless and dripless, if not in a draft.
They also smell good by filling the room with the sweet aroma of
honey. Their wax is, after all, made from the nectar of flowers. In
Bibical times, this candle was known as `The Virgin Candle,' and is
still used in a lot of Roman Catholic churches today.''
</P>
<P>
   Rolled sheets of beeswax, featuring a hand or machine-pressed
honeycomb pattern, come in a wide range of colors to go with any
decor. But poured solid beeswax candles are a mellow buttery yellow
color, which is the natural color of beeswax, once it has been
cleaned of any dark brown or blackish honey deposits.
</P>
<P>
   ``The wax used for the candles comes from the beeswax that is
secreted by the honeybees to seal their honeycombs,'' Borghi said.
``We have to remove the cappings to retrieve the honey for sale. To
help the bees get started with their honeycomb building, we insert
a sheet of wax with the same geometrical honeycomb configuration on
it. As they build each honeycomb cell, they deposit their honey.
The bees need 80 to 100 pounds of honey to live on over the winter
and anything above that is surplus that we can sell,'' Borghi said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to rolling candles from sheets of colorful predyed
beeswax that Borghi purchases from a wholesaler (because of an
allergy to the dyes), she pours her own solid octagon-shaped pure
beeswax candles.
</P>
<P>
   Borghi's pure solid beeswax candles only come in a 10 1/2-inch
size for $5 a pair. Rolled beeswax candles start at 4 inches for $2
a pair to 16 inches for $4 a pair.
</P>
<P>
   Beeswax candles can be found in most specialty stores and candle
stores, such as Yankee Candles, the largest hand-crafted-candle
company in the country.
</P>
<P>
   If you plan to store your beeswax candles for any length of
time, they should be wrapped in white tissue or waxed paper, Borghi
advised.
</P>
<P>
   Pure beeswax is also excellent for waxing sticky drawers,
windows, archery bow strings, quilting threads, black powder
reloading guns and as a concealing aid for magic tricks, Borghi
said.

NIX ON THE NIXON ANALOGY 
</HEADLINE>
  By WILLIAM SALETAN 
 (www.slate.com) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Should President Clinton be treated just like President Nixon?
This week Republicans argued that he should. Unfortunately, they
failed to get their message straight.
</P>
<P>
   Two different Republican camps advanced the Watergate analogy in
two different ways for two different purposes. One camp's case is
more persuasive, but the other's is more exciting. And Democrats
are exploiting the difference.
</P>
<P>
   The Process Camp, led by House Judiciary Chairman Henry Hyde,
R-Ill., is using the Watergate analogy to justify procedural rules
for the Clinton impeachment inquiry. Wednesday Hyde released an
inquiry resolution, which, he noted, ``follows the Watergate
resolution, word for word.'' Hyde thinks that by following the
rules of the Watergate process, which were approved and
administered by Democrats, he can force Democrats to admit he's
conducting the Clinton inquiry fairly.
</P>
<P>
   The more zealous Substance Camp, led by House Majority Whip Tom
DeLay, R-Texas, is using the Watergate analogy to suggest not just
that the Clinton impeachment process should mirror the Nixon
impeachment process but also that Clinton's offenses are as serious
as Nixon's. This camp hopes constant comparisons between Watergate
and the Lewinsky cover-up will cause the former's gravity to rub
off on the latter.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats can't persuasively rebut the process analogy. So
instead, they're conflating it with the substance analogy.
Wednesday, when asked about the Watergate inquiry rules, Conyers
replied, ``The notion that this investigation should be open-ended
like Watergate ... is preposterous,'' because ``Watergate involved
a wholesale corruption of government which extended through the
FBI, the CIA and other federal agencies. This matter involves the
concealing of a private affair.''
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, White House Press Secretary Mike McCurry argued, ``The
facts of Watergate and the Monica Lewinsky matter are entirely
different, and I think most Americans would readily and quickly
agree to that, which is why I went through a little reminder about
the enormity of the crimes committed during the period of
Watergate.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the New York Times, McCurry arrived ``armed for a
question about comparisons to Watergate. He got it, and almost ran
out of breath as he rattled off a lengthy list of the accusations
against Nixon, including that he 'misused the FBI, (and) the Secret
Service, to conduct unlawful wiretapping of American citizens (and)
maintained a secret unit in the White House to violate the
constitutional rights of citizens.' After pausing slightly for air,
McCurry added indignantly, 'So there's no parallel whatsoever.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Once the process analogy is transformed into the substance
analogy, it loses its force. Yes, substantive analogies can be
drawn between Nixon's offenses and Clinton's, e.g., between the
Enemies List and the FBI files or between the Plumbers and the
Bimbo Eruption Team. But the differences are more striking. In the
Lewinsky case--the only case presently before Congress--the
president's objective was sex, not power. The underlying sins were
more personal than political. And the secret tapes and wires were
arranged not by the president but by his enemies and investigators.
</P>
<P>
   The irony is that it would have been so much easier to deem
Clinton's offenses impeachable on their own terms. He has plainly
lied under oath, for example. If Congress determines that this
constituted perjury (which is somewhat more technical), then
Clinton has committed a felony. Republicans could simply argue that
no felon should be allowed to remain president. Instead, they're
holding Clinton to the impossibly high standard of corruption set
by Nixon. If, as ``Henry Hyde recently pledged to do,'' the House
``applies the standard that emerged in 1974, it will decide that
the charges against Clinton do not fall under the articles of
impeachment,'' argued two Watergate-era Democratic congressmen in a
Times op-ed Thursday. They're right: Clinton's offenses aren't what
the Watergate committee meant by an impeachable offense. But that
comparison isn't what Hyde meant by the Watergate rules, either.

FINALLY, A FUNCTIONAL FAMILY MAKES THE BIG SCREEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By AMY BIANCOLLI  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``A Soldier's Daughter Never Cries'' is a mind-bending thing:
It's a movie about a functional family. You've heard of functional
families _ they're the ones that aren't abusive, don't engage in
incest, hug each other occasionally and treat each other with love
and respect.
</P>
<P>
   They're out there, somewhere, but we don't often see them
starring in feature films, which usually prefer the company of
dysfunctional monsters.
</P>
<P>
   Yet here it is, Merchant Ivory's latest film, a relaxed,
compassionate look at one family's ability to cope. The Willises
are expatriate Americans living in 1950s Paris: Bill (Kris
Kristofferson) is a bluff, successful novelist, Marcella (Barbara
Hershey) is his impassioned wife, and Channe (Luisa Conlon and
later Leelee Sobieski) is their clever, slightly discontented
daughter. Into their lives comes an illegitimate French boy, Benoit
(Samuel Gruen and Jesse Bradford), whose desperate young mother
sent him to an orphanage and has now allowed the Willises to adopt
him.
</P>
<P>
   The movie opens with a view from a window _ Benoit's pregnant
young mother, gazing at the surf from a beach house _ and repeats
the technique later, when the same woman regards her child through
a fogged-up pane of glass. It's a suitable metaphor for the
camera's eye, and it's especially fitting coming from a partnership
known for its unflappable studies of human relationships (``A Room
With a View,'' indeed).
</P>
<P>
   This one is both warm and subdued, a quiet, often humorous film
based on Kaylie Jones' autobiographical novel about her youth and
her father, the celebrated author James Jones (``From Here to
Eternity,'' ``The Thin Red Line''). Directed by James Ivory (and
produced by Ismail Merchant) from a script co-written by Ivory and
Ruth Prawer Jhabvala, the film turns gracefully from one event to
another in the Willis household, following Channe through girlhood
in France to fumbling adolescence in America.
</P>
<P>
   But it's most remarkable for what doesn't happen. The lusty Bill
doesn't have an affair. The tippling Marcella doesn't hit bottom
and slap one of her kids in the mouth. Benoit, who changes his name
to Billy and becomes a sad-eyed kid addicted to television, doesn't
attempt suicide, or shoot up drugs, or turn to crime. Channe
doesn't get raped or abused. And her parents consistently,
unfailingly support their children in all of their endeavors.
</P>
<P>
   It feels strange, somehow, to spend time with a family so
resolutely normal. As moviegoers, we aren't used to it; we expect
to be confronted with weirdness at every turn, getting dragged
through the mud of ``A Thousand Acres'' or the frigid air of ``The
Ice Storm.'' And the Willises are resolutely unweird: They have
their travails, they suffer heartbreaks large and small, but at no
point do relationships break down in a scattered Freudian mess.
They simply pause, adjust, and move on.
</P>
<P>
   Whether this makes compelling cinema is up to the viewer. Those
who require hysterical conflict or warped psychological plot twists
will come away dissatisfied, for Ivory's film is unfailingly
even-keeled. He recounts the story of Channe's childhood with
tenderness and patience, allowing his camera to dwell on the
telling minutiae of life: the lunchroom humiliations, the seesaw
chemistry between best friends, the fleeting passage of childish
rituals. Richard Robbins' lean, dark score snakes through her life
with rueful and sometimes dissonant commentary.
</P>
<P>
   ``Soldier's Daughter'' is both intuitively cast and immaculately
acted, a smart ensemble piece that is content to tell small, gentle
stories about a flawed but loving group of people. Hershey is fiery
yet skittish as Channe's vaguely combustible mother; Sobieski, last
seen dodging a comet in ``Deep Impact,'' conveys vulnerability and
hesitant intelligence. Bradford is sympathetic in the film's only
undeveloped part _ he comes across as a bit of a cipher, as though
some of his scenes met their fate on the cutting-room floor. But
Anthony Ross Costanzo has a marvelously vivid turn as Channe's
quirky best pal, Francis, who sings opera arias in a milky soprano
and zings some of the film's best lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``You act like a girl,'' Channe tells him. He retorts: ``I don't
act like anybody. I act like me.''
</P>
<P>
   Kristofferson tempers squinty-eyed machismo with beguiling
softness, like an old leather baseball mitt worn from years of
play. He watches old Clint Eastwood and John Wayne movies on the
tube, and at various points his vocal cadences become eerily
Duke-like. But the macho stuff is just a ruse: even the title
maxim, which Bill repeats to his daughter at trying times, proves
false.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stop with the `soldier's daughter.' Anyway, I'm not _ I'm a
writer's daughter,'' says Channe near the end of the film. Dad
replies, his voice a gravel bucket of affection: ``That's OK, then.
They cry all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet few tears are shed in ``A Soldier's Daughter Never Cries.''
The film presents grief, but never dwells on it _ bad news for
moviegoers in search of a few cathartic sobs. Despite the anguish
in the title, revelation and release are in very short supply here;
nothing comes to a boil in these cozy-warm waters, nothing rises to
the top and reveals itself as some long-lost horrid truth.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, crying jags are not the point. The point, instead,
is the decency of these characters, the complexity of their world
and their measured ability to behave _ to function _ as a family.

THE RICHNESS OF PURPLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BARBARA DE WITT 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; Royal purple reigns again.
</P>
<P>
   The current color craze started in Paris and has gone
mainstream, seen in everything from clothes to cars to candles,
says Brooke Stoddard, senior editor of House &AMP; Garden magazine.
</P>
<P>
   And its cosmopolitan ambience is appealing to everybody from Gen
X-ers to their parents, report furniture retailers such as Cecil
Adams, vice president of Expressions Custom Furniture in North
Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike recently trendy home decorating colors _ hunter green,
peach and dusty rose _ purple is steeped in history with plenty of
pathos.
</P>
<P>
   The color story begins in ancient Greece, where purple carpets
were rolled out for the gods. And in the Roman Empire, purple togas
signified elite status.
</P>
<P>
   According to Sherry Payne, a Pasadena interior designer who also
teaches color theory courses at several colleges, the color purple
has always been associated with the upper classes, because the
fabric was so costly to make.
</P>
<P>
   ``In medieval times, it took 20,000 shellfish to make one square
meter of dyed cloth, therefore only the royal family leaders could
afford to buy it. And even today, it only shows up during a strong
economy,'' Payne says.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, Payne says studies show that people behave more
elegantly in a purple setting. And while you're sitting
ever-so-straight in that purple chair, consider that purple also is
believed to relax the body, lower blood pressure and decrease
appetite.
</P>
<P>
   Purple, the shortest wavelength of the color spectrum (red is
the longest), was a favorite of England's Queen Victoria, and when
husband Prince Albert died, it became a mourning color that
continues to be a popular alternative to black, says Payne.
</P>
<P>
   Patty Lindberg, interior design specialist at the Fashion
Institute of Design and Merchandising in Los Angeles, says purple
is linked to spirituality, ritual and magic. According to Lindberg,
``Purple is a spiritually healing and purifying color, aiding sleep
and the development of psychic abilities. It is innate ... even
erotic.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the color can make people relaxed and/or erotic, Lindberg
says purple is perfect for bedrooms, especially when used in floral
patterns with green and white.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Payne says it works well in a kitchen because
people don't overeat when they're around purple. The French
designer Christian Lacroix hasn't said if he had dieters in mind,
but his newest collection of china patterns and table linens for
Christofle features shades of violet, gray and gold in tribute to
Napoleon III.
</P>
<P>
   The season's purple reign signals a return to formality and
luxurious fabrics, perhaps the latest installment in the cocooning
decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``Deep purple velvet is what we're seeing in furnishings right
now. It adds a touch of luxury, easily dressing up an inexpensively
decorated room,'' says Lindberg.
</P>
<P>
   But a little purple goes a long way, designers caution. For the
most drama, try using deep eggplant in a single piece of furniture,
such as a sofa or perhaps a trio of tasseled pillows. Too much
purple and you'll put guests on visual overload, as well as make a
room look small and heavy, advises Payne.
</P>
<P>
   According to Payne, purple tones work well on dark wood
furniture, especially when combined with greens, soft golds or
yellows, and white.
</P>
<P>
   So, you don't share the passion for purple and want to know
what's next?
</P>
<P>
   ``Look to women's clothing. I've noticed it always follows
fashion,'' says Irene Hidvegi, an interior designer at Glabman's
Furniture in Woodland Hills.

DON'T GIVE UP ON SLOW STARTERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL MULLER  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - Call me wacky, but when I take a guy in the first or
second round, I'd like for him to occasionally show up on Sunday.
Maybe even gain a yard or two.
</P>
<P>
   I know, I know. I'm too demanding. But it makes it hard to win
when your first-round pick starts looking better in his commercials
than he does on the football field.
</P>
<P>
   Like, for instance, Kordell Stewart.
</P>
<P>
   The Steelers quarterback was among the top six picks in most
fantasy drafts. He has responded by throwing the ball at imaginary
gophers and passings blimps, when he's not running for his life.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Pittsburgh's new offense looks like the one Stinky
Stinkowski and I ran during our street football games in the sixth
grade, straight from the ``everybody go out for a pass'' playbook.
</P>
<P>
   Except Stinky ran better patterns than Charles Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   I knew things were getting bad when a guy in our league benched
Stewart in favor of Baltimore's Eric Zeier _ and it turned out to
be the right move.
</P>
<P>
   Basically, Pittsburgh is in the same trap that Philadelphia was
in with Randall Cunningham. Let Stewart run, and the offense is
wildly unpredictable. Put the clamps on, and you take away the one
thing that makes him better than everybody else.
</P>
<P>
   But Stewart isn't the only first-round bust. Take the Georges
(no relation to the hurricane), Jeff and Eddie.
</P>
<P>
   Oakland's offensive scheme has made an average receiver out of
Tim Brown, and Jeff George is getting pounded. Almost half the
yards he rang up against Dallas came on a lucky deflection to James
Jett.
</P>
<P>
   Personally, I blame Al Davis. The glare from those stupid Elvis
sunglasses has melted his coaches' brains.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Eddie George hit rock bottom, gaining only 25 yards
on 14 carries. Tennessee doesn't seem committed to the run, and
George is a big guy who doles out punishment in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, you can't run if you're way behind.
</P>
<P>
   There are others. Tampa Bay's slow start has dropped the stock
of running backs Warrick Dunn and Mike Alstott. Antowain Smith is
getting stuffed in Buffalo. And Denver wide receiver Rod Smith is
making 1997 look like a fluke.
</P>
<P>
   I know what you're thinking: ``Gee, Bill, how can we take
advantage of all this pain and suffering?''
</P>
<P>
   Glad you asked. For one thing, don't panic. I think most of
these guys are going to come around. If you have them, keep them a
little longer.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, the owners who picked these underachievers are
starting to freak out. If you have a solid starter, offer a backup
in a trade, then hope the player you get comes alive in the second
half.
</P>
<P>
   I still think Jeff George will get his numbers. The Raiders have
faced some tough defenses (Kansas City, New York Giants, Denver and
Dallas) in the first four weeks. Their schedule gets a lot softer
down the stretch.
</P>
<P>
   Same with Stewart. I think the offense will get untracked as he
becomes more comfortable with his receivers. By the same token, I'd
dump Alstott and Antowain Smith like so much spoiled tuna. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One-hit wonder &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This week it's Green Bay receiver Derrick Mayes, who caught
passes for 87 yards and three touchdowns against Carolina. Does the
name Don Beebe ring a bell? &QL;

OREGON VOTERS COULD OPEN DOOR TO ADOPTEES' PAST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ADAM PERTMAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALEM, Ore. _ Mary Inselman found out five years ago that she
was adopted. Ever since, she has been trying to get her birth
certificate, so she can learn her biological parents' names and
seek out any blood relatives she might have.
</P>
<P>
   Both a state agency and a judge have repeatedly turned down her
requests, however, because Oregon _ like almost every state _ bars
adoptees from obtaining these documents. The stated reason is that
birth parents were promised anonymity, and that they should be
spared an uncomfortable encounter that may want no part of: having
the children they relinquished show up at the door.
</P>
<P>
   Inselman finds that logic irrelevant. She is 77 years old.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's probably nobody else even living in my family,'' she
said last week. ``It just seems so stupid that this is happening.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is why Inselman, a soft-spoken woman who shies away from
political activity, vocally supports a revolutionary initiative on
Oregon's ballot next month. It would give all adult adoptees
unrestricted access to their birth certificates, a right no state
has granted in at least a quarter-century; and it would do so only
if voters approve in a referendum, marking the first time in US
history that any question regarding adoption has been put to a
public vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not penetrating people's consciousness because neither
side has a significant amount of money, and because the Bill and
Monica show and the Sosa-McGwire show (have been) dominating the
media,'' said Warren Deras, a lawyer who works with a statewide
coalition of adoption professionals who are opposing the
unprecedented open-records initiative. ``But people should pay
attention, because it's a very important issue ... with some very
important implications in Oregon and for the whole country.''
</P>
<P>
   That it surely is, at least for the tens of millions of
Americans whose families include adoptees, adoptive parents, or
biological parents of children given up for adoption. The
``search'' _ shorthand for adoptees' efforts to find biological
parents (and sometimes of parents seeking them) _ is perhaps the
most difficult and emotionally charged subject that the adopted and
their families face, subtly or directly, or try to avoid.
</P>
<P>
   The consensus among adoption professionals, and the trend in the
past decade or so, has been in favor of increased openness. As a
result, a growing majority of children adopted today are or will be
provided with wide access to records and other information about
their backgrounds, usually from their own adoptive parents.
Moreover, as adoption has emerged from the shadows of shame and
secrecy in American life, the number of birth mothers requesting
anonymity has been rapidly shrinking.
</P>
<P>
   Some states have tried to catch up to these recent realities,
partly by creating little-publicized registries in which birth
parents and adoptees can formally declare their desire to meet and
provide details of how they can be contacted. A handful of states,
including Oregon, have developed systems that let adoptees ask
intermediaries to conduct a search and arrange a reunion with birth
parents, if they are amenable.
</P>
<P>
   Alaska and Kansas have always kept their birth certificates open
to adoptees. But adoption-reform advocates, agencies, and adoptee
organizations have not succeeded in changing the laws anywhere else
_ not even when release would be subject to severe restrictions to
protect birth parents' privacy.
</P>
<P>
   So the sponsors of Oregon's initiative decided to circumvent the
traditional route, through the state Legislature and the courts,
and are taking their case directly to the people. If they succeed,
they plan to expand their referendum strategy to other states.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a matter of grave concern to us on the national
level,'' said Bill Pierce, president of the National Council for
Adoption in Washington, a conservative organization that has led
many successful fights against measures designed to make adoption
more open. ``We've beaten them in the courts, we've beaten them in
the legislatures ... but we've never had experience with an
initiative before, and we would have to fight it in every state. In
some ways, this battle is a dress rehearsal.''
</P>
<P>
   Helen Hill, an elementary school art teacher and adoptee who is
leading the charge here, seemed thrilled at the possibility that
the ballot measure in Oregon could have such dramatic consequences.
She appeared equally pleased at the use of a strategy that puts the
decision about birth certificates into the hands of a new group of
decision-makers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It automatically changes the dynamic and, I think, puts the
odds on our side for the first time,'' said Hill, who is the Oregon
director of Bastard Nation, the largest and most vocal adoptee
activist organization in the country. Noting that adoptees are the
only Americans not allowed to view their birth certificates, she
added that ``voters will see that this is a clear, simple civil
rights issue... that no group should be denied a basic right
granted to all other citizens.''
</P>
<P>
   Lauren Greenbaum, an adoption specialist with the 113-year-old
Boys and Girls Society of Oregon, believes that Hill's argument is
so straight-forward and appealing that it will prevail in November.
``I think they'll win,'' she replied flatly when asked about the
referendum's chances.
</P>
<P>
   But she also said that Hill's approach is misleading, because
the proponents' objective is not simply to give adoptees access to
their birth certificates, but to facilitate the pursuit of
biological parents. ``It's all about `search,''' Greenbaum said.
</P>
<P>
   She said that the biological parents' rights therefore need to
be addressed as well, but she worries they won't be, what with the
difficulty in getting the electorate to focus on the complexities
or subtleties of the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Although they have principled concerns about the ballot measure,
Greenbaum and other initiative detractors aren't expecting much
harm to result if it is approved. Indeed, most experts agree that
the vast majority of birth mothers _ and fathers in the minority of
cases when they've been involved in the process _ either are
accepting or glad to be found, regardless of what they felt when
they relinquished their children.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides also agreed that the biggest source of fear about
``search'' is unfounded: that adoptees are moved to seek out their
biological parents because they are unhappy with their adoptive
parents. ``The research clearly shows that search doesn't indicate
dissatisfaction; people simply have a desire to know where they
come from,'' said Peter Gibbs, a longtime adoption specialist and
director of the Center for Adoption Research and Policy at the
University of Massachusetts Medical Center in Worcester.
</P>
<P>
   At least as significant, the adoption professionals who oppose
Oregon's initiative said they would support a statutory change to
open birth certificates to all new adoptees once they reach the age
of 21. That provision would protect birth parents who were assured
of anonymity in the past. Opponents of the current initiative also
want to allow for a ``contact veto,'' by which birth parents or
adoptees could sign a register declaring that they don't want to
hear from their biological relatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not that Bastard Nation or other people in support of
this don't have good arguments, because they do, but we have to
balance the rights of the birth mothers, too,'' said Greenbaum.
</P>
<P>
   Most mainstream adoption-reform groups, as well as specialists
in the field, are watching this battle without participating in it.
Some share the concern about birth parents' privacy; others worry
that if the initiative comes to be viewed as a national testing
ground, and fails, the consequences could be significant.
</P>
<P>
   ``With all the information on the Internet, and given the open
way adoptions are done today, issues of access to information about
adoptees' biological parents are becoming moot,'' said Joan
Hollinger, a professor at the University of California at Berkeley
Law School and one of the nation's foremost experts on adoption
practices. ``What I'm concerned about is that this initiative's
loss could send a message that people don't want openness, don't
want open records... so the down side could be substantial.''
</P>
<P>
   Madelyn Freundlich, who heads a research organization in New
York called the Evan B. Donaldson Adoption Institute, echoed that
concern. ``Pierce and people like him will say they were right all
along and will point to a defeat as vindication when other states
try to change their laws,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   All of which could set the stage for a compromise in 2000 if the
measure does lose, one that would push the birth-certificate issue
ahead with limitations designed to satisfy both sides in the
current controversy.
</P>
<P>
   Hill, however, isn't ready to talk compromise yet. She insists
this is an all-or-nothing fight for adoptees. She sees a parallel
in the civil rights struggle of the 1960s, when activists rejected
half-measures because they wanted full equality. Hill said she
understood some birth parents might not want to be sought out and
found, but argued that all those involved are adults who can
express their sentiments to each other without any intermediaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't make one group's rights supersede those of
another,'' said Hill. ``And you can't talk about compromise and
civil rights in the same sentence and be honest at all.''

CALIFORNIA WINE GROWERS WANT RAIN, RAIN TO GO AWAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (Filed in financial, ``f,'' and food, ``d,'' categories)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ERIC BRAZIL  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Short of a plague of frogs, a swarm of locusts
or the return of El Nino, rain is the last thing that Northern
California's beleaguered wine-grape growers want these early autumn
days.
</P>
<P>
   The season that began late, cold and wet is ending early, cold
and wet. More than half the grapes in a very light crop are
unpicked, and rain threatens the quality and quantity of fruit
still on the vine.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the first time in 24 years we have picked absolutely no
grapes in September. It's nerve-racking,'' said Deborah Kahn of
Navarro Vineyards in the Anderson Valley of Mendocino County.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only 5 percent of our fruit is in. I'm staring right down the
gun barrel,'' said Jeff Meyers, winemaker at Montevina Winery in
the Shenandoah Valley of Amador County. Montevina's harvest
traditionally starts in August.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year at this time we were 85 percent done,'' Meyers said.
</P>
<P>
   If a short crop meant higher prices _ as it invariably does in
the fruit and vegetable industry _ grape growers could, in theory,
roll with El Nino's punch. But it doesn't work that way in the
premium wine-grape business.
</P>
<P>
   El Nino is the name given to the unusual warming of waters in
the Pacific Ocean that affected global wind and temperature
patterns earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   The difficult growing season ``isn't going to drive up the
price,'' said Andy Beckstoffer, one of the Napa Valley's biggest
growers, who sells to 40 wineries. ``Grapes are sold on a long-term
contract, and most are sold based on the value of the wine, and
those prices don't change based on crop size.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the prices of bottles of wine ``are going to remain
competitive or get slightly lower,'' said Wilfred Wong, a wine
buyer. ``The market is healthy with product from Chile and the
south of France, so prices will definitely hold the line, if not
drop.''
</P>
<P>
   Ed Weber, Napa County viticulture adviser for the University of
California's cooperative extension service, said that with the
exception of champagne grapes, which are supposed to have low sugar
and high acid, ``pretty much everything else is still out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Weber said that more rain right now ``is likely to create some
significant problems, particularly bunch rot.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Gubler, a plant pathologist at the University of
California at Davis, agreed. ``This is much worse than a normal
year. The fungus has the ability to colonize the flowers, and it
got a head start with the early wet weather.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the blows from nature, vintners are hoping their skills
and some tricks of the trade will produce some decent wines.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the most challenging year for a winemaker that I've
seen in 28 years,'' said Ernie Farinas, winery manager, winemaker
and cellar master for UC-Davis, which has an 80-acre vineyard near
the campus and 40 acres in the Napa Valley. ``This is where
winemakers can put their skills to the test on quality.''
</P>
<P>
   Viticulture practices in the vineyards are crucial this season.
To minimize bunch rot, growers are pulling leaves off their vines
and thinning out bunches to open the vineyard canopies and improve
air circulation. Gubler and his colleagues demonstrated in the
early 1980s that reducing the amount of foliage in the vineyards
increases air flow and is as effective as several applications of
fungicides in containing botrytis, a plant disease that affects
buds.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been doing whatever we can to maximize what little heat
and sun we've been getting,'' said Bob Trinchero, chief executive
officer and chairman of St. Helena-based Sutter Home winery.
</P>
<P>
   Because of cool weather, the sugar content of grapes remains
low, thereby confronting growers with a dilemma.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are trying to decide whether to pick at a slightly
lower sugar than they had intended versus picking right after a
rain, when the sugar will be higher but there will be more
botrytis,'' Weber said.
</P>
<P>
   Meyers has just made his choice. ``Our grapes aren't as ripe as
I prefer, but we're going to start a preemptive pick, if you will,
on Monday. ... For my big reds, I haven't picked a grape, and I'm
hoping to dodge a bullet.''

<P>
   Whether the quality will be down commensurately won't be known
until the wines made from this year's crop are ready to drink.
</P>
<P>
   Some say there's no question quality will suffer. ``Everybody's
trying to put a positive spin on it, but the quality's going to be
very indifferent,'' Wong said.
</P>
<P>
   California's last El Nino vintage, 1983, when rain impeded the
harvest, was uneven and unmemorable.
</P>
<P>
   It produced ``rather shallow wines, acidic and not particularly
full bodied along any measure,'' said Joel Butler, national manager
for press relations and education for United Distillers and
Vintners and a certified Master of Wines.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, this year could produce some surprises, said
Michael Richmond, winemaker and general manager of Acacia Vineyards
in the Napa Valley. ``Our Pinot Noir had a nice, long hang time,
the grapes showed high sugars, and we think we'll have concentrated
flavors and a chance to make some superb Pinot Noirs,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Trinchero believes this year's wines may not be great but
``there's no reason it won't be a good year.''

VAN GOGH TAKES WASHINGTON BY STORM 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and e coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARY LEONARD  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Move over, Monet. The really big guy has arrived.
</P>
<P>
   For a city that takes kings and queens, prime ministers,
presidents, and even an occasional Hollywood star in stride,
Washington is simply agog over Vincent Van Gogh. On Sunday, Oct. 4,
a stunning exhibit of 72 works by the enormously popular Dutch
painter _ sometimes called the Elvis of the art world _ opens at
the National Gallery of Art for a three-month run.
</P>
<P>
   In the breathless world of blockbuster shows _ a huge exhibit of
Claude Monet's 20th century work opened recently at Boston's Museum
of Fine Arts _ ``Van Gogh's Van Goghs'' is considered the crown
jewel, the event of the year. Not for 25 years have so many Van
Goghs been brought together in one North American exhibit, and it
may never happen again.
</P>
<P>
   Scalpers are demanding more than $100 each for a few precious
tickets to the free show. Chefs are creating special Vincent
dishes, hotels are offering Van Gogh weekends, and the National
Gallery, for once is bending its no-kitsch rules to allow the sale
of Van Gogh magnets, mugs, and $59 watches.
</P>
<P>
   ``Van Gogh would have been truly amazed by the media and
touristic attention to this exhibit,'' said Philip Conisbee, the
gallery's senior curator of European paintings. ``This is, after
all, an artist who sold only one work of art in his lifetime.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, people can't seem to get enough of Van Gogh, the tormented
legend whose work not only fetches stratospheric sums but who also
has inspired more films, books, scholarly papers, poetry, popular
songs, Web sites, tacky souvenirs (``Degas makes da Van Gogh,''
says one T-shirt), art thefts and forgeries than Monet, Manet, and
Millet put together. Like Leonardo and Rembrandt, the world's on a
first-name basis with Vincent.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's Van Gogh! I had to come,'' swooned Edney Silverstre, a
correspondent for Globo-TV Brazil, who traveled from New York with
a camera crew for a sneak media preview of the exhibit. ``He's the
rock star of art, so he guarantees high ratings for me.''
</P>
<P>
   From wherever they watch (the Japanese are known to have a
special affection for Vincent), the public will see in this show
some of Van Gogh's greatest works, including ``The Potato Eaters''
(1885), ``Self-Portrait with a Felt Hat'' (1887), ``The Bedroom''
(1888), ``Wheatfields with Crows''(1890) _ paintings that represent
the tremendous range, and brilliant expression of Van Gogh's short
but prolific career.
</P>
<P>
   Some may be disappointed that this priceless collection, on loan
during the renovation and expansion of Amsterdam's Van Gogh Museum,
doesn't include any of the painter's well-known golden sunflowers
(the inspiration for, among many other consumer goods, a Barbie
doll costume). Nor will they see the alluring ``Starry Night,''
which not only was popularized in Don McLean's 1972 hit song,
``Vincent,'' but also once provided the bright, blue background for
a commercial for TV's Conan O'Brien.
</P>
<P>
   There's no doubt that the public likes to look at Van Goghs. But
that's not all there is to it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people see a lot of themselves in Vincent,'' said
David Brooks, a Toronto banker who designed the most comprehensive
Van Gogh Web site (www.vangoghgallery.com). ``He worked hard, he
was good and decent, he was lonely and insecure, and he was never
sure whether the work he was doing was worthwhile ... You can't
help but like the man.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, his was a life which balanced genius with tragedy.
The son of a minister, Vincent Van Gogh drifted from job to job
before becoming a painter supported throughout his life by his
brother, Theo. He was institutionalized for mental illness, drank
too much, and suffered from seizures. He never married but lived
with a prostitute. He went after artist Paul Gauguin with a razor
but turned the blade on himself, cutting off his own ear lobe. In
1890, at age 37 and just as his talent was being discovered, Van
Gogh walked into a French wheatfield and fired a pistol into his
chest. He died two days later.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Van Gogh had been a happy man, he still would have been a
great artist, but he might not have been the romantic genius or had
quite the emotional appeal that the culture adores today,''
Conisbee said.
</P>
<P>
   Josien Heling-Van Gogh is the painter's niece and part of the
family foundation in the Netherlands that painstakingly, and at
considerable financial sacrifice, has maintained a large portfolio
of Van Gogh's paintings and writings for the public. She says she
tries to be patient when the focus is put on her uncle's life
instead of his art.
</P>
<P>
   ``People will come up to me and say, `Are you a relative of that
crazy person who cut off his ear?''' Heling-Van Gogh said. ``I say,
`Well, he only cut off part of his ear, and he wasn't crazy.' He
was complicated. He was a person of ups and downs. And he made
wonderful paintings.''
</P>
<P>
   Heling-Van Gogh says she only regrets that her grandfather, also
named Vincent Van Gogh, didn't keep a few paintings in the family
when he set up the public trust. In 1990, Van Gogh's ``Portrait of
Doctor Gachet'' was purchased by a private Japanese collector for
$82.5 million, the highest sale price in art history.
</P>
<P>
   Such price tags only add to the mystique. ``Celebrities have
become our culture's most reliable products,'' said James Mahoney,
a critic for Art in America magazine. ``Why is Van Gogh so popular?
In part, it's because people are fascinated by anything that is
worth a lot of money.''
</P>
<P>
   Brooks, whose Web site has had more than 250,000 visitors since
it was set up two years ago, thinks it is ``a little bit sad'' that
an artist who couldn't afford to feed himself has now become a
``cottage industry,'' generating millions in sales not only through
his works, but also the myriad spinoffs. He said he was
particularly offended to find a ``Pin the Ear on Van Gogh'' game in
the gift shop of a children's museum.
</P>
<P>
   Whether it's Van Gogh in Washington, Monet in Boston, or Cezanne
in Philadelphia, the hot shows make cash registers jingle and draw
thousands of tourists to town. In Boston, 200,000 advance tickets
already have been sold for the Monet exhibit, which lasts until
Dec. 27.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, 215,000 advance passes to the Van Gogh show were
snapped up quickly, and long lines are expected to form for the
2,000 tickets that will be distributed each day. In January, the
exhibit moves on to the Los Angeles County Museum of Art for a
nearly three-month stay.
</P>
<P>
   One disappointed art lover is Brooks, the Van Gogh Web site
designer who has not been able to get a ticket to the show in
Washington and refuses to pay a scalper.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a heartbreaker,'' said Brooks. ``This is a
once-in-a-lifetime event.''

`ANTZ' ANIMATORS MAKE A MOUNTAIN OUT OF AN ANTHILL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
ANTZ 
Directed by: Eric Darnell, Tim Johnson 
Screenplay by: Todd Alcott, Chris Weitz &AMP; and Paul Weitz 
With the voices of: Woody Allen, Dan Aykroyd,/cq/ Anne Bancroft,
Jane Curtin, Danny Glover, Gene Hackman, Jennifer Lopez, John
Mahoney, Paul Mazursky, Grant Shaud, Sylvester Stallone, Sharon
Stone, Christopher Walken 
Running time: 83 minutes 
Rated: PG (mild language and menacing action) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Antz'' yanks us into the expanding world of computer-generated
animation and turns us into delighted kids again. It's fresh,
exhilarating, funny, able to tell an old story in a beguiling new
way. It also suggests that DreamWorks and rival Disney are
Hollywood's version of McGwire and Sosa. After slugging it out with
duelling comet movies _ ``Deep Impact'' and ``Armageddon'' _
they're now squaring off with battling bug cartoons. In eight
weeks, we'll see Disney's ``A Bug's Life,'' made by the ``Toy
Story'' wizards at Pixar. Right now, though, there's a lot to like
in ``Antz.'' Like ``Toy Story,'' ``Antz'' suggests a whole
tradition scrubbed clean, shiny with newness, high on the
moment-to-moment discovery of its own possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   Its movement is upward and outward, from a dark, totalitarian
underground world to a scary but thrilling and blindingly radiant
Insectopia above ground. The tunneled, layered interior of the
anthill is right out of Fritz Lang's ``Metropolis,'' with masses of
robotic workers toiling mindlessly for the incipiently fascist
colony. But Lang never had Woody Allen to play the little guy who
moves from kvetching on his shrink's couch to questioning the
social order, and moving from insignificant worker mining dirt with
pick and shovel to war hero to outlaw when he makes off with a
princess cool enough to not mind being taken along.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard not to believe that Allen didn't write at least some
of his lines. At least I'd like to think so when his nebbishy ant,
Z, whines about the self-esteem problems brought on by being the
middle child in a family of five million. ``Antz'' restores to us
the shleppy Woody who used to beat the odds and wind up with Diane
Keaton in films like ``Sleeper.'' Ironically, but perhaps not
altogether paradoxically, ``Antz'' is going to do more to perk up
Allen's career than all his own films of the '90s, including the
terrific ones.
</P>
<P>
   Not that ``Antz'' is all Allen. It owes a lot of what will be
its winning appeal to its look, both underground and especially
above ground, where the artifice isn't disguised, but advanced as
part of a new esthetic. As ``Toy Story'' showed us, artifice can
have its very own dazzle, and ``Antz'' builds on it, whether it
involves Z doing a funky dance to ``Guantanamera'' with the
princess (slumming in a worker's bar) while all the others gyrate
robotically, or above ground, when a sneaker on the redwood-like
leg of a boy almost lands on Z and the princess like a giant
spaceship and crushes them.
</P>
<P>
   When Z, trying to rescue the princess, grabs one of the
sneaker's loose shoelaces and is yanked along by the striding boy
oblivious to his presence, it supplies as much of a rush as any
rescue scene in years. And when Z meets a pair of sympathetic WASP
wasps (voiced by Dan Aykroyd and Jane Curtin), you're surprisingly
touched for a moment. The voices are first-rate. Stallone seems to
be slyly enjoying the chance to play a Rambo figure with the voice
and personality of Rocky. Sharon Stone is the essence of wry
sophistication as the princess. And Gene Hackman and Christopher
Walken arrestingly color the voices of the bad and good
militarists, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   The real star of ``Antz,'' however, is its look. The real
animation comes from the adrenalin level of the computer artists
playing with their new toys, pushing the envelope, even in the
parodies. When Z gets more than the military parade he bargains for
and is sent off with the rest of the army to fight a nest of
termites, the carnage is right out of ``Starship Troopers.'' The
story never quite resolves its built-in contradiction, namely the
clash between its message of individualism triumphant and its need
to have Z wind up with the princess back in the colony. The story,
in short, isn't as foolproof as the renderings, even the ones that
make the ants seem made of wood. But there's always something to
grab the eye and charm it here. ``Antz'' is king of the hill.

CALIFORNIA WINE GROWERS WANT RAIN, RAIN TO GO AWAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (Filed in financial, ``f,'' and food, ``d,'' categories)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ERIC BRAZIL  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Short of a plague of frogs, a swarm of locusts
or the return of El Nino, rain is the last thing that Northern
California's beleaguered wine-grape growers want these early autumn
days.
</P>
<P>
   The season that began late, cold and wet is ending early, cold
and wet. More than half the grapes in a very light crop are
unpicked, and rain threatens the quality and quantity of fruit
still on the vine.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the first time in 24 years we have picked absolutely no
grapes in September. It's nerve-racking,'' said Deborah Kahn of
Navarro Vineyards in the Anderson Valley of Mendocino County.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only 5 percent of our fruit is in. I'm staring right down the
gun barrel,'' said Jeff Meyers, winemaker at Montevina Winery in
the Shenandoah Valley of Amador County. Montevina's harvest
traditionally starts in August.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year at this time we were 85 percent done,'' Meyers said.
</P>
<P>
   If a short crop meant higher prices _ as it invariably does in
the fruit and vegetable industry _ grape growers could, in theory,
roll with El Nino's punch. But it doesn't work that way in the
premium wine-grape business.
</P>
<P>
   El Nino is the name given to the unusual warming of waters in
the Pacific Ocean that affected global wind and temperature
patterns earlier this year.
</P>

BARENAKED LADIES LEARNS TO LOVE SHOWBIZ 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The term ``show business'' may be a dirty phrase to some rock
'n' roll bands, but not to Barenaked Ladies. They sing, tell jokes,
and improvise on stage. They study show-biz icons like Sammy Davis
Jr. and Dean Martin, plus crafty pop humorists like John Prine and
Randy Newman. And they're as far from the angst era as any band
could be.
</P>
<P>
   ``People come to us for a good time and to hear up stuff,'' says
Barenaked Ladies singer Steven Page. ``I think crowds leave our
concerts really, really happy.''
</P>
<P>
   And the crowds are getting bigger by the day, for Barenaked
Ladies are a true phenomenon. They sold out their FleetCenter show
this Monday in 25 minutes. They drew 30,000-plus to a City Plaza
date this summer. And who knows how many they'll draw to another
City Hall Plaza show (as part of the MIX Fest) on Sunday, Oct. 11.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a classic word-of-mouth band,'' says Page, acknowledging
a comparison to the Dave Matthews Band, which built its audience
the same way. ``I don't know a lot about Dave Matthews, but I know
we have a lot of fans in common,'' Page adds. ``Our fans tell their
friends about us, and they drag them along to the shows.''
</P>
<P>
   A humorous edge has suffused the six-year recording history of
Barenaked Ladies, whose key songwriters, Page and Ed Robertson,
grew up together in Scarborough, Ontario. ``We don't walk off stage
and turn into dour, glum people,'' says Page. ``And when we do go
on stage, we turn the humor up a notch.''
</P>
<P>
   Page may modestly declare that ``we're just a lumpy band of
boys,'' but they're also a group with unusual pop intelligence, as
seen in its driving, acoustic-layered rock and in the recent hit,
``One Week.'' A sample line: ``Like Kurasawa, I make mad films/
Okay, I don't make films / But if I did, they'd have a Samurai.''
Or this: ``Like Harrison Ford, I'm getting frantic/ Like Sting, I'm
tantric.''
</P>
<P>
   Other songs from their latest album, ``Barenaked Ladies,''
include the satirical ``Alcohol'' (``a party-time necessity''), the
playful ``It's All Been Done'' (``If I play the same three chords,
will you just yawn and say it's all been done before?''), and the
exuberant ``I'll Be That Girl,'' with the verse ``When you're
through being young and beautiful ... then come to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that it's all been fun and games. A jolt of reality hit last
year when keyboardist Kevin Hearn was diagnosed with leukemia (he's
been replaced this tour by Toronto friend Chris Brown). But the
diagnosis is good. ``He's had a new treatment called a stem-cell

rid of the cancer. We hope he'll be back with us in the spring.''

   Tom Tom Club: The Tom Tom Club slips into town to play the
Paradise tomorrow. The group doesn't have a new record, but does
have a new web site (www.tomtomclub.com) and quite a legacy to
impart. Band leaders Tina Weymouth (vocals, bass) and Chris Frantz
(drums) have had a professional and personal relationship for two
decades, dating back to their formative role in the Talking Heads,
back before David Byrne left for a solo career.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very happy. I'm in love with my husband. The sun is
shining, and we're trying to forget anything negative,'' says
Weymouth, speaking from her Westport, Conn. home, where she and
Frantz are raising two sons, 11 and 15. ``We're taking our music in
a new direction that we call lover's rock. I just didn't want to go
to the angry places anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   The Tom Tom Club started in 1981 as a techno-spiced side project
to the Talking Heads. The band was ahead of the curve in the techno
revolution and has become one of the most sampled groups in the
field. ``The Genius of Love,'' a Tom Tom Club hit from 1982, was
sampled in Ziggy Marley &AMP; the Melody Makers' ``Tomorrow People''
and Mariah Carey's No. 1 hit, ``Fantasy,'' as well as by rappers
such as Puff Daddy.
</P>
<P>
   ``God bless Puff Daddy,'' Frantz says with a chuckle.
</P>
<P>
   The latest incarnation of Tom Tom Club includes percussionist
Steve Scales (from the Heads' heyday) and co-singer Charles
Pettigrew, formerly with Boston acts Down Avenue and Charles &AMP;
Eddie. ``We've recorded a lot of stuff with Charles,'' says Frantz,
who promises to unveil part of it tomorrow, as well as Tom Tom Club
hits and the Heads's ``Psycho Killer,'' which is ``just a fun song
to do,'' adds Weymouth.
</P>
<P>
   The group has had trouble finding record company interest
(``Part of it is our age and the fact that we're just not the next
big thing anymore,'' says Frantz), so it may release its next disc
on an indie label. ``Right now, we're just making music for the
love of it. Imagine that,'' says Weymouth, who has also done some
production work with her husband for such groups as Angelfish
(Shirley Manson's band before Garbage) and Los Fabulosos Cadillacs.
</P>
<P>
   They also revived a version of the Talking Heads in 1996
(without Byrne), calling it just the Heads. It included Heads
keyboardist Jerry Harrison, who is now producing a CD for the band
Live. The Heads may be revived (without singer Johnette Napolitano)
and may adopt a different name, which is ``probably what we should
have done in the first place,'' says Frantz.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the Paradise show Saturday, the Tom Tom Club is at
Lupo's in Providence, R.I. Friday night to benefit the alumni
scholarship fund of the Rhode Island School of Design, where
Frantz, Weymouth, and Byrne all went in the '70s.

A BMW TO QUICKEN THE PULSE

 (l and f coding)

 By JOHN R.WHITE

<TEXT>
<P>
   The Fourth Annual Castle Hill Concours d'Elegance has been a
riproaring success, which means that all roads in and out of
Ipswich, Mass. on this last muggy Sunday afternoon are jammed. So I
am whiling away the time in traffic listening to Click &AMP; Clack, the
Tappet Brothers, a.k.a. Tom and Ray Magliozzi, expounding on things
mechanical, philosophical, and societal on National Public Radio.
They have reached that point in the program known to regular
listeners as ``The Tommy Rant,'' during which Tommy Tappet lapses
loudly into the Twilight Zone and gives work to otherwise idle
attorneys.
</P>
<P>
   Today it is BMW's turn to sue as TT declares the Z3 with a
six-cylinder engine as ``unsafe'' and certainly not something to
entrust to a 16-year-old. Well, he's half right _ the doting mother
asking his advice on which transmission, automatic or manual, she
should purchase in the Z3-cum-I-6 engine intended for her
16-year-old daughter is getting properly raked over the coals for
the idiot she is. But the fulmination turns nasty; TT jumps from
unwarranted allegations of unsafe car to advocating
horsepower-to-weight limitations on all cars, and _ surprise _ he
is joined in this eco-nazi theme by normally sensible brother Ray.
</P>
<P>
   I am shaking my head, listening, inching through traffic, when I
spy the Subaru coming the other way, a familiar face behind the
wheel. It's Tommy Tappet. For an instant I have him on the radio
ranting and in person exchanging greetings as only Tom can _ with
bellowing laughter. There is no time to bring up the subject of the
BMW; traffic is slow, but not that slow.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But the subject today is BMW, and the particular BMW is the M
Coupe, the latest manifestation of the Z3, actually, with
240-horsepower I-6, five-speed manual gearbox, a tin top, and a
square back. It reminds one of the old Volvo P1800 squareback, only
less angular. It takes some getting used to, but finally I stop
thinking of it as a cartoon edition of that Volvo and decide that I
like the look of it _ it's a handsome little thing.
</P>
<P>
   If Tommy Tappet thinks the 189-horsepower I-6 in the regular
edition of the Z3 convertible or coupe is a hot number, he should
get his hands on this M Coupe. It should be good for at least three
weeks of rant.
</P>
<P>
   The coupe is fast, agile, and very civilized. Unlike the
convertible, the two-seater coupe has cargo room _ enough for a
couple of two-suiters plus soft luggage _ here's a sports car for
the tubist. Part of the road test is a run to northwest Vermont in
company with another auto writer and two sets of baggage. With a
full load, the M Coupe still sizzles uphill and down dale, snaps
around the tight corners, accelerates with vigor in any gear _ this
is a very elastic car.
</P>
<P>
   But it is the trip back, this time alone with only the one set
of baggage, that is seared into memory, a truly spiritual driving
experience. I choose a mountain route, a route made familiar during
driving exercises with another German automaker's cars, and head
west across Vermont Route 17 just south of Vergennes. There are
four cars in front of me and suddenly the road ahead is open. I
snap the shifter down to fourth gear and press the throttle; the M
leaps around two cars _ traffic appears ahead. I wait for the next
opening, then blaze past the remaining two cars; in my enthusiasm,
I have also blazed past a required right turn, if I am to get home.
</P>
<P>
   I backtrack, pass two more cars on the approach to the ascent up
the mountain, then find the road unoccupied for 20 or so miles. The
road up and then down switches back and forth, offers some nasty
hairpin turns in which to test the mettle of the M Coupe. Tom
Tappet is certainly right about one thing: If you find yourself in
a fast, capable car, you are sorely tempted to drive it fast. The M
is more than fast, better than capable, but enjoyable at any speed.
For a time I was simply an extension of the machine, wringing the
utmost out of both of us, putting to use most of the driving
lessons of two decades of learning. It is almost an out-of-body
experience, something mystical, close to heavenly.
</P>
<P>
   And then it's over as I join Route 100 and traffic. Ah, but it
was grand.
</P>
<P>
   The Z3 convertible was designed stiff to be agile on the road,
to turn smartly with virtually no flexing of the chassis. The coupe
adds a roof, closing the already stiff box and making it even
stiffer. The result is a car that is a handling dream.
</P>
<P>
   Controls are simple; the instrument cluster holds only the bare
necessities _ fuel gauge, speedometer, tachometer, and temperature
guage. A clock, voltmeter, and oil pressure gauge sit on the bottom
foot of the console just below the temperature/fan controls _ large
convenient knobs, by the way. The hand brake rests next to the
driver's right thigh.
</P>
<P>
   Convenience diminishes with the radio controls, disappears
altogether in the matter of cupholders, two, under a lid between
the seats and behind the occupants. A small covered bin sits ahead
of them. The glove box is taxed by the owner's manual, but door
bins and a compartment between the seatbacks help with minor
storage. The back offers major storage under a privacy cover.
</P>
<P>
   Give this $40K-plus car to a 16-year-old? Not a chance. A kid
should start on a clunker, something possessed of a lot of excess
practice metal _ mine learned on a hand-me-down Volare, a
glamourless clod of a car just right for the job. Spend the money
on advanced driver training instead.
</P>
<P>
   Is this little car unsafe? The car itself at worst can be said
to be neutral; drivers are unsafe. But this coupe is nimble, quick,
able to avoid occasions of disaster. Fast, yes, but speed isn't
what kills. What kills is speed divorced from reason, speed that
exceeds the limits of driving conditions, experimental speed by the
untrained or the speed of the intoxicated. With seatbelts, air
bags, training and judgment, this is a very safe car. Don't leave
home without any of those.
</P>
<P>
   The M Coupe offers socially acceptable fuel mileage, too; it
delivered an average 27.74 miles per gallon over 900 miles clocked
_ 900 miles of spirited driving.
</P>
<P>
   I have never liked any BMW as much as I like this M Coupe. This
one's a keeper.

QUESTIONS FROM A NEW HOMEOWNER 
</HEADLINE>

   Q. I just bought a house and have a lot of questions. 1. Is it
OK to pressure-wash vinyl siding? 2. Should an asphalt driveway be
sealed every year? 3. How can I fill small cracks in my asphalt
driveway? 4. The back deck is pressure-treated wood, but never was
sealed. Should it be sealed, or should I treat it with
semitransparent stain that you seemed to prefer. 5. Can I use
caulking between ceramic tiles instead of grout? 6. How can I hang
things on a ceramic tile wall? 7. I have a lot of silver that is
severely tarnished. How can I clean it?
</P>
<P>
   BEN SIMON, Somerville, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. You're right about one thing; those are a lot of questions,
but that's OK, because they can be answered and cover a lot of
problems that other first-time homeowners run into without a clue
as to what to do. The answers might take up most of a column, but
that's OK, too.
</P>
<P>
   So, here goes: 1. I don't think it is a good idea to
pressure-wash vinyl siding (and aluminum siding). Such siding is
made up of strips of the material that are connected with
interlocking edges, and the strips are hung on nails rather than
being nailed tightly against the sheathing boards. These connecting
joints are not airtight and also not watertight; therefore,
pressurized water could penetrate those joints. This water would
tend to stay behind the siding and will take a long time to
evaporate. Such long-standing water could cause decay. This
penetration of water might occur when pressure-washers aim the jet
stream upward, under the joints. I doubt if they will take care not
to do that.
</P>
<P>
   While such joints are not watertight, the siding itself,
properly installed, will resist 99 percent of weather (rain, snow,
sleet) thrown at it.
</P>
<P>
   2. An asphalt driveway does not have to be sealed; sealer is
mostly cosmetic, and while a sealer may make the driveway look
nice, it is doing little else. A sealer should last 10 years or so.
</P>
<P>
   3. Fill small cracks in a driveway with, well, a driveway crack
sealer; it comes in a caulking cartidge and is easily applied, but
it won't do much good if you can't get it into the crack. But
cracks should be looked after, because water can get into such
cracks, and if it freezes in winter, it expands, making the cracks
wider. That brings us back to the sealer; a sealer will, indeed,
fill very small cracks, so if you do have them, then sealing the
driveway makes sense.
</P>
<P>
   4. A pressure-treated deck is sealed with a clear sealer such as
Thompson's to keep the wood from splitting and spalling (bits of
wood and slivers coming out of the wood). A sealer generally has to
be renewed every year or two, adding to the maintenance chores of a
deck. If your deck boards show no sign of splitting or spalling or
misbehaving, you don't need a sealer. But you're right that the
handyman prefers semitransparent stain; this will do the same as a
sealer, provides color, needs only one coat, and will last a lot
longer, three to five years.
</P>
<P>
   5. Do not use caulking in the joints of ceramic tile. It won't
work well, stays soft, and is virtually impossible to clean, and is
simply not designed to go between tiles. Use grout instead; grout
is a cementitious material (like concrete or mortar), and goes into
tile joints very well. Most grout for wall tiles is sandless,
making it easier to install. Sanded grout is usually used on
ceramic tile floors. If you do intall new grout, the joint must be
cleaned of all old grout, and the new installed very, very
compactly; otherwise, it will fail.
</P>
<P>
   Your question probably arose from the popular use of caulking
(instead of grout) in the joint between tiles and tub. I feel that
grout in this joint is better than caulking, even in these
relatively large joints.
</P>
<P>
   6. You can hang things on a ceramic tile floor by drilling small
holes through the tile and installing a round-headed screw into a
stud, or if there is no stud, inserting a molly bolt. Hang things
on these protruding screw or bolt heads.
</P>
<P>
   It is relatively easy to drill holes in ceramic tile. You can
buy a special spade bit for drilling ceramic, and glass, for that
matter. Do it slowly. And drill a scrap piece of tile to see if you
can do it. That will also give you a little practice before you go
to the real thing.
</P>
<P>
   7. You can clean silver the old-fashioned way, by using a paste
cleaner. I remember using it as a kid, but forget the brand name.
There are several types on the market, all good for polishing, but,
of course, it requires hand work. Or, you can clean silver the
new-fashioned way, by using the dip method.
</P>
<P>
   But be careful using the dip method on heavily carved silver.
The deep parts of the carving of a lot of these items are black,
enhancing the deep embossing. They should stay black. Dipping will
lighten these black areas, spoiling the effect of the carving.
</P>
<P>
   Well, sir, it did take up a whole column, but it was worth it.
</P>
<P>

BUCKEYES SHOULD PASS TEST EASILY

   COLUMBUS, Ohio _ Already they are starting to ask, how good is
this Ohio State team?
</P>
<P>
   Are they good enough to beat Michigan in Columbus Nov. 21? Good
enough to win a national championship? Good enough to be called one
of the best teams of all time?
</P>
<P>
   No one really knows. But the first real indication should come
Saturday when Penn State comes to town.
</P>
<P>
   In a season in which no one has looked invincible week-to-week,
the Buckeyes seem to be the closest to wearing the label of great.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will be one of the better teams we've played against,''
said Penn State coach Joe Paterno, who is not talking about just
this season, but his entire stay at Penn State.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're playing one of the best football teams I've seen in 50
years,'' said Paterno, who has been at Penn State since 1950.
``It's as simple as that.''
</P>
<P>
   Ohio State is a better team than Penn State. It is playing at
home. It should win. In fact, if talent was the only factor, the
Buckeyes should win every game on their schedule.
</P>
<P>
   But as Buckeye fans and critics will tell you, it's not all
about talent. Michigan appears on the Buckeyes schedule in November
and the Wolverines usually find a way to win _ in Columbus, or in
Ann Arbor _ with less talent.
</P>
<P>
   Who knows what will happens to the Buckeyes? But observing coach
John Cooper's demeanor might give you a clue. In the spring or
early summer he is easygoing and funny, very much a person who can
make you feel at ease.
</P>
<P>
   Come football season, especially Michigan week, Cooper turns
into Oliver Stone, looking for conspiracies, dealing in secrecy,
making his players less accessible to the media.
</P>
<P>
   If Cooper thinks that cuts down on distractions, he's dead
wrong. It increases it because it's not the normal procedure and
the players notice it.
</P>
<P>
   Change the routine, as Cooper has done before big games, and the
players notice it.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's game is a big one for Ohio State. Not the biggest,
but certainly worthy of national attention.
</P>
<P>
   If Ohio State stumbles, it's not because the Buckeyes are not a
good football team, but because they are tense and only John Cooper
can control that.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Lame Ducks
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Just when things were looking up for the Oregon Ducks, the
injury bug hits them. Linebacker Peter Simon, last season's leading
tackler in the Pac-10, is gone for the season with a torn muscle in
his right shoulder. Oregon, 4-0, is off to its best start since
1988. With a week off, Oregon gets to prepare for the roughest part
of its season, a six-game stretch that includes road games against
unbeatens UCLA and Arizona, as well as Pac-10 wannabe contenders
USC, Washington, and Arizona State ... UCLA, coming off its
unexpected bye because of the postponement/cancellation of last
Saturday's game at Miami, still is not sure how good it is. ``We're
2-0, I still don't have a real good grasp on this team,'' said
coach Bob Toledo ... After a rough opening game in which it was
bombed by Air Force, 42-0, Wake Forest has bounced back with a pair
of solid wins over Navy and Clemson. With Appalachian State, Duke,
and Maryland on the schedule the next three games, the Deacons can
re-start their run toward a bowl bid ... If you happen to look at
the NCAA rushing statistics this week you might see Ricky Williams
listed twice. It's not a misprint. Leading the country is Ricky
Williams from Texas Tech, who has compiled 770 yards and rushed for
eight touchdowns in guiding the Red Raiders to a 4-0 start. Just
behind is Texas's Ricky Williams, who has 736 yards and 15
touchdowns and is once again in the hunt for the Heisman race.
Texas's Ricky Williams is only five touchdowns away from the
all-time NCAA record of 64 (held by Indiana's Anthony Thompson) and
needs 1,191 yards to break Tony Dorsett's all-time record of 6,082
yards. Williams is wrapping up a brilliant career for the
Longhorns, while Tech's Williams is a sophomore with a couple of
more seasons left to pile up yardage ... Not that anyone could take
it the wrong way, but Nebraska's 55-7 romp over Washington should
have been a warning to every team remaining on its schedule. ``We
sent a message to a lot of people,'' said cornerback Ralph Brown.
``When we have all our personnel and we come to play, it's going to
be a long day for our opponents.'' ... If the Huskers are going to
stumble, it could either be at Texas A&AMP;M Oct. 10 or Kansas State
Nov. 7. And then there is the annual end-of-season battle with
Colorado, which will be played in Lincoln ... Alabama, suffering
its worst loss in 41 years after getting pounded, 42-6, by Arkansas
last week, has no explanations for the back-to-back defeats to the
Razorbacks. ``They whipped us,'' said Alabama coach Mike DuBose.
``We are shocked at our ineffectiveness in both offense and
defense.'' ... Is it more important to make money or win games?
Probably both. But Oklahoma State gave away what ever advantage it
had by agreeing to switch Saturday's home game with Nebraska to
Kansas City's Arrowhead Stadium. The Cowboys will make money, get
pounded the way they would have been in Stillwater, but it will
hardly be a neutral crowd. Kansas City is only a 3 1/2 hour trip
from Lincoln and thousands of the Husker faithful will make the
pilgrimage ... Now that Prairie View has ended its 80-game losing
streak, the longest skid in college football is Division 2 Cheney
State's, which has hit 35 straight ... How's this for irony,
Prairie View wins for the first time in nine years and the band
isn't even there, having been suspended for a week after becoming
involved in a brawl with members of the Southern University band
two weeks ago ... Rotating quarterbacks are becoming the rage. Both
Arizona and Florida (3-1) are using the system and using it well
... More bad news for the Western Athletic Conference. The
conference championship game played in Las Vegas each season was
largely funded by the Las Vegas Visitors Convention Bureau whose
contribution raised the payout to $1 million. But they've pulled
out, so now the payout is $250,000.

<P>
   It wasn't a big deal around here, but college football lost a
true legend this week when former Southern Methodist University
star Doak Walker died at age of 71.
</P>
<P>
   Walker was the epitome of college football in Texas in the late
'40s and early '50s. He was a three-time All-American and Heisman
Trophy winner, who also made the Pro Football Hall of Fame after a
six-year career with the Detroit Lions. He retired at the age of
29.
</P>
<P>
   A skiing accident last January left Walker almost totally
paralyzed, but his spirit remained strong and the memory of Walker
running wild as an SMU Mustang will remain etched in granite in
college football history.

GLOVER FINALLY FINDS HIS NICHE WITH THE SAINTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ A lot of players in the National Football
League think they're All-World. La'Roi Glover really was.
</P>
<P>
   The New Orleans Saints' undersized defensive tackle is just two
springs removed from desperately hanging on to the edge of an NFL
career by becoming a World League All-Star with the Barcelona
Dragons at a time when most everyone in the NFL thought there just
wasn't enough of him to go around.
</P>
<P>
   Back in those thin old days, Glover was still the property of
the Oakland Raiders, but they were unimpressed by the 6 1/2 sacks
he put up in Europe in 11 games or the fact he finished third in
that league's Most Valuable Player balloting. They felt that way
because at 6 feet 1 inch and change and 275 pounds only on a double
whopper with cheese kind of day, he was just too light to hold his
ground in the center of their defense.
</P>
<P>
   What this opinion led to was the break of Glover's career. He
got fired.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes a guy needs to get into the right setting,''
Patriots coach Pete Carroll said of the Saints' leading sacker
Thursday, three days before his team is going to have to find a way
to block him. ``In the Raider scheme, he was an undersized tackle.
Their scheme couldn't use his skills.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's really, really quick though, and in New Orleans they run
schemes that offset him on the center and move him around and it
makes him very difficult to block. He's been in the backfield a lot
this year. We have to take note of where he is every play on
Sunday.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Patriots don't, Glover already has shown he can do more
than sack quarterbacks, which he's done a club-leading four times
already. What he can do are chaotic things like what happened when
he shot through a gap in the Rams' defense in the first game of the
season, slammed into running back Jerald Moore at the 7, and jarred
the ball loose. Defensive end Joe Johnson then scooped it up and
ran it in for a touchdown in an eventual 24-17 victory.
</P>
<P>
   It was a play of quickness, not bulk, one in which Glover simply
shot through an open gap before the Rams' line could react.
Quickly, as he does all things, Glover became a Saint raising hell
in St. Louis' backfield.
</P>
<P>
   It is just such opportunities New Orleans defensive coordinator
Zaven Yaralian will be trying to create for Glover Sunday and just
such disasters Patriot center Dave Wohlabaugh and line coach Paul
Boudreau will be working to avoid.
</P>
<P>
   To accomplish his aim, Yaralian will try to put Glover in odd
spots and at strange angles that make him difficult to block and
able to capitalize on his quickness. The Patriots will try to give
Wohlabaugh the best possibilities to make his blocks without asking
him to do the impossible.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you try and be stubborn and just be a man-blocking team,
they're too quick and play too wide for you to be successful,''
Boudreau said. ``They play a different style of defense than we've
seen and it suits Glover's talents.
</P>
<P>
   ``He sheds blocks, uses his hands well, is very active and is a
guy who stays on his feet. He's not the traditional, big nose
tackle who swallows up blocks. He's very active and they put him in
positions that force you to run some different blocking schemes to
give your kid a chance to be successful. Saying, `You should have
blocked him,' is not a good coaching point.''
</P>
<P>
   Although now listed at 6-2, 285, both are a bit of a reach, but
his weight and strength have improved since he was cut by the
Raiders eight days before the start of the 1997 season. At the
time, the Saints were one of three teams that claimed him and by
virtue of their record of a year earlier they got him and he
quickly showed his value, finishing his first season with 6 1/2
sacks despite starting only two games.
</P>
<P>
   But it was in the offseason that Glover showed what he was
really all about by working four days a week in the Saints' weight
program and then adding to what had become a notable work ethic
only hours after he and his teammates had been dismantled by the
Green Bay Packers Aug. 8 in the first exhibition game of the
summer.
</P>
<P>
   After that 31-7 loss, the Saints took a 3 1/2-hour bus ride back
to their La Crosse, Wisc., training camp, arrving at 3 a.m. When
defensive line coach Walt Corey walked into his office at 7 a.m. to
review film of the debacle, Glover was already there.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's worked his butt off,'' Yaralian said of Glover, who
packed on 10 pounds of muscle and at least as much football
knowledge from such work habits during the past offseason.
</P>
<P>
   ``He worked hard in the weight room. He was quick but he wasn't
strong. We knew he had potential but he's a guy you've got to keep
moving, running stunts, moving him around.''
</P>
<P>
   The Saints have done that for three games now and surely will do
it again Sunday because it has freed him from the kind of double
team blocks his size makes it difficult to defeat. With former
All-Pro Wayne Martin and defensive end Joe Johnson alongside him,
Glover has been the beneficiary of more than quickness, scheming,
and his own work ethic, however.
</P>
<P>
   ``La'Roi was drawing a lot of double teams while Joe was holding
out (as he did all summer before agreeing to a deal that made him
one of the highest paid defensive linemen in the game),'' said
Saints general manager and club president Bill Kuharich. ``Now with
Joe and Wayne on either side of him, teams have to decide do you
double La'Roi with Martin and Johnson coming or do you single him?
</P>
<P>
   ``If you single him, he beats you with his quickness. Zaran
moves him all around. One play he's head up. Next he's offset. Then
he's tilted. I enjoy watching to see where Zaran is going to put
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus far he's put him into opponent's backfields more often than
they would like. If that is not to happen again Sunday, Wohlabaugh
knows he must find some way to deal with Glover.
</P>
<P>
   ``They play him in positions that are hard for the center to
reach,'' Wohlabaugh said. ``He may not be as big as other defensive
linemen, but he makes quick moves and he has a high motor. I've
seen guys block him and just when they think they have him under
control he spins off and makes a play.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a guy I'll have to be careful of and stay aware of. If
you ease up on a block he'll slide off you. He's going all the
time. He runs a lot of stunts and twists that use his quickness to
get him free and make tackles. You watch him make some of the plays
he's made and you kind of wonder how he got to New Orleans but a
lot of times success is being in the right place at the right
time.''
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to La'Roi Glover _ or the art of blocking him _
that's exactly what it will come down to this Sunday.

TRADER EXPECTED TOO MUCH FROM LADY LUCK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE BAILEY AND STEVEN SYRE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Lady Luck,'' Bing Sung once observed, tends to play a big role
in the outcome of people's most important decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Sung was known as an accomplished stock-option strategist with
impressive mathematics credentials when he wrote that line in a
1991 book commemorating the 25th anniversary of his Harvard
University class. Today, Sung is labeled a rogue trader whose risky
and unauthorized option activity at a Boston investment firm cost
$162 million in losses for pension funds covering employees of AT&AMP;T
Corp. and the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   Regulators say Sung got into trouble because he pushed Lady Luck
too hard and tried to hide his tracks. Sung's laywer says the
investment strategist did nothing wrong and never hid anything. The
investments simply lost money when the market went against him.
</P>
<P>
   Huge stock-option positions were hardly the norm at RhumbLine
Investors, which mostly invested money for pension funds in passive
and popular index funds that match the stock market. Sung had
brought his own proprietary option strategy to the firm, supposedly
a low-risk method to tweak index accounts to earn a few percent
more. Stock options are the right to buy or sell a specific number
of shares at a specific time and price.
</P>
<P>
   Sung's strategy was only used on four RhumbLine accounts and
represented a very small portion of the firm's business. How it
grew to such outsize proportions and subjected the clients of a
low-risk investment firm to huge losses still amazes many
observers.
</P>
<P>
   Sung did not return calls Thursday on the advice of his lawyer,
Joseph L. Kociubes, a partner at Bingham Dana in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   People who know Sung do not paint the picture of a classic rogue
trader, the egomaniac obsessed with building a personal fortune. To
the contrary, they describe Sung as soft-spoken and self-effacing.
Though apparently wealthy, he made no outrageous demands at the
office and seemed to have no financial incentive to gamble
excessively with his clients' money.
</P>
<P>
   ``He would cringe if anyone wrote his name with a PhD beind
it,'' said John D. Nelson, the chief executive of RhumbLine
Advisors, where Sung worked as the chief investment officer. ``He's
good at numbers and that's all he's good at, that's what he would
say.''
</P>
<P>
   But Sung had problems, too. After resigning amid disaster at
RhumbLine in 1996, he joined Leon Cooperman's Omega Advisors in New
York as an options trader and washed out after a week. ``He didn't
even have time to get a building pass,'' said one source close to
the company.
</P>
<P>
   No one ever disputed Sung's skill with numbers, however. He had
gone to Harvard from Phillips Academy in Andover and earned three
degrees by the age of 23. Sung, who was born in Shanghai, received
a doctorate in applied statistical decision theory by 1970 and went
to teach at the Harvard Business School the following fall.
</P>
<P>
   Sung married Kathryn Lavely, a ``Wellesley girl'' by his
description, in 1971, and the new couple moved to New York two
years later. Sung joined DLJ Securities as a convertible arbitrage
analyst and trader. Later, he jumped to William D. Witter Inc., an
institutional brokerage, as vice president in charge of its options
department.
</P>
<P>
   He was drawn back to Boston by an opportunity at Harvard
Management Co., the firm that invests Harvard's now $13 billion
endowment. George Sigular, at the time an important figure at
Harvard Management and one of Sung's former business school
students, recruited him to become involved in the firm's stock and
option trading.
</P>
<P>
   Sung was building a reputation in the option world, where
complex mathematical models are used to build and manage big
portfolios. State Street Corp. twice invited Sung to speak about
his strategy at its annual client conference meetings, where many
of the nation's most influential pension executives met and talked
shop.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could hear a pin drop in the room when he started to talk
about options,'' said Nelson, the RhumbLine chief who was a State
Street executive at the time. ``When he spoke, he had everyone in
awe.''
</P>
<P>
   Sung quit at Harvard Management in the mid-1980s, telling people
he wanted to spend time helping his parents, who were not well.
Divorce, a messy child custody battle, and remarriage also figured
into the mix. But after a few years, Sung was looking to get back
into an investment firm. ``He said he was tired of just talking to
the kids and the UPS delivery guy,'' said Nelson.
</P>
<P>
   He talked to several companies but soon focused on RhumbLine and
made a proposition to Nelson. Sung agreed to work for no salary, at
least temporarily, and pitch his own proprietary option strategy to
institutional clients.
</P>
<P>
   Sung had used the system for seven years managing private family
money and sustained only one quarterly loss, Nelson said. But it
was unclear if the system offered enough liquidity for institutions
that would direct millions of dollars based on the strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, RhumbLine was known around the country as an index fund
shop. Why would big pension funds hire it to get involved in the
option product?
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know what I could do for him,'' said Nelson. ``And,
to tell you the truth, I didn't know what he could do for me.''
</P>
<P>
   But, Nelson said, it seemed like a no-lose proposition for
RhumbLine and they gave it a try.
</P>
<P>
   Sung's strategy involved paired stock options, one betting the
market would go up and the other anticipating a market fall. Both
were supposed to be ``out of the money,'' struck at prices that
seemed unlikely to be reached and probably destined to become
declared worthless.
</P>
<P>
   But one kind of option generated fees and the other cost money.
The idea was to create more fees than expenses and pocket the
difference. It wasn't supposed to make a fortune, but generate
consistent earnings in a stable stock market.
</P>
<P>
   The Massachusetts Pension Reserve Investment Trust was the first
client to try the option strategy, and then it came back for more.
</P>
<P>
   Later, AT&AMP;T executives arranged for Sung to manage a special
option strategy that served the specific needs of their pension
fund. The AT&AMP;T executives later signed on for Sung's proprietary
option strategy.
</P>
<P>
   The US Securities and Exchange Commission alleges Sung began to
lose money in 1995, ironically because stocks were doing so well
and upset the assumptions in his strategy. The SEC alleged that
Sung misled AT&AMP;T about the losses and embarked on a more risky but
successful strategy to recoup the money.
</P>
<P>
   By mid-1996, the SEC alleged, Sung increased the bets even more
and further misled his clients. By September, the losses became
apparent and were snowballing. When accounts were finally closed,
unauthorized trading cost the AT&AMP;T account $150 million and the
Massachusetts state fund $12 million, according to the SEC.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real sin was he exposed us to additional risk,'' said
Scott Henderson, head of the state's pension fund. ``If the trades
were profitable and we found out he exposed us to additional risk,
we would have fired him.''
</P>
<P>
   As for AT&AMP;T, the loss was a small fraction of its $48 billion
pension fund, which still had an overall $1.6 billion gain in
September 1996. It was an inconsequential event on that scale, but
from another perspective the option trading loss equaled $600 for
each of AT&AMP;T's 246,000 current retirees.
</P>
<P>
   Still, was it Sung's fault? His lawyer insisted that, at least
in the case of AT&AMP;T, the options strategy was disclosed at every
step.
</P>
<P>
   ``This guy didn't stand to make an extra nickel,'' said
Kociubes, the laywer. ``He had no incentive in any way to cover up
or not disclose to AT&AMP;T. He denies it was in any way a secret from
AT&AMP;T.''

`DREAMS' RAVISHES WITHOUT MOVING US 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
WHAT DREAMS MAY COME 
Directed by: Vincent Ward 
Screenplay by: Ron Bass (novel: Richard Matheson) 
Starring: Robin Williams, Annabella Sciorra, Cuba Gooding Jr., Max
Von Sydow, Jessica Brooks Grant, Josh Paddock, Rosalind Chao 
Running time: 106 minutes 
Rated: PG-13 (thematic elements involving death, some disturbing
images and language) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The afterlife movie soars to new visionary (if Eurocentric)
heights in ``What Dreams May Come.'' Imagine Monet, Van Gogh, and
Caspar David Friedrich teaming up to design heaven. Imagine
Hieronymous Bosch commissioned to design hell. Never has paradise
looked so lush, so vibrantly colored, so packed with saturated
paint strokes throbbing with life. Never has hell looked so dank
and bleak and packed with misery suffered en masse. In terms of
sheer visual reach, ``What Dreams May Come'' is a dazzling
achievement. It shows us what the afterlife could look like if God
could afford the special effects. It also confirms director Vincent
Ward's inspired eye and grand, one-of-a-kind visual flair.
</P>
<P>
   If visuals were all that were needed to make a movie sublime,
``What Dreams May Come'' would be an instant classic. As it is,
it's merely stunning. The reason is that its emotional impact can't
match its visual impact. Perhaps this is understandable when you
consider that much of the emotion is muted. In fact, Robin Williams
and Annabella Sciorra spend a lot of time playing the absence of
emotion. All they feel is an empty numbness after their two
children die in a road crash. Then after he dies trying to rescue a
crash victim in a subsequent tunnel accident, she's so bereft that
she implodes and takes her own life. That's when the story arc
begins, and it's quite an arc.
</P>
<P>
   Because she committed suicide, she's not allowed to join him in
heaven. So he takes the plunge from paradise (actually a stunt man
parachutes from Angel Falls in Venezuela, the world's highest
falls) and returns below. He'd rather be together with her than in
heaven without her. What follows is a reworking of the Orpheus and
Euridyce story as he tries to bring her out of the underworld with
the power of love. Certainly Williams and Sciorra project
vulnerability and sensitivity. They convince us they value the
golden life they have as soul mates before tragedy abruptly ends
it. Certainly Josh Paddock and Jessica Brooks Grant are believable
as their children. Cuba Gooding Jr. is a plus, too, trying as
sunnily as possible to get Williams's recently deceased character,
Chris, to accept the fact that he is indeed dead and that the
gorgeous environment through which he finds himself cantering is at
best a palliative.
</P>
<P>
   Gooding's heavenly host, in other words, offers cushioning and
consolation. But the father and husband, torn from his loved ones,
is determined to move heaven and hell to get them back. The
shortfall in the magnificent journey involving love reaching beyond
the graves is that the emotional dimension keeps being eclipsed by
the visual one. Although her face is drained of expression, we
don't feel the grief and loss of Sciorra's Annie as strongly as we
feel the bleakness and desolation in the color-drained world around
her. The hell sequence is brilliant, with Williams walking across
the shaved heads of the damned as if they were cobblestones on the
road to bringing Annie back to life, and the afterlife.
</P>
<P>
   The theme of love transcending the usual boundaries is
exhilarating as a concept and certainly as a spectacle in ``What
Dreams May Come.'' It is not something that reaches us as felt
knowledge, however. In the end, Williams and Sciorra are icons of
yearning and bereavement and reunion, not embodiments of it,
although Sciorra's slow thawing of Annie is delicately managed. One
of these days, New Zealander Ward will tap into a dimension of
emotion that matches the reach and range of the incredible visual
imagination he has put on screen in ``Vigil,'' ``The Navigator,''
``Map of the Human Heart'' and now here. When he does, look out.
Meanwhile, ``What Dreams May Come'' is more memorable as a rich
canvas than as an experience.

AFTER EIGHT YEARS, THE CHURCH IS BACK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM SULLIVAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  The Church has been a buzz band at least twice in its nearly
two decades of life. The first time was when the young Australians
scored in their native country with their first album, and
especially the jangly, emotionally expressive hit ``Unguarded
Moment'' in 1980. (They later had success in the United States with
the same song on a differently packaged debut album.) The second
time, the Church hit the epicenter of the pre-grunge alt-rock world
with the dreamy single ``Under the Milky Way'' from the
``Starfish'' album in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   There have been other albums, but, no real Church presence to
speak of for eight years. ``It was never meant to be that long,''
sighs singer-songwriter-bassist Steve Kilbey, on the phone from
Minneapolis. ``Although, touring the US isn't all there is to life.
(Guitarist) Marty (Willson-Piper) and I did a bit of stuff, just
the two of us playing acoustic guitar around the world and the band
did a bit of work in Australia.''
</P>
<P>
   Kilbey says the band, which includes guitarist Peter Koppes and
new-ish drummer Tim Powles, found its confidence ebbing, as hassles
with management and record labels took their toll. ``People talked
us into staying together,'' he says, ``because they thought we were
a good band.''
</P>
<P>
   The group is back with its 11th album, ``Hologram of Baal,'' a
new release on Thirsty Ear (which contains a bonus all-instrumental
disc ``Bastard Universe'').
</P>
<P>
   ``It's back to the bars,'' says Kilbey, whose band played
theaters during the ``Starfish'' tour. But Kilbey doesn't discuss
this downsizing with bitterness. He says it's hard to remember
getting any pleasure from the success of ``Starfish'' on the road.
``We were on tour the whole year so there was never any time to sit
back and (savor) it, and it didn't do me any good career-wise.
Everybody wants you to be bigger than U2.''
</P>
<P>
   Did he want that?
</P>
<P>
   ``No, never. We're not that sort of band. The nature of what we
do limits it. You put out a book of poetry, you know it's not going
to sell as much as a Hollywood porno novel. What we do has limits
built in.
</P>
<P>
   At any rate, the Church has always been an ambitious pop band.
``I hope we're not a pop band after all this time,'' says Kilbey.
``We do some pop songs, I guess, but I hope we push the boundaries
a little bit more than that.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, they do. The Church has long had a dreamy, meditative
sound: a swirl of celestial guitars, a melancholic tone, a
mid-tempo pace, a mix of light and dark shades. Kilbey explains how
the 80-minute space-trucking ``Bastard Universe'' CD was done. ``We
put a DAT in the DAT machine and we started playing and playing and
playing ... after about 80 minutes someone walked upstairs and
turned the machine off. Someone said that it makes Pink Floyd's
`Echoes' (an album side-length space-rock jam from the early '70s)
look like a Ramones song.'' On both the bonus disc and ``Baal'' the
Church create a spatial ``widescreen'' effect. You tend to hear the
Church's music as you might watch a beautifully filmed movie
unfold. Could the Church be compared to any filmmaker?
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh God,'' says Kilbey, with a laugh, ``that's a bit grandiose,
isn't it?'' But he takes the bait: ``Cecil B. DeMille. I like that
bigger-than-`Ben Hur' feeling, you know.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a happy record,'' Kilbey adds. The moody Church has
never been mistaken for shiny happy people. Even ``Unguarded
Moment,'' a song Kilbey has long despised, is centered around the
nagging notion of failing to find inspiration.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's always that paradox with the Church,'' says Kilbey.
``Sad music can make you happy; whereas happy music doesn't always
make you happy. I think it is a bit like watching a film, this
album. Like our other albums, too. You go through bits of happiness
and light-heartedness, bits of melancholy. I think it finishes on
kind of an up note.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We've tried to bring a bit of literature and history to pop
and rock music,'' says Kilbey. ``A lot of people didn't appreciate
that, especially in the early days, 'cause there is this school of
thought that rock music should be about girls and cars.''
</P>
<P>
   Is the Church a spiritual band?
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, we try to be,'' says Kilbey. ``We try personally and
musically to incorporate that. I think music can sometimes get you
to places were you might not have been before. We don't have a
defined spiritual life
</P>
<P>
   Kilbey says that on the best nights, the Church feel that
spiritual warmth on stage. ``We played Vancouver the other night,''
he says, ``and we got high from playing. We got higher and higher,
it was like a real multiplication thing. The band is getting better
than it ever was, and (that feeling) is getting more and more
common now.''

WALKER'S `SMILE' SPEAKS OF REDEMPTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ELLEN CLEGG  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
BY THE LIGHT OF MY FATHER'S SMILE 
By Alice Walker 
Random House, 222 pp., $22.95 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In her poetry and her richly layered fiction, Alice Walker has
always moved easily from sun to shadow, from ripe sensuality to
spectral grace. Mundane standards like time and distance melt away
as she considers the fate of the women she writes about _ her
central characters, the ones that plumb the depths of self for us,
are almost always women _ but in the end, she has the skill and the
words and the passion to call them home. And in the end, at her
best, she offers transformation.
</P>
<P>
   On the surface, ``By the Light of My Father's Smile,'' Walker's
first novel in six years, is the story of an African-American
family living in Mexico, studying the Mundo Indian tribe in the
Sierra Madre. But readers familiar with Walker's work _
particularly her Pulitzer-winning novel, ``The Color Purple'' _
know there will be much more. Walker's characters are seekers, and
she often uses a backdrop of cultural voyeurism to explore the
tensions inherent in boundary-crossing. Walker's women also possess
a prodigious thirst, both for spiritual authenticity and for
sensual pleasure.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Smile,'' Susannah and Magdalena Robinson are not so
different from Celie and Nettie in ``Color Purple'': sisters who
will endure rupture and find reconciliation. Early in the novel,
Susannah, a lithe beauty and family favorite, watches through a
keyhole as her father beats Magdalena, punishing her blooming
sexual heat with a local Mundo boy. The rest of the book is about
the ripples of betrayal that follow, and about Susannah's languid
walk toward a full understanding of that moment.
</P>
<P>
   In this expansive world of magical realism, the dead travel on
evening breezes and grow ever wiser, supplying the omniscience
needed to draw the narrative together. It's a tale with many
tellers _ Susannah's ghostly father opens the book, watching from
some heavenly perch as she makes love to a woman _ and the shifts
in point of view add depth and mystery. ``With time,'' we're told
in Magdalena's voice, ``as I understood how severely the twig was
bent in that moment of her horror and disbelief, my revenge against
my father, a revenge so subtle Susannah would not realize its
damage to her for another 30 years, was born. As for my father, he
would never again be permitted to really know or enjoy his favorite
little tree.'
</P>
<P>
   But it takes death and transmutation for the distrust that grows
up between the two sisters to abate. Magdalena, known as Mad Dog,
is Susannah's opposite: wild and big and bold, not neat or sleek.
She wears her heaviness of spirit, flesh settling in folds around
bone. ``I am very fat, it's true. And within a year I will be dead
because my heart will simply buckle under the strain of pumping
blood through so much weight. I teach at a large Eastern
university, where I'm sure my students sometimes think of me as
Aunt Jemima disguised as Punk Dyke as I come rolling into the
lecture hall with my thrice-pierced nose, green hair, and
jelly-plump arms filled with their papers, ablaze with my copious
multicolored notes.''
</P>
<P>
   Walker's prose is pared-down and powerful, bristling with
primary colors and scents _ the red flesh of a melon, the tang of
Greek olives and grilled fish, a toke of cannabis and a giggle. The
language is fierce, sometimes, and sex is steamy, always. There are
few hints of the agenda-driven didacticism that can occasionally
creep into her work, though some characters seem to work overtime,
symbolizing several larger truths at once.
</P>
<P>
   When Susannah, ever the tourist, arrives in Greece with her
husband, Petros, it is the beginning of the end of her ordered
world. She revels in the sensual detail:
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a day, perhaps it was even the evening of the day of
their arrival: out in the courtyard that was slowly cooling from
the day's heat, the sunflowers nodding in the corners like drowsy
old men. They sat around a wooden table ... and Susannah, her eyes
watering, drank ouzo for the first time, and nibbled a
home-preserved olive.''
</P>
<P>
   Stirring, she begins to question her Greek mother-in-law, making
a womanly connection across age and culture. Why wear black? Why
dilute joy with resignation? Finally, she meets a mysterious older
woman, a dwarf with a long view of history, who begins Susannah's
education in earnest.
</P>
<P>
   It is her mother, long dead, who teaches a central lesson of the
book, however. Life can be damaging, and holds out the hardest of
choices, but possibilities for redemption abound. Perched on a flat
stone in a dry riverbed, she gets right to it: ``Crossing is life.
Being on one side or the other of the river is beside the point.''

TAXMAN WILL CUT INTO INVESTMENT PLAN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, October 04, 1998)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH HOOKER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I am a married 32-year old business owner with an income of
$50,000, which I anticipate will double in the next two years. The
only investment my wife and I have is a $14,000 account in the
American Funds family's New Economy Fund. Is this a good fund? I
have read a lot about the SEP-IRA and the Roth IRA, and I'm not
sure what should be my investment priority. Should I continue to
contribute to the New Economy fund, or should I look to other funds
or the IRAs? I would like to have at least $500,000 in investments
by the time I'm 55 years old.
</P>
<P>
   R.A., Carlsbad, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. To attain a $500,000 portfolio over the course of the next 23
years would require monthly savings of $375, presuming you achieved
10 percent average annual returns from your investment portfolio.
But that calculation doesn't take the taxman into consideration.
</P>
<P>
   Thus you would either have to move into tax-deferred investments
such as IRAs, Keoghs, and the like, or prepare to pay increasingly
large amounts in taxes as you save. To show you how severe this
might be, in the final year of that financial projection, the
internal growth of the portfolio worked out (on paper at least) to
$45,205 -- and if the lion's share of that were distributed as
dividends or capital gains, you would be likely to have a nasty
time on April 15.
</P>
<P>
   You're now in the perfect situation to take advantage of the new
Roth IRA. That's to say that you are now earning considerably less
than you expect to in the future, and that you expect to have a
significant amount of money in retirement, so taxes will be an
increasing problem unless you plan for them. Since you expect
dramatic increases in your income, I suggest you take full
advantage of the maximum $2,000 annual contributions allowed for
each individual. That means that you and your wife can each
contribute $2,000 to a Roth annually. Soon enough, if things work
out the way you hope, your income will exceed the level at which
Roth IRA contributions are allowed, and you'd have to fall back on
the SEP or traditional IRAs.
</P>
<P>
   I presume from your letter that the money you have invested in
New Economy fund is in a taxable account. I have no problem with
this, and in fact it seems to me that you should probably have more
in taxable accounts. While you seem to feel that things are going
well for your business, and you will soon be doing even better, it
seems to me that the owner of a small business would do well to
develop a larger financial cushion than people who have solid jobs
with well-established companies. Moreover, if you're going to
follow my reasoning and consider the money now in New Economy as an
emergency or backup cash hoard, it should probably be in a less
volatile investment.
</P>
<P>
   My suggestion is this: Move the $14,000 now in New Economy into
two separate accounts, half in a mutual fund money market, and half
in a good GNMA fund, which holds federally guaranteed mortgage
securities. You should get a yield of about 5 percent from the
money fund, and 6.5 percent from the GNMA fund. Excellent no-load
funds in these categories are available from the Fidelity and
Vanguard fund families, among others.
</P>
<P>
   What do I seem to have against New Economy? Nothing in
particular, except that first, it's an all-stock fund, and
therefore inappropriate for an emergency savings pool, and second
that you're paying a 5.75 percent sales charge every time you
contribute to it. I have nothing against paying a sales charge for
a superior fund, but see no reason to pay such an expensive ticket
to get into an average performer. (You might, for example, be
willing to pay the picket to get into American Mutual's Washington
Mutual or Fundamental Investors funds, which have long-term
above-average records, and lower risk scores.) Once you have moved
your current savings to tamer instruments, I suggest you add the
additional $42 a month to those accounts, and continue plugging
away at this for many years -- perhaps until the conservative pool
amounts to at least 50 percent of your annual income. There won't
be a great deal of growth on either the money market or GNMA side,
but there will also be a great deal more safety than with the stock
funds.
</P>
<P>
   As for your-deferred savings (or tax-free savings in the case of
Roth IRAs) I would go entirely with stock funds. If you want to
stay with American Mutual, as I suggested above, both Washington
Mutual and Fundamental Investors are excellent funds, and with
value- oriented portfolios they should provide you with a somewhat
smoother ride than New Economy, especially in bear markets. If you
want to go the no-load route, I would suggest either Vanguard Index
500 or Fidelity Spartan Market Index, or, for a slightly more
conservative approach, Vanguard Index Value.

<P>
   Q. My father, who is 86, recently moved into an assisted living
facility in Massachusetts. The lowering of interest rates has
created a minor financial situation, in that before this, his
income from retirement, Social Security, and CD interest was
sufficient to cover his needs. The new living arrangement requires
a larger monthly outlay. Based on this, he had planned to sell his
common stock and invest all his money in CDs. Had the rate of
return remained at 6.05 percent, this would have worked. Please
advise how to invest this money so that income is produced for his
expenses, and which might also allow for the possibility of
increased expenses at a later date.
</P>
<P>
   J.G., West Townsend, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Your attached budgets show a total of $329,360 in cash.
stocks, and CDs, and non- investment income of $2,225 a month. Your
best-case estimate of his expenses comes to $3,275 a month, leaving
a shortfall of $1,050 a month, and a worst-case projection shows
monthly expenses of $4,280, leaving you with the need to supply
$2,055 a month from his investments.
</P>
<P>
   The good news, of course, is that there's plenty of money there.
</P>
<P>
   Even if it comes immediately to the worst case, your father's
money would last more than 21 years -- a calculation for which I
used only a 5 percent projected yield from his investments.
</P>
<P>
   At this stage of your father's life, I'm sure he doesn't want to
take the risks inherent in stock market investing, or higher-risk
fixed-income investments. I agree with his idea of selling the
stock positions, and I think that probably half of the money should
be retained in his major investment of choice -- CDs. Moreover, if
you are willing to shop around for your CDs, you should be able to
match that 6.05 percent that you seem to think has gone the way of
the dodo bird. As of Sept. 27, the nation's best rate on a jumbo
($100,000 or more) CD was 6.21 percent, and the top rate was 6.20
percent on traditional five-year CDs. For one-year CDs, the highest
rate was 5.80 percent. To give you an idea how important it is to
shop around, the national average rate for one-year CDs was 4.78
percent, and was 5.02 percent for five-year CDs. (Such information,
and the institutions offering the rates, is updated weekly in the
Data Bank feature of the Sunday New York Times.) My suggestion for
the remainder of the money is to invest it in the Vanguard GNMA
fund, which has a current yield of 6.58 percent as this is written.
This fund holds a portfolio of federally guaranteed mortgage
securities, and while such funds can suffer occasional market bumps
based on fluctuating interest rates, their long-term results tend
to be stable, and they tend to produce about 1 1/2 percentage
points higher yield than money market funds. The effect of all this
is that your father might come up with a 6.25 percent average
portfolio yield -- enough to provide $1,715 a month for his
expenses without invading principal.

`REFLECTIONS' SHEDS LITTLE LIGHT 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
REFLECTIONS OF MONET 
Organized by Barbara Stern Shapiro 
At: Museum of Fine Arts, through Jan. 17  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Claude Monet's most common influence on painters who
came after him is negative: There are still ``Impressionists'' out
there, blithely missing the radical quality of even Monet's early
work, translating his style into sugary tourist art.
</P>
<P>
   But there are also serious late-20th-century artists who have
been inspired by the true achievements of Impressionism's founding
father, and some of them are the focus of ``Reflections of Monet,''
the Museum of Fine Arts' contemporary companion to its grand
``Monet in the 20th Century.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Reflections'' could have been a far more adventurous
exhibition. Given its connection with the Monet show upstairs, it
could have explored the role of Monet's Giverny as precursor of
earthworks and environmental art, of the gardens of Robert Irwin or
the gentle rearrangements of nature of Andy Goldsworthy or Richard
Long. Instead, it relies heavily on its own holdings in Color Field
painting and loans from museum patrons Ann and Graham Gund, with a
few less predictable paintings in the mix.
</P>
<P>
   For all that it disappoints, ``Reflections'' does give you the
chance to see how later artists picked up on the scale, shape,
subject, palette, and composition of Monet. The show opens with the
artist's own 1880s ``Meadow at Giverny.'' As a choice of
touchstone, it's odd: Most of the paintings in this show echo
traits of the 20th-century Monet, not the earlier one. The Kenneth
Noland ``Lilium'' next to the ``Meadow'' does, however, share its
palette of springy blues and greens and its emphatic horizontality.
In the Monet, long horizontal shadows roll across a lawn; in the
Noland, the horizontals are crisp, straight, defiantly mechanical,
and personality-free. Paintings have tempos: The Noland whizzes
along; the Monet lingers.
</P>
<P>
   Pollock's ``Number 10'' extended Monet's horizontals into a
scroll-like form and countered Monet's diffuse, all-over
compositions with tangled skeins of paint as painful as knotted
muscles. Pollock depends on the drama of black, a color Monet
banished from his canvases. The texture in ``Number 10'' looks like
granite with graining gone out of control, in the way that Monet's
texture often looks like opals. Both achieve a complexity of
surface that seems beyond anything a human hand could create. The
MFA label quotes Hans Hofmann's admonition to Pollock to consult
nature, and Pollock's reply: ``I am nature.'' Pollock thought he'd
absorbed nature; Monet thought nature had absorbed him.
</P>
<P>
   Water imagery unites otherwise diverse painters in this show,
including Jennifer Bartlett, Larry Abramson, Michael Mazur, and
Joseph Raffael. Bartlett's water is closer to David Hockney than
Monet. But her ``Swimmers and Rafts, Ellipse'' has a compositional
affinity with the Impressionist: Both favor grids. And Bartlett's
ellipses within the larger ellipse start to look like the more
frisbee-ish of Monet's lily pads.
</P>
<P>
   Abramson, a distinguished Israeli painter and the
``Reflections'' artist who will be least known to American
museum-goers, makes a real grid in ``Impression,'' 32 tiny canvases
arranged eight across and four down. All are variations on Monet's
seminal 1872 ``Impression: Sunrise,'' which gave the movement its
name. Abramson abstracts Monet's composition _ three tiny boats on
a diagonal in the lower left balanced by a small orange sun on the
upper right _ creating streaky, blotted surfaces. He's making art
about art _ but some scholars think Monet was, too, painting
successive versions of a scene from their predecessors in a series
rather than from nature. For all their conceptual construct,
Abramson's little canvases have a Whistlerian wistfulness. Looking
at the ones swathed in a painterly fog, you root for the little
boats and wan sun to make their way through.
</P>
<P>
   In sheer wetness, Mazur's luscious ``Growth'' nods to Monet;
Mazur lets his paint drip downward, an effect comparable to Monet's
trickling reflections of weeping willows. Mazur's actual
inspiration, though, was a 12th-century Chinese scroll, which shows
the way aspects of art thread their way through continents and
centuries.
</P>
<P>
   Raffael's ``Lily Painting Hilo (Island Lilies)'' was
commissioned by the US Department of the Interior, and looks it.
It's a big, blatant billboard of a painting, whose waterlily
subject gives it an instant but misleading Monet link. You sink
into Monet's water world; you'd bounce off Raffael's.
</P>
<P>
   The other half of ``Reflections'' is a gallery devoted to
gigantism. Biggest of all is Larry Poons's 1971 ``Railroad Horse,''
a 25-footer, which makes it a bit over 5 feet wider than the widest
Monets in the main MFA show. An object lesson in how size doesn't
count, this monstrosity of one crust of color laid _ or thrown _
over another lacks any of Monet's introspection or emotional force.
</P>
<P>
   A few mid-century paintings _ a 1954 Morris Louis, a '55 Mark
Rothko, and a '64 Jules Olitski _ have aged better than the
Poonses, although they tell you more about a moment in American
painting than they do about Monet. All verticals, they have a
thrusting energy rather than the tranquil spreading of some of
Monet's last pictures. The Rothko, though, is riveting, its
spiritual force and bold color in Monet's league.
</P>
<P>
   The freshest and most immediate response to Monet in
``Reflections'' is also the simplest, the painting Ellsworth Kelly
made in 1952, the day after visiting Giverny. ``Tableau Vert'' is a
rich malachite color that sings across the room, its brushy surface
revealing flecks of blue underneath.
</P>
<P>
   Monet was the most competitive of painters, constantly pitting
himself against the past. What ``Monet in the 20th Century'' and
``Reflections of Monet'' demonstrate in different ways is that
nearly three-quarters of a century after his death, he still hasn't
been topped as a wielder of paint. The painters in ``Reflections''
engage in a dialogue with Monet rather than a duel _ a wise
strategy.

IRONS' HUMBERT HUMANIZES `LOLITA' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW GILBERT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
LOLITA 
Starring: Jeremy Irons, Dominique Swain, Frank Langella, Melanie
Griffith 
Directed by: Adrian Lyne 
Screenplay by: Stephen Schiff, adapted from novel by Vladimir
Nabokov  
Running time: 137 minutes 
Rated: R 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   What makes this ``Lolita'' so powerful is that director Adrian
Lyne and screenwriter Stephen Schiff draw you into Humbert
Humbert's strange view of himself as Lolita's beau. The famous
story is told through Humbert's eyes, as in Vladimir Nabokov's
novel, with the newly sexual Lolita appearing to seduce him,
slipping him a little tongue during an innocent kiss, and knocking
her leg against his on the porch rocker. Humbert is never reduced
into the cliched child-abuser we're accustomed to vilifying these
days, and at points he looks quite the victim of love, as Lolita's
attentions wander to a mysterious other. ``Who is it?'' he
desperately begs Lolita repeatedly during one of their sexual
encounters.
</P>
<P>
   Jeremy Irons seems born to play Humbert. Lyne and Schiff
couldn't have found a more skilled actor to bring us inside
Humbert's twisted mind. He is a schoolboy in a man's body, all
vulnerability to the whims of Lolita and secret plotting to keep
her. He allows us to glimpse the humanity laced through Humbert's
distorted thinking, and to feel his remorse. His Humbert is a
creature of tortured need and compulsion, and not snake-like cool.
Irons also gives the movie its too few humorous moments, as when he
drugs Lolita's mother to avoid sexual relations, then holds a
blaring radio up to her head to make sure she's asleep. (It's
playing ``I'm in the Mood for Love.'')
</P>
<P>
   At points, the serious atmosphere grows tiresome. Perhaps
because his previous efforts (including ``9 1/2 Weeks'' and ``Fatal
Attraction'') have been considered exploitive, Lyne works overtime
not to let his ``Lolita'' seem like anything but a literary
adaptation. He restrains himself from having nasty fun at the
expense of Humbert and his suffering, dressing the movie in an
artiness and a melodrama that wear a bit thin in the last 45
minutes. As the power-struggles and confrontations between Humbert
and Lolita grow more intense, it's not a far cry from ``The Young
and the Restless.'' One of the pleasures of Stanley Kubrick's less
reverential ``Lolita'' was its ability to deploy Nabokov's black
humor, mostly thanks to the perfectly droll presence of James
Mason.
</P>
<P>
   Lyne also gives his ``Lolita'' an overly sensual look, as the
camera languidly grazes 1940s Midwestern landscapes soaked in earth
tones and bittersweet sunlight. This accentuates Humbert's
love-struck state of mind, as he and Lolita motel-hop through the
backwash of America, but it undermines the agony and distortion of
his passion. It's only when an armed Humbert confronts his nemesis,
Clare Quilty _ the man who stole Lolita and then spit her out, the
man who is everything awful about Humbert taken to an extreme _
that the movie rustles up a healthy sense of ugliness.
</P>
<P>
   As Lolita, Dominique Swain manages the difficult task of being
both a seductress and a young girl with a fondness for jawbreakers.
She successfuly merges the sexual woman and the carefree child as
she revels in the vibrating bed in a motel room, or reads a comic
book while having sex with Humbert. Only Melanie Griffith as
Charlotte, Lolita's mother, seems out of place in the movie, more
1990s than 1940s. Her role is fairly small, though, so it doesn't
spoil the chemistry between Irons and Swain, a chemistry that is
fascinating, frightening, and, sadly, believable.

<P>
   Stanley Tucci's ``The Impostors'' amounts to a much littler
night than ``Big Night,'' his first filmmaking effort. It's an
initially lively but ultimately overextended foray into Art Deco
era farce, as Tucci and Oliver Platt play actors on the run, taking
refuge in a crate they don't realize is about to be hoisted onto a
luxury cruise ship. ``The Impostors'' wants to be a cross between
``Some Like It Hot'' and the Marx Brothers in ``Monkey Business.''
But the further out to sea it literally gets, the further out to
sea it figuratively seems.
</P>
<P>
   Too bad, because everybody throws himself into his work,
especially Tucci and Platt as the Laurel &AMP; Hardy-like team playing
chronically unemployed actors in the '30s, reduced to staging phony
death battles in the park to stay in histrionic shape. Their
troubles begin when they get free tickets to a production of
``Hamlet.'' Alfred Molina's hammy thespian, presumably a sendup of
John Barrymore, gets them jeering in a bar afterward. One
confrontation and one chase scene later, they find themselves
playing roles as paying passengers on the ship.
</P>
<P>
   As they hurtle through corridors and in and out of staterooms,
they intersect with a passenger list of agendas, ranging from Lili
Taylor's social director playing Miss Fixit to Campbell Scott's
lovelorn Nazi, wishing she'd love him instead of the ship's
detective. Also aboard are a bomb-tossing revolutionary, an
assortment of golddiggers, their rich prey, and funniest of the
lot, Steve Buscemi's terminally depressed band singer named Happy
and Hope Davis's glum wallflower, who naturally sees him as Mr.
Right.
</P>
<P>
   The Art Deco settings are a plus, but the multiple scamperings
by the entire shipload of impostors in one disguise or another are
too single-track and too mechanical to generate much urgency or
delight. What the script needs is more of the surprises and
reversals represented by Scott's moony Nazi. The pressure and
hysteria don't escalate. They wind down until at the end everyone
just seems to be playing out the string. What's missing is more
outrage, more energy, more oomph, or at least more of a sense of
snowballing complication. Farce hinges on going too far. ``The
Impostors'' doesn't go far enough.

`SQUAWK' TRADES STOCK QUOTES, QUIPS 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   Nowadays, Joe Kernen is known as ``the kahuna'' for his droll
stock-market analyses on CNBC's financial-news show, ``Squawk
Box,'' but there was a time when Kernen saw himself merely as the
guy without a Nobel.
</P>
<P>
   It was the late 1970s, and Kernen, fresh out of the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology with a master's in molecular
biology, found himself being ``just left in the dust'' by the
once-or-future Nobel laureates with whom he worked at an MIT cancer
research lab.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was clear to me I wasn't as smart as some of these
people,'' said Kernen. ``It was obvious I might be an OK
researcher, but I'm not going to win a Nobel Prize.''
</P>
<P>
   So Kernen detoured into the world of business, becoming a
stockbroker, then a business-news reporter, and eventually one of
the personalities who bring a cutting edge to ``Squawk Box.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Squawk Box,'' which leavens hard data with whimsical touches,
rides into town on a wave of momentum and buzz. It has become to
biz-heads what ESPN's ``SportsCenter'' is to sports junkies.
</P>
<P>
   The audience for ``Squawk Box'' _ a combination of average
citizens who want to know how their mutual funds are doing and
stockbrokers gathering ammo before the market opens _ has more than
doubled in the past year. Money magazine recently declared that
```Squawk Box' is redefining TV financial news.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that everyone in the world of business likes the
redefinition.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not unanimously accepted, believe me,'' said Kernen.
``You don't kid around about someone's religion or race, and you
really shouldn't kid around about money. It's a very serious
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   He paused. ``Then again, when you're talking about 90-day T-bill
rates and Alan Greenspan, it needs a light approach,'' insisted
Kernan. ``It's dying for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Haines, a former news anchor at WPRI-TV in Providence who
now hosts ``Squawk Box,'' says the show deliberately set out to
break the business-news mold.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we started, there was an attitude that to do business
news you had to be boring,'' said Haines. ``I don't believe that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Our approach is irreverent, but we take the usual steps to be
as accurate as humanly possible,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   The eclectic format of ``Squawk Box,'' which airs weekdays from
8 to 10 a.m. and weekends at 7:30 p.m., blends Haines's
tough-minded interviews of CEOs with Kernen's ``Stocks to Watch''
feature, then adds information on earnings reports and mergers and
acquisitions by David Faber, bond updates by Kathleen Hays, and
reports from the floor of the New York Stock Exchange by Maria
Bartiromo.
</P>
<P>
   There are also a few popular gimmicks, such as ``the briefcase
indicator,'' in which ``Squawk Box'' films Alan Greenspan on the
way to meetings of the Federal Reserve Board, then uses the size of
Greenspan's briefcase to forecast changes in interest-rate policy
(a thin briefcase means no change; an overstuffed briefcase means a
rate increase or a cut looms).
</P>
<P>
   ``So far, it's been right every time,'' said Haines. ``Though I
grant the logic is tenuous.''
</P>
<P>
   In catering to people with diverse financial interests, ``Squawk
Box'' walks a fine line. ``It's tricky,'' conceded Kevin McGee, the
show's executive producer. Added Kernen: ``You want to show the
financial professionals you can walk the walk, but then you risk
being too inside baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the audience for financial ``inside baseball'' is
a lot bigger than it once was.
</P>
<P>
   As the fortunes of Main Street have grown more closely tied to
Wall Street, there has been an explosion of interest in business
news that has benefited ``Squawk Box'' and other business shows
such as CNN's ``Moneyline With Lou Dobbs'' and PBS's ``Wall Street
Week With Louis Rukeyser.''
</P>
<P>
   The audience for ``Squawk Box'' has grown in the past year from
109,000 to 238,000 households _ and some involved with the show
believe that number is low because it does not reflect the
financial professionals who watch ``Squawk Box'' at work.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, as the stock market has climbed aboard a roller
coaster, CNBC has racked up its highest ratings ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all in the stock market, even those of us who never
thought we'd be in the stock market,'' says McGee. ``We have 401k
plans, stock plans where we work, so that number on the screen,
that's your number. That's an indicator of how soon you get to
retire, how soon you get to buy that house on Martha's Vineyard.''
</P>
<P>
   CNBC, a cable channel that is a joint venture of NBC and Dow
Jones, airs business news during the day and such talk shows as
``Rivera Live'' and ``Hardball With Chris Matthews'' at night.

A FRIENDSHIP PIERCES THE HEART OF WAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN KOCH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
SHOT THROUGH THE HEART 
Written by: Guy Hibert 
Directed by: David Attwood 
Starring: Linus Roache, Vincent Perez, and Lia Williams  
On: HBO  
Date: Sunday at 8 p.m. 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If Hollywood movies tend to be inhumanly monumental and stuffed
with money rather than artistry, HBO movies often offer an
antidote. Coming this weekend on the cable channel is a fine case
in point, a wrenching film about the distintegration of Sarajevo
called ``Shot Through the Heart.''
</P>
<P>
   It takes place in 1992 when the peaceable multi-ethnic
metropolis broke apart _ not just physically, but culturally and
emotionally _ under Bosnian Serb assault. Sensitively filmed
partially on locations in the ravaged city, this is, despite its
explosions of violence, no ordinary war film. (It debuts Sunday on
HBO at 8 p.m.)
</P>
<P>
   Based on real people and events, it's a story about intimacy and
civility under fire, an account of the destruction of friendship,
the fragmentation of families, the breakdown of years of urban
amity. It is a piercingly sad story, tightly focused on its
principle characters, simply told, and beautifully acted by, among
anothers, costar Linus Roache as Vlado Sarzinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Before the Yugoslavian breakup, Vlado was a serious recreational
marksman. He and best friend Slavko Simic, buddies from boyhood,
often competed together for the national shooting team and won
medals in various East European capitals. ``Shot Through the
Heart'' begins by evoking their warm camaraderie as they fire at
targets of olives on sticks and party at Vlado's weekend retreat.
</P>
<P>
   The tragedy of ``Shot Through the Heart'' is that while their
friendship is never really extinguished, they become mortal
enemies. When Slavco is called up to serve with the forces of
Radavan Karadzic, he not only instructs other snipers but becomes
the Bosnian Serbs' most precise killer of once fellow Sarajevans.
</P>
<P>
   He nonetheless remains loyal to his old friend, and twice tries
to help Vlado, a Croat, and his Muslim wife flee the besieged city.
But even after enemy artillery showers their apartment with glass,
the Sarzinskys refuse to leave their hometown. Perhaps because of
the skillful, sympathetic evocation of the city and its people,
it's easy to identify with his family's disbelief as this friendly,
cosmopolitan city rapidly becomes a murderous, rubble-strewn hell.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing is more fiendish than the deaths delivered by the
distant Serb snipers. In one scene, notable for its absence of
Hollywood flames and fury, the 12-year girl daughter of the
Sarzinskys's best friends is picked off in front of her apartment
building. A dull pop sounds, and she slumps to the stoop
rag-doll-like, a dark little hole in her forehead.
</P>
<P>
   Why a man like Slavco becomes an accomplice in such slaughter,
and why he accepts an evicted, probably murdered, Muslim family's
suburban house as a reward for his triggerwork is a mystery ``Shot
Though the Heart'' can't solve. It just presents the
contradictions, Slavco's masculine warmth and loyalty along with
his hating and will to kill, and fuses them in Vincent's Perez's
appealingly loose, chillingly credible performance.
</P>
<P>
   Vlado's motives for turning to violence himself are easier to
understand and, among its many virtues, the movie refuses to spin
his counter-sniping into a predictable revenge saga.
</P>
<P>
   This is a film filled with complex human feeling, finely
modulated by its ensemble of adult and child actors. The inevitable
``shot through the heart'' fired near the end evinces neither
pleasure nor satisfaction, as it almost certainly would in any more
conventional Hollywood version of the same story.
</P>
<P>
   It's not a perfect movie. The script doesn't, for instance,
sufficiently explain the rather mysterious group of anti-snipers
Vlado joins and helps to train. But director David Attwood's
instincts even here are understandable: He correctly wants to keep
our undistracted attention fixed on the powerful, mercurial
emotional content of the story. And for the most part, he succeeds
admirably.
</P>
<P>
   The result is an intense and memorable movie, the likes of which
are increasingly hard to find on the big screen.

SAVING A MYSTERY BENEATH THE SEA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DERRICK Z. JACKSON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Knowing the languishing fish had precious time left, Mark
Erdmann dropped into the water for a swim with the eons. Erdmann
was eye to eye with a 4-foot-long, 64-pound coelacanth.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was absolutely magical,'' Erdmann said by telephone from
north Sulawesi, Indonesia, where he saw the fish. He is a
postdoctoral biologist at the University of California at Berkeley.
``It was nothing like swimming with sharks or dolphins. It wasn't
like watching a tuna die, flapping about and gasping for air.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was amazingly calm, collected and almost dignified. It had
these fascinating, big eyes, looking around as if it was checking
us out. It was as if the eyes were allowing us to look into a
window into the past. It was overwhelmingly sad to watch it die,
but its dignity was incredible.''
</P>
<P>
   Pronounced ``see-la-kanth,'' the coelacanth is one of the
world's great mysteries. Until this century, it was thought to have
been extinct, supposedly going belly up 20 million years before the
final disappearance of the dinosaurs.
</P>
<P>
   In 1938, a coelacanth was discovered off the Comoro Islands off
east Africa. For 60 years, the Comoros were the only known area for
coelacanths, with its current population estimated at a scant 300
to 500 fish. With fins that are coordinated to move as we pump our
arms and legs, scientists had once speculated that coelacanths,
which go back 410 million years, were ancestors of all four-limbed
animals, including humans.
</P>
<P>
   The connection to humans has been dropped in favor of lung fish,
but the fascination with the coelacanth has hardly declined. A year
ago, Erdmann, a postdoctoral biologist from the University of
California at Berkeley, was on a honeymoon on the Indonesian island
of Sulawesi, 6,000 miles away from the Comoros.
</P>
<P>
   Erdmann and his wife, naturalist Arnaz Mehta Erdmann, were in a
fish market. Arnaz saw a large, odd fish being carted through the
market. She knew right away it was a coelacanth. Erdmann spent the
next several months talking with fishermen, hoping they would
contact him when the next coelacanth was brought to the surface.
Coelacanth captures by fishermen are usually an accident. Comoros
coelacanths live in caves and crevices at depths of between 500 and
600 feet.
</P>
<P>
   The fish may grow up to 5 feet and weigh up to 150 pounds, but
it is inedible because of urea in their flesh. No specimen has ever
lived more than a few hours at the surface, apparently unable to
withstand temperature and pressure change.
</P>
<P>
   Erdmann's contacts paid off in July when fishermen informed him
that a deep-set shark net had pulled up a still-alive coelacanth.
Erdmann went to the dock for his swim. After the fish died, it was
frozen for analysis.
</P>
<P>
   Erdmann's swim was so deep a window into the past that George
Stuart, vice president for research and exploration for the
National Geographical Society has said it was like a ``triceratops
walking out of the woods.'' Scientists say the coelacanth should
also humble us about the future, given how we are plundering many
of the worlds's fishing areas toward commercial extinction.
</P>
<P>
   Carl Safina, founder of the National Audubon Society's Living
Oceans Program and author of ``Song For the Blue Ocean,'' said,
``It is unlikely that there are any 100-pound land animals to be
discovered anywhere on Earth. But it is very real that there are
still 100-pound animals waiting to be discovered in the sea.''
</P>
<P>
   The question is whether we can curb our insatiable appetites in
time to make the discoveries and begin to think seriously about the
trawlers, draggers, and poisons that make fishing child's play. As
Erdmann swims with coelacanths, Indonesian fishermen use so much
dynamite and cyanide to capture and stun fish for food and
aquariums that Erdmann estimates that 15-20 percent of the nation's
coral reefs are ``toasted beyond repair.'' Another 40 percent-50
percent are in serious danger of being destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are becoming aware that fishing practices have
consequences on other fauna,'' said Roy Caldwell, a
California-Berkeley biology professor and Erdmann's doctoral
adviser. ``People are aware of tuna and porpoise, but we rarely
talk about cases where we are dealing with the last few handful of
fish.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Comoros government has made it illegal to go catch a
coelacanth, but if you lay a fishing net down and catch one by
accident, you still impact the population. Some people think it
already is fewer than half as many fish as 10 years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Erdmann echoed Caldwell. ``Scientists have been researching this
area for a long time,'' Erdmann said. ``Just the fact that (the
coelacanth) escaped scientific attention for over 100 years
indicates how amazing the oceans are. On one hand, it's neat that
scientists still don't know much about the natural world. But it is
a warning against the wiping out of species. It is a very strong
reminder that we really need to protect the seas.''

   BOSTON _ If you didn't know to look, you could almost miss it.
</P>
<P>
   Off a curving and quiet side street just a block in from the
grit and bustle of Huntington Avenue, students loll under trees in
a bright green quadrangle. Fountains gurgle, and the autumn sun
bounces off glassy new libraries and classroom buildings.
</P>
<P>
   It looks like, well, what it is, a campus. And that might not be
saying much, except that this is Northeastern University, the
almost defiantly gritty commuter school where for years, campus was
the concrete structures that lined the streetcar tracks that
brought the bulk of its students. The landscaping philosophy was
``pave it.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a new campus and a new vision for Northeastern as it
celebrates its first 100 years and looks to its next. Long the
scrappy underdog among Boston's colleges, Northeastern is now wants
to be taken more seriously, not only in the city, but across the
country.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, it is succeeding. Northeastern has sparkling new
student centers and a polished new president with degrees from
Harvard and Amherst. Its student body is smaller and smarter,
coming mostly from outside Massachusetts, with SAT scores 130
points higher than two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Yet as Northeastern seeks a new place for itself and as public
colleges compete for commuter students, Northeastern is acutely
aware of its challenge: Can it remain true to its historic mission,
its pledge to educate and elevate those ``from the humbler walks of
life''?
</P>
<P>
   ``Historically the way an academic institution increases its
reputation is it becomes as much like Harvard as it can,'' said the
new president, Richard Freeland. ``You drop your evening program;
you lower enrollment; you stop serving the middle-class kids.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are those at Northeastern who think that's what we ought
to do. A tension we are working our way through, both
philosophically and practically, is to what extent do we want to
flourish, and can we flourish, no longer as a local service
institution, but as an institution that is really competing on the
basis of quality with students around the country, while hanging
onto a historical identity.''
</P>
<P>
   The school has built a reputation around its program of
practical work experience, known as the cooperative education, yet
some suggest that the co-op program is dragging down the school's
reputation.
</P>
<P>
   Northeastern wants to become a research institution and attract
prominent professors, but some wonder if that will mean that
students get less face time with professors? And as the school
becomes more expansive, doubling the size of its campus,
Northeastern is struggling to remain a good neighbor.
</P>
<P>
   Alumni and those who work at the school reflect the dilemna in
the way they speak about Northeastern: They are at once proud of
its scrappy heritage and insistent that the rest of the world
doesn't respect them enough.
</P>
<P>
   Northeastern started as noblesse oblige, with the directors of
the YMCA deciding to open an evening institute for ``ambitious''
young men ``from the humbler walks of life,'' as they wrote in
their statement of purpose. Tuition was $30, and that included a $5
Y membership.
</P>
<P>
   It was only 25 years later that the Northeastern University of
the Boston YMCA dropped the latter part of its name. But the only
professors it had were moonlighters from Harvard and Massachusetts
Institute of Technology.
</P>
<P>
   Other schools that were once located in small buildings in the
Back Bay _ Boston University, Boston College, and MIT _ moved to
their own campuses and shifted their missions. Each attracted a
national student body and built a campus with chapels, charm, and
ivy.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even when Northeastern was forced to move because of a fire
in the YMCA on Boylston Street, it resisted leafy notions of a
campus. It bought cheap parcels of land on Huntington Avenue. And
through the 1980s, the campus plant manager had a notoriously low
maintenance policy. ``His answer to landscaping was to pave it,''
Freeland said.
</P>
<P>
   Northeastern remained a school for those of humbler origin. It
was the second school in the nation, and became the best known, to
have a cooperative learning program. Students go to school for five
years, spending one or two quarters each year getting practical
work experience in a job arranged by the school and paid by an
employer.
</P>
<P>
   Northeastern was decidedly no frills, with only the smallest of
libraries. Yet the school also launched prominent careers. Neal
Finnegan, president and chief executive of USTrust, graduated from
Northeastern and did his co-op work at Shawmut Bank. Other
prominent grads include John Cullinane, founder of Cullinet and a
prominent philanthropist; Thomas M. Finneran, speaker of the
Massachusetts House of Representatives; and Richard Egan and
Richard Marino, founders of EMC.
</P>
<P>
   Northeastern soon boasted of being the largest private
university in the nation, with about 50,000 students in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   But Northeastern didn't change its mission until it was forced
to, in 1990. On Sept. 17, 1990, the school's registrar reported
that enrollment was down 1,000 students from the year before; with
the school dependent on tuitions, there would have to be budget
cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Northeastern hadn't realized that since the Boston campus of the
University of Massachusetts opened in 1965, it had begun to lure
prospective students away from Huntington Avenue. Why would they
pay expensive private school tuition when they could get similar
courses at a public school for less money? And as the baby bust
generation entered college, all schools were competing for fewer
students.
</P>
<P>
   President John Curry imposed a hiring freeze, cut the budget by
$60 million over the next four years, and eliminated 700 jobs. But
more importantly, the crisis prompted a revision of Northeastern's
mission; the goal would be smaller and better, leaner and meaner.
</P>
<P>
   To survive, the school realized, it had to attract students from
across the country. To do that, it had to earn more prestige by
adopting higher academic standards. It would take fewer students,
but better students.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our success ultimately depends on not being the state school
on Huntington Avenue,'' said Finnegan, now the chairman of the
board of trustees.
</P>
<P>
   Smaller has meant better in many ways. Applications are up 13
percent in two years _ double the increase that demographers
predicted at campuses across the country. ``Selectivity,'' the
percentage of applicants the school accepts, is at 66 percent, down
from 77 percent two years ago and 90 percent in the early 90s. Part
of this drop reflects a smaller incoming class of 2,800, down from
4,700 in the '90s.
</P>
<P>
   The majority of students come from outside Massachusetts, after
years of Northeastern educating students who could commute from
their parents' homes. Eighty-two percent of the freshman class
lives on campus this year.
</P>
<P>
   Northeastern remains a quintessentially Boston institution in
some ways. Its scholarship programs and activities in the Boston
public schools outdistance any other local university, with $9
million in contributions last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever we've asked for,'' says Mayor Thomas M. Menino,
``they've stepped up to the plate.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Northeastern's expansion has meant neighborhood battles in
Lower Roxbury, where it is building new dormitories to get students
out of private apartment buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Tuition is still high; at $15,776 a year it would be difficult
for a student to pay their entire tuition with co-op earnings.
</P>
<P>
   And while the school has attracted many more research dollars _
with a 68 percent increase over the past two years to $36.9 million
_ some fear that Northeastern could lose its reputation for
student-professor interaction if it becomes a research university.
</P>
<P>
   ``Professors around here are expected to teach and teach well,''
says former Governor Michael S. Dukakis, who has taught at the
school since 1991. ``We teach, our doors are open, and that's an
important part of our job. Can you do that and do research? Yes,
but it's a tough balance, and God help us if we lose our reputation
for good teaching.''
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps most critical is the question of co-op education
itself. As the school lifts its standards, there are those who say
the co-op program drags it down, leaving people with the impression
that Northeastern is still a trade school.
</P>
<P>
   ``They may be at a juncture where co-op education is more a
pejorative, given where they want to go,'' said John Hoy, executive
director of the New England Board of Higher Education.
</P>
<P>
   Northeastern's board of trustees and Freeland both know of the
tension over the role of coop education and say they are working to
resolve it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still have and take seriously the access mission,''
Finnegan says. ``We obviously are not comprised of only that kind
of students that I remember from Northeastern, when we were
carrying lunches in a bag and jumping on the T to go home. We need
to find a new niche, because there are other places serving those
kids.
</P>
<P>
   ``But Northeastern needs to not lose its willingness to make
strong educational opportunities available to what used to be
called blue-collar kids,'' he said. ``I know that. I was one of
those kids.''

STEPPING FORWARD TAKES AN EASIER PATH 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By L.M. SIXEL 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's bad enough to feel you've been sexually harassed or
discriminated against because of your age but it's probably worse
to feel you're the target of ridicule for stepping forward.
</P>
<P>
   More and more employees are complaining that when they've
stepped forward to complain about discrimination at work that
they're getting the cold shoulder from co-workers or shunned by
their bosses.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes they feel as if they're under a microscope with their
supervisor who sends warning notes if they're a minute late
returning from the bathroom. Other times invitations for department
lunches or critical meetings stop.
</P>
<P>
   Co-workers can have just as devastating an impact. If word gets
around that a worker filed a discrimination complaint, friendly
co-workers may suddenly begin to worry that if they're seen with a
complainer that their own careers may suffer, so they shut out
their colleague.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the uphill battle such employees may feel they are
fighting at work, the number of retaliation claims have more than
doubled in the past decade in the Houston office of the U.S. Equal
Employment Opportunity Commission.
</P>
<P>
   During the most recent fiscal year, employees filed 825
retaliation claims, or 26.6 percent of the total charges filed with
the agency. In 1989, only 297 retaliation claims were filed which
represented only 11.4 percent of its total charges.
</P>
<P>
   Many employers think that if the underlying discrimination
complaint isn't valid, they can do whatever they want to the
employee, said H. Joan Ehrlich, district director of the federal
agency in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   But whether or not the underlying complaint is true, employees
are still protected from retaliation, she said. As soon as someone
complains about discrimination, an employer has to take steps to
protect the employee from retaliation.
</P>
<P>
   As a consequence, the agency gives retaliation claims priority,
Ehrlich said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If people aren't protected in coming forward with complaints,
we don't have a free society,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Employers can help cut claims &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Employers can do a lot of things to cut down on the number of
retaliation claims that they get, said Garry G. Mathiason, a lawyer
with Littler Mendelson in the firm's San Francisco office.
</P>
<P>
   Mathiason suggests that companies implement a ``stand alone''
retaliation policy. It's usually built into an existing
anti-discrimination policy, but it needs to be expressed as a
free-standing policy that the company won't tolerate retaliation,
said Mathiason, who spoke recently before a group of human resource
managers in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Companies should also train first-line supervisors on how to
avoid retaliation, he said. There should be an established
complaint system in place so employees know where to complain.
</P>
<P>
   Managers should learn how to document complaints of retaliation,
even off-handed ones, Mathiason said. For example, if an employee
said she was mistreated by her manager because of her race
discrimination complaint, then the manager should notify human
resources. That would help to establish that the company solicits
retaliation complaints if the company was sued.
</P>
<P>
   Company officials can pre-empt retaliation claims by reassuring
an employee who has filed a discrimination complaint that nothing
unpleasant will occur, Mathiason said. And if it does, companies
should encourage employees to complain.
</P>
<P>
   Ehrlich said it's critical for the person receiving the
complaint, the human resource manager for example, to have
credibility with employees.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Keep in contact with employee &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's also important to periodically talk to an employee who has
filed a discrimination complaint and ask how everything is going,
Mathiason said. That gives the employee a chance to say she wasn't
invited to a recent staff meeting and two employee lunches.
</P>
<P>
   It's critical to take all retaliation complaints seriously and
investigate them separately, he said. And if the complaint involves
a top official, such as the chief executive, consider hiring an
outside investigator so the probe doesn't look tainted.
</P>
<P>
   And don't become a victim of litigation fear, Mathiason said.
Just because an employee filed a discrimination lawsuit doesn't
mean that he can show up when he feels like it and goof off.
</P>
<P>
   While Ehrlich agrees a company doesn't have to put up with poor
work performance, companies also shouldn't just monitor the
activities of that one employee.
</P>
<P>
   Companies need to have a fair way of evaluating their employees
before problems arise, Ehrlich said. The system needs to compliment
employees on jobs well done and offer constructive criticism on
areas that need improvement.

THIRD EYE BLIND LIVES SEMI-CHARMED LIFE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By RICK MITCHELL 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Third Eye Blind's breakthrough hit was called ``Semi-Charmed
Life.''
</P>
<P>
   Given the double-platinum success of the band's self-titled 1997
debut album, totally charmed might be more like it. The album has
spawned a series of modern rock hits including ``Graduate,''
``How's It Going to Be'' and the latest, ``Jumper,'' to remain on
the charts for nearly a year and a half.
</P>
<P>
   The band's concert following is even more impressive than its
album sales. Third Eye Blind's Friday show with opening act Eve 6
at the Woodlands Pavilion north of Houston has been sold out for
months.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't take it for granted at all,'' said Blind leader
Stephan Jenkins of the band's rapid commercial ascension. ``In the
month off that I had, I sort of had time to think about it and get
some perspective on it. It's something that's very flattering to
me. I think I value this current tour the most of all. I've never
felt more relaxed playing music.''
</P>
<P>
   But Jenkins said he still feels, at best, semi-charmed.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a humility in me, or something, that makes me, like,
not there, to feel charmed. You know, like `Don't you dare.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Jenkins may be humbled by the scale of his band's success, but
that hasn't stopped him from gaining a reputation for cockiness
among critics, not to mention certain rival bands.
</P>
<P>
   Jenkins sighed like someone who feels misunderstood, if not
exactly sorry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look cocky. People get that from me,'' he said. ``When you
talk to me, you have to make your own assessment. I make a lot of
jokes. I think a lot of times, people don't really get my sense of
humor.''
</P>
<P>
   As for a reported rivalry with matchbox 20 _ one of the handful
of other new rock bands to survive and prosper in the post-grunge
landscape _ Jenkins was curt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we have anything to do with matchbox 20, at
all,'' he said. ``Matchbox 20 doesn't think we have anything to do
with matchbox 20. We have no musical reference points in common,
and I think it's plain as day for anyone who would listen to the
record.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've heard comparisons between us. The only reason why is
because (both bands have) debut albums that are still on the
charts. That's all it is. But people don't think very much. They
just go, `Well, these are bands that had their records come out at
about the same time.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Third Eye Blind was formed five years ago in San Francisco,
shortly after Jenkins graduated from the University of California
at Berkeley with a degree in literature. The band came up in the
Bay Area underground, playing at the Paradise Lounge and promoting
its own shows.
</P>
<P>
   From the first, Third Eye Blind (the name is intended as a jab
at exotic pseudo-spirituality) set itself apart from the
``woe-is-us'' flannel set.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were sort of opposed to that, in fact,'' Jenkins said.
``The band got together during the grunge period. But we formed not
because we wanted to fit into that, but because we felt we didn't
fit into that. I saw that whole scene as very conservative and
limiting. I wanted to do something that's more out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Like to become rock stars without apology.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Third Eye Blind opened on tour for both the Rolling
Stones and U2.
</P>
<P>
   Jenkins calls the Stones dates ``a business proposition. They
roll in and sell a lot of merchandise. On the last night of our
tour, they came out and took a picture with us _ click _ and went
on with the business of being the Rolling Stones.''
</P>
<P>
   The members of U2, on the other hand, were ``wonderful people,
gracious and humble and generous and funny,'' Jenkins said. ``They
really taught us that you can keep grounded and keep your interest
focused on making music and reaching people.''
</P>
<P>
   So how does it feel to be rock's hottest sex object of the
moment?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fun,'' said Jenkins. ``It initially made me sort of
self-conscious, but now it's just funny. Usually, when people are
having a good time, they want to add sex to it. Girls are the same
as boys. It's all good.''
</P>
<P>
   But Jenkins hopes his music will reach people on a deeper level
than superficial appearances.
</P>
<P>
   ``I aim for making an orbit, an atmosphere, for making a whole
world that I can step into,'' he said. ``Music for me has been sort
of a way of making sense out of my life. That's how I always listen
to music, and that's the music that I endeavor to make. When I make
that kind of connection with people, it's very gratifying.'' &QL;

PORTABLE PERFECTION COMES A LITTLE CLOSER 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DWIGHT SILVERMAN 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Since starting this column in 1993, I've been on a seemingly
impossible quest to find the perfect notebook computer _ one that I
would buy with my own money. I've tried a lot of very good _ and
very bad _ portable PCs over the past five years, but I've never
found one I could call my own.
</P>
<P>
   Some systems have come close, but there's always been some
deal-killer _ a poor keyboard layout, a klutzy pointing device,
poor battery life, poky performance, too much weight or too much
expense.
</P>
<P>
   The latest generation of portable computers that use the Windows
operating system have been particularly frustrating. They include
the mobile version of Intel's Pentium II processor, which gulps
battery power and runs very hot.
</P>
<P>
   However, I've found a remarkable high-end notebook that seems to
have gotten around these problems. It comes the closest, so far, to
my idea of the perfect portable.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Tecra 8000 _ $3,799, Toshiba America. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That I would be so enamored of the Tecra 8000 takes me somewhat
by surprise. I've not been that fond of Toshiba's portables in the
past, even though they are the best-selling notebooks. They always
struck me as generic in design and performance.
</P>
<P>
   But not this one. The Tecra 8000 has a new, sleek, gunmetal-gray
case that's thinner _ though with a slightly larger footprint _
than its predecessors. Its keyboard is excellent, its
TrackPoint-style pointing device is comfortable to use and, for a
Pentium II system, its battery life is very good.
</P>
<P>
   The model I tried came with a 300-megahertz Pentium II chip, 64
megabytes of memory, a 6.4-gigabyte hard drive, a 24X CD-ROM drive,
a 56K voice/fax modem and a 13.3-inch active matrix screen that can
support resolutions up to 1,024-by-768 pixels. It also has a TV-out
connector, so you can connect the computer to a standard television
set.
</P>
<P>
   Models are also available with slower processors and both larger
(14.1-inch) and smaller (12.1-inch) displays.
</P>
<P>
   It weighs just a little over 6 pounds, which is astounding for a
high-end system. That's partly due to the fact that this computer
has room for only one disk drive at a time _ CD, DVD or floppy disk
_ in a swappable bay. You can also connect the floppy externally.
</P>
<P>
   I easily averaged three hours of battery life, and with an
additional battery in the drive bay, I could have doubled that.
That's much better than most Pentium II systems I've tried, which
seem to max out at about 2 { hours.
</P>
<P>
   It's as solid a notebook as I've tried. Lately, I've found some
notebooks to be unusually finicky _ troubled with small glitches
or, in some cases, refusing to run programs _ but this one took
everything I threw at it.
</P>
<P>
   And it ran them exceedingly well. Normally, notebook computers
just don't have the speed of their desktop brethren, but this model
was beyond frisky. Memory-hog software such as WordPerfect 8 opened
almost instantly. It even handled graphics-intensive 3-D games
running at high resolutions with ease.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, the Tecra 8000 isn't perfect. I wish Toshiba had figured
out a way to keep both the CD and the floppy built-in. And the
power management seems a bit incomplete. For example, there's no
way to manually adjust the screen's brightness. You get three
auto-settings _ dim, bright, super-bright _ and that's it.
</P>
<P>
   And it's a bit expensive. I'd like to see this configuration of
the Tecra 8000 selling closer to the $3,000 mark.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Armada 1700 _ $2,499, Compaq Computer Corp. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If the Tecra is a bit out of your price range, and you must have
an all-in-one machine, Compaq's Armada 1700 is an excellent choice.
While it's a bit heavy, and its battery life is nothing to write
home about, the 1700 is a solid workhorse of a portable.
</P>
<P>
   The 1700 I tried had a 233-megahertz Pentium II processor, 32
megabytes of memory, a four-gigabyte hard drive, a 56K fax modem, a
12.1-inch active matrix screen with resolutions up to 800-by-600
and a 24X CD-ROM drive. It includes a built-in floppy drive,
excellent stereo speakers and a rugged, black case. It feels like
this puppy can take some abuse.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq still makes my favorite portable keyboards, with the best
layout in the industry. The flat touchpad is nice, with just the
right amount of sensitivity. And the screen is nice and bright, an
improvement over the last Armada I tried.
</P>
<P>
   Its performance was very good for a 233-megahertz system,
opening applications in a snap. It bogged down running some 3-D
games at high resolutions; reducing the display size helped
dramatically.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the 1700 is a very heavy portable. In this
configuration, it weighs in at just under eight pounds. With the
larger 14.1-inch screen, it can approach 8.5 pounds. It will not be
popular with those who dash through airports for a living. However,
part of that weight comes from the fact that the power supply is
built in, so you have to take into account that you are also not
lugging ``the brick'' around.
</P>
<P>
   Battery life is what you'd expect from a Pentium II system _ the
best I could do was about two hours. Using the modem or the CD-ROM
quickly cuts that to 60-90 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The 1700 is Compaq's new value line, replacing the 1500 with an
all-Pentium II lineup. If you need the power of a Pentium II, but
don't have lots of cash and are willing to put up with the weight,
it's a bargain.

TEST MODEM CONNECTION'S QUALITY BY CALLING THIS HOUSTON NUMBER 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DWIGHT SILVERMAN 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. Some time ago, you printed a phone number that computer users
can call to test the quality of a modem connection. Can you reprint
that number, and give some detail about how to use it?
</P>
<P>
   A. The Houston phone number is 713-693-0399. You can also find
it posted on the home page of the Houston Area League of PC Users,
better known as HAL-PC, at www.hal-pc.org.
</P>
<P>
   To use the service, you'll need a terminal program, such as
Procomm Plus or HyperTerminal (the latter comes with Windows 95/98)
to dial the number. Set your terminal type as ANSI.
</P>
<P>
   After the opening screen comes up, inviting you to join HAL-PC,
the line test will begin. After a few seconds, you'll get a screen
that will feature a lot of technical results, but you need to pay
attention to just one. In the upper right-hand corner of the
display will be ``56K?'' and either ``Passed'' or ``Failed.''
</P>
<P>
   The service is primarily designed to determine if your phone
connection is good enough to benefit from and make use of a 56K
modem. What you want to see is ``56K? Passed.''
</P>
<P>
   If it fails, you'll get an error code and some hints as to what
might be wrong.
</P>
<P>
   The service tests your phone line's properties, but only as it
relates to a connection to that computer. Your connection to your
Internet provider may be better _ or worse.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Every time I open Microsoft Word, the window inches upward a
little more than where I had it located the last time I used it. If
I open and close Word several times in a row, the upper border will
eventually disappear off the screen, making it necessary to play
around trying to get it centered back in the middle of the screen.
Do you know if there is a setting that establishes the metrics of
where a window will locate when an application is opened?
</P>
<P>
   A. There's no setting that will lock Word in place, but you can
stop this behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Look in your Startup group and remove the icons FastFind,
FastStart and, if you have it running, the Office Bar. Any one of
these, or a combination, can cause this to happen.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I've got a 17-inch monitor that I bought just because I
wanted more screen real estate. But in order to really take
advantage of it, I've found I need to increase my resolution from
800-by-600 to 1,024-by-768. I hate the way this looks. The fonts
are too small, even if I set them on large, and if I use a custom
font setting, they look garbled in some applications. Is there any
way to get the screen real estate I paid for and still be able to
read what's on the screen?
</P>
<P>
   A. Some graphics cards come with the ability to have a virtual
desktop, in which the resolution expands beyond the physical
borders of the monitor. You set the virtual desktop the overall
size you want _ say, 1,024-by-768 _ but keep the actual resolution
at the size that's comfortable for your eyes, in this case
800-by-600.
</P>
<P>
   When you do this, the screen seems to slide up or down, left or
right when your mouse cursor hits the edge, almost like a camera
panning across a scenic vista. This can drive some users _ like me
_ crazy. But it might work for you.
</P>
<P>
   You can tell if you have this capability by right-clicking on
the open Windows 95/98/NT desktop, then choosing Properties. Click
on the Settings button, and if you have this ability, you'll see
two sliders _ one might be marked Display Area, while the other is
marked Desktop Area. Fiddle with those settings until you are
pleased with the results.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't see those sliders, check the manual for your
graphics card. It's possible there's a program you'll have to run
to turn the feature on.
</P>
<P>

`SQUAWK' TRADES STOCK QUOTES, QUIPS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (e and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DON AUCOIN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nowadays, Joe Kernen is known as ``the kahuna'' for his droll
stock-market analyses on CNBC's financial-news show, ``Squawk
Box,'' but there was a time when Kernen saw himself merely as the
guy without a Nobel.
</P>
<P>
   It was the late 1970s, and Kernen, fresh out of the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology with a master's in molecular
biology, found himself being ``just left in the dust'' by the
once-or-future Nobel laureates with whom he worked at an MIT cancer
research lab.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was clear to me I wasn't as smart as some of these
people,'' said Kernen. ``It was obvious I might be an OK
researcher, but I'm not going to win a Nobel Prize.''
</P>
<P>
   So Kernen detoured into the world of business, becoming a
stockbroker, then a business-news reporter, and eventually one of
the personalities who bring a cutting edge to ``Squawk Box.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Squawk Box,'' which leavens hard data with whimsical touches,
rides into town on a wave of momentum and buzz. It has become to
biz-heads what ESPN's ``SportsCenter'' is to sports junkies.
</P>
<P>
   The audience for ``Squawk Box'' _ a combination of average
citizens who want to know how their mutual funds are doing and
stockbrokers gathering ammo before the market opens _ has more than
doubled in the past year. Money magazine recently declared that
```Squawk Box' is redefining TV financial news.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that everyone in the world of business likes the
redefinition.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not unanimously accepted, believe me,'' said Kernen.
``You don't kid around about someone's religion or race, and you
really shouldn't kid around about money. It's a very serious
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   He paused. ``Then again, when you're talking about 90-day T-bill
rates and Alan Greenspan, it needs a light approach,'' insisted
Kernan. ``It's dying for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Haines, a former news anchor at WPRI-TV in Providence who
now hosts ``Squawk Box,'' says the show deliberately set out to
break the business-news mold.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we started, there was an attitude that to do business
news you had to be boring,'' said Haines. ``I don't believe that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Our approach is irreverent, but we take the usual steps to be
as accurate as humanly possible,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   The eclectic format of ``Squawk Box,'' which airs weekdays from
8 to 10 a.m. and weekends at 7:30 p.m., blends Haines's
tough-minded interviews of CEOs with Kernen's ``Stocks to Watch''
feature, then adds information on earnings reports and mergers and
acquisitions by David Faber, bond updates by Kathleen Hays, and
reports from the floor of the New York Stock Exchange by Maria
Bartiromo.
</P>
<P>
   There are also a few popular gimmicks, such as ``the briefcase
indicator,'' in which ``Squawk Box'' films Alan Greenspan on the
way to meetings of the Federal Reserve Board, then uses the size of
Greenspan's briefcase to forecast changes in interest-rate policy
(a thin briefcase means no change; an overstuffed briefcase means a
rate increase or a cut looms).
</P>
<P>
   ``So far, it's been right every time,'' said Haines. ``Though I
grant the logic is tenuous.''
</P>
<P>
   In catering to people with diverse financial interests, ``Squawk
Box'' walks a fine line. ``It's tricky,'' conceded Kevin McGee, the
show's executive producer. Added Kernen: ``You want to show the
financial professionals you can walk the walk, but then you risk
being too inside baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the audience for financial ``inside baseball'' is
a lot bigger than it once was.
</P>
<P>
   As the fortunes of Main Street have grown more closely tied to
Wall Street, there has been an explosion of interest in business
news that has benefited ``Squawk Box'' and other business shows
such as CNN's ``Moneyline With Lou Dobbs'' and PBS's ``Wall Street
Week With Louis Rukeyser.''
</P>
<P>
   The audience for ``Squawk Box'' has grown in the past year from
109,000 to 238,000 households _ and some involved with the show
believe that number is low because it does not reflect the
financial professionals who watch ``Squawk Box'' at work.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, as the stock market has climbed aboard a roller
coaster, CNBC has racked up its highest ratings ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all in the stock market, even those of us who never
thought we'd be in the stock market,'' says McGee. ``We have 401k
plans, stock plans where we work, so that number on the screen,
that's your number. That's an indicator of how soon you get to
retire, how soon you get to buy that house on Martha's Vineyard.''
</P>
<P>
   CNBC, a cable channel that is a joint venture of NBC and Dow
Jones, airs business news during the day and such talk shows as
``Rivera Live'' and ``Hardball With Chris Matthews'' at night.

STUDENTS AT PARTY U NEED A DOSE OF REALITY 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN LYNCH  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Do you know what might straighten out these
middle-class kids in their late teens and early 20s? How about a
nice, bloody, protracted land war in Asia?
</P>
<P>
   That might do the trick. Just imagine that too much partying and
too little work could land you in some steamy rice paddy halfway
around the world _ with little guys in black pajamas blasting away
at you with AK-47s. Wouldn't that be a wonderful tool for focusing
their minds?
</P>
<P>
   The average American undergraduate now takes six years to get a
degree. And these kids are boozing big time. According to the
Harvard School of Public Health, only one in five college kids
abstains from alcohol. More than 40 percent of them are serious
binge drinkers.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, a survey of students at 500 American colleges and
universities revealed nearly 17,000 alcohol-related arrests. As
Frederick Alford, dean of students at Union College in Schenectady,
N.Y., says: ``Drinking is deeply embedded in the culture of college
life.''
</P>
<P>
   And forget about the drugs. There were more than 7,000 drug
busts at those schools in the same time frame.
</P>
<P>
   You can ask anybody who lives in a college town. These kids are
totally out of control. The local cops know it, and so do the
college administrations, even it the administrators don't know what
to do about it. Parents know it, too. They worry themselves sick
over it, and with good reason.
</P>
<P>
   College is supposed to be a good many things _ among them the
springboard to a decent career, the bridge between childhood and
adulthood. For too many kids, though, college means only partying
'til you puke _ on Mom and Dad's dime, naturally.
</P>
<P>
   On one recent week night, I was cruising near the State
University of New York's Albany campus. The kids were all over the
street, drinks in hand, validating the designation awarded SUNY
Albany by the Princeton Review Guide as the country's top party
school.
</P>
<P>
   Which might strike some people as funny. But Mary Ann Moran is
in no way amused. She works as a special education teacher. She's
also a SUNY Albany alum, with a graduate degree in ed psych. On a
Sunday morning on the weekend before SUNY Albany opened for
classes, she was in Albany Police Court. She was there to watch the
arraignment of the SUNY Albany kid whom the police said had killed
her father.
</P>
<P>
   William J. Moran was 78. At 8:44 a.m. on a Saturday morning,
he'd been crossing Western Avenue to buy a newspaper and a lottery
ticket, as he did every morning. According to the police, a SUNY
Albany kid on his way back to his dorm room smacked into William J.
Moran and kept on going. The kids turned himself into the police
six hours later. If he'd been boozing, the cops couldn't prove it,
although they did charge him with leaving the scene of a fatal
accident.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Ann Moran told me, ``I didn't count, but my brother-in-law
called and asked how many cases were on the docket. They told him
35 and that over 20 were SUNY kids.
</P>
<P>
   ``And you could just tell by looking that they were all SUNY
kids out front. I heard them all talking about how they got busted
for this and that, for open containers on the street ...
</P>
<P>
   ``I found it depressing,'' Mary Ann Moran told me. ``I worked my
butt off to get a graduate degree _ for all my college. I paid for
it all myself. My family was not wealthy. I got loans. I paid them
back. And I worked. In fact, one semester I worked full-time and
went to school full-time. I didn't have time to be doing what they
do ... I find it terribly depressing as an alumnus.''
</P>
<P>
   So Mary Ann Moran, who lost her mother just two years ago, has
now lost her father for no good reason, and a college kid at Party
School Number One is charged with a felony. But don't expect
anybody to pull up his pants, turn his hat around, sober up and
buckle down because of anything that inconsequential.
</P>
<P>
   Nope, just party on, dudes.

MOVIE GAGS DRAW LAUGHS IN `IMPOSTORS' 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JEFF MILLAR 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   And now for something completely different, here's Stanley
Tucci's new movie. It's hard to imagine that the writer-director
could make ``The Impostors'' more different from his gentle,
human-scaled ``Big Night'' of two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Impostors'' is a movie about movies, specifically the kind
of potboiler farces from the '30s that take place on art deco ocean
liners.
</P>
<P>
   Tucci cast himself and Oliver Platt as a comedy team. Mostly
Oliver &AMP; Hardy (Tucci does a couple of Stan's shticks), but some
Marx Brothers, as well. Some Stooges, too.
</P>
<P>
   The film is as affectionate about this kind of humor as ``Big
Night'' was about its characters. It's quite deliciously silly.
</P>
<P>
   It's bad enough that Arthur (Tucci) and Maurice (Platt) are
actors looking for work in the teeth of the Depression. But they
are monumentally bad actors.
</P>
<P>
   Tucci has a couple of delightful scenes with the pair's
artlessness. Critically to the success of this movie, we laugh
always at the artlessness and not at Arthur and Maurice, who are
always lovably hapless.
</P>
<P>
   In the opening credit sequence, staged like a silent film,
Arthur and Maurice act for free in a park, just to be acting.
Later, they drill each other, calling an emotion like a flash card
so that the other can emote it (badly).
</P>
<P>
   The film proceeds as a series of the sorts of gags a '30s movie
gag man might have thought up, and as eccentric riffs of
contemporary sensibility at a level of rather innocent naughtiness,
perhaps as restitution to the gagmen of the era who were not
allowed anything like this mild naughtiness. (The R rating comes
from The Word That Causes Movies to be Rated R.)
</P>
<P>
   Arthur and Maurice end up fleeing the cops and then become
stowaways on the aforementioned ocean liner. To say that the
passenger manifest could be the characters of Cole Porter's
``Anything Goes'' doesn't recognize the cleverness and precision of
Tucci's pastiche.
</P>
<P>
   There's a deposed Balkan queen; fortune hunters; Steve Buscemi,
hilarious as the ship's suicidal entertainer (his singing ``The
Nearness of You'' is a must-see); and an anarchist (Tony Shalhoub)
who carries a time bomb that ticks so loudly passengers check their
wristwatches as he passes.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell Scott, as the German chief steward (Maurice and Arthur
disguise themselves as stewards), has a dueling scar. There are
very good actors with sharp comic timing and deliberately terrible
``French'' and ``Italian'' accents.
</P>
<P>
   There are also intelligent bits of playfulness such as fun with
subtitles. A character can understand dialogue in a foreign
language when he reads the subtitles (reversed) in a mirror.
</P>
<P>
   You get the idea that Tucci had his sets (all deliberately
cheesy interiors), had his actors for the duration, had time built
into the shooting schedule to fool around. He just locked the doors
to the sound stage and made this up as he went along. This movie
must have been great fun to shoot. That shows up on the screen. &QL;

six-cylinder engine as ``unsafe'' and certainly not something to
entrust to a 16-year-old. Well, he's half right _ the doting mother
asking his advice on which transmission, automatic or manual, she
should purchase in the Z3-cum-I-6 engine intended for her
16-year-old daughter is getting properly raked over the coals for
the idiot she is. But the fulmination turns nasty; TT jumps from
unwarranted allegations of unsafe car to advocating
horsepower-to-weight limitations on all cars, and _ surprise _ he
is joined in this eco-nazi theme by normally sensible brother Ray.
</P>
<P>
   I am shaking my head, listening, inching through traffic, when I
spy the Subaru coming the other way, a familiar face behind the
wheel. It's Tommy Tappet. For an instant I have him on the radio
ranting and in person exchanging greetings as only Tom can _ with
bellowing laughter. There is no time to bring up the subject of the
BMW; traffic is slow, but not that slow.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But the subject today is BMW, and the particular BMW is the M
Coupe, the latest manifestation of the Z3, actually, with
240-horsepower I-6, five-speed manual gearbox, a tin top, and a
square back. It reminds one of the old Volvo P1800 squareback, only
less angular. It takes some getting used to, but finally I stop
thinking of it as a cartoon edition of that Volvo and decide that I
like the look of it _ it's a handsome little thing.
</P>
<P>
   If Tommy Tappet thinks the 189-horsepower I-6 in the regular
edition of the Z3 convertible or coupe is a hot number, he should
get his hands on this M Coupe. It should be good for at least three
weeks of rant.
</P>
<P>
   The coupe is fast, agile, and very civilized. Unlike the
convertible, the two-seater coupe has cargo room _ enough for a
couple of two-suiters plus soft luggage _ here's a sports car for
the tubist. Part of the road test is a run to northwest Vermont in
company with another auto writer and two sets of baggage. With a
full load, the M Coupe still sizzles uphill and down dale, snaps
around the tight corners, accelerates with vigor in any gear _ this
is a very elastic car.
</P>
<P>
   But it is the trip back, this time alone with only the one set
of baggage, that is seared into memory, a truly spiritual driving
experience. I choose a mountain route, a route made familiar during
driving exercises with another German automaker's cars, and head
west across Vermont Route 17 just south of Vergennes. There are
four cars in front of me and suddenly the road ahead is open. I
snap the shifter down to fourth gear and press the throttle; the M
leaps around two cars _ traffic appears ahead. I wait for the next
opening, then blaze past the remaining two cars; in my enthusiasm,
I have also blazed past a required right turn, if I am to get home.
</P>
<P>
   I backtrack, pass two more cars on the approach to the ascent up
the mountain, then find the road unoccupied for 20 or so miles. The
road up and then down switches back and forth, offers some nasty
hairpin turns in which to test the mettle of the M Coupe. Tom
Tappet is certainly right about one thing: If you find yourself in
a fast, capable car, you are sorely tempted to drive it fast. The M
is more than fast, better than capable, but enjoyable at any speed.
For a time I was simply an extension of the machine, wringing the
utmost out of both of us, putting to use most of the driving
lessons of two decades of learning. It is almost an out-of-body
experience, something mystical, close to heavenly.
</P>
<P>
   And then it's over as I join Route 100 and traffic. Ah, but it
was grand.
</P>
<P>
   The Z3 convertible was designed stiff to be agile on the road,
to turn smartly with virtually no flexing of the chassis. The coupe
adds a roof, closing the already stiff box and making it even
stiffer. The result is a car that is a handling dream.
</P>
<P>
   Controls are simple; the instrument cluster holds only the bare
necessities _ fuel gauge, speedometer, tachometer, and temperature
guage. A clock, voltmeter, and oil pressure gauge sit on the bottom
foot of the console just below the temperature/fan controls _ large
convenient knobs, by the way. The hand brake rests next to the
driver's right thigh.
</P>
<P>
   Convenience diminishes with the radio controls, disappears
altogether in the matter of cupholders, two, under a lid between
the seats and behind the occupants. A small covered bin sits ahead
of them. The glove box is taxed by the owner's manual, but door
bins and a compartment between the seatbacks help with minor
storage. The back offers major storage under a privacy cover.
</P>
<P>
   Give this $40K-plus car to a 16-year-old? Not a chance. A kid
should start on a clunker, something possessed of a lot of excess
practice metal _ mine learned on a hand-me-down Volare, a
glamourless clod of a car just right for the job. Spend the money
on advanced driver training instead.
</P>
<P>
   Is this little car unsafe? The car itself at worst can be said
to be neutral; drivers are unsafe. But this coupe is nimble, quick,
able to avoid occasions of disaster. Fast, yes, but speed isn't
what kills. What kills is speed divorced from reason, speed that
exceeds the limits of driving conditions, experimental speed by the
untrained or the speed of the intoxicated. With seatbelts, air
bags, training and judgment, this is a very safe car. Don't leave
home without any of those.
</P>
<P>
   The M Coupe offers socially acceptable fuel mileage, too; it
delivered an average 27.74 miles per gallon over 900 miles clocked
_ 900 miles of spirited driving.
</P>
<P>
   I have never liked any BMW as much as I like this M Coupe. This
one's a keeper.

ANIMATION, HIP DIALOGUE PUT `ANTZ' ABOVE FILM COLONY 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JEFF MILLAR 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Antz,'' like ``Toy Story,'' is animated completely by
computer.
</P>
<P>
   The quality of the animation is genuinely stunning. It feels
like at least a half-generation jump over ``Toy Story'': The
character movement is smoother, the texture of the surfaces more
detailed, the lighting more subtle. It's eye candy in the size bags
they sell at Sam's Club.
</P>
<P>
   So how is it as a movie for nonpropellerheads? ``Toy Story''
perhaps had a better screenplay and funnier dialogue. ``Antz'' has
monster charm. Enormous likability.
</P>
<P>
   I liked ``Antz'' a lot better at its end than at its beginning.
That doesn't mean it's one of those movies that gets better as it
goes along. I just liked it more. I wrote down some complaints in
my notes, then later jotted down beside the notes, ``So what?'' The
complaints were valid, but ``So what?'' is more valid.
</P>
<P>
   Z (voice of Woody Allen) is an ant. He walks upright on two sets
of legs, has hands at the end of a third set, lips and teeth
instead of mandibles, and goes to a therapist; his issue is dislike
of conformity, which can be a problem for a worker ant in a colony
of ants.
</P>
<P>
   The Princess Bala (Sharon Stone), not eager to ascend the throne
and spend the rest of her life laying eggs at the rate of 10,000 an
hour, sneaks into a worker bar with some girlfriends for some
slumming. That's when Z becomes enamored of her.
</P>
<P>
   She is betrothed to Gen. Mandible (Gene Hackman), a despot who
intends to depose the Queen (Anne Bancroft) and ethnically cleanse
the colony. The narrative, to spill only about one-third of a bean,
has Z and Bala thrown together, fleeing the colony into the scary
outside world. Z saves the day.
</P>
<P>
   The voice performances are unusually strong. The screenplay is
credited to Todd Alcott and the Chris Weitz/Paul Weitz
collaboration; but Allen, according to the film's publicity packet,
was encouraged to make his dialogue his own.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Aykroyd and Jane Curtin are funny as a pair of very WASPish
wasps. The funniest is Sylvester Stallone, who plays Z's
soldier-ant buddy. Jennifer Lopez voices Azteca, a worker ant.
</P>
<P>
   Directors Eric Darnell and Tim Johnson have several bravura
scenes: a battle with aggressor termites; Z and Bala getting stuck
to a piece of chewing gum on the bottom of a giant Reebok (the film
is eventually so engaging that you like its product placements). It
is likely for those, and for the very mildest of sort-of
scatological jokes, that it gets a PG rating.
</P>
<P>
   One of the censuring notes I wrote down at the beginning was
``rather primitive anthropomorphization.'' (We're talking just
scratching out ``man'' in dialogue and substituting ``ant,'' as in,
``You're a Renaissance ant'' and ``You're an ant after my own
heart.'')
</P>
<P>
   As the film goes on, you come to realize that the filmmakers are
smart people who could have made the film a lot hipper by
incorporating in-jokes for the cognoscenti and giving evidence
they've read Edward Wilson's books. But they chose to keep the
humor simple. The simplicity becomes one of the measures of its
quality.
</P>
<P>
   Simple anthropomorphization is one of the film's major jokes,
and it just grows on you. If Stallone's soldier ant saying to Z
``You da ant!'' had come at the beginning of the film, you might
not have laughed at it. At the end, you will. Simple as that. &QL;

`FIRST LOVE' GETS BOGGED DOWN IN FILM SYMBOLISM 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JEFF MILLAR 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``First Love, Last Rites'' is moody and languid as all get-out,
but for most of its existence your brain is drumming its virtual
fingers and looking around for something to do.
</P>
<P>
   Rule of thumb: If you're sitting there attempting to divine the
formal symbolic schemata of objects on the screen, you are being
underentertained.
</P>
<P>
   This is the directorial debut of Jesse Peretz. He comes to
features from music video, and, refreshingly, you'd never have
guessed it. If anything, the film is underdirected.
</P>
<P>
   It was adapted by David Ryan from a short story by Ian McEwan,
who wrote the novels that were the basis for ``Cement Garden'' and
``The Comfort of Strangers.'' The story was teleported from the
coast of Britain to a Louisiana shrimping village.
</P>
<P>
   Visiting there on an extended vacation is Brooklyn native Joey
(Giovanni Ribisi). He has rented a shabby one-room stilt house and
become enmeshed with local Sissel (Natasha Gregson Wagner) in a
serious movie ``l'amour fou.'' They couple sweatily and listen to
45-rpm records.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're making something,'' says Joey. ``Something is taking
shape.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Something'' is typical of the amorphous words that the
filmmakers don't feel are necessary to further define in order for
their film to be satisfying.
</P>
<P>
   Progressive decay symbolizes (we surmise) malignant portends of
what will happen to the Joey-Sissal relationship _ there's a rat in
the walls. More ominous as movie symbology, they stop tidying up
the stilt house. Sissal spends long periods of time staring at
nothing. Anomie on the bayou.
</P>
<P>
   Typical dialogue exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Joey: ``I love you, Sissal.''
</P>
<P>
   Sissal: ``You want to stick a baby in me, so I can dangle it in
front of you like a cat. We're finished, Joey.''
</P>
<P>
   The acting's OK. If you think you want to see this, tone had
better count for a lot. &QL;

 c.1998 Ha'aretz  
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   (NOTE: In this exclusive interview, former U.N. arms inspector
Scott Ritter tells Ha'aretz, the Israeli newspaper, that the U.N.
inspectors had broken Iraq's code for hiding missiles _ and then
inspections were stopped.)
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Scott Ritter knows Iraq pretty well by now. A veteran
arms inspector for the U.N. Special Commission charged with
tracking Iraq's arsenal of weapons of mass destruction, Ritter, who
recently resigned his post, was intimately involved in the U.N.
effort to keep Saddam Hussein honest.
</P>
<P>
   Over an extended period, Ritter and other inspectors worked to
break the code Saddam was using to issue instructions involving the
movement of weapons Iraq wanted to keep hidden from inspectors.
Well into this year, the cat-and-mouse game being played in Iraq
made regular headlines around the world.
</P>
<P>
   What few know is that the U.N. inspectors, with Israeli help,
eventually broke the Iraqi code and were on the verge of a major
breakthrough in uncovering concealed weaponry. Then this summer the
inspections were halted. That's when Ritter quit his job _ out of
pure frustration, he says.
</P>
<P>
   In this conversation with David Makovsky, correspondent for
Ha'aretz, Ritter reveals how weapons were being moved around in
Iraq and what role Israel played in helping the inspections team.
He also reveals his own personal disillusionment with the United
States for what he characterizes as its lack of support for the
inspections program.
 &UR; -0- &QL;
</P>
<P>
   DAVID MAKOVSKY: How did Iraq conceal weapons from UNSCOM?
</P>
<P>
   SCOTT RITTER: In April 1991, Saddam Hussein issued a
presidential directive ordering that Iraq lie to the Special
Commission (UNSCOM) and to the IAEA (International Atomic Energy
Agency), (and that Iraq) would keep (its mass destruction)
capabilities.
</P>
<P>
   In May 1991, the materials that were kept were turned over under
instruction of the president to the Special Security Organization
(SSO) and Special Republican Guard (SRG). These are presidential
security forces.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How big is this special organization?
</P>
<P>
   A: The SSO is one of the most secretive organizations in Iraq.
It probably numbers around 5,000 people. The SRG is the military
arm that had four brigades, around 15 battalions, and is about the
size of a division _ maybe 20,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Was the special organization set up for this purpose of
concealment?
</P>
<P>
   A: The special organization was set up to protect the president
of Iraq. Back in the 1980s this special security organization also
had a responsibility for protecting Iraq's weapons. ... So they
have been linked from the very beginning with these weapons, but
today they have the responsibility of hiding them from the Special
Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is their job basically to conduct one big shell game?
</P>
<P>
   A: That's right, it's a shell game. Now what you're getting to
is the problem I faced. We were beating our heads against the wall
going after the shell game. We're playing their game. I said to
(then) chairman (of UNSCOM, Rolf Ekeus, that) rather than going
after the shells, let's go after the man moving the shells.
</P>
<P>
   One reason why I went to Israel and started working with the
Israelis is because I believe that the methodologies that Israel
uses to hunt down terrorists are the same methodologies we needed
to use to go after the weapons of mass destruction. So I asked
Israel to help the commission formulate analytical models,
analytical techniques and to advise on operational issues.
</P>
<P>
   Q: When was that?
</P>
<P>
   A: I first approached (Israel) in 1994. We started working in
1995.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Was it helpful?
</P>
<P>
   A: I can honestly say that if it weren't for Israel, the Special
Commission would not have been able to carry out the
anti-concealment effort.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What was Israel's unique contribution?
</P>
<P>
   A: I can just say Israel had a good reputation of being
innovative, of being capable, of being good. And we approached
Israel due to all those factors. It's Tel Aviv that can be hit by
these missiles, not New York City, and we were actually, frankly
speaking, a little dismayed with the lack of intensity, the lack of
enthusiasm, that emanated from Washington on this issue. The U.S.
treated it more as an academic exercise and I thought Israel
treated it as it is _ a matter of life and death. So we came to
Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Were your trips and cooperation with Israel authorized by the
head of UNSCOM? Was it also approved by the U.S.?
</P>
<P>
   A: Ekeus started this, yes. It was all authorized by Ekeus. It
was a totally authorized thing and it was approved by the U.S.
government. Every aspect was approved by the U.S. government.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Who ran the Iraqi concealment program?
</P>
<P>
   A: Abed Hamed Mahmoud, the presidential secretary. He is
probably the most powerful man in Iraq after the president. He is
Saddam's bodyguard, confidant, right-hand man. Qusay Hussein
(Saddam's son) cannot go to the president without going through
Abed Hamed Mahmoud. He is the gatekeeper. He is the man responsible
for coordinating the national security policy of Iraq. He's the
secret power in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   He runs what's called the joint committee, (which) coordinates
all the national security. ... He's the one who brings people in
and gives them concealment tasks. He's the one who (manages) the
concealment operation center that monitors all the stuff that is
moved around Iraq. Abed uses the special security organization
[SSO] as the tool for concealment.
</P>
<P>
   I can name officers within the special security organization who
did concealment, and I can tell (the UNSCOM) chairman, how, when,
where and why specific acts of concealment took place. That's how
good we got. I can't say how we did it. But I can say how good we
got. So we started with nothing and in the end we were down to
where we knew when, where, how, why, who and what was happening.
</P>
<P>
   And that's why the frustration. It was not a single source of
information. We used everything that we had available to us. And
that's why what happened in July and August (when the U.S. halted
inspections) was so frustrating. Because now that we have
identified how they're doing it, and now that we get the kind of
information we need on the timely basis we need, we're inside their
decision-making cycle. We're reacting before Iraq can react.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You really could get the information before they move the
shell?
</P>
<P>
   A: Before they move the shell. And I got stuck. That's why I was
so mad. Because I finally came up with the solution. I broke the
code. We untied the Gordian knot. We figured it out. We had the
problem solved and now we just need to go do the job. It took us
three years, but we solved the problem.
</P>
<P>
   But the U.S. didn't let us. Not only didn't they let us, they
won't let us _ because to go do it ratchets it up to the ultimate
level of confrontation. Because there's no way Iraq will allow us
to inspect the people who need to be inspected. We're talking about
the people closest to Saddam Hussein. We're talking about the
security forces, the personal security forces of Saddam; we're
talking about the family of Saddam. These are the people doing
concealment.
</P>
<P>
   It basically works like a mafia organization. When you organize
crime (or set up a) terrorist organization, you have cells. And in
order to become a cell leader, you have to be trusted by the
family, so you have to be very close to the family. So the people
being selected are direct blood relatives of Saddam. There are
primarily Tikritis (people from Saddam's hometown) or there are
alliances of marriage to other tribes, like the Alduries.
</P>
<P>
   People of this nature are also close to Saddam. Abed is the one
who says I can trust this man or I can't. Abott does the
interviews. That's all compartmentalized. (Even) if you get one
cell, you don't what the other guy is doing.
</P>
<P>
   Now the cells can rely on a larger infrastructure, the Special
Security Organization, the Special Republican Guard. These elite
organizations are populated by people loyal to Saddam. Now they
don't have a mission per se of concealment, but if you need a
truck, you can go to that Special Republican Guard and vehicle
resources. If you need 15-man working party, you can go to that
Special Republican Guard unit and get 15 soldiers to do something
for you.
</P>
<P>
   So you have the resources of the SSO and SRG at your disposal if
you want to hide these weapons. You're given vehicles, you're given
money, you're given a safe house. You're given the responsibility
to go out and find a location to hide this stuff. ... You go to
your uncle who has a farm in Samara, and you say on that farm, 'I
need to use that shed. I can't tell you what for, it's a family
business.'
</P>
<P>
   Thirty days later, they leave and he has a soldier on his team.
He asks: 'Do you have a relative near here?' They go to the cousin
and say, 'We need to use your farm and hide stuff on your farm.'
And that's how they move stuff around.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How many people do you think are involved?
</P>
<P>
   A: I think we are talking about hundreds of people involved. It
is probably several cells doing chemicals, several cells doing
ballistic missiles, several cells doing biological (components),
and a cell doing nuclear (devices). You might be talking 50, 60
sites in Iraq at any one time with all that. Then you have the
groups responsible for monitoring ... personnel. Then you have a
group responsible for monitoring UNSCOM _ trying to collect
intelligence on what UNSCOM is doing. And Iraq has this regime of
terror and control. ... They can tap into any resource in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Did Israel help crack the code of concealment?
</P>
<P>
   A: We used the methodology that Israel was considered to be the
best at in the world. We cracked the code, not Israel. Israel was
not in the lead on this, but I can say that UNSCOM could not have
solved this problem without the help of Israel. It's absolutely
essential. We could not have done what we did. We couldn't even
come close without the help of Israel.
</P>
<P>
   I was in charge when I went to Israel. Israel responded. My
requirements and my tasking came from the executive chairman.
Israel did not control the Special Commission. Israel didn't want
to control the Special Commission. Israel was a fair player on all
of this. It was extremely responsible.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Can you say how many times you were in Israel?
</P>
<P>
   A: I was there a lot. From 1994 until 1998 I was there a lot.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Can you comment on the FBI investigation into your links with
Israel?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's the most outrageous that I ever encountered with the
U.S. government. I was sent to the Special Commission by the U.S.
government to work for the executive chairman. Those are my orders.
So I did that. I was told that strength of the Special Commission
would be in its independence, that the Special Commission could not
be seen as a tool of any country and that I have to help make the
Special Commission independent. I did that. I succeeded.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, we needed some new methodologies that we weren't
getting from the United States, so we went to Israel. I went to the
executive chairman (Ekeus) and we raised the issue of approaching
Israel, and he approved.
</P>
<P>
   I have to say that as an American citizen, I went to the U.S.
government and told them that I was doing this and they didn't stop
me. When the relationship really began in earnest starting in July
of '95, everything I did in Israel was approved by the executive
chairman. Everything we did was consistent with the mandate given
by the Security Council. And everything I did was made known to and
approved by the U.S. government.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Every step of the way?
</P>
<P>
   A: Every step of the way. Now they didn't agree with a lot of
what I did. They didn't agree at all. They didn't like the idea of
UNSCOM becoming this independent, nor UNSCOM having a capable
partner like Israel supporting us. They weren't happy with this at
all. They tried to stop it every step of the way. But I kept them
informed. I had their approval and everything was approved by the
executive chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Was it the CIA that instigated the FBI investigation?
</P>
<P>
   A: The bottom line is that it was the CIA that raised the
concerns. They said that the relationship that Israel and Ritter
had could be an espionage relationship. Even though they knew all
the facts and they approved everything. They turned it over to the
FBI and the FBI ran with it and then it became sort of a
self-continuing effort. Every time I went to Israel, the pile got
thicker. Every time I did my job, the FBI just collected more data,
saying its espionage. It was terrible.
</P>
<P>
   Q: When did the FBI investigation become known to you?
</P>
<P>
   A: I knew in January, February 1997 that the U.S. had a concern
about the nature of the work and I worked very closely with the
government to try and talk about what their concern was. And it
came down to basically bureaucratic jealousy. You know, I have a
better relationship with the Israelis than they do. They are not in
control. They lost control.
</P>
<P>
   I'm an American. Israel can't have an intelligence relationship
with an American that is not controlled by the U.S. These are their
concerns. I said basically if that's it, then tough luck. Because,
you sent me here to work. You told me to be independent. I'm doing
what you told me to do, and I'm succeeding. So unless you give me a
direct order to stop, and always I'm an American, you give me a
direct order, you say stop, I will stop today. You ask me a
question, I will answer it. I'm not hiding anything from them. But
they never said stop.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What can you say about the Israeli officials you met?
</P>
<P>
   A: First is the professionalism. The people I dealt with were
dedicated, professional, smart. When you go down to Washington you
are overwhelmed with the 9 to 5 mentality. There wasn't this 9 to 5
mentality. This was national security. Plus they think out of the
box.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What does that mean 'to think out of the box?'
</P>
<P>
   A: In America, you have rules. We're going to address this
problem. Let's read the rules here. They say we can think this, we
cannot do this. That's how we are going to solve this. That's how
we're going to do it.
</P>
<P>
   The Israelis are: `What's another way of looking at this? How
else can we do this? Let's think of alternatives here. Is there
another way we can solve this problem?' The Israelis were
innovative and courageous in terms of putting forward ideas. They
were not afraid to have an idea shot down. Again, professional. A
level of trust developed.
</P>
<P>
   The Israelis looked at me and didn't see a United Nations
official, or an American. It's all professional. It's somebody whom
they can respect, whom can they can work with. That's what
impressed me about them. And the fact that they were always
sympathetic with the cause.
</P>
<P>
   I never once felt when I was over there that I was somehow
imposing on them or somehow inconveniencing them. When I was over
there, we were a team. We were all going for the same cause. We
were working really hard. They are good people.

<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   (NOTE: In this exclusive interview, former U.N. arms inspector
Scott Ritter tells Ha'aretz, the Israeli newspaper, that the U.N.
inspectors had broken Iraq's code for hiding missiles _ and then
inspections were stopped.)
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Scott Ritter knows Iraq pretty well by now. A veteran
arms inspector for the U.N. Special Commission charged with
tracking Iraq's arsenal of weapons of mass destruction, Ritter, who
recently resigned his post, was intimately involved in the U.N.
effort to keep Saddam Hussein honest.
</P>
<P>
   Over an extended period, Ritter and other inspectors worked to
break the code Saddam was using to issue instructions involving the
movement of weapons Iraq wanted to keep hidden from inspectors.
Well into this year, the cat-and-mouse game being played in Iraq
made regular headlines around the world.
</P>
<P>
   What few know is that the U.N. inspectors, with Israeli help,
eventually broke the Iraqi code and were on the verge of a major
breakthrough in uncovering concealed weaponry. Then this summer the
inspections were halted. That's when Ritter quit his job _ out of
pure frustration, he says.
</P>
<P>
   In this conversation with David Makovsky, correspondent for
Ha'aretz, Ritter reveals how weapons were being moved around in
Iraq and what role Israel played in helping the inspections team.
He also reveals his own personal disillusionment with the United
States for what he characterizes as its lack of support for the
inspections program.
 &UR; -0- &QL;
</P>
<P>
   DAVID MAKOVSKY: How did Iraq conceal weapons from UNSCOM?
</P>
<P>
   SCOTT RITTER: In April 1991, Saddam Hussein issued a
presidential directive ordering that Iraq lie to the Special
Commission (UNSCOM) and to the IAEA (International Atomic Energy
Agency), (and that Iraq) would keep (its mass destruction)
capabilities.
</P>
<P>
   In May 1991, the materials that were kept were turned over under
instruction of the president to the Special Security Organization
(SSO) and Special Republican Guard (SRG). These are presidential
security forces.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How big is this special organization?
</P>
<P>
   A: The SSO is one of the most secretive organizations in Iraq.
It probably numbers around 5,000 people. The SRG is the military
arm that had four brigades, around 15 battalions, and is about the
size of a division _ maybe 20,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Was the special organization set up for this purpose of
concealment?
</P>
<P>
   A: The special organization was set up to protect the president
of Iraq. Back in the 1980s this special security organization also
had a responsibility for protecting Iraq's weapons. ... So they
have been linked from the very beginning with these weapons, but
today they have the responsibility of hiding them from the Special
Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is their job basically to conduct one big shell game?
</P>
<P>
   A: That's right, it's a shell game. Now what you're getting to
is the problem I faced. We were beating our heads against the wall
going after the shell game. We're playing their game. I said to
(then) chairman (of UNSCOM, Rolf Ekeus, that) rather than going
after the shells, let's go after the man moving the shells.
</P>
<P>
   One reason why I went to Israel and started working with the
Israelis is because I believe that the methodologies that Israel
uses to hunt down terrorists are the same methodologies we needed
to use to go after the weapons of mass destruction. So I asked
Israel to help the commission formulate analytical models,
analytical techniques and to advise on operational issues.
</P>
<P>
   Q: When was that?
</P>
<P>
   A: I first approached (Israel) in 1994. We started working in
1995.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Was it helpful?
</P>
<P>
   A: I can honestly say that if it weren't for Israel, the Special
Commission would not have been able to carry out the
anti-concealment effort.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What was Israel's unique contribution?
</P>
<P>
   A: I can just say Israel had a good reputation of being
innovative, of being capable, of being good. And we approached
Israel due to all those factors. It's Tel Aviv that can be hit by
these missiles, not New York City, and we were actually, frankly
speaking, a little dismayed with the lack of intensity, the lack of
enthusiasm, that emanated from Washington on this issue. The U.S.
treated it more as an academic exercise and I thought Israel
treated it as it is _ a matter of life and death. So we came to
Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Were your trips and cooperation with Israel authorized by the
head of UNSCOM? Was it also approved by the U.S.?
</P>
<P>
   A: Ekeus started this, yes. It was all authorized by Ekeus. It
was a totally authorized thing and it was approved by the U.S.
government. Every aspect was approved by the U.S. government.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Who ran the Iraqi concealment program?
</P>
<P>
   A: Abed Hamed Mahmoud, the presidential secretary. He is
probably the most powerful man in Iraq after the president. He is
Saddam's bodyguard, confidant, right-hand man. Qusay Hussein
(Saddam's son) cannot go to the president without going through
Abed Hamed Mahmoud. He is the gatekeeper. He is the man responsible
for coordinating the national security policy of Iraq. He's the
secret power in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   He runs what's called the joint committee, (which) coordinates
all the national security. ... He's the one who brings people in
and gives them concealment tasks. He's the one who (manages) the
concealment operation center that monitors all the stuff that is
moved around Iraq. Abed uses the special security organization
[SSO] as the tool for concealment.
</P>
<P>
   I can name officers within the special security organization who
did concealment, and I can tell (the UNSCOM) chairman, how, when,
where and why specific acts of concealment took place. That's how
good we got. I can't say how we did it. But I can say how good we
got. So we started with nothing and in the end we were down to
where we knew when, where, how, why, who and what was happening.
</P>
<P>
   And that's why the frustration. It was not a single source of
information. We used everything that we had available to us. And
that's why what happened in July and August (when the U.S. halted
inspections) was so frustrating. Because now that we have
identified how they're doing it, and now that we get the kind of
information we need on the timely basis we need, we're inside their
decision-making cycle. We're reacting before Iraq can react.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You really could get the information before they move the
shell?
</P>
<P>
   A: Before they move the shell. And I got stuck. That's why I was
so mad. Because I finally came up with the solution. I broke the
code. We untied the Gordian knot. We figured it out. We had the
problem solved and now we just need to go do the job. It took us
three years, but we solved the problem.
</P>
<P>
   But the U.S. didn't let us. Not only didn't they let us, they
won't let us _ because to go do it ratchets it up to the ultimate
level of confrontation. Because there's no way Iraq will allow us
to inspect the people who need to be inspected. We're talking about
the people closest to Saddam Hussein. We're talking about the
security forces, the personal security forces of Saddam; we're
talking about the family of Saddam. These are the people doing
concealment.
</P>
<P>
   It basically works like a mafia organization. When you organize
crime (or set up a) terrorist organization, you have cells. And in
order to become a cell leader, you have to be trusted by the
family, so you have to be very close to the family. So the people
being selected are direct blood relatives of Saddam. There are
primarily Tikritis (people from Saddam's hometown) or there are
alliances of marriage to other tribes, like the Alduries.
</P>
<P>
   People of this nature are also close to Saddam. Abed is the one
who says I can trust this man or I can't. Abott does the
interviews. That's all compartmentalized. (Even) if you get one
cell, you don't what the other guy is doing.
</P>
<P>
   Now the cells can rely on a larger infrastructure, the Special
Security Organization, the Special Republican Guard. These elite
organizations are populated by people loyal to Saddam. Now they
don't have a mission per se of concealment, but if you need a
truck, you can go to that Special Republican Guard and vehicle
resources. If you need 15-man working party, you can go to that
Special Republican Guard unit and get 15 soldiers to do something
for you.
</P>
<P>
   So you have the resources of the SSO and SRG at your disposal if
you want to hide these weapons. You're given vehicles, you're given
money, you're given a safe house. You're given the responsibility
to go out and find a location to hide this stuff. ... You go to
your uncle who has a farm in Samara, and you say on that farm, 'I
need to use that shed. I can't tell you what for, it's a family
business.'
</P>
<P>
   Thirty days later, they leave and he has a soldier on his team.
He asks: 'Do you have a relative near here?' They go to the cousin
and say, 'We need to use your farm and hide stuff on your farm.'
And that's how they move stuff around.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How many people do you think are involved?
</P>
<P>
   A: I think we are talking about hundreds of people involved. It
is probably several cells doing chemicals, several cells doing
ballistic missiles, several cells doing biological (components),
and a cell doing nuclear (devices). You might be talking 50, 60
sites in Iraq at any one time with all that. Then you have the
groups responsible for monitoring ... personnel. Then you have a
group responsible for monitoring UNSCOM _ trying to collect
intelligence on what UNSCOM is doing. And Iraq has this regime of
terror and control. ... They can tap into any resource in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Did Israel help crack the code of concealment?
</P>
<P>
   A: We used the methodology that Israel was considered to be the
best at in the world. We cracked the code, not Israel. Israel was
not in the lead on this, but I can say that UNSCOM could not have
solved this problem without the help of Israel. It's absolutely
essential. We could not have done what we did. We couldn't even
come close without the help of Israel.
</P>
<P>
   I was in charge when I went to Israel. Israel responded. My
requirements and my tasking came from the executive chairman.
Israel did not control the Special Commission. Israel didn't want
to control the Special Commission. Israel was a fair player on all
of this. It was extremely responsible.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Can you say how many times you were in Israel?
</P>
<P>
   A: I was there a lot. From 1994 until 1998 I was there a lot.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Can you comment on the FBI investigation into your links with
Israel?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's the most outrageous that I ever encountered with the
U.S. government. I was sent to the Special Commission by the U.S.
government to work for the executive chairman. Those are my orders.
So I did that. I was told that strength of the Special Commission
would be in its independence, that the Special Commission could not
be seen as a tool of any country and that I have to help make the
Special Commission independent. I did that. I succeeded.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, we needed some new methodologies that we weren't
getting from the United States, so we went to Israel. I went to the
executive chairman (Ekeus) and we raised the issue of approaching
Israel, and he approved.
</P>
<P>
   I have to say that as an American citizen, I went to the U.S.
government and told them that I was doing this and they didn't stop
me. When the relationship really began in earnest starting in July
of '95, everything I did in Israel was approved by the executive
chairman. Everything we did was consistent with the mandate given
by the Security Council. And everything I did was made known to and
approved by the U.S. government.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Every step of the way?
</P>
<P>
   A: Every step of the way. Now they didn't agree with a lot of
what I did. They didn't agree at all. They didn't like the idea of
UNSCOM becoming this independent, nor UNSCOM having a capable
partner like Israel supporting us. They weren't happy with this at
all. They tried to stop it every step of the way. But I kept them
informed. I had their approval and everything was approved by the
executive chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Was it the CIA that instigated the FBI investigation?
</P>
<P>
   A: The bottom line is that it was the CIA that raised the
concerns. They said that the relationship that Israel and Ritter
had could be an espionage relationship. Even though they knew all
the facts and they approved everything. They turned it over to the
FBI and the FBI ran with it and then it became sort of a
self-continuing effort. Every time I went to Israel, the pile got
thicker. Every time I did my job, the FBI just collected more data,

SAFEWAY PLANS BIG INVESTMENT IN NEW, EXISTING STORES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By VICTORIA COLLIVER  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ In its most aggressive expansion to date,
Safeway Inc. is investing $2 billion this year and next to add
nearly 100 new grocery stores and remodel more than 400 others.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a big ramp-up for these guys, the biggest yet,'' said
Jonathan H. Ziegler, an analyst who follows the grocery industry
for Salomon Smith Barney in San Francisco. ``This company is on a
roll.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts supported the company's plans in light of Safeway's
solid third-quarter earnings report, released Thursday. The
Pleasanton, Calif.-based grocery chain, which operates 1,381 stores
in the United States and Canada, said profits for the quarter had
risen 29 percent, to $193.7 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've cleaned up their balance sheet, and they get great
returns in investing in their stores,'' Ziegler said.
</P>
<P>
   Safeway is benefiting from lower costs and other improvements in
connection with its $2.6 billion purchase of Los Angeles-based Vons
Cos. last year.
</P>
<P>
   According to the latest earnings report, net income rose to
$193.7 million (38 cents per diluted share) from $150 million (30
cents) for the same period a year earlier. Those results beat
analyst estimates by a penny.
</P>
<P>
   Safeway spokeswoman Debra Lambert said strong sales combined
with leaner operating expenses had helped the company fund this
round of store improvements.
</P>
<P>
   From 1993 to 1997, Safeway spent $3.5 billion to open 133 new
stores and remodel 546 others. By the end of this year, the company
will have added 40 new stores and remodeled 200 others. In 1999, it
will add another 45 to 50 stores and finish refurbishing 200
stores. Safeway would not release plans beyond next year.
</P>
<P>
   Things were not always so smooth for the company. In 1986,
Safeway was taken private in a $4.1 billion deal put together by
the New York investment firm of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &AMP; Co. It
went public again in April 1990. The company suffered from weak
earnings, especially during the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Lambert attributed much of the company's problems at the time to
the sluggish economy, but said Safeway had internal weaknesses too.
The company and analysts credit chief executive Steven Burd, who
took over in November 1992, with igniting Safeway's turnaround.
</P>
<P>
   While analysts are enthusiastic about Safeway's future, they
note that the grocery industry is becoming increasingly
competitive.
</P>
<P>
   In August, the parent company of California's Lucky Stores
announced a merger with Idaho-based Albertson's Inc., which would
create a combined operation of 2,470 stores.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Wal-Mart Stores announced intentions to make
greater inroads in California with its grocery business and
specialty stores.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Cerankosky, an analyst with McDonald &AMP; Co. Investments,
said he had confidence that Safeway was up to the challenge. He
said the company was not sacrificing financial security with its
expansion.

<P>
   Q: What's the meaning or origin of Scooby-Doo's name?
</P>
<P>
   _ M.P.G., Cape Coral, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   A: The mystery-solving dog's name was inspired by the song
``Strangers in the Night,'' according to the Ask Mr. Showbiz World
Wide Web page.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Silverman was a CBS executive working on the project that
would become the animated series ``Scooby-Doo Where Are You?'' in
1969. As the network struggled with the right approach for the
cartoon, Silverman heard ``Strangers'' on an airline flight.
</P>
<P>
   ``The `doobie-doobie-dos' Sinatra sang between verses sparked a
brainstorm, and Silverman immediately reconceptualized the series
as a lighthearted caper with the Great Dane as the main
character,'' Mr. Showbiz writes.
</P>
<P>
   Silverman's first name was lent to Fred, one of Scooby's
crime-fighting pals. The Mr. Showbiz Web site is at
www.mrshowbiz.com.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Which party controls the Senate and the House of
Representatives, and in what numbers?
</P>
<P>
   _ R.S., Fort Worth
</P>
<P>
   A: Heading into the November elections, Republicans are in
control of both houses of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   In the House, there are 228 Republicans, 206 Democrats and 1
independent, four-term incumbent, Bernard Sanders of Vermont.
Thirty-four House members _ 17 Republicans and 17 Democrats _ are
retiring this year or running for other offices.
</P>
<P>
   In the Senate, there are 55 Republicans and 45 Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What information is available on Kevin Spacey?
</P>
<P>
   _ B.R., Fort Worth
</P>
<P>
   A: Not much. Spacey is a 39-year-old Southern Californian who
was born Kevin Fowler in New Jersey. He became involved in theater
as a high school student and graduated as co-valedictorian, sharing
the honor with fellow actor Mare Winningham.
</P>
<P>
   Spacey made his movie debut in 1986's ``Heartburn'' as a thief,
and shortly afterward became a cult favorite for his villainous
role on the TV drama ``Wiseguy.''
</P>
<P>
   He won a best supporting actor Oscar in 1995 for ``The Usual
Suspects'' and a Tony Award in 1991 for ``Lost in Yonkers.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Conrad, who first saw Spacey perform in a high school
play, told an Esquire' reporter, ``You want to know who Kevin
Spacey is? He's an actor. He's never really had a life.''
</P>
<P>
   Write to Spacey in care of the William Morris Agency, 151 El
Camino Drive, Beverly Hills, CA 90212.

VAN GOGH TAKES WASHINGTON BY STORM 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and e coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARY LEONARD  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Move over, Monet. The really big guy has arrived.
</P>
<P>
   For a city that takes kings and queens, prime ministers,
presidents, and even an occasional Hollywood star in stride,
Washington is simply agog over Vincent Van Gogh. On Sunday, Oct. 4,
a stunning exhibit of 72 works by the enormously popular Dutch
painter _ sometimes called the Elvis of the art world _ opens at
the National Gallery of Art for a three-month run.
</P>
<P>
   In the breathless world of blockbuster shows _ a huge exhibit of
Claude Monet's 20th century work opened recently at Boston's Museum
of Fine Arts _ ``Van Gogh's Van Goghs'' is considered the crown
jewel, the event of the year. Not for 25 years have so many Van
Goghs been brought together in one North American exhibit, and it
may never happen again.
</P>
<P>
   Scalpers are demanding more than $100 each for a few precious
tickets to the free show. Chefs are creating special Vincent
dishes, hotels are offering Van Gogh weekends, and the National
Gallery, for once is bending its no-kitsch rules to allow the sale
of Van Gogh magnets, mugs, and $59 watches.
</P>
<P>
   ``Van Gogh would have been truly amazed by the media and
touristic attention to this exhibit,'' said Philip Conisbee, the
gallery's senior curator of European paintings. ``This is, after
all, an artist who sold only one work of art in his lifetime.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, people can't seem to get enough of Van Gogh, the tormented
legend whose work not only fetches stratospheric sums but who also
has inspired more films, books, scholarly papers, poetry, popular
songs, Web sites, tacky souvenirs (``Degas makes da Van Gogh,''
says one T-shirt), art thefts and forgeries than Monet, Manet, and
Millet put together. Like Leonardo and Rembrandt, the world's on a
first-name basis with Vincent.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's Van Gogh! I had to come,'' swooned Edney Silverstre, a
correspondent for Globo-TV Brazil, who traveled from New York with
a camera crew for a sneak media preview of the exhibit. ``He's the
rock star of art, so he guarantees high ratings for me.''
</P>
<P>
   From wherever they watch (the Japanese are known to have a
special affection for Vincent), the public will see in this show
some of Van Gogh's greatest works, including ``The Potato Eaters''
(1885), ``Self-Portrait with a Felt Hat'' (1887), ``The Bedroom''
(1888), ``Wheatfields with Crows''(1890) _ paintings that represent
the tremendous range, and brilliant expression of Van Gogh's short
but prolific career.
</P>
<P>
   Some may be disappointed that this priceless collection, on loan
during the renovation and expansion of Amsterdam's Van Gogh Museum,
doesn't include any of the painter's well-known golden sunflowers
(the inspiration for, among many other consumer goods, a Barbie
doll costume). Nor will they see the alluring ``Starry Night,''
which not only was popularized in Don McLean's 1972 hit song,
``Vincent,'' but also once provided the bright, blue background for
a commercial for TV's Conan O'Brien.
</P>
<P>
   There's no doubt that the public likes to look at Van Goghs. But
that's not all there is to it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people see a lot of themselves in Vincent,'' said
David Brooks, a Toronto banker who designed the most comprehensive
Van Gogh Web site (www.vangoghgallery.com). ``He worked hard, he
was good and decent, he was lonely and insecure, and he was never
sure whether the work he was doing was worthwhile ... You can't
help but like the man.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, his was a life which balanced genius with tragedy.
The son of a minister, Vincent Van Gogh drifted from job to job
before becoming a painter supported throughout his life by his
brother, Theo. He was institutionalized for mental illness, drank
too much, and suffered from seizures. He never married but lived
with a prostitute. He went after artist Paul Gauguin with a razor
but turned the blade on himself, cutting off his own ear lobe. In
1890, at age 37 and just as his talent was being discovered, Van
Gogh walked into a French wheatfield and fired a pistol into his
chest. He died two days later.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Van Gogh had been a happy man, he still would have been a
great artist, but he might not have been the romantic genius or had
quite the emotional appeal that the culture adores today,''
Conisbee said.
</P>
<P>
   Josien Heling-Van Gogh is the painter's niece and part of the
family foundation in the Netherlands that painstakingly, and at
considerable financial sacrifice, has maintained a large portfolio
of Van Gogh's paintings and writings for the public. She says she
tries to be patient when the focus is put on her uncle's life
instead of his art.
</P>
<P>
   ``People will come up to me and say, `Are you a relative of that
crazy person who cut off his ear?''' Heling-Van Gogh said. ``I say,
`Well, he only cut off part of his ear, and he wasn't crazy.' He
was complicated. He was a person of ups and downs. And he made
wonderful paintings.''
</P>
<P>
   Heling-Van Gogh says she only regrets that her grandfather, also
named Vincent Van Gogh, didn't keep a few paintings in the family
when he set up the public trust. In 1990, Van Gogh's ``Portrait of
Doctor Gachet'' was purchased by a private Japanese collector for
$82.5 million, the highest sale price in art history.
</P>
<P>
   Such price tags only add to the mystique. ``Celebrities have
become our culture's most reliable products,'' said James Mahoney,
a critic for Art in America magazine. ``Why is Van Gogh so popular?
In part, it's because people are fascinated by anything that is
worth a lot of money.''
</P>
<P>
   Brooks, whose Web site has had more than 250,000 visitors since
it was set up two years ago, thinks it is ``a little bit sad'' that
an artist who couldn't afford to feed himself has now become a
``cottage industry,'' generating millions in sales not only through
his works, but also the myriad spinoffs. He said he was
particularly offended to find a ``Pin the Ear on Van Gogh'' game in
the gift shop of a children's museum.
</P>
<P>
   Whether it's Van Gogh in Washington, Monet in Boston, or Cezanne
in Philadelphia, the hot shows make cash registers jingle and draw
thousands of tourists to town. In Boston, 200,000 advance tickets
already have been sold for the Monet exhibit, which lasts until
Dec. 27.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, 215,000 advance passes to the Van Gogh show were
snapped up quickly, and long lines are expected to form for the
2,000 tickets that will be distributed each day. In January, the
exhibit moves on to the Los Angeles County Museum of Art for a
nearly three-month stay.
</P>
<P>
   One disappointed art lover is Brooks, the Van Gogh Web site
designer who has not been able to get a ticket to the show in
Washington and refuses to pay a scalper.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a heartbreaker,'' said Brooks. ``This is a
once-in-a-lifetime event.''

   OBIT-AUTRY (Undated) _ Gene Autry, America's first movie singing
cowboy and a multimillionaire businessman, died Friday at the age
of 91. Using his familiar theme song of ``Back in the Saddle
Again,'' and riding his famous chestnut stallion Champion, Autry
began his climb to fame in the mid-1930s. Although he later owned
hotels, broadcasting stations, oil wells and a baseball team, he
did not give up performing in films, on radio and television and in
his own rodeo until 1964. By Albin Krebs.

Cambodia and the former Yugoslavia, among many others, have begun

BORDER CITY SEEKS BINATIONAL TELECOM AUTHORITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By BONNIE PFISTER  
 c.1998 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAREDO, Texas _ City leaders here are calling for a border-free
telecommunications zone, and a binational commission to oversee it,
to improve information traffic between the United States and Mexico
while discouraging abuses.
</P>
<P>
   Pay phone fraud and disabled cellular phone services are just
part of the problem, according to Laredo's mayor and members of the
city's telecommunications board. They said a binational approach is
needed to streamline and regulate the growing use of telephones,
radios and other systems spurred by border growth and the North
American Free Trade Agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The concept of a border-free telecommunications zone has been
discussed in Southern California for at least two years.
</P>
<P>
   John Eger, an endowed professor at the International Center for
Communications at San Diego State University, has proposed an
experimental zone with common telecommunications systems and
regulations extending 30 miles on each side of the U.S.-Mexico
border. This would allow San Diego and Tijuana, for example, to act
as a common region in telecommunications as well as manufacturing
and transportation.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Communications Commission held a hearing in Laredo
Thursday, taking the complaints of businesspeople, communications
workers and police officers, who reported trouble with
interdepartmental communications from the glut of illegal
radio-frequency use on the border.
</P>
<P>
   They asked FCC Commissioner Gloria Tristani and her Mexican
counterpart, Reynaldo Gonzalez Bustamante, to work together to
regulate and simplify cross-border technology traffic.
</P>
<P>
   Tristani called the concept ``a magnificent idea.'' She said,
``I'm surprised it hasn't happened before, frankly, with the
importance of telecommunications to both countries and to the
global economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Forming such a commission could require congressional approval
as well as cooperation from dozens of governmental agencies,
Tristani said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want us to kid ourselves,'' she said. ``We have to
have in hand a plan ... with concrete solutions'' while taking in
the big picture of the border's needs.
</P>
<P>
   Only the federal government has the power to stop
telecommunications lawbreakers, said Larry Dovalina, the assistant
city manager of Laredo, an increasingly busy entry point and
gateway for cross-border commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Dovalina described trucking company drivers who adjust the
frequencies on radios to communicate with one other while trucks
inch over the congested international bridges here. They operate
without licenses and cut into the frequencies reserved for
legitimate users, such as cell phone owners and the police.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, there are dozens of unauthorized antennae in the
city, said Bruce Miller Earle, chairman of Laredo's
telecommunications board.
</P>
<P>
   Those antennae establish point-to-point radio links connecting,
for example, a warehouse in Texas with an office across the border.
This allows U.S. companies an unauthorized tap into the Mexican
telephone system, and vice versa, which Earle calls ``dial-tone
piracy.''
</P>
<P>
   Some ``entrepreneurs'' sell that service to others, even
charging federal and state taxes, which they pocket, Dovalina said.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities say a model for a binational communications agency
already exists in the form of the International Water and Boundary
Commission, which regulates water use on both sides of the Rio
Grande.

BILL WELD IS NO DASHIELL HAMMETT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARTIN F. NOLAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO - Four blocks from where Dashiell Hammett was an
operative in the Pinkerton detective agency, America's newest
practitioner of pulp fiction came, saw, and conquered.
</P>
<P>
   Before writing ``The Maltese Falcon,'' ``The Thin Man,'' and
other novels, Hammett worked in the real world. William F. Weld is
doing it the other way around. A former crime-fighting bureaucrat
and politician, he is now a passionate tribune of the private
sector, a salesman. ``If the book seems to crawl for the first
two-thirds, please, just get a grip on those pages. The last third
goes very quickly,'' he told members of the Commonwealth Club here
about ``Mackerel by Moonlight.''
</P>
<P>
   The former governor's novel takes its title from an insult from
John Randolph of Roanoke. Weld takes his plot from his own
adventures in law and politics, emphasizing long legal memos and
longer St. Patrick's Day breakfasts. ``The hero is an underclass
Irishman who does not come from a good family,'' he said, marking
another role reversal for the author, who grew up in Great Gatsby
country among the landed gentry of Long Island.
</P>
<P>
   Whether he was charmed by Irish-American politicians or repelled
by them is unclear. But he read passages from his work with the
gusto of a viceroy who had gone native in the Southie raj.
</P>
<P>
   The former governor's luncheon talk referred to Thomas Wolfe, F.
Scott, Marcel Proust, Vladimir Nabokov, and his favorite, John
Buchan. But he made no literary claims. ``It's a bagatelle. It's
lighter than popcorn,'' he said. ``It's designed to be
entertaining, and I hope it is.''
</P>
<P>
   For some stylistic inspiration, he chose a Boston novelist. ``It
might be called a poor man's George V. Higgins,'' Weld said of his
book. ``He was an assistant US attorney in Boston for a number of
years. I was the US Attorney in Boston for a number of years. One
peculiarity which traces directly to George V. Higgins is the
punctuation. ... I've punctuated to try to reflect a spoken
cadence, rather than the rules of grammar. This is at least as much
gangsters-cops-and-robbers as it is a political book.''
</P>
<P>
   As Elmore Leonard and others attest, ``The Friends of Eddie
Coyle,'' which Higgins wrote in 1972, is widely emulated. The next
Higgins novel, ``The Agent,'' from Harcourt Brace later this year,
will be his 29th.
</P>
<P>
   Since imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, Higgins says
he likes Weld's tribute, but muses: ``He's another one who's found
that it's not as easy as it looks. I'm sure Weld's a wonderful
fellow and if he had enough amber liquid in him, he might think I'm
a wonderful fellow. But writing is a grown-up game. He's about as
good a writer as I would be a candidate for governor.''
</P>
<P>
   Weld said he dictated the novel's first draft, ``then went over
it in pen and ink five times thereafter.'' He plans the same
procedure for four more novels.
</P>
<P>
   The audience here reflected Weld's politics: socially liberal
and fiscally conservative. Asked about his political plans, he
replied, ``Candidly, this may sound a little vainglorious, the only
office I would be interested in is at the national level ... It may
be beyond my grasp and that's fine.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, he is ``socked into law practice,'' where he is
happy and where art and commerce blend. His publisher, Simon &AMP;
Schuster, mapped his plug-ola pilgrimage to cities with offices of
McDermott, Will and Emery, his law firm. On the bottom line, the
luncheon was a success. Of more than 100 people in attendance, half
bought books and stood patiently in line for the author's
autograph.
</P>
<P>
   Some mentioned ties to New England or to Harvard, others praised
the former governor's doomed battle in 1997 for the ambassadorship
to Mexico against Senator Jesse Helms of North Carolina. Some had
read Weld's book; some had not. Some wanted him to try politics
again. Regarding his new literary career, no one advised him to
quit his day job.

TEN MORE `SLEEPERS' FROM AN OLD-CAR GURU 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN R. WHITE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Every year, the resident old-car guru of Hemmings Motor news and
the magazine Special Interest Autos, Dave Brownell, offers his list
of ``sleepers,'' a compendium of 10 models of the past likely to
become valued collectibles of the future.
</P>
<P>
   The Brownell ``Prospectus of 10'' is offered up as part of the
annual Hemmings Press Day festivities, in which members of the
motor press are briefed on the state of the old-car hobby, the
current condition and lastest activities of the Hemmings publishing
empire, the latest cause of its socially aware publisher, Terry
Ehrich, and then given the opportunity to drive old cars. Driving
the ancient vehicles in the Hemmings fleet gives rise to
conflicting thoughts; it is good to revisit the technology of
yesteryear so as to appreciate more the technology of today (and
the endurance and strength of yesteryear's drivers), to admire
these grand old cars and trucks _ but why would a sane man want to
own and drive them if he didn't have to do it?
</P>
<P>
   It is a question answered by the vagaries and illogic of
hobbyists. Why do anything difficult? For enjoyment, for the
camaraderie of fellow sufferers, notoriety, or just for the sheer
pleasure of doing it. The larger question for the writer, however,
is why do I want to publish the latest predictions of this rascally
seer of old car values when all it will serve to do is drive up the
price of still another old car I'd like to own?
</P>
<P>
   Brownell, after all, is the expert who predicted that the
Volkswagen Beetle would become a collectible, thereby bumping up
the price of the car I was haggling to own and killing the deal.
Then came the ``new'' Beetle and a rush to the old Beetle.
</P>
<P>
   Now the man is doing it again, predicting this year that the
1951-'52 Chevrolet Bel Air convertibles and hardtops will be seeing
``upward potential.'' Collectors crave the cars of their youth _
you can't get the youth back, but at least you can have the car.
This is a car of my youth, that I couldn't afford then and still
can't find enough spare change to own. The closest I came to owning
one was buying a new bumper for a nifty yellow '51 ragtop _ because
I hit it with my rusty '47 Buick.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble with Brownell's predictions is that they are too
good, too frequently come to be realized; he has considerably more
hits than misses and reminded us painfully of that by documenting
the rise in price of several old memories of youth.
</P>
<P>
   Well, in the interest of fair play and truth in journalism,
here's the Brownell list for this year.
</P>
<P>
   He leads the list with a curious selection, the  &UR; Willys station
wagon  &LR; built from 1949 into the early '60s. Rugged with 4-wheel
drive, they were the first all-steel station wagons _ or were they
the original SUVs? Available, Brownell says, for between $1,600 to
$2,500, an odd collectible available for an agreeable price.
</P>
<P>
   The  &UR; '51-'52 Bel Airs, &LR;  he reminds us, are pleasing cars to look
at, pleasing to drive, and the ``simple, straight-forward
mechanicals make them easy to and economical to restore and
maintain.'' An ideal ``starter'' for the new hobbyist, he says.
</P>
<P>
   Another of my youthful ``likes'' _ certainly not a passion _
that Brownell sees as a comer is the &UR; 1953-'54 Plymouths,  &LR; cars that
had ``disappointing sales when new'' but offer pleasing compact
design with a tough chassis and engine, Brownell says.
</P>
<P>
   A ``nearly forgottten'' compact of the '60s, the &UR; '64-'67 Mercury
Comet Caliente &LR;  in hardtop or convertible is next on the Brownell
list. Derived from a Ford Falcon, these distinctive cars were
available with either I-6 or V-8 engines and are quite rare today,
but fairly cheap, Brownell says, commenting that Hemmings listed
one as ``rust-free'' for $1,600.
</P>
<P>
   Next is the  &UR; '67-'69 Cougar &LR;  in hardtop or convertible style.
Essentially, these are upscale Mustangs, he reminds us, but have
not achieved the inflated values of their Ford siblings. Recent ads
for a rust-free '67 XR-7 with a 289 CID V-8 in storage asked
$2,900. Probably gone by now, and after Brownell's list gets
around, never to be seen again. Thanks, Dave, for ruining another
dream.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Alfa-Romeo 1966-'69 Duetto Spyders &LR;  are next on his tout list _
no dream of this writer's. Admitting they are ``prone to rust'' and
``mechanically temperamental'' (an understatement), Brownell sees
them in a favorable light for good looks, available parts, and club
support.
</P>
<P>
   The  &UR; 1969-'76 Triumph TR-6 &LR;  makes the list for ``performance,
appearance, and attractive current price levels.'' Why these cars
haven't become warmer in the market is a mystery, since British
sports cars, no matter how troublesome or rust prone, seem to be
coveted by collectors and hobbyists.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Buick 1968-'70 GS400 &LR;  hardtops and convertibles, ``solid and
well engineered'' cars in Brownell's words, are next up and, with
their Wildcat 400 CID engines and Burst three-speed shifters, are
desirable cars. Figure to pay $6,000, he says _ until the owners
read this stuff.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously looking to put some humor into his Top Ten List,
Brownell finishes with the  &UR; Pontiac Fiero &LR; , ``one of the most
innovative cars to come out of General Motors.''  &UR;  &LR; He admits to
``initial quality problems'' _ a euphemism for a fire-prone car _
and tells us these mid-engined, plastic-skinned cars matured into
``quick, great-handling two-seaters.''
</P>
<P>
   That's got to be the punch line. Plastic they were; quick they
were not. The six-cylinder version was a maintenance monster; the
four-cylinder versions were lead sleds with decent handling.
Although the skin won't rust, most everything underneath might;
although the skin won't dent or ding, it will rip and tear.
</P>
<P>
   Oh well, at least there's no harm in that one.

REDEFINING RADIO
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVID BLOOM  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ After the FCC nearly found her 40-watt pirate
radio station last summer _ which would have resulted in a fine of
as much as $100,000 a day _ proprietor Paige Jarrett shut down
temporarily to find a better, or at least more discreet, way to run
a broadcasting operation without a federal license.
</P>
<P>
   So when KBLT-FM in Silver Lake starts operating again, Jarrett
plans to make it a ``cybercast'' over the Internet, where the
Federal Communications Commission won't try to put her out of
business.
</P>
<P>
   Jarrett and her dozens of volunteer disc jockeys play everything
from the '60s French pop she loves to classic country to
drum-and-bass to Delta blues to rockabilly, in a labor of love paid
for basically out of her not-so-deep pockets.
</P>
<P>
   That all-over-the-map approach is perfect for the Internet,
where the far-flung fans of those genres can find someone playing
music they love.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to keep the purity of micro radio and apply it to the
Net,'' said Jarrett, a pseudonym she uses on the air. She asked
that her real name not be used.
</P>
<P>
   Though she is concerned about the additional cost of being on
the Net, and some of her DJs prefer the exclusivity of
micro-broadcasting, being able to be heard and be legal is an
attractive proposition, Jarrett said.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet is increasingly a home for radio stations around
the world that want to reach local fans who've moved somewhere
else, and make new ones in places their broadcasts could never
reach over the air.
</P>
<P>
   The number of on-air radio stations now online has skyrocketed
in the past year from fewer than 100 to nearly 2,000, according to
one recent estimate.
</P>
<P>
   And the Internet is spawning its own kind of ``radio,'' with
Net-only music sites that provide all the great stuff of radio
without poor reception, endless ads or music you're not much
interested in.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet also is fast becoming a place to get audio and even
video of live performances, giving fans a front-row seat without
having to travel halfway across the country for a show.
</P>
<P>
   The secret is computer software that ``streams'' a highly
compressed audio signal over the Internet, initially storing
several seconds of audio in a buffer, then downloading more as it
begins playing. That tactic smooths out the hiccups in transmission
that could otherwise interrupt a cybercast.
</P>
<P>
   Sound quality depends on a listener's computer audio system and
Internet connection, but normally at least rivals FM broadcasts.
</P>
<P>
   But the biggest benefit of Net radio is having a choice of tunes
that no radio market, let alone single radio station, could offer.
</P>
<P>
   You can listen to BBC Radio 1 in London, or an Indonesian
station, or the best techno music in Moscow. You can check out
people's opinions on a talk station in Atlanta, or a sports station
in Chicago. And you can dial up a site such as the Internet-only
Spinner.com, whose 104 formats include such narrow slices of music
as baroque or Celtic music or '70s dance hits.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a lot of things over radio,'' said Scott Epstein,
Spinner.com's vice president for marketing and content in
Burlingame, Calif. ``You get a specific kind of music, and very few
interruptions. We have some audio advertising, with four 15-second
breaks per hour, vs. up to 22 minutes of advertising (per hour)
over the air.''
</P>
<P>
   The medium is perfect for public radio stations, whose mandate
is to give away music and information.
</P>
<P>
   At KCRW-FM, the Santa Monica public radio powerhouse, the Web
site archives hundreds of hours of live performances by top artists
who have appeared on ``Morning Becomes Eclectic'' and ``Cafe
L.A.,'' said Josh Berman, the station's Webmaster.
</P>
<P>
   And if you want to hear KCRW's highly regarded public affairs
and arts programming, such as Warren Olney's ``Which Way L.A.?''
and Sandra Tsing Loh's ``The Loh Life,'' it's there, too, Berman
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Web site also features a music-only audio stream of music
played by the station's influential DJs, running even when the
public-affairs programs are on air.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been hugely popular,'' Berman said. ``Oh, gosh, I get
e-mail from everywhere, mostly Angelenos who've moved somewhere
else, but also people from other parts of the world. We're even
getting people who subscribe (because they listen) online.''
</P>
<P>
   There are an increasing number of outlets offering live
performances as well, such as the House of Blues, whose Web site
features concerts, interviews and other delights from its six clubs
and other venues three nights a week. The 2{-year-old site also
makes new albums available for listening the week before their
release.
</P>
<P>
   ``The traffic has tripled each year,'' said Phil Fracassi, vice
president of programming for the company's new media division.
``It's now a viable medium. I'm really jazzed by it.''
</P>
<P>
   The company is building digital production studios in all its
clubs, so it can take advantage of coming high-speed connections
such as cable modems, offering live performances in people's homes
nightly in the future, Fracassi said.
</P>
<P>
   Even labels are taking advantage of the opportunities, among
them Atlantic Records, which just opened a online studio as part of
its Web site.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, in Atlantic's just-opened Digital Arena Studio as
well as on SonicNet's Station Website, singer Duncan Sheik will
take questions from the audience, play an acoustic set and offer
tracks from his second album, to be released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet radio boom promises to change even, or especially,
the small fry such as Jarrett's pirate operation who can reach out,
legally, in ways never before possible.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Jarrett acknowledges with a grin,``There's also something
appealing about broadcasting when you're not supposed to.''

LAWMAKERS LOOK TO WATERGATE CASE FOR IMPEACHMENT GUIDANCE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For Release Sunday, Oct. 4)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN FREEDMAN  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For the first time since the Watergate scandal 24
years ago, the House Judiciary Committee is expected to vote this
week for an impeachment inquiry against a sitting president.
</P>
<P>
   Such an investigation of President Clinton would explore whether
he committed ``high crimes and misdemeanors,'' as the Constitution
vaguely defines impeachable offenses.
</P>
<P>
   When the committee wrestled in 1974 with the definition of
impeachable offenses when it investigated President Richard M.
Nixon, the committee relied on a staff report, ``Constitutional
Grounds for Presidential Impeachment,'' _ for help in deciding
whether Nixon's conduct amounted to a high crime and misdemeanor.
</P>
<P>
   Now, 24 years later, that report gives some ammunition to both
Republicans who want vigorous pursuit of Clinton for his conduct in
the sex scandal, and Democrats who argue that sexual peccadillos
and ensuing fallout are not enough.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans will note with approval that the 1974 report
concluded that the thrust of past impeachment proceedings ``has
been on the significant effects of the conduct _ undermining the
integrity of office ... arrogation of power, abuse of the
governmental process, adverse impact on the system of government.''
</P>
<P>
   That sounds a little like what Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott
was talking about last week when he said that ``bad conduct is
enough'' for impeachment if it brings ``disrepute on the office''
of the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   It also echoes Republican charges that evidence of criminal
wrongdoing by a president automatically is fair game for an
impeachment inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't think that this is a matter that can simply be swept
under the rug,'' Rep. Charles Canady, R-Fla., a Judiciary member,
told reporters last week. ``There are very serious questions here
concerning whether the president of the United States committed
perjury before a grand jury ... and engaged in conduct amounting to
the obstruction of justice.''
</P>
<P>
   But Democrats will be able to take heart from phrases like this:
</P>
<P>
   ``The crucial factor is not on the intrinsic quality of the
behavior but the significance of its effect upon our constitutional
system or the functioning of our government.''
</P>
<P>
   Or this: ``Because impeachment of a president is a grave step
for the nation, it is to be predicated only upon conduct seriously
incompatible with either the constitutional form and principles of
our government, or the proper performance of constitutional duties
of the presidential office.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., chairman of the House Judiciary
Committee, has promised a hearing sometime in the future on what
constitutes an impeachable offense, leaving it up to individual
House members to apply a definition to the charges of perjury,
subornation of perjury and obstruction of justice that independent
counsel Kenneth Starr has lodged against Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the full House is expected to go along with the
committee and authorize an impeachment investigation before
adjourning Friday to go home and campaign for the Nov. 3 election.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Zoe Lofgren, D-Calif., a Judiciary Committee member who
worked as an aide to then-Rep. Don Edwards, D-Calif., during
Watergate, said the 1974 report and the scholarly texts underlying
it are clear: Impeachment is for conduct that threatens to sabotage
the workings of government.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a remedy for a worst-case situation where you have (a
president) engaged in a course of conduct that is going to destroy
the constitutional form of government,'' she said. ``You can't wait
for the next election. You have to do something or the whole system
could be destroyed before the next election.''
</P>
<P>
   Does Clinton's conduct in the Monica Lewinsky sex scandal,
including criminal allegations of perjury, subornation of perjury
and obstruction of justice, rise to that level?
</P>
<P>
   As a Judiciary Committee member who will be called on to render
that judgment this week, Lofgren wouldn't say. But she left little
doubt that in her mind, Clinton's conduct does not come close.
</P>
<P>
   ``If allegations (against Clinton) could later be proven to be
accurate, could they destroy the constitutional form of
government?'' she said. ``Not all misbehavior rises to that level
... The criminal law is to punish the wrongdoer. Impeachment is to
save the country.''
</P>
<P>
   The 1974 report, she said, ``was accepted at the time by both
Democrats and Republicans. The only argument was not whether (the
offenses) had to destroy the government, but the Republicans argued
in addition to destroying the government it had also to be a
criminal law offense.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats, she added, argued that severe damage to the
government was the test, regardless of whether the president's
actions were legal violations. ``I think that's the better view,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   She cited the Judiciary Committee's work in 1974 in voting three
articles of impeachment against Nixon. The articles accused Nixon
of obstructing justice, abuse of power and contempt of Congress _
all stemming from the 1972 White House-directed burglary of the
Watergate offices of the Democratic National Committee.
</P>
<P>
   But the committee rejected an impeachment article accusing Nixon
of cheating on his taxes. ``It's a felony, but did it destroy the
constitutional form of government?''
</P>
<P>
   However, Rep. Lamar Smith, R-Texas, also a Judiciary member,
said any violation of the presidential oath to ``faithfully execute
the office of the president'' and ``preserve, protect and defend
the Constitution'' represents possible grounds for impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question is whether the president is treating the oath of
office seriously,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Smith would not say how he'd vote on the inquiry resolution.
</P>
<P>
   Putting the tax case against Nixon aside was easy in 1974
because the Judiciary Committee already had decided what the
standard for impeachment would be, said two Democratic committee
members at the time, Robert Drinan and Wayne Owens, writing in the
New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without such standards, the impeachment process could become a
partisan free-for-all,'' they wrote. ``If (the current Judiciary)
panel applies the standard that emerged in 1974, it will decide
that the charges against Mr. Clinton do not fall under the articles
of impeachment.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith noted that ``no one has been able to come up with a
10-word definition of what an impeachable crime is.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What we can do is look at the facts, look at the evidence, and
determine in totality whether it meets a very high threshold,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   With ambiguous language in the Constitution to guide them, House
members weighing Clinton's fate might fall back on the definition
of an impeachable offense articulated in 1970 by then-House
Republican Leader Gerald R. Ford.
</P>
<P>
   An impeachable offense, Ford said, was ``whatever a majority of
the House of Representatives considers it to be at a given moment
in history.''

HATCH PREDICTS HOUSE WILL IMPEACH BUT SENATE WON'T CONVICT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service Clients.)  
 By JUDY HOLLAND  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sen. Orrin G. Hatch, R-Utah, predicted Friday that
the House will vote to impeach President Clinton but said it's
unlikely the Senate would convict the president and remove him from
office.
</P>
<P>
   Hatch, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said he
doesn't know of any Democratic senators who would vote to remove
Clinton from office.
</P>
<P>
   ``As I view it, I believe the House is going to have an
impeachment inquiry and the odds are they will vote up articles of
impeachment and send it to the Senate,'' Hatch told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can you name one Democrat in the Senate who will vote for
impeachment at this point?'' Hatch asked. ``I don't know of one.''
</P>
<P>
   To convict an impeached official, two-thirds of the Senate _ 67
senators _ would have to vote to convict, according to the
Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate now is composed of 55 Republicans and 45 Democrats.
Assuming all 55 Republicans in the Senate voted to convict Clinton,
the GOP majority would need 12 Democratic votes to reach the
necessary 67 votes. However, this lineup could change as the result
of the Nov. 3 elections when 34 Senate seats are up, including 15
Democrats, 14 Republicans and five open seats.
</P>
<P>
   The new Congress takes over in January and any action on
impeachment would come after that.
</P>
<P>
   Hatch commented just before the House released an additional
4,800 pages of grand jury testimony and other documents in a
three-volume set from independent counsel Kenneth W. Starr's
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Starr previous charged Clinton with perjury, obstruction of
justice, witness tampering and abuse of power in connection with
the coverup of his sexual relationship with former White House
intern Monica Lewinsky
</P>
<P>
   Hatch said if members of Congress ``take the totality of the
evidence,'' it will meet the constitutional impeachment standard of
``high crimes and misdemeanors,'' adding that he favors broadening
the scope of the inquiry beyond the Lewinsky matter.
</P>
<P>
   Hatch said he has accepted Clinton's apology for lying to the
public about his relationship with Lewinsky, ``but I'm concerned he
may just be saying the things he thinks people want to hear.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe in redemption,'' Hatch said. ``I believe people can
overcome their faults. Naturally, my heart would like to see him
make it through this. But, he added, ``In totality, there's room to
impeach here.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Hatch cautioned that Congress must consider ``what's in
the best interest of the American people.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that he doesn't think Clinton ``is the most savory
person who has ever been in the presidency, but I don't think he's
the issue here. It's what is in the best interest of the American
presidency.''
</P>
<P>
   Hatch also questioned the constitutionality of a censure or
other sanction less than impeachment. One non-impeachment penalty
getting attention is known as ``censure plus,'' in which the
president would be censured by Congress and then required to pay a
monetary penalty to reimburse a portion of Starr's investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Hatch criticized Clinton for splitting semantic hairs during his
grand jury testimony when he claimed his relationship with Lewinsky
didn't fit a legal definition of sexual relations, saying the
president portrayed it as if Lewinsky was having sex with him, but
he wasn't having sex with her.
</P>
<P>
   ``That seems pretty miraculous to me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   When asked what would happen to the presidency if the House
votes to impeach but the Senate does convict, Hatch replied,
``Clinton's presidency is damaged no matter what... He has sullied
the office of the president.''
</P>
<P>
   ``His presidency, though it is not over, is badly damaged,''
Hatch said. ``Frankly, he doesn't have a lot of credibility on
Capitol Hill.''
</P>
<P>
   Hatch said he expects the House's impeachment inquiry to take
``one to two months at least,'' but added, ``there is some
indication the administration will pull every procedural delay they
can'' to keep the impeachment process going as long as two years,
or until Clinton finishes his term.

WHAT KIND OF A GRANDPARENT ARE YOU?
</HEADLINE>
 
 EDS.: Corrects the credit line at bottom of take)  By RUTH K. WESTHEIMER AND STEVEN KAPLAN 
 c.1998 Ruth K. Westheimer and Steven Kaplan 
 World rights 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Of all the roles in the nuclear and extended family, none is as
loosely defined as that of the grandparent.
</P>
<P>
   No single dominant model exists of what a grandparent is
supposed to do and how a grandparent is supposed to act. Many
grandparents, especially first-timers, are often left unsure of
what is expected of them and how best to fill their role.
</P>
<P>
   In choosing a grandparenting style, it is probably most
important to ask yourself some key questions:
</P>
<P>
   _ What kinds of things do I enjoy doing?
</P>
<P>
   _ What special skills do I have? How much time do I have
available and how much do I want to spend grandparenting?
</P>
<P>
   _ What are my children's and grandchildren's needs?
</P>
<P>
   _ What religious and ethnic traditions do I want to pass on to
my grandchildren?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Some Basic Styles &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, scholars have made numerous attempts to classify
the different types of grandparents. There is no widespread
agreement on the best way to make the division. One attempt that
I've found very interesting was proposed by Berniece Neugarten and
Karol Weinstein in their now-classic 1964 article, ``The Changing
American Grandparent.'' Based on interviews with grandparents, they
were able to identify five basic styles:
</P>
<P>
   _Fun-seeking
</P>
<P>
   _ Formal
</P>
<P>
   _ Distant
</P>
<P>
   _ Reservoirs of family wisdom
</P>
<P>
   _ Surrogate parents
</P>
<P>
   Many grandparents combine elements of each of these types, and
some more recent studies have tried to reflect this complexity. You
may find that your grandparenting style changes over time as your
circumstances change and your grandchildren grow. So take the
models that follow as general guides, not as goals to be achieved.
</P>
<P>
   The fun-seeking (or what some have called companionate)
grandparent's relationship to his grandchildren is marked
especially by informality and playfulness. He joins the child in
specific activities with the express purpose of having fun, almost
as if he were a playmate. The emphasis here is on mutual
satisfaction rather than on providing treats for the grandchild.
</P>
<P>
   Neugarten and Weinstein found this to be the most common
grandparenting style among those under 65. Although they believe
this changes as the grandparents themselves grow older, others
suggest that the changes in style reflect changes in the age of the
grandchildren. It's just a lot harder to have this kind of
relationship with a teen-ager than it is with a baby or small
child.
</P>
<P>
   Fun-seeking grandparents are most interested in their
grandchildren's friendships, how they get along with other
children, and whether they are considerate of others.
</P>
<P>
   One of the things that makes this style particularly interesting
is that we find little evidence that it existed as a grandparenting
style until comparatively recently. Very few grandparents
interviewed in the 1960s and 1970s remembered their own
grandparents as playful. Nor does this fun-seeking grandparent
appear prominently in many traditional cultures. In short, it seems
to be a modern invention.
</P>
<P>
   Formal grandparents are those who follow what they regard as the
proper and traditionally prescribed role for grandparents. Although
they like to provide special treats and indulgences for their
grandchildren and may occasionally provide minor assistance to the
parents such as baby-sitting, they make sure there is a clear
difference between parenting and grandparenting.
</P>
<P>
   They leave parenting strictly to the parents. They are very
interested in the grandchild, but are careful not to offer advice
on childrearing. Neugarten and Weinstein found this to be the most
common style among grandparents over age 65. It seems to be a style
more appropriate to older grandchildren than the fun-seeking style.
</P>
<P>
   It is not surprising that formal grandparents have the same
expectations of ``proper'' behavior from their grandchildren as
they have for themselves. They put an emphasis on good manners,
neatness and cleanliness and self-control.
</P>
<P>
   The distant grandparent emerges from the shadows on holidays and
on special occasions such as graduations and birthdays. Unlike the
formal grandparent, the distant grandparent's contact with his
grandchild is fleeting and infrequent. This grandparent is
benevolent in stance but essentially distant and remote.
</P>
<P>
   Although distant grandparents are often those who live at a
great distance, researchers agree: geography is not destiny! It is,
to be sure, much easier to maintain a close relationship if you
live nearby, but there are lots of ways to keep in touch and
up-to-date even if you live far away. There are plenty of
grandparents who live within a few miles of their grandchildren but
have adopted a distant style.
</P>
<P>
   The reservoir of family wisdom represents a distantly
authoritarian relationship in which the grandparent -- almost
always the grandfather -- is the dispenser of special skills or
resources. Lines of authority are distinct, and the young parents
maintain and emphasize their subordinate position -- sometimes
without resentment. These grandparents put an emphasis on such
virtues as honesty, common sense and responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   A number of years ago, I spent a Fourth of July weekend with a
family whose grandfather exemplified this role. During the course
of the weekend, his wife, acting as a sort of appointments
secretary, made sure that each of his three daughters, their
husbands, and all of his more than a dozen grandchildren had time
to talk with him alone. He updated himself on everyone's activities
and usually concluded each conversation with a statement of
approval or disapproval, a recommendation regarding the future and,
when relevant, the name of a friend or acquaintance who might be of
some help.
</P>
<P>
   Some grandparents find themselves in the role of surrogate
parents. This style of grandparenting appears almost exclusively
among women. It usually occurs in situations when the young mother
works and the grandmother assumes the actual caretaking
responsibility for the child.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Department of Commerce, 62 percent of
preschoolers in poor families are cared for by relatives while
their mothers work. In 1996, more than 1.9 million children were
living with their mothers in the homes of their grandparents.
</P>
<P>
   It is not surprising that this type of grandparent holds
expectations that are very similar to those of many parents: try
hard, obey your elders, be a good student. As the name indicates,
the line between parenting and grandparenting is blurred in these
cases, with little or no formal separation of responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
   In a world of runaway change, grandparents have a vital role to
play in providing security and consistency. This doesn't mean that
you can't continue to grow and change. It does mean, however, that
whatever changes take place in your life, your grandchildren always
know they can depend on you.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Your Own Role &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The roles discussed in this chapter are only a sampling of the
special positions you may have in the lives of your grandchildren.
Each of your grandchildren is different and their needs may vary.
However much you may have enjoyed being the confidant of one, do
not let that get in the way of teaching another valuable lessons or
giving another a sense of the richness of her family's history.
</P>
<P>
   Remember that it is always you who defines the role you play,
based on the circumstances and the type of relationship you have
with each grandchild and his parents. Don't let yourself get
typecast into one particular position. Be ready to grow, change,
and explore.

TWO DAUGHTERS: AN ADVENTURE NEVERENDING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GRACIE BONDS STAPLES 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Even when it's just across the hall, traveling with my daughters
is always an adventure.
</P>
<P>
   Take Jamila's move a few months ago from the room she had shared
with her sister, Asha.
</P>
<P>
   The argument for this move went something like this: ``Asha is a
pig.''
</P>
<P>
   At the time, not knowing exactly why their room never measured
up to my standard of cleanliness, I trusted Jamila to know what she
was talking about. I'm always struck by her sensitivity, her
discerning spirit, her honesty.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mommy, button your blouse,'' she told me one day recently.
``You're showing your cleavage.''
</P>
<P>
   Secretly impressed that she thought I had cleavage, I
immediately turned to the mirror to see what she might be seeing. I
didn't see cleavage, but I trust Jamila. At 9, she's smarter than I
ever was.
</P>
<P>
   But about the room.
</P>
<P>
   Jamila moves in and transforms it into some menagerie of stuffed
animals and Barbie dolls. She says she's happy, but keeps
complaining that the television should have moved with her. After
all, she argues, ``I was here first.'' I guess she considers the TV
her birthright.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, she thinks the room has too much of a grown-up feel
about it. Says she wants to trade the plain white bedding, for
instance, for something like Winnie-the-Pooh, something for a kid.
</P>
<P>
   I'm confused, because she has never wanted to be referred to or
treated as such. I still remember her tearful plea at age 6 to stop
treating her like a kid because she was ``almost a grown-up.'' Just
this past Saturday, she told me that she couldn't possibly watch
another cartoon with her sister because ``those are for kids. I'm
in the fourth grade.''
</P>
<P>
   Go figure. But about the room.
</P>
<P>
   Jamila moves out, and I think this smacks of betrayal. I wonder
if my little girls are growing apart, or if one of them is just
growing up.
</P>
<P>
   I am at a loss to explain the often-complex relationship between
sisters. It changes as often as their clothing sizes. As far as I
can tell, the only thing that hasn't changed between my daughters
in the past seven years is this: When one of them faces discipline,
they fall into each other's arms and cry. Just like always.
</P>
<P>
   I watch them, and I think, how can this be? Asha is like the
color red. Jamila is a pastel pink. Asha is athletic. Jamila is
strictly a girl, like me. The only competition she's interested in
is counting 100s to see who has the most. I'm counting the days
till I can keep them out of my bubble bath, my clothing, my
perfume. Meanwhile, I've been reduced to scrounging for samples. Of
course, as long as I can find chocolate, I figure it's a wonderful
life.
</P>
<P>
   But about the room.
</P>
<P>
   I wonder if I give in to this Winnie-the-Pooh motif, if she'll
then ask for new furniture. I wonder if I hold out, whether she
will cave in and go back across the hall. I wonder if I've already
yielded too much.
</P>
<P>
   Then, as I often do when the house is still and dark, I walk
down the hall to check on my sleeping babies and notice an enormous
snoring session going on across from Jamila's room.
</P>
<P>
   There they are _ together _ fast asleep in the middle of the
floor. I stand there for a moment, relishing the crazy distance
we've traveled. Anticipating future journeys, I whisper this
passage from the book of Isaiah: ``The Lord will guide you always
... you will be like a well-watered garden, like a spring whose
waters never fail.'' I turn and walk back to my bed, looking
forward to tomorrow and the next adventure with my daughters.

LITTLE UNDERSTOOD, CROWS AMONG NATURE'S MOST INTELLIGENT ANIMALS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By VICKI CROKE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The phrase ``stupid birds!'' may spring to mind when you first
hear those loud, scolding caws at sunup.
</P>
<P>
   But nothing could be further from the truth.
</P>
<P>
   Crows, surprisingly classified as songbirds, are among the most
intelligent birds.
</P>
<P>
   And we are approaching the best time of year to appreciate them,
as they gather by the thousands in fall and winter nighttime
roosting areas.
</P>
<P>
   The crow family is found in most of the world and its numbers
are on the rise. Yet crows remain poorly understood and little
studied.
</P>
<P>
   Still, anyone who has been reprimanded by an enraged
neighborhood crow for putting a lid on a trash can knows that they
have plenty of personality. And those who have had close encounters
with canny crows have remarkable stories to tell.
</P>
<P>
   Jean Craighead George, the Newbery Medal-winning author of such
children's books as ``My Side of the Mountain'' and ``Julie of the
Wolves,'' has lived with crows as pets. (That is illegal now.)
</P>
<P>
   Take Crowbar, one of George's favorites. Her children found him
on the ground, a naked, orphaned nestling. He was soon a member of
the family, gobbling down scrambled eggs at the breakfast table and
dropping to the ground to walk the kids to the school bus stop. He
could mimic George's voice and shout ``Hello!'' from treetops. He
even figured out a way to join the kids on the slide, using a
coffee can lid like a surfboard.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Mertz, director of the New England Wildlife Center in
Hingham, Mass., treats about 60 crows a year _ mostly nestlings
tossed out of trees being trimmed or adult birds hit by cars. What
impresses Mertz is how determined these birds are to escape. ``You
can wrap up a red-tailed hawk with its face covered, and it will
just lie there,'' Mertz says. But a crow similarly bound ``will
take about 17 seconds before it's figured out how to get out of the
wrapper.''
</P>
<P>
   Kevin McGowan, curator of the ornithology and mammalogy
collections at Cornell University, has studied American crows
around Ithaca, N.Y., for the past decade, tagging about 750 birds
out of a population of about 125,000. McGowan is skeptical about
the way we define intelligence in animals but nonetheless finds his
study species astonishing.
</P>
<P>
   In laboratory tests of ``reversing habit'' behaviors _ the
pellets suddenly stop coming from the green lever and will come
only from the red, for example _ crows score as high as monkeys in
figuring out the switch.
</P>
<P>
   Crows are omnivores and opportunists. They live in large
extended families in which, often, several generations of crow kids
help out around the nest of the breeding parents (a rare behavior
for birds and, come to think of it, for humans, too).
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes offspring will leave for weeks or months or even a
year and be recognized and welcomed on their return. (Many of us
have been recognized upon returning to the nest but not necessarily
welcomed.) Unlike most other birds, a 7-year-old crow might still
be hanging around the nest. As with many intelligent species, crows
have a fairly long lifespan and a long time in childhood to learn.
The oldest wild crow known was 30 (a crow crone?), and the average
crow usually lives to age 13.
</P>
<P>
   Like us, it appears crows began moving to the suburbs and cities
in the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   They mate for life, or as scientists prefer to say, they form
``long-term pair bonds,'' with recent cases of crow divorce being
reported from a researcher in _ where else? _ California.
</P>
<P>
   Crows have a huge vocabulary and varied vocalizations. They seem
to enjoy play, and young crows have been observed chasing each
other with feathers.
</P>
<P>
   So, if crows are so much like us, why have we hated them? They
have been known to be agricultural pests, though their negative
impact is now believed minimal, while we are just discovering some
of the positive things they do for farmers, ecologically. They are
loud. On the ground, a crow has the menacing gait of _ as author
Thomas McNamee described another bird _ a ``bar bully.'' They
scatter our trash. They eat the nestlings of cuter birds. They
appear dressed for a funeral. And they have been known to feed on
corpses.
</P>
<P>
   But as we are finally getting to know them, their image is
changing. What does researcher McGowan see when he looks at a crow?
``I see a big, beautiful, intelligent, and fascinating bird,'' he
says.
</P>
<P>
   We have mostly American crows around here, with a few of the
smaller fish crows. Ravens, estimated to be four times the size of
crows, are making a comeback, with some in Western Mass. and very
few east of Worcester. McGowan says crows and ravens are as
different as lions and leopards.
</P>
<P>
   Though it's amazing to see thousands of the black birds filling
the sky as they gather to roost evenings from October to February,
there is good crow viewing in your own backyard too.
</P>
<P>
   Crow families have territories, so your neighborhood crows
really are your crows. If you want to befriend these birds, you
can. Though they all look alike to us, crows can distinguish
individual humans, even out of context.
</P>
<P>
   McGowan says you can toss some peanuts to the ground when you
see the crows _ don't look directly at them or throw the nuts at
them. In time, the crows will know you and greet you.
</P>
<P>
   And then you may have stories such as the one Jean George tells
about Crowbar. The bird was stealing milk money from school kids
and hiding it. She happened to discover one day that he was
depositing the coins in the drainpipe of the building next door.
Which just happened to be a bank. Coincidence?

TEN MORE `SLEEPERS' FROM AN OLD-CAR GURU 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN R. WHITE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Every year, the resident old-car guru of Hemmings Motor news and
the magazine Special Interest Autos, Dave Brownell, offers his list
of ``sleepers,'' a compendium of 10 models of the past likely to
become valued collectibles of the future.
</P>
<P>
   The Brownell ``Prospectus of 10'' is offered up as part of the
annual Hemmings Press Day festivities, in which members of the
motor press are briefed on the state of the old-car hobby, the
current condition and lastest activities of the Hemmings publishing
empire, the latest cause of its socially aware publisher, Terry
Ehrich, and then given the opportunity to drive old cars. Driving
the ancient vehicles in the Hemmings fleet gives rise to
conflicting thoughts; it is good to revisit the technology of
yesteryear so as to appreciate more the technology of today (and
the endurance and strength of yesteryear's drivers), to admire
these grand old cars and trucks _ but why would a sane man want to
own and drive them if he didn't have to do it?
</P>
<P>
   It is a question answered by the vagaries and illogic of
hobbyists. Why do anything difficult? For enjoyment, for the
camaraderie of fellow sufferers, notoriety, or just for the sheer
pleasure of doing it. The larger question for the writer, however,
is why do I want to publish the latest predictions of this rascally
seer of old car values when all it will serve to do is drive up the
price of still another old car I'd like to own?
</P>
<P>
   Brownell, after all, is the expert who predicted that the
Volkswagen Beetle would become a collectible, thereby bumping up
the price of the car I was haggling to own and killing the deal.
Then came the ``new'' Beetle and a rush to the old Beetle.
</P>
<P>
   Now the man is doing it again, predicting this year that the
1951-'52 Chevrolet Bel Air convertibles and hardtops will be seeing
``upward potential.'' Collectors crave the cars of their youth _
you can't get the youth back, but at least you can have the car.
This is a car of my youth, that I couldn't afford then and still
can't find enough spare change to own. The closest I came to owning
one was buying a new bumper for a nifty yellow '51 ragtop _ because
I hit it with my rusty '47 Buick.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble with Brownell's predictions is that they are too
good, too frequently come to be realized; he has considerably more
hits than misses and reminded us painfully of that by documenting
the rise in price of several old memories of youth.
</P>
<P>
   Well, in the interest of fair play and truth in journalism,
here's the Brownell list for this year.
</P>
<P>
   He leads the list with a curious selection, the  &UR; Willys station
wagon  &LR; built from 1949 into the early '60s. Rugged with 4-wheel
drive, they were the first all-steel station wagons _ or were they
the original SUVs? Available, Brownell says, for between $1,600 to
$2,500, an odd collectible available for an agreeable price.
</P>
<P>
   The  &UR; '51-'52 Bel Airs, &LR;  he reminds us, are pleasing cars to look
at, pleasing to drive, and the ``simple, straight-forward
mechanicals make them easy to and economical to restore and
maintain.'' An ideal ``starter'' for the new hobbyist, he says.
</P>
<P>
   Another of my youthful ``likes'' _ certainly not a passion _
that Brownell sees as a comer is the &UR; 1953-'54 Plymouths,  &LR; cars that
had ``disappointing sales when new'' but offer pleasing compact
design with a tough chassis and engine, Brownell says.
</P>
<P>
   A ``nearly forgottten'' compact of the '60s, the &UR; '64-'67 Mercury
Comet Caliente &LR;  in hardtop or convertible is next on the Brownell
list. Derived from a Ford Falcon, these distinctive cars were
available with either I-6 or V-8 engines and are quite rare today,
but fairly cheap, Brownell says, commenting that Hemmings listed
one as ``rust-free'' for $1,600.
</P>
<P>
   Next is the  &UR; '67-'69 Cougar &LR;  in hardtop or convertible style.
Essentially, these are upscale Mustangs, he reminds us, but have
not achieved the inflated values of their Ford siblings. Recent ads
for a rust-free '67 XR-7 with a 289 CID V-8 in storage asked
$2,900. Probably gone by now, and after Brownell's list gets
around, never to be seen again. Thanks, Dave, for ruining another
dream.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Alfa-Romeo 1966-'69 Duetto Spyders &LR;  are next on his tout list _
no dream of this writer's. Admitting they are ``prone to rust'' and
``mechanically temperamental'' (an understatement), Brownell sees
them in a favorable light for good looks, available parts, and club
support.
</P>
<P>
   The  &UR; 1969-'76 Triumph TR-6 &LR;  makes the list for ``performance,
appearance, and attractive current price levels.'' Why these cars
haven't become warmer in the market is a mystery, since British
sports cars, no matter how troublesome or rust prone, seem to be
coveted by collectors and hobbyists.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Buick 1968-'70 GS400 &LR;  hardtops and convertibles, ``solid and
well engineered'' cars in Brownell's words, are next up and, with
their Wildcat 400 CID engines and Burst three-speed shifters, are
desirable cars. Figure to pay $6,000, he says _ until the owners
read this stuff.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously looking to put some humor into his Top Ten List,
Brownell finishes with the  &UR; Pontiac Fiero &LR; , ``one of the most
innovative cars to come out of General Motors.''  &UR;  &LR; He admits to
``initial quality problems'' _ a euphemism for a fire-prone car _
and tells us these mid-engined, plastic-skinned cars matured into
``quick, great-handling two-seaters.''
</P>
<P>
   That's got to be the punch line. Plastic they were; quick they
were not. The six-cylinder version was a maintenance monster; the
four-cylinder versions were lead sleds with decent handling.
Although the skin won't rust, most everything underneath might;
although the skin won't dent or ding, it will rip and tear.
</P>
<P>
   Oh well, at least there's no harm in that one.
</P>

SPANISH-LANGUAGE SOAP OPERAS BUBBLE TO THE TOP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DIANE SMITH 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   EULESS, Texas _ As the rain pours down on an exotic Mexican
town, dark-haired Dona Leonarda Ruan slips out her window to pledge
her undying love to a mysterious man. The man melts into her
embrace as the fantasy world of the ``telenovela'' ends.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pueblo Chico, Infierno Grande'' is interrupted by a commercial
and the reality that exists in Guadalupe Vasquez's tiny living
room.
</P>
<P>
   ``She gets on my nerves. She can't choose who she loves,''
Jessica Rios says.
</P>
<P>
   On weeknights from 7 to 9, there is an open-door policy in
Vasquez's Euless apartment so Rios and other neighbors can join her
ritual of watching ``telenovelas,'' Spanish-language soap operas.
</P>
<P>
   These soap operas are romantic, some say decadent, filled with
stereotypical characters and well-worn plots. But for the
predominantly female audience, the shows are a vital bridge to
Spanish heritage, helping them to overcome the isolation of U.S.
language and cultural barriers, researchers say.
</P>
<P>
   But the shows' appeal reaches beyond Hispanic women. Entire
families and native English speakers also tune in, according to
researchers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are very well put together,'' said Amanda Irwin, a
foreign-language professor at Rhodes College in Memphis, Tenn.
``Some are historically based, so you can learn from them.''
</P>
<P>
   The popularity of these racy shows, made in countries such as
Mexico or Venezuela, is growing.
</P>
<P>
   Inside Vasquez's living room, the television's golden glow
dances across the walls as the Spanish-speaking friends compare
``telenovela'' notes.
</P>
<P>
   Vasquez and her friends follow actors who made names for
themselves in the ``telenovelas'' _ from the Mexican star Thalia to
Erik Estrada, who re-emerged on Mexican television years after
``C.H.I.P.s.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike U.S. soap operas such as ``Days of Our Lives,'' the
``telenovelas'' conclude after several months, often with
Cinderellalike endings. Some scenes are sexy, others violent. In
``Leonella,'' the heroine is sexually assaulted.
</P>
<P>
   But costumes, hairstyles and settings are also important
nuances. Sometimes a heroine becomes the focus of intimate
controversies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see how they suffer,'' Vasquez said. ``We know it's always
going to end up the same way: The heroine always finds her love.
They always end up getting married.''
</P>
<P>
   There is some debate over whether these stories celebrate
Spanish heritage or denigrate it. Some critics say ``telenovelas''
are immoral.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole family sits down and watches these soaps, and the
themes are really decadent,'' said Acela Hernandez Paliotta, the
Hurst-Euless-Bedford district coordinator for English as a second
language/bilingual/foreign language programs. She became concerned
when her students identified with ``telenovela'' characters.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is never really good moral values in the novelas,''
Paliotta said. ``There is usually lots of greed and women fighting
for men.''
</P>
<P>
   Researchers counter that ``telenovelas'' enable Hispanic viewers
to see their roots portrayed on television. Popular Hispanic
holidays and images of the Virgin of Guadalupe often appear and are
a reaffirmation of culture and customs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you look past the common type of attraction _ like junk
food for the mind or something that should be dismissed _ you begin
to see how complex they are,'' said Denise D. Bielby, a professor
at the University of California-Santa Barbara. ``It really takes
being willing to move beyond the stereotypes about television and
the purpose in people's lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Bielby, who teaches sociology, has done extensive research on
English soaps and is taking a closer look at the Spanish ones with
Vivian Barrera, a graduate student.
</P>
<P>
   Barrera found that many viewers understand or speak English but
prefer to watch the Spanish-language ``telenovelas'' to maintain a
connection to their heritage.
</P>
<P>
   ``The women were looking for dark-haired and dark-eyed women
they identified with,'' said Barrera, referring to her research.
``They were looking for the strong female characters.''

UFO INVESTIGATOR FINDS LITTLE HELP FROM SCIENTISTS 
 
(FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, OCT. 3) 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By TODD ACKERMAN 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When John Schuessler was investigating UFO reports in and around
Houston, he always knew he could count on one thing.
</P>
<P>
   He'd get little help from local scientists.
</P>
<P>
   Needing answers about, say, the physiological effects of
radiation or the physics of unusual occurrences, the aerospace
engineer would have to turn to experts in other cities.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd think that in the nation's space center there'd be no
shortage of interest,'' says Schuessler. ``But as soon as I
mentioned my questions concerned a UFO sighting, scientists didn't
want to talk to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Schuessler hopes that is about to change. This summer, in the
first scientific review of UFO phenomena since 1970, a panel of
scientists concluded that some sightings are accompanied by
physical evidence so strong they deserve scientific study.
</P>
<P>
   The story made front-page headlines around the nation. To the
intelligentsia, after all, UFOs have long been the stuff of
tabloids and the lunatic fringe, liable to culminate in mass
suicides like Heaven's Gate, better illuminated by ``The X-Files''
than serious scientists.
</P>
<P>
   The 50-page report, funded by millionaire Laurance Rockefeller,
stopped short of finding convincing evidence of extraterrestrial
intelligence or even any violation of natural law. But it indicted
the scientific community for a lack of scientific curiosity.
</P>
<P>
   Citing cases that included burns to witnesses, radar detection
of mysterious objects, strange lights appearing repeatedly in the
skies over certain locales, aberrations in the workings of
automobiles, and radiation and other damage found in vegetation, it
called on scientists to overcome their fear of ridicule associated
with the topic and get funding to research such occurrences.
</P>
<P>
   Funding is the rub, of course. Even a report by respected
scientists isn't likely to make historically skeptical government
agencies and foundations suddenly pour forth with major grants to
study UFOs.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I think it'll crack the door open a bit,'' says
Schuessler, who delivered testimony to the panel regarding UFOs he
has investigated, including a famous 1980 case in Liberty County,
Texas. ``And, symbolically, it means a lot to the UFOlogy community
and to those people around the world whose experiences have been
trivialized by science.''
</P>
<P>
   But if UFOlogists want practical results, they probably still
have their work cut out for them. Alan Holt, a NASA manager at the
Johnson Space Center who is sympathetic to their concerns, says the
scientific community would need 10 times more data than the report
presents before they would get interested.
</P>
<P>
   UFO ridicule dates to the Korean War, when a CIA-sponsored study
debunked then prevalent UFO reports. In that authoritative era, its
language was so harsh it had the effect of quieting the controversy
_ the media stopped asking questions, people became afraid to
report sightings.
</P>
<P>
   There were (and still are) easy explanations for most sightings:
Jupiter, Mars and Venus, comets, meteors, even the moon in its
red-hued gibbous phase, space debris, experimental aircraft, model
planes, fireworks, research balloons, kites. Others require more
expertise: ball lightning, swamp gas, mirages, distant tornadoes,
sunlight reflecting off flocks of birds and swarms of insects.
Some, of course, are hoaxes.
</P>
<P>
   But according to UFOlogists, about 5 percent of reported
sightings involve none of those, and constitute some sort of
unidentifiable phenomena. This summer's report says those cases
merit more serious study.
</P>
<P>
   The only investigation currently being done is typically by
UFOlogists like Schuessler, volunteers who've made a hobby of
researching the subject. They often are scientists, although the
fact that their work isn't funded by grants actually taints them in
the eyes of some colleagues. Skeptics, nicknamed debunkers by the
UFOlogists, call them ``mystery mongers.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The implication of claims about those unidentifiable sightings
is that if you spend a lot of time studying them you'll find
something remarkable,'' says Joe Nickell, an editorial board member
of the Skeptical Inquirer. ``But more likely, they'll fall into one
of the identifiable categories.''
</P>
<P>
   Nickell says he has no problem with open-minded scientific
investigations into UFO sightings. But he questions the wisdom of
putting money into research that will inevitably yield cases that
are unidentifiable because there simply weren't enough witnesses or
the kind of evidence to resolve the matter.
</P>
<P>
   The world's biggest center of UFOlogy is the Mutual UFO Network,
an international, grass-roots organization headquartered in Texas
that dispatches its volunteers to investigate sightings, holds
symposiums and publishes a quarterly journal.
</P>
<P>
   MUFON is also the home, in Seguin,Texas, of a UFO museum _ an
eccentric hodgepodge of alien toys and UFO books; of gift-shop
knickknacks and scholarly displays of UFO sightings; of mugs, caps
and T-shirts and laminated newspaper pages; of movie posters and
debris from an authentic NASA rocket.
</P>
<P>
   It is the biggest UFO museum east of Roswell, N.M.
</P>
<P>
   MUFON's roughly 3,500 members include a wide range of experts
and views _ 217 have doctorates and 300 have master's degrees; some
are almost as skeptical as Nickell in assessing likely
explanations. Others, like MUFON Director Walt Andrus, are more
flamboyant.
</P>
<P>
   Andrus, whose home doormat reads ``Welcome, UFOs and Crews,''
says the UFOs probably have an underwater Earth base and calls on
the U.S. government to ``quit lying and tell the truth about
UFOs.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Theology is a matter of belief, not UFOs,'' says Andrus. ``The
fact of the matter is, the evidence for UFOs is overwhelming. We're
receiving visitations from someplace. These UFOs didn't originate
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Such is the kind of discussion the makes the mainstream
scientific community cringe. A sampling of scientists at the time
expressed anxiety when this summer's report came out that a topic
with such a high ``giggle factor'' might blur the lines between
legitimate research and the ``lunatic fringe.''
</P>
<P>
   Schuessler says he and others presenting UFO testimony to the
report's authors initially picked up that same vibe, an
``arm's-length'' attitude that bespoke a kind of fear of being
contaminated. But Schuessler says that went away, and a mood of
true scientific discussion emerged as ``the panel realized we
weren't kooks.''
</P>
<P>
   Schuessler's testimony focused on the physiological effect on
witnesses, particularly in the well-known Cash-Landrum case in
Liberty County. The 1980 incident involved two women and one's
7-year-old grandson. Their alleged encounter with a UFO left them
with permanent damage to the eyes; stomach pains, vomiting and
diarrhea; skin scarring, with loss of pigmentation; excessive hair
loss; loss of appetite, energy and weight; fingernail shedding;
increased susceptibility to disease; and cancer.
</P>
<P>
   The incident _ Schuessler has written a book on it _ is one of a
number of sightings that Schuessler says have made Texas a UFO
center. Others include an 1897 airship crash near Fort Worth in
which The Dallas Morning News reported that the recovered pilot's
body was ``not of this world,'' sightings of lights in the sky
known as the Lubbock Lights and Marfa Lights, and a 1976 event near
Tyler that Schuessler told the panel left the witnesses with the
experience of ``shock.''
</P>
<P>
   So what will the report accomplish? Nickell says it'll be a blip
on the radar screen. And even its author, Stanford physicist Peter
Sturrock, says he doesn't think scientists are going to jump into
the field. But Schuessler is more hopeful.
</P>
<P>
   ``Scientists will happily do UFO research, just as as they now
do fruit fly research, if the money's there to pay for it,'' says
Schuessler. ``UFOlogy just needs some millionaires to endow
them. &UR; '' &LR;  &QL;

SUPREME COURT TO ADDRESS RIGHT TO PRIVACY, PEACEFUL ASSEMBLY 
 
(FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, OCT. 3) 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By STEVE LASH 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court begins its new term this week, a
nine-month session in which the justices will address such major
constitutional issues as the right to privacy and peaceful assembly
along with arcane topics such as patent law.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, awash in the Monica Lewinsky scandal, will be
keeping an eye on the court as the justices consider whether to
hear his appeals of lower court rulings that White House attorneys
and Secret Service agents can be compelled to testify before grand
juries.
</P>
<P>
   On another presidential matter, the high court has already said
it will decide the legality of Clinton's proposal to use a
statistical formula to supplement the traditional head count of the
U.S. population in the year 2000 census.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although the court is never able to escape controversy
entirely, for the second year in a row its docket is not loaded
with headline-generating cases,'' said Steven Shapiro, legal
director of the American Civil Liberties Union. ``That, in itself,
is an interesting commentary on the Supreme Court's role in our
constitutional system, given the political turmoil now swirling
around the other branches of government.''
</P>
<P>
   On the issue of constitutional rights, the justices will decide
if house guests enjoy Fourth Amendment protection against
unreasonable searches even when they are helping their hosts commit
a crime. The high court will also use that case, Minnesota vs.
Carter and Johns, to determine what constitutes a police search as
opposed to a mere observation.
</P>
<P>
   Eagan, Minn., police Officer Jim Thielen, responding to an
anonymous tip of drug activity, peered through the blinds of
Kimberly Thompson's apartment window and saw Wayne Thomas Carter
and Melvin Johns help Thompson pass, bag and tie cocaine. Police
officers arrested Carter and Johns when the two men left the
apartment.
</P>
<P>
   At trial, Carter and Johns urged the state court to suppress the
evidence, arguing that Thielen violated their Fourth Amendment
rights when he peered through the window. Without that
unconstitutional search, the police would have had no probable
cause to arrest them, they argued.
</P>
<P>
   The court rejected the argument, ruling that Carter and Johns
had no reasonable expectation of privacy and that Thielen merely
observed them through a window. However, the Minnesota Supreme
Court disagreed, ruling that Thielen violated the suspects' privacy
by walking right up to the window and peering between the blinds.
</P>
<P>
   The justices will hear arguments in the case Tuesday and are
expected to issue their ruling by next summer.
</P>
<P>
   The high court will also decide whether a Chicago ordinance that
permits police to break up people congregating on street corners
passes constitutional muster. The controversial 6-year-old Gang
Congregation Ordinance calls for police to tell loiterers to
disperse if an officer believes a street-gang member is present.
</P>
<P>
   The city says the law is necessary in the fight against gang
violence. But the ACLU, which represents about 65 people arrested
under the ordinance, counters that the measure is
unconstitutionally vague, making it difficult for people to
understand what behavior is prohibited and too easy for police to
enforce the law arbitrarily.
</P>
<P>
   The Illinois Supreme Court agreed with the civil liberties
group, prompting the state to appeal the case, Chicago vs. Morales,
to the Supreme Court. The justices will hear arguments in the case
Dec. 9.
</P>
<P>
   In a less-hallowed area, the high court will also consider a
patent case that pits an inventor from suburban Dallas against a
large electronics company. The issue before the high court in Pfaff
vs. Wells Electronics Inc. concerns the scope of a statutory
provision barring patent applicants from marketing their products
more than one year before filing their applications.
</P>
<P>
   The justices will consider whether the one-year clock begins
when the invention is complete or at an earlier point in the
creative process.
</P>
<P>
   Wayne Pfaff was developing a socket to hold computer microchips
during testing when, on April 8, 1981, he agreed to sell the
finished product to Texas Instruments. More than one year later _
on April 19, 1982 _ he applied for a patent, which was awarded on
Jan. 1, 1985.
</P>
<P>
   After the patent was issued, Wells Electronics began selling its
own socket design, prompting Pfaff to sue for patent infringement.
The U.S. District Court for Northern Texas agreed with Pfaff,
ruling that Wells Electronics had infringed. But the U.S. Court of
Appeals for the Federal Circuit, reversed the decision.
</P>
<P>
   The appeals court threw out Pfaff's patent, saying the one-year
clock was already running when he reached the sales agreement with
Texas Instruments. The court, citing federal patent law, said the
clock begins not when an invention is finished but when it is
substantially completed.
</P>
<P>
   Pfaff then appealed to the justices, saying the clock does not
start until an invention is completed. The high court will hear
Pfaff's appeal Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the justices have not decided whether they will
hear Clinton's appeals. However, if the past is prologue, the
president will not fare well at the high court.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist this summer rejected
Clinton's efforts to get a Supreme Court stay of the rulings that
compelled government attorneys and Secret Service Agents to testify
about what they were told, saw or heard regarding the president's
extramarital affair with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   In his appeal to the high court, Clinton argued that his
conversations with White House lawyers are covered under the
attorney-client privilege. However, the U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals in Washington, D.C., has ruled that government lawyers, as
opposed to Clinton's personal attorneys, owe no obligation of
confidentiality to their presidential client.
</P>
<P>
   With regard to the Secret Service, Clinton argued that the
agents cannot be forced to disclose what they saw or heard the
president do during their role as his protectors. Requiring Secret
Service agents to testify would undermine their ability to protect
the president, because a president might keep them at an unsafe
distance to ensure that his actions and conversations remain
private, Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   But the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Washington, D.C., has
ruled that the testimony of Secret Service agents can be compelled.
The circuit court rejected Clinton's so-called ``protective
privilege'' argument, saying Secret Service agents must stay close
to the president only when he is out in public.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court has, however, agreed to hear Clinton's appeal
of a lower court decision that statistical sampling in the Census
would violate a federal law prohibiting anything but a head count
in the decennial population survey.
</P>
<P>
   In its appeal, the Clinton administration argued that the
Republican-dominated Congress, which is challenging the president's
proposal, has no standing to sue because the year 2000 Census
results, used to apportion congressional seats, would not affect
current lawmakers. The administration also said that neither the
federal Census Act nor the Constitution prohibits statistical
sampling.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Washington, D.C., siding
with congressional Republicans, has ruled that the Census Act
prohibits statistical sampling.
</P>
<P>
   The Commerce Department said the most recent Census in 1990
failed to count 8 million people, mostly minorities and poor
people, historically strong voting blocs for Democrats. The
justices will hear arguments in Department of Commerce vs. House of
Representatives Nov. 30 and are expected to rule by next summer. &QL;

STAMP OF (DIS)APPROVAL: MAIL ON MEDIA COLUMN RANGES FROM APPLAUSE
TO CLAWS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL THOMPSON 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A person goes away for a few days and the mail really piles up.
</P>
<P>
   One of my favorite finds in the post-trip letter bag wasn't even
a letter to me; it was written to fellow columnist Bob Ray Sanders
with a postscript to Mr. ``John'' Thompson: ``The same goes for
you.''
</P>
<P>
   Turns out that Bob Ray and I had similar reactions to the
videotape of President Clinton's grand jury testimony and offered
similar assessments of the public's response to the tape's airing
on national television. It's a rare occasion when Sanders and
Thompson _ that's ``Bill'' Thompson, for the record _ can be found
agreeing on an issue, much less expressing such similar views that
one of them can be rejected with an unceremonious, ``The same goes
for you.''
</P>
<P>
   I will reply with the only response that comes to mind: So's
your old man.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the letters that came in while I was away were responses
to a recent column in which I suggested that the news media's
preoccupation with _ and sometimes creation of _ scandals will
eventually propel readers and viewers to a level of disgust that
will make them turn away from newspapers and TV news.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the letters were complimentary, like the one from a
reader in Russell, Ky.: ``You have put to print something many of
my friends and I have discussed on several occasions. We would
prefer the media to report the facts and let us decide their
significance.''
</P>
<P>
   And one from a reader in Yakima, Wash., who said that ``you hit
the nail right on the head. The hype and manipulation of the media,
quite frankly, made me soul-sick. I stopped watching news channels
a month ago. PBS has a more honorable presentation on news events,
and that is what I watch.''
</P>
<P>
   A note from a reader in St. Augustine, Fla., wasted no words:
``Congratulations! Somebody is showing some perspective on this
matter.''
</P>
<P>
   I even received a letter from an Indiana prison inmate _ D.O.C.
No. 900877 _ who says that the media caused his conviction for a
murder that he claims he didn't commit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We, as a people, are programmed to believe everything we read,
or hear on TV news stations,'' the prisoner wrote, ``so it's up to
the media to go back to the standards it once had _ responsible
journalism, not sensationalism.
</P>
<P>
   ``I doubt very much if I would be here today had it not been for
the media. And I'm not the only one this has happened to!''
</P>
<P>
   One of the most thought-provoking letters came from a reader in
Baltimore who identified himself as ``a newspaperman for 40 years
including 23 on The Washington Post.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Something happened to journalism after Watergate: A different
kind of person came into the business, intent only on their own
personal fame and fortune. These are the people who dig in
celebrities' garbage, literally, who, as you say, deliberately
promote phony stories, as in the case of (Mark) McGwire's pills.
There are still, of course, real journalists coming into the
business, but I'm afraid there are enough Woodward-Bernstein
wannabes both on the beat and on the desk to turn many newspapers
into mere scandal sheets.
</P>
<P>
   ``The days when we worked for peanuts ($40 a week on my first
job in 1949; got up to $75 after 3 years) are long gone, days when
$10,000 a year made you rich, days when we loved our work and bent
over backward to be fair. I fear it is all just a symptom of what
is happening to America itself with our rampant materialism, our
acceptance of total self-indulgence, our indifference to everyone
else.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would love to think that the public will turn against the
media and not simply ignore us. I suspect that Clinton's strong
showing in the polls is not so much a sign of his popularity as a
message to the media.''
</P>
<P>
   But man does not live by like-mindedness alone. So a reader in
Alabama clipped my column out of The Huntsville Times and scrawled
across the top:
</P>
<P>
   ``It's idiots like you that is turning off the public. Get your
nose out of Clinton's ___ and join the real world.''
</P>
<P>
   Uh, let's see: The same goes for you?
</P>

<P>
   I hear hummingbirds before I see them. The noise of their tiny
wings beating furiously as they flit from one flower to the next
sounds like the sputtering engine of a distant dirt bike. It's a
noise I hear often as the season progresses and the hummingbirds
find each flower in its prime. They hover around the beard tongue
in June, the impatiens in July, the Mexican sunflower in August.
</P>
<P>
   A garden's birds are a fine complement to its flowers and
vegetables. Not even cornflowers can match the blue of an indigo
bunting; no rose is as vividly red as a scarlet tanager. Even
drab-color birds improve the landscape, like plants grown as a
quiet background.
</P>
<P>
   There are birds in the garden all year, as there are evergreens
to make a show when the herbaceous plants are dormant. But the
arrival of spring's first robin is as eagerly awaited as the first
jonquil, both being signs that winter has loosened its hold on the
earth.
</P>
<P>
   A neighbor watches for the first barn swallow, in the belief
that when the swallows arrive, frost will not visit again, and it
is therefore safe to put out the tomato seedlings that have been
getting spindly on the windowsill. Barn swallows have been known to
be wrong on that count, but they are a welcome sight anyway,
wheeling joyously behind the tractor and snapping up flying insects
that the machine has disturbed.
</P>
<P>
   Where there are many barn swallows, there are few mosquitoes,
which is reason enough to tolerate their mud nests in the barn
eaves.
</P>
<P>
   When it's time to till a field for early peas and potatoes, the
tractor will make a slight detour around the spot where a killdeer,
a kind of plover, has constructed her nest on the ground. The
killdeer likes to nest where the soil is well drained and exposed
to the southern sun _ exactly the right spot for early garden crops
_ so this annual conflict is inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   It would be almost impossible to detect the killdeer's nest,
with its four brown-speckled eggs, except that the killdeer is very
good at calling attention to it. She plants herself, shrieking like
a harridan, in front of the tractor as it approaches the site. In
the spring, the tractor toolbox includes a supply of small, orange
flags to mark killdeer nests.
</P>
<P>
   In the summer, when the peas have all been picked and the field
has been cleaned up for a fall crop of broccoli or turnips, there
is likely to be a small section of pea trellis left standing. House
wrens and sparrows like to build their nests in the pea trellis.
</P>
<P>
   This year, a house wren chose a pot of artemisia on a bench
outside the greenhouse as a nesting site. The artemisia was
supposed to be planted in the spring, next to a clump of day lilies
in a new perennial bed. Watching the mother wren fuss over her
brood and applauding as the last youngster teetered on the edge of
the bench before launching into flight was worth the delay. Fall
planting is good for perennials, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Some birds are said to be pests in the garden, including crows
and mockingbirds. It's true that crows will eat newly sown seeds,
delighted to find their dinner so neatly arranged in a row, and
mockingbirds are fond of berries.
</P>
<P>
   But the four-crow squadron that patrols my fields (the same
birds every year) is a familiar part of the scenery, and
mockingbirds keep me company in the winter, when most of their
compatriots have fled to warmer locales. I don't begrudge them a
share of the produce. A piece of netting over the newly seeded
squash or ripening blueberries prevents large losses.
</P>
<P>
   More often, birds are allies in the garden and field, devouring
quantities of insects and weed seeds. When the dandelions go to
fluff, bright yellow finches come to gorge on the seeds, arriving
in such numbers that it looks as if the dandelions have bloomed all
over again.
</P>
<P>
   Robins work at ground level, gobbling up grubs and cutworms, and
swallows handle aerial duties. In the evening, swallows fly low
over the vegetable plants, brushing the leaves lightly with their
wings, then bank sharply around to grab any leafhoppers thus
dislodged.
</P>
<P>
   Kestrels, hawks and owls hunt down rodents, and turkey vultures
_ so ungainly on the ground, so magnificently graceful riding a
summer thermal in great, lazy circles _ do their part as
scavengers.
</P>
<P>
   Like many other gardeners, I favor hummingbirds. Fearless in
their pursuit of nectar, they fly right into the greenhouse through
open vents, heading first, always, to the double red impatiens.
</P>
<P>
   This year a young hummer mistook the greenhouse poly cover for
open sky, and stunned herself trying to fly through it. I carried
her to a basket of impatiens, where in due time she regained her
wits. When mother came looking for her, chirping anxiously, the
youngster was well enough to fly away.
</P>
<P>
   To grow beautiful flowers and fine vegetables is a gardener's
joy. But to hold an iridescent hummingbird in one's hand is an
experience that is not likely to be repeated. That one, I hope,
will return when the lilacs are next in bloom.

BOWL GAMES NO LONGER CALL THE SHOTS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WENDELL BARNHOUSE 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
There's no business like bowl business. And there's no business I
know that has had undergone such a course correction in the last
decade.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Gone are the days when the bowls were in control of the
postseason. There are no more Hoss Brocks, jetting to a different
game each weekend to press the flesh and distribute good will for a
bowl. Ten years ago, the bowls were competing with each other for
the best available teams and public relations were crucial.
</P>
<P>
   Now, you see the guys in the blazers colored by your kids' box
of 64 Crayolas. But when the Fiesta Bowl rep shows up at the
Washington-Nebraska game, he's merely there to wave his bowl's
flag.
</P>
<P>
   The only thing the bowls control these days is the time their
parade starts, the type of trinkets they can give to the players
and which dealership will provide courtesy cars.
</P>
<P>
   From the bowl coalition to the bowl alliance to the Bowl
Championship Series, conference commissioners have increased their
power with each step. And with each step, the bowls' power has
declined. The conferences say jump, the bowls ask how high.
</P>
<P>
   A perfect example is the recent deal involving the Cotton Bowl.
Southeastern Conference commissioner Roy Kramer and Big 12 senior
associate commissioner Donnie Duncan wanted to bring in an SEC team
as the Big 12's foe in Dallas each Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
   And never mind that the SEC had contracts with the Citrus,
Outback and Peach bowls for its teams that failed to make the BCS
invitation list. Kramer went to the Outback and Peach bowls and
made them an offer they couldn't refuse.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the Cotton, Outback and Peach are in a selection pool
together; only you can't tell if those are smiles or grimaces on
the faces of the Outback and Peach poobahs.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question that we're dependent on the conferences
because they supply our inventory,'' Cotton Bowl executive director
Rick Baker said. ``The Big 12 is our partner, absolutely. They
supply half of our product.''
</P>
<P>
   And the conferences control the postseason.  &LR; tagtop:Wendell
Barnhouse, (817) 390-7238  &LR; tagbottom:wbhoops &LR; star-telegram.com
Splitsville Since May, Western Athletic Conference commissioner
Karl Benson has found himself in divorce court more often that
Elizabeth Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've watched the WAC marriage fall apart, I've seen the
WAC-Las Vegas marriage fall apart and I've seen the WAC-Holiday
Bowl marriage fall apart,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   All that considered, Benson is willing to walk down the aisle
again. He's scrambling trying to find a bowl home for this year's
WAC champion, a home he hopes will extend to next season when the
WAC is made up of eight teams.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps a prenuptial agreement would be in order this time.
Indiana on the offensive Perhaps Indiana basketball coach Bob
Knight should start studying football coach Cam Cameron's practices
so he could juice up the Hoosiers' basketball attack.
</P>
<P>
   In Cameron's second season, the Hoosiers appear to be grasping
his offensive philosophies. Indiana is 2-1 going into today's game
with No. 13 Wisconsin and there is a marked improvement in the
team's offense.
</P>
<P>
   The Hoosiers have scored 120 points in three games, matching
their total for 11 games last season. In 1997, the Hoosiers scored
11 touchdowns; so far, they've scored 15. And last season, they
rushed for 999 yards; they're already at 716.
</P>
<P>
   Indiana has victories over Western Michigan and Cincinnati and a
loss to Kentucky. The Badgers provide a difficult test. Wisconsin
is fifth nationally in rushing defense and third in total defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we've accomplished so far is great, but now we have to
see how we do against the more physical and more experienced teams
in the Big Ten,'' Cameron said. ``I don't know what that answer
will be.'' A Champ of a candidate Georgia is launching a
three-pronged campaign for defensive back Champ Bailey. The school
is sending out full-color pamphlets promoting the junior defensive
back for three awards _ Thorpe (defensive back), Biletnikoff (wide
receiver) and Heisman (top player).
</P>
<P>
   Bailey will try to follow in the footsteps of Michigan
cornerback Charles Woodson, who won the Heisman Trophy last season
because of his big-play exploits. In three Bulldogs victories,
Bailey has 12 tackles and one interception on defense; 11
receptions for 218 yards and two touchdowns on offense; and one
kickoff return for 24 yards on special teams.
</P>
<P>
   Bailey's profile could improve over the next two weeks. Georgia
plays at No. 6 LSU today and plays host to No. 3 Tennessee on Oct.
10.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those games are going to be big for him as far as exposure,''
Bulldogs coach Jim Donnan said. ``I think he'll have a chance again
to show everybody what his capabilities are.'' Still streaking On
the day when Prairie View A&AMP;M ended its 80-game losing streak,
there were some other notable streaks that either continued or
ended:
</P>
<P>
   Illinois has lost 15 consecutive Big Ten Conference games.
</P>
<P>
   Oregon State has lost 14 consecutive Pacific-10 Conference games
and 18 consecutive road games.
</P>
<P>
   Duke has lost 20 consecutive Atlantic Coast Conference games.
</P>
<P>
   BYU had 313 yards passing against Murray State, ending an
11-game stretch in which the Cougars had failed to pass for 300
yards.
</P>
<P>
   Rutgers ended a 21-game losing streak against I-A opponents with
a 27-15 victory over Army.
</P>
<P>
   Nevada-Las Vegas has lost 23 consecutive road games. In quotes
Arkansas athletic director Frank Broyles, who helped work out the
deal between the Southeatern Conference, the Big 12 Conference and
the Cotton Bowl, after the deal was announced last week:
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, hey, ho, ho, Arkansas to the Cotton Bowl.''
</P>
<P>
   Southern California wide receiver Billy Miller after the
Trojans' 30-10 loss at Florida State:
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a huge game for USC football. And a big blow. We
didn't do anything with the ball. We looked like we belonged in
Division I-AA.''
</P>
<P>
   Ohio State had last Saturday off and some of the Buckeyes
watched Nebraska dominate Washington, 55-7. Defensive back Ahmed
Plumer:
</P>
<P>
   ``We saw a dominant team. They dominated that game from start to
finish. They have a great offensive unit, and it just really spoke
to me and told me we have to get better. Where we are right now is
good, but we have to get a whole lot better.'' Briefly California
has six touchdowns. Three were scored by the defense in last week's
victory against Washington State. Of the other three, one was set
up by the defense (a fumble recovery against Oklahoma).
</P>
<P>
   Penn State coach Joe Paterno has a 4-5 record against No. 1
teams entering today's game at Ohio State. The Nittany Lions didn't
play last week. Penn State has won its past seven games after an
off week.
</P>
<P>
   Southwestern Louisiana is 0-4. In its past two games, USL has
allowed 132 points. The Ragin' Cajuns are last in Division I-A in
points allowed, giving up 48.5 per game.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado, which plays at Oklahoma today, has allowed just 319
yards in its past two games (178 to Baylor, 141 to Utah State).
That's the first time in 21 seasons that the Buffs have held
consecutive opponents to less than 200 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Tech's victory against North Carolina was the first in
Chapel Hill since 1945. Yellow Jackets coach George O'Leary was
born in 1946.
</P>
<P>
   There's something about the Minnesota-Purdue series that sparks
both teams' offenses. The past five meetings, the team's have
combined to average 87.4 points and 1,021 yards per game. The
scores: Purdue, 59-43 in '97; Purdue, 30-27 in '96; Minnesota,
39-38 in '95; Purdue, 49-37 in '94; Minnesota, 59-56 in '93.
CHART Hogs vs. Heismans No. 22 Arkansas, which faces Kentucky today
in Little Rock, will hope to slow down Wildcats quarterback Tim
Couch. Couch is putting up numbers worthy of a Heisman Trophy
winner. The Razorbacks have faced a player in his Heisman
Trophy-winning season seven times. Here's what happened:
Year/Heisman winner, team/Result 1938/Davey O'Brien, TCU/L, 21-14
1948/Doak Walker, SMU/L, 14-12 1957/John David Crow, Texas A&AMP;M/L,
7-6 1970/Jim Plunkett, Stanford/L, 34-28 1977/Earl Campbell,

GENE AUTRY: SINGING COWBOY, ACTOR, BASEBALL OWNER, DEAD AT 91

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Gene Autry, America's first singing cowboy of the movies and a
multimillionaire businessman, died Friday at his home in the Studio
City neighborhood of Los Angeles, said Karla Buhlman, vice
president of Gene Autry Entertainment. He was 91.
</P>
<P>
   With his theme song, ``Back in the Saddle Again,'' and riding
his chestnut stallion, Champion, Autry began his climb to fame in
the mid-1930s. Although he later owned hotels, broadcasting
stations, oil wells and a baseball team, he did not give up
performing in films, on radio and television or in his own rodeo
until 1964.
</P>
<P>
   His biggest recording hit, ``Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer,''
released in 1949, remains a children's Christmas favorite. It has
sold an estimated 15 million copies and is the second best-selling
single in history, runner-up to Bing Crosby's ``White Christmas.''
</P>
<P>
   He was also a prolific songwriter, turning out some 300 tunes,
including ``Here Comes Santa Claus.'' ``That Silver-Haired Daddy of
Mine,'' another original, was his first recording, a hit that sold
more than a million copies in less than a year.
</P>
<P>
   Autry's career as a businessman went back to his movie days when
he began making money franchising his name and face for
sweatshirts, jeans, belts, suspenders, gloves, lassos and
souvenirs. By 1940, Gene Autry cap pistols dominated the toy gun
industry.
</P>
<P>
   But it was not until 1948, when he bought a radio station in
Phoenix, that he laid the cornerstone of a financial empire that
included 10 radio stations and a Los Angeles television station, a
flying school, a music-publishing company, a 20,000-acre cattle
ranch in Arizona and ownership of the California Angels baseball
team in 1961.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Autry owned the Gene Autry Hotel in Palm Springs,
Calif., and controlled corporations that at times operated a
half-dozen other hotels, including the St. Francis in San
Francisco. He was also a partner in many Oklahoma and Texas oil
well operations.
</P>
<P>
   Autry, who continued to wear Western boots and clothes long
after his retirement from show business, came by his cowboy image
honestly.
</P>
<P>
   Orvon Gene Autry was born on Sept. 29, 1907, on a small cattle
and grain farm in Tioga, Texas. He was the son of a cattle buyer,
tenant farmer and nondenominational itinerant preacher. The boy's
mother died when he was 4 years old, not long after the family had
moved to Ravia, Okla., where the young Autry learned to ride horses
and play the guitar and sing at his father's church services.
</P>
<P>
   At the age of 16 he went to work as a baggage handler at the
Ravia railroad depot, where he learned telegraphy from the station
master. Later he was a vacation relief telegrapher for the Frisco
Railroad at stops from St. Louis to southern Oklahoma, an
experience that he said was to ``change my life forever.''
</P>
<P>
   One night in Chelsea, Okla., when he was 17, he said, ``This
farmer-looking guy, with glasses on the tip of his nose, came into
the office and gave me some pages to send.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Then he spotted the guitar,'' Autry said. `` `You play that?'
he asked. `Like to hear you.'''
</P>
<P>
   The man Autry dutifully played for turned out to be Will Rogers,
and he told the young man that he had a future on the radio.
</P>
<P>
   Thus encouraged, in 1927 Autry used his railroad pass to visit
New York, where he spent a month knocking on the doors of radio
stations and record companies. He was advised to get radio
experience elsewhere, and shortly afterward got a job as Oklahoma's
Yodeling Cowboy on station KVOO in Tulsa.
</P>
<P>
   In 1928, Autry returned to New York to record ``Silver-Haired
Daddy,'' written with Jimmy Long, a fellow railroad worker, whose
niece, Ina Mae Spivey, he was to marry in 1932. The success of the
recording won Autry a Columbia Records contract and a weekly role
on the popular National Barn Dance radio show broadcast from
Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   The Autrys moved to Hollywood in 1934. He was given a small role
in a Ken Maynard western, ``In Old Santa Fe,'' and sang only one
song, but the idea of a singing cowboy hero caught on with
producers at Republic Pictures, which specialized in low-budget
westerns and serials.
</P>
<P>
   In 1935, Autry, beginning with ``Tumbling Tumbleweeds,'' his
first starring role, made eight hourlong movies for the Saturday
afternoon ``kiddie trade.'' In the years to come he appeared in
dozens more, and he became the only western star to be listed by
moviehouse owners as among the top 10 money makers in the Hollywood
films of 1938 to 1942.
</P>
<P>
   In such movies as ``Boots and Saddles,'' ``South of the
Border,'' ``Melody Ranch'' and ``Down Mexico Way,'' Autry was a
no-nonsense hero in stories that conformed to his own cowboy's
code: ``The hero must not take unfair advantage of anyone,
including the bad guys. He must not hit anybody smaller than
himself. He must always keep his word. He must not smoke or drink
in public, and he must not kiss the girl.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   His well-trained Tennessee walking horse Champion, which figured
prominently in most Autry movies, had its own stand-in. The famous
horse was replaced through the years with two others from the same
strain from the same breeder near Nashville. In movies and the
traveling Autry rodeo show, Champion was billed as the ``World's
Wonder Horse.'' Smiley Burnett was popular as Autry's comic
sidekick.
</P>
<P>
   Autry, whose songs, performed in a pleasant tenor voice, irked
some of his younger viewers who preferred nonstop action, had
millions of female fans who wrote 5,000 letters a week to him. But
he was modest about his talents, telling an interviewer in 1980:
``I honestly never considered myself an actor. An actor would be
someone like Paul Muni or Spencer Tracy. I was more of a
personality.''
</P>
<P>
   By 1942, when he enlisted in the Army Air Forces, Autry was
grossing more than $600,000 a year from movies, records, a weekly
radio show and personal appearances. Having learned to fly years
earlier, he spent the war ferrying cargo in the Far East and was
discharged in 1945. The only concession the Air Forces made to
Sergeant Autry's fame was to allow him to wear his cowboy boots
with his uniform.
</P>
<P>
   During his wartime absence, Republic Pictures had promoted Roy
Rogers as King of the Cowboys, so Autry did not return to his old
studio, preferring to form his own Flying A Productions as a unit
at Columbia Pictures. After the war, he took on a new partner, Pat
Buttram, as well.
</P>
<P>
   Flying A made his movies from then on and in the 1950s filmed 91
half-hour episodes of ``The Gene Autry Show'' for CBS and a new
generation of American youngsters. The highly lucrative Autry
company also produced ``Annie Oakley,'' ``Death Valley Days'' and
other television series.
</P>
<P>
   Autry credited his wife, Ina Mae, with inducing him to make one
of his shrewdest decisions. He had received a catchy song in the
mail in 1949 but was reluctant to record it. Mrs. Autry, however,
told her husband: ``It reminds me of `The Ugly Duckling.' Kids will
love it.''
</P>
<P>
   At a recording session in Los Angeles, he suddenly decided to
include the song, ``Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer,'' and performed
it in a single take. His personal earnings from that single
recording came to more than $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   Autry had no children. His first wife, Ina Mae, died in 1980,
and the next year he married Jacqueline Ellam. She was a
39-year-old friend of 15 years who was a vice president of a bank
in Cathedral City, Calif., near Palm Springs, where Autry had a
home.
</P>
<P>
   If Autry was shrewd in his entertainment career, he had a Midas
touch in business. In 1982, for example, he sold television station
KTLA in Los Angeles for $245 million. Even while still playing
Madison Square Garden in New York and other cities with his own
rodeo shows, he was making deals for oil wells, hotels, radio and
television stations and other properties. He was on the telephone
constantly, keeping in touch with his far-flung interests, but he
was admired for his ability to delegate authority.
</P>
<P>
   Autry was a longtime collector of Western memorabilia and art,
and in December 1988, the Gene Autry Western Heritage Museum, built
largely with funds from Autry's foundations, opened in Griffith
Park in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt that I owed something,'' Autry said. ``The West has
been very kind to me over the years.'' Among the items in the $54
million museum are an 1870s-era steam fire engine from Nevada, guns
owned by Annie Oakley and Wyatt Earp and costumes of the Lone
Ranger and Tonto.
</P>
<P>
   As owner of the California Angels, now the Anaheim Angels,
Autry, who had been a baseball fan since childhood, was fiercely
competitive. He spent lavishly, offering multi-million-dollar
contracts to attract star players to his team. In 1979 his costly
lineup of stars won Autry and the Angels their first divisional
championship. Known affectionately as the Cowboy in baseball
circles, Autry was one of the most popular owners among players on
his own and other teams.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Autry announced that the Walt Disney Co. was buying a
part interest in the team, and the next year Disney took operating
control. Recent baseball seasons ended as all seasons have ended
for the Angels, with Autry still awaiting the team's first World
Series appearance. Disney had an agreement to acquire Autry's
remaining share of the team at his death.

MELISSA JOAN HART HAS MAGICAL FUN WITH `SABRINA' &HT;    
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By MIKE McDANIEL 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bewitching. Magical. Mysterious.
</P>
<P>
   Hooey! It's no mystery why ``Sabrina, the Teenage Witch'' is so
popular, the best and highest-rated show on ABC's TGIF schedule.
</P>
<P>
   First, it doesn't take itself too seriously. Second, it has the
charming Melissa Joan Hart in the lead.
</P>
<P>
   But let it come from Hart herself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the show's success is a combination of things,'' she
said. ``A large part is fans from `Clarissa' (before `Sabrina,'
Hart starred in Nickelodeon's `Clarissa Explains It All'). More
than Sabrina, I get called Clarissa. That show was pretty
groundbreaking. I know that it really got to a lot of kids about my
age (she's 22 now), and it's still on for the younger kids. So that
has something to do with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what's made `Sabrina' so successful is it's so
colorful and bright. There's so much going on in the show, and you
can get away with anything because, you know, she's a witch.
</P>
<P>
   ``We keep it really light. All the other sitcoms have their
`special episodes.' We don't. We just have fun with it and make fun
of ourselves. We know it's a goofy show, and that's why we love
it.''
</P>
<P>
   ABC loves it so much that the network came to Hart and her mom,
``Sabrina'' executive producer Paula Hart, to make a Sabrina movie.
``Sabrina Goes to Rome'' airs Sunday on ``The Wonderful World of
Disney'' on ABC.
</P>
<P>
   Last year Disney ran another Sabrina feature, one that first ran
on Showtime, ``and it had big numbers, right under `Cinderella,' ''
said Hart.
</P>
<P>
   With the ball in her court, Hart made her wish list.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't really want to do another Sabrina thing since we do
it all year long, so I asked if we could do it in Rome to make it a
little more interesting,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She chose Rome because the previous year she had spent in
Florence studying art and literature (in a New York University
program).
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to explore more of Italy,'' she said. ``I'd been to
Paris before. We didn't want to do what everyone else had done
(`The Facts of Life and Blossom,' for example).''
</P>
<P>
   The result is a movie that's as breezy and mindlessly
entertaining as the series. It finds Sabrina and her stowaway cat
Salem in Rome searching for a secret that will unlock a
centuries-old locket sealed by Sabrina's witchly ancestors.
</P>
<P>
   Her search takes a romantic turn when she runs into an American
photographer named Paul (Eddie Mills). She doesn't know that Paul
and his friend Travis (James Fields, Hart's real-life boyfriend)
are plotting to expose her as a witch.
</P>
<P>
   The movie has magic and its usual dose of smart-aleck remarks
from Salem. There's a mystery that gets solved. And there's a whiff
of love in the air.
</P>
<P>
   So how did James take it when Sabrina and Paul smooched?
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a little uncomfortable,'' admitted Hart. ``James had a
video camera and was taking some footage for E! (so he was right
there). We knew from the beginning that was going to be the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only uncomfortable thing was we had such a huge audience.
(The kissing scene was shot by the landmark Trevi Fountain.)
Everyone kept oohing. It was really embarrassing.
</P>
<P>
   ``But James took it well,'' she said. ``He's really a sport.''
</P>
<P>
   Hart herself takes well to the fact that her mother is so
involved in her work life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Working with Mom is great,'' she said. ``We're growing up
together _ that's how we put it. My family is important to me.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was with `Clarissa,' I got offered all these movies or
auditions, awful characters that I did not want to play. We decided
to come up with something of our own, something we could have
control over. It's been wonderful, a dream.''
</P>
<P>
   So how much more Sabrina is in Melissa's future?
</P>
<P>
   ``We've started talking about (the end) already because we've
already got this season and next season planned.''
</P>
<P>
   ABC has given the show a go through the year 2000, and Hart
thinks she'd like to do something else by the year 2001.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to go back to school, work on feature films and take
some time off,'' said Hart.
</P>
<P>
   `` `Sabrina' is the best show I could ever ask for,'' Hart said.
``If I could make up my own show, it wouldn't be nearly as good as
this _ the crew, the cast, everything. So I'm really lucky.'' &QL;

<P>
   Gene Autry, America's first singing cowboy of the movies and a
multimillionaire businessman, died Friday at his home in the Studio
City neighborhood of Los Angeles, said Karla Buhlman, vice
president of Gene Autry Entertainment. He was 91.
</P>
<P>
   With his theme song, ``Back in the Saddle Again,'' and riding
his chestnut stallion, Champion, Autry began his climb to fame in
the mid-1930s. Although he later owned hotels, broadcasting
stations, oil wells and a baseball team, he did not give up
performing in films, on radio and television or in his own rodeo
until 1964.
</P>
<P>
   His biggest recording hit, ``Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer,''
released in 1949, remains a children's Christmas favorite. It has
sold an estimated 15 million copies and is the second best-selling
single in history, runner-up to Bing Crosby's ``White Christmas.''
</P>
<P>
   He was also a prolific songwriter, turning out some 300 tunes,
including ``Here Comes Santa Claus.'' ``That Silver-Haired Daddy of
Mine,'' another original, was his first recording, a hit that sold
more than a million copies in less than a year.
</P>
<P>
   Autry, who continued to wear Western boots and clothes long
after his retirement from show business, came by his cowboy image
honestly.
</P>
<P>
   Orvon Gene Autry was born on Sept. 29, 1907, on a small cattle
and grain farm in Tioga, Texas. He was the son of a cattle buyer,
tenant farmer and nondenominational itinerant preacher. The boy's
mother died when he was 4 years old, not long after the family had
moved to Ravia, Okla., where the young Autry learned to ride horses
and play the guitar and sing at his father's church services.
</P>
<P>
   At the age of 16 he went to work as a baggage handler at the
Ravia railroad depot, where he learned telegraphy from the station
master. Later he was a vacation relief telegrapher for the Frisco
Railroad at stops from St. Louis to southern Oklahoma, an
experience that he said was to ``change my life forever.''
</P>
<P>
   One night in Chelsea, Okla., when he was 17, he said, ``This
farmer-looking guy, with glasses on the tip of his nose, came into
the office and gave me some pages to send.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Then he spotted the guitar,'' Autry said. `` `You play that?'
he asked. `Like to hear you.'''
</P>
<P>
   The man Autry dutifully played for turned out to be Will Rogers.
</P>
<P>
   Thus encouraged, in 1927 Autry used his railroad pass to visit
New York, where he spent a month knocking on the doors of radio
stations and record companies. He was advised to get radio
experience elsewhere, and shortly afterward got a job as Oklahoma's
Yodeling Cowboy on station KVOO in Tulsa.
</P>
<P>
   In 1928, Autry returned to New York to record ``Silver-Haired
Daddy,'' written with Jimmy Long, a fellow railroad worker, whose
niece, Ina Mae Spivey, he was to marry in 1932. The success of the
recording won Autry a Columbia Records contract and a weekly role
on the popular National Barn Dance radio show broadcast from
Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   The Autrys moved to Hollywood in 1934. He was given a small role
in a Ken Maynard western, ``In Old Santa Fe,'' and sang only one
song, but the idea of a singing cowboy hero caught on with
producers at Republic Pictures, which specialized in low-budget
westerns and serials.
</P>
<P>
   In 1935, Autry, beginning with ``Tumbling Tumbleweeds,'' his
first starring role, made eight hourlong movies for the Saturday
afternoon ``kiddie trade.'' In the years to come he appeared in
dozens more, and he became the only western star to be listed by
moviehouse owners as among the top 10 money makers in the Hollywood
films of 1938 to 1942.
</P>
<P>
   Autry had no children. His first wife, Ina Mae, died in 1980,
and the next year he married Jacqueline Ellam. She was a
39-year-old friend of 15 years who was a vice president of a bank
in Cathedral City, Calif., near Palm Springs, where Autry had a
home.
</P>
<P>
   As owner of the California Angels, now the Anaheim Angels,
Autry, who had been a baseball fan since childhood, was fiercely
competitive. He spent lavishly, offering multi-million-dollar
contracts to attract star players to his team. In 1979 his costly
lineup of stars won Autry and the Angels their first divisional
championship. Known affectionately as the Cowboy in baseball
circles, Autry was one of the most popular owners among players on
his own and other teams.

MYSTERIOUS ANNUAL MIGRATION OF MONARCH BUTTERFLIES UNDER WAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DOUGLAS BROWN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   They flitter through the sky, part magical and part mysterious.
</P>
<P>
   Every year, usually about late August, millions of monarchs
begin the migration to their wintering grounds. From southern
Canada and northern parts of the United States, the delicate winged
insects travel southward on a slow and arduous flight.
</P>
<P>
   Monarchs east of the Rocky Mountains fly up to 2,000 miles to
the forests high in the mountains of Mexico, passing through Texas
in late September and early October. Those west of the Rocky
Mountains travel a shorter distance to small groves along the
California coast.
</P>
<P>
   Their migration is one of the mysteries of the natural world.
Monarchs are the only butterflies to make such a long, two-way
migration every year. But unlike other migratory animals, such as
birds or whales, the butterflies make only part of the journey. It
is their offspring, several generations removed, that complete the
journey back home.
</P>
<P>
   The cycle begins in a forested reserve in the Mexican state of
Michoacan. Millions of monarchs spend the winter at 9,000 feet in
semidormancy, clinging together tightly on fir branches. Moist
cloud cover and the tree canopy protect the butterflies against
winds and frost. The temperature, 40 to 65 degrees, keeps the
monarchs warm enough so that they don't freeze, but cool enough
that their dormancy is not interrupted.
</P>
<P>
   As spring arrives, the monarchs begin their journey northward in
search of milkweed plants, on which they lay their eggs and their
larvae thrive.
</P>
<P>
   During the trek northward, several generations are born, breed
and die before the shorter days and cooler temperatures of late
summer signal that it is time to begin the trip south.
</P>
<P>
   With no previous knowledge of the path to take or the place to
go, the last generation of the summer loads up on flower nectar,
then flies to the wintering roosting sites.
</P>
<P>
   It took scientists 40 years of study to find where the monarchs
go to roost for the winter. Now they are trying to find out how
they know the way.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   MONARCH HOT LINE
</P>
<P>
   For updates on the migration, call the Texas Monarch Hotline at
(800) 468-9719 or the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department at (800)
792-1112, Ext. 4464.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   FAST FACTS
</P>
<P>
   The monarch is one of 128 butterfly species seen in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Monarchs got their name from European settlers, particularly
those from Holland and England. They were impressed by the beauty
of the butterfly and named it monarch after King William, Prince of
Orange, later named king of England.
</P>
<P>
   Monarchs can fly up to 15 to 20 mph, usually riding the wind
currents, and as high as 10,000 to 12,000 feet.
</P>
<P>
   A monarch weighs 0.25 to 0.75 grams. A dime, in comparison,
weighs 2.3 grams.
</P>
<P>
   Reproductively active adult monarchs live two to six weeks,
depending on the time of year and the conditions. But the monarchs
that overwinter in Mexico can live up to eight months.
</P>
<P>
   A white monarch is a rare form whose wings are grayish-white
instead of orange. They seem to appear most often in Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   A MONARCH MIMIC
</P>
<P>
   Animals display a wide variety of defenses, from a dog showing
sharp teeth to a skunk emitting a putrid scent.
</P>
<P>
   In the world of butterflies, looks can be a strong defense,
because they can deceive predators. Butterflies that taste bad
usually have warning colors or patterns on their wings.
</P>
<P>
   The bitter taste of one monarch is usually enough to convince a
bird that it's not worth the effort to try to eat another one. That
helps the viceroy butterfly survive as well. The viceroy's coloring
mimics the monarch's coloring so closely that predators avoid it.
</P>
<P>
   The viceroy and monarch are both found in Texas. How can you
tell them apart? Viceroy butterflies are slightly smaller, have
shorter wings and have a black band across the hind wings.

respective divisions in the SEC. Georgia has gotten off to fast
starts in other years, but were eventually brought back down to
earth by conference powers Tennessee and Florida. After last

respective divisions in the SEC. Georgia has gotten off to fast

HOLOCAUST MUSEUM OF HOUSTON HONORS FILM DIRECTOR/PRODUCER STEVEN
SPIELBERG 

</HEADLINE>

c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ ``This is like a scene from the movie `Giant,' ''
Steven Spielberg quipped as he slipped his hand into a bin to
select the winning raffle ticket for a $10,000 shopping spree at
Neiman Marcus.
</P>
<P>
   As the internationally renowned filmmaker looked out across the
sea of well-heeled men and women, attended by white-jacketed
waiters amid a shimmering setting accented in roses and candles,
Spielberg had to have been impressed by the larger than life
aspects of the evening.
</P>
<P>
   The Holocaust Museum Houston annual award dinner drew 1,800
guests to the George R. Brown Convention Center.
</P>
<P>
   Net proceeds from the event were a staggering $1.2 million,
making it one of the city's most successful fund-raisers. Proceeds
will be used for the operating fund of the museum, which is open
seven days a week and has free admission.
</P>
<P>
   As the evening's honoree, Spielberg was accompanied by dinner
chairs Barbara and Charles Hurwitz, Maxxam CEO. The Lyndon Baines
Johnson Moral Courage Award was presented to Spielberg by last
year's recipient, Edgar Bronfman, Seagram Company CEO and chairman
of the World Jewish Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The director/producer was recognized for his dedication to
philanthropic causes such as the Righteous Persons Foundation,
financed by all his profits from his renowned film ``Shindler's
List.'' He also founded Survivors of the Shoah Visual History
Foundation, which has recorded testimonies from more than 47,000
Holocaust survivors.
</P>
<P>
   In his remarks at an earlier press conference and to the full
dinner gathering, Spielberg presented a warm and generous spirit.
In accepting the honor, he said, ``I accept the award, but we know
who this award is for _ the six million who were moral and who had
courage.''
</P>
<P>
   On several levels, it was a joyous occasion. Greetings of
``Happy New Year'' echoed through the vast expanses of the
convention center as Jewish guests resounded the salute of the
Jewish High Holidays, which had just ended.
</P>
<P>
   On another level, the evening held the serious message of the
Holocaust. Houston artist and Holocaust survivor Alice Cahana
delivered a brief yet moving address. The Rev. Bill Lawson of
Wheeler Avenue Baptist Church of Houston was invited to deliver the
invocation, a generous ecumenical overture, the import of which was
lost neither on Lawson nor the gathering.
</P>
<P>
   Lawson and his wife Audrey joined the Hurwitzes, Spielberg,
Bronfman and Houston Mayor Lee Brown and his wife Frances at the
head table, which was elevated in the center of the vast ballroom.
Also breaking bread with the filmmaker were Holocaust Museum
Houston Chairman Ed Wulfe (who also took part in the program) and
his wife Lorraine,Cahana and her husband Rabbi Moshe Cahana, and
close Hurwitz friends Nellie Connally, Mark Quick and Linda Knight
Quick, who served as dinner adviser. The Hurwitzes' children filled
out the table _ David Hurwitz of New York and Houstonians Sean and
Debbie Hurwitz.
</P>
<P>
   Luci Baines Johnson and Lynda Johnson Robb were present for the
award presentation that honored the memory of their late father,
former President Lyndon Johnson. &QL;

JAMES GARNER DOES JUSTICE TO SCUMBAG ROLE IN `LEGALESE'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEN PARISH PERKINS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   James Garner is gloriously wicked as the egomaniacal,
manipulative attorney in TNT's ``Legalese'': smooth, articulate,
rich, famous, a sleaze ball who knows he is one.
</P>
<P>
   Garner's Norman Keane is the embodiment of criminal law
ruthlessness. ``I am the guy,'' this high-priced celebrity attorney
says to a colleague, ``you go to if you are famous and guilty.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Keane is the most shrewdly devised character among a
slew of them roaming through this quick-moving film, a delicious
satire written handsomely and hilariously by Billy Ray and directed
with snap and crackle by Glenn Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, watching ``Legalese'' (7, 9 and 11 CDT Sunday night on
TNT) is a little like spending time with white-collar criminals or
at your nearest law office boardroom. Whether heroes or villains,
just about every character seems to belong to the same breed of
deranged opportunists who'd turn on their own mothers if it meant
fat book deals and a piece of the movie rights.
</P>
<P>
   Keane's equal in this tale about the wacky world of justice and
media manipulation is Roy Guyton, an ambitious, fresh-out-of-school
lawyer who gets the kind of legal lessons they don't teach at UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Kerr's Roy is a smart but naive lawyer who shamelessly trades
on his integrity and quickly finds himself in a moral dilemma.
</P>
<P>
   Roy and Keane meet when Keane backs up his car in a parking
garage and nearly runs him over. Soon Keane is handing Roy the
high-profile case involving an actress (Gina Gershon as Angela
Beale) accused of murder. He plans to pull the strings from the
shadows.
</P>
<P>
   Keane's reason? He's too successful at keeping scumbags out of
jail. ``It's hard to retain any mystery about you when you're on
the tube more than `I Love Lucy,' '' he quips.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, this isn't entirely the reason. Roy is seen as the
insurance policy, a young, handsome upstart trying to fight for the
innocent.
</P>
<P>
   And he plays the game beautifully. When he first meets the press
with Angela, an earpiece attached to receive orders from Keane, he
slips into a Southern accent to charm reporters. Everyone is
running a game.
</P>
<P>
   Seduced by the swirl of publicity, Roy soon crosses paths with
Brenda Whitlass, a relentless tabloid reporter annoyingly
overplayed by Kathleen Turner.
</P>
<P>
   To its credit, ``Legalese'' captures this tight little universe
of scrambling opportunists with comedic intensity, offering up a
world in which those who walk the straight and narrow are seen as
the oddballs. Where else could a woman charged with murder get her
own TV show?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm on trial for murder. How could I host a talk show?''
Angela asks a wide-eyed producer. ``That's easy,'' he responds.
``We tape evenings.''
</P>
<P>
   Mary Louise Parker is Keane's hardened, sexually avid assistant
warmed up by Roy's farmboy, aw-shucks integrity. She gets some of
the best lines, particularly while trying to seduce Roy into a
sex-with-no-strings relationship.
</P>
<P>
   ``What do you think I'm proposing here?'' she asks a reluctant
Roy as she slithers toward him, dropping her clothes. ``Picnic
baskets in the meadow? I'm talking about you and me bent over the
Xerox machine when no one's looking.''
</P>
<P>
   For Roy, it becomes yet another offer he couldn't refuse.
</P>
<P>
   This week:
</P>
<P>
   ``Shot Through the Heart'' (7 p.m. CDT Sunday, HBO) is based on
the true story of Vlado Sarzinsky (Linus Roache) and Slavko Simic
(Vincent Perez), best pals whose relationship takes a tragic turn
during the war in Sarajevo.
</P>
<P>
   Vlado, a Croat married to a Muslim, learns that the enemy sniper
he's hunting is actually Slavko, the Serbian friend he has known
since childhood. So ``Shot Through the Heart'' is about Vlado
hunting down the man he once considered as close as a brother.
</P>
<P>
   Told in a straightforward manner without getting too
heavy-handed politically or melodramatic creatively, ``Shot Through
the Heart'' puts a human face on an ethnic civil war we merely read
about in digest form in American newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   The first in a series of two original films based on the
characters from the 1948 film noir classic, ``Naked City'' (7 p.m.
CDT Sunday, Showtime) follows two girls (Robin Tunney, Kathryn
Erbe) from Ohio who decide to come to New York City for vacation.
One becomes a victim of an attempted rape and, out of self-defense,
her girlfriend accidentally kills her attacker.
</P>
<P>
   Courtney B. Vance and Scott Glenn star in this watchable drama
that also features a pretty horrible Giancarlo Esposito, warming up
for his stint on ``Homicide: Life on the Street.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Wonderful World of Disney'' presents ``Sabrina Goes to Rome''
(6 p.m. CDT Sunday, ABC), which finds the sassy sorceress pursuing
a family heirloom that's been cursed by a spellbinding ancestor,
also played by Melissa Joan Hart.
</P>
<P>
   ``About Sarah'' (8 p.m. CDT Sunday, CBS) is the budget version
of the current Meryl Streep weeper, ``One True Thing.'' Kellie
Martin is asked to put her final year of college on hold to care
for her developmentally disabled mother (Mary Steenburgen). Through
it all, she comes to respect her.
</P>
<P>
   A&AMP;E's ``Investigative Reports'' (8 p.m. CDT Monday) offers a
believe-this-when-you-see-it portrayal of America's transsexual
community. Among the subjects: a female-to-male transsexual who
works for the Tampa sheriff's office; a male-to-female electrical
designer who has hosted a radio show called ``Gendertalk''; a
Southerner whom host Bill Kurtis and crew follow through surgical
transformation from female to male. Surprise, surprise.
</P>
<P>
   Geez, it's not even sweeps but ``Moesha'' (7 p.m. CDT Tuesday,
UPN) does a gimmicky double play. Brandy plays opposite herself as
the girls try to bust into a Brandy concert with no tickets. Of
course, they get in. Of course, Brandy sings from her new CD.
</P>
<P>
   Mare Winningham is terrific in ``Little Girl Fly Away'' (8 p.m.
CDT Tuesday, CBS) even if the film is a bit flat. She plays a woman
who appears to be pursued by a man intent on killing her until
police detectives smell something fishy.

NEW BOFA STARTS FIRST DAY --ALREADY INITIATES CHANGES  
 BY PETER SINTON 
</HEADLINE>
   c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
BankAmerica and NationsBank became one yesterday, but it will be a
while before the Bank of America name and new blue and red logo fly
around the globe.
<TEXT>
<P>
   BankAmerica CEO Hugh McColl said the new look will begin to
appear on signs and at other business operations next year, with
worldwide implementation continuing into 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sign companies should feel very happy this morning,'' said
David Coulter, CEO of the old BofA and president of the new bank.
The combined bank has 4,854 branches and offices in the United
States and nearly 14,000 automated teller machines.
</P>
<P>
   Starting yesterday, customers of both banks could use each
other's ATMS to make withdrawals and transfers with no ATM fees.
BofA estimated that this could save customers $5 million a year in
charges.
</P>
<P>
   Individual customers will see no other immediate changes from
the merger. The bank said they should continue to use their
existing checks, ATM cards and credit cards.
</P>
<P>
   In teleconferences and private chats with reporters, McColl and
Coulter touched on several subjects, from loan exposure to
management pledges to stock option plans:
</P>
<P>
   _BofA has ``below $300 million'' in outstanding loans to hedge
funds like Long-Term Capital Management, which recently needed a
bailout, but no investments in them. He said NationsBank had no
exposure to hedge funds. Coulter said in an interview that the old
BofA ``was not a lender to Long-Term Capital management in any
significant way.''
</P>
<P>
   _Asked for assurance that he won't change his mind about keeping
corporate banking headquartered in San Francisco after NationsBank
backed away from a commitment over who would manage Montgomery
Securities' high-yield bond unit, McColl got testy. ``You are
asking a question we Southerners take as an insult,'' snapped
BofA's new boss. ``When we give our word on something, we keep
it.''
</P>
<P>
   _The ``Take Charge'' stock option plan that BofA set up for all
employees two years ago will be continued. Although the November
1998 and May 1999 option grants (totaling 100 to 180 shares of the
old BofA stock per worker) were canceled, Coulter said new options
will be granted in January. &UR;  &LR; The exact number of shares has yet to
be decided.
</P>
<P>
   _To curry favor among the communities it serves, the Bank of
America Foundation will announce $10,000 grants in 100 cities
today.
</P>
<P>
   _The bank announced that thousands of employees on Saturday will
``celebrate by turning out in their communities coast to coast in
one of the biggest grassroots volunteer campaigns ever.''  &LR;   &LR;  &QL;

GRIZZLY QUARTER FOR MUTUAL FUNDS  
 BY ARTHUR M. LOUIS 
</HEADLINE>
   c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
When the quarterly statement from your 401(k) plan arrives in the
mail during the next few days, you'd better sit down and prepare
for a shock.
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was the worst quarter in eight years for the stock market, so
there's a good chance the bear ate a huge chunk of your retirement
money.
</P>
<P>
   The average domestic stock fund suffered a staggering 15.24
percent loss during the September quarter, reports Morningstar
Inc., the Chicago fund-tracking service.
</P>
<P>
   As usual, stock funds as a group trailed the Standard &AMP; Poor's
500 index, the principal market benchmark, which fell 10.07
percent. Only 16 percent of the 2,841 domestic stock funds surveyed
by Morningstar beat the S&AMP;P.
</P>
<P>
   International stock funds performed slightly worse than the
domestic funds, tumbling an average of 16.59 percent. The
worst-performing group of all was the 31 funds specializing in
Latin American stocks, which fell an average of 30.62 percent.
</P>
<P>
   If your retirement prospects hinge on a vibrant stock-market
performance, it's likely you endured a serious setback last
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, in the unlikely event that you switched all
your assets to bond funds when the quarter started, you may not
need any smelling salts when that fateful envelope arrives. Bond
funds gained an average of 0.77 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Funds specializing in federal government bonds rose an average
of 3.58 percent in the quarter, municipal-bond funds were up 2.56
percent, and taxable-bond funds gained 2.63 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The overall performance was pulled down by specialty bond funds
_ those invested in convertibles, junk bonds and other oddball
issues _ which lost 6.83 percent on average.
</P>
<P>
   Many bond funds benefited from the so-called investor flight to
quality during the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Investors concerned about the global financial crisis and its
possible dampening effect on the U.S. economy yanked billions of
dollars out of stocks and poured the money into bonds, which are
perceived as relatively safe investments.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to the positive bond-fund performance, the entire
universe of 6,599 mutual funds surveyed by Morningstar _ stock and
bond funds together _ did somewhat better than the S&AMP;P 500,
declining an average of 7.65 percent.
</P>
<P>
   As they have repeatedly in recent years, stock funds that focus
on large companies generally did better than those that invest
primarily in midsize and smaller companies.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;  Large-cap growth funds were down 11.13 percent for the
quarter, mid-cap growth funds lost 17.39 percent, and small-cap
growth funds fell 22.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The best-performing mutual fund of all was the Prudent Bear
Fund, based in Dallas, which gained a phenomenal 21.93 percent
during the quarter. As its name implies, it takes a pessimistic
view of the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   David Tice, the manager, says the fund, with $175 million in
assets, is a heavy short-seller of stock _ a classic bearish
strategy that often produces big profits in steeply falling
markets.
</P>
<P>
   In a short sale, an investor borrows stock and sells it, hoping
that the price will fall. If it does fall, the investor can buy it
back at the lower price and pocket the difference.
</P>
<P>
   Tice founded his fund in early 1996, when ``it became clear that
this market was dramatically out of control.'' His short-selling
tactics didn't help at first because the market continued to shoot
up through 1997 and into this year.
</P>
<P>
   During 1997, Prudent Bear lost 4 percent, while the S&AMP;P 500 was
gaining 33 percent. Now it has begun to make up the lost ground.
``We are still very, very bearish,'' Tice says.
</P>
<P>
   He holds particularly large short positions in consumer-credit
stocks, such as MBNA and Household International because he
believes that the economy will deteriorate to the point where
personal loan defaults become common.
</P>
<P>
   He also has shorted high-technology stocks, among them Intel and
Gateway, because he thinks that their profits will plunge due to
``too much production capacity and not enough demand.''
</P>
<P>
   The fund's few long positions include mainly precious-metals
stocks _ which tend to rise in periods of economic uncertainty.
</P>
<P>
   The worst-performing fund was Vontobel Eastern European Equity,
which plunged 40.48 percent in the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Wittwer, managing director of Vontobel USA, says the fund
has heavy investments in Hungary and Poland, whose stock markets
have been hit particularly hard by the global crisis.
</P>
<P>
   For a while, the fund, which has $45 million in assets, also was
heavily invested in the decimated Russian market, but managers have
``reduced our exposure there to zero,'' Wittwer says.
</P>
<P>
   Wittwer says he expects the fund to bounce back nicely in the
coming years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hungary, Poland and the Czech Republic will become part of the
European Union by 2003 or 2004,'' he predicts. ``That will have a
favorable effect on their capital markets.''
</P>
<P>
   Kurt Brouwer, with Brouwer &AMP; Janachowski in Tiburon, believes
that the stock market _ and stock funds _ will break out of their
funk fairly soon.
</P>
<P>
   He thinks that the market panic has reached a crescendo _
``everybody is focusing on what's negative'' _ and notes that
historically the market has always turned around when things looked
bleakest.
</P>
<P>
   Craig Litman, with Litman/ Gregory in Larkspur, speculates that
large-cap stock funds eventually may lose their perennial edge over
lesser-cap funds.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to question how long that can go on,'' Litman
remarks. ``A lot of people are throwing in the towel, thinking that
diversification doesn't work anymore. Diversifying across market
caps is supposed to lower risk, but that has not been the case
recently. But I think it still makes sense to be diversified.''

BAY AREA STOCKS SLASHED BY 21%  
 CHRONICLE STAFF REPORT 
</HEADLINE>
   c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
Oomph.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bay Area stocks had the wind knocked out of them in the third
quarter. On average, they fell a crippling 21.36 percent for the
three months ending September 30.
</P>
<P>
   That's more than twice as severe as the 10.3 percent decline in
the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index and the 10.6 percent fall in the
Nasdaq composite.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the Bay Area companies are considered growth stocks.
And growth in all industries has been called into question in the
last three to six months,'' said David Stadlin, portfolio manager
with Davis Skaggs Investment Management in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Small companies were hit especially hard, he added, ``but even
the icon stocks, the Ciscos, are being called into question.''
</P>
<P>
   Only 66 out of 298 Bay Area stocks tracked by Davis Skaggs
posted a gain for the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest winners were two Internet stocks, Inktomi and Yahoo.
</P>
<P>
   Inktomi, a San Mateo developer of search-engine technology and
software, soared 89 percent during the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``To quote one analyst, we're the universal arms merchant for
the Internet,'' Inktomi CEO David Peterschmidt said. ``We're the
guys providing everyone with the infrastructure technology
necessary for the Web to thrive.''
</P>
<P>
   Inktomi went public in June at $18 per share and ended the
quarter at $66.94.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of runner-up Yahoo of Santa Clara were up 64.4 percent.
The Internet directory firm, which also ranked among the 10
best-performing stocks in the previous quarter, is expected to
announce its fourth straight profitable quarter on Wednesday. It's
benefitting from being the best-known name on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Ranking fourth was MIPS Technologies, which went public on the
last day of the second quarter at $14 per share and ended the third
quarter at $19.88, up 48 percent. MIPS, which makes chips for
Nintendo machines, was spun off from Silion Graphics.
</P>
<P>
   Quickturn Design Systems Inc. of San Jose rose out of the
chip-equipment swamp and landed in the No.9 spot, thanks to a
hostile bid from rival Mentor Graphics of Wilsonville, Ore.
Quickturn is fighting the bid, and has called a shareholders
meeting for January 8.
</P>
<P>
   Telecommunication stocks, which had been enjoying an impressive
run, hit the wall in the third quarter after industry leaders like
Alcatel and Northern Telecom said their earnings would be
disappointing, said Stadlin.
</P>
<P>
   Two telecom equipment companies _ Advanced Fibre Communications
of Petaluma and Premisys Communications of Fremont _ were the Bay
Area's worst-performing stocks during the quarter, falling 83
percent and 72 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Both were squeezed by declines in orders from big telephone
companies and increasing price competition. Analysts said the two
firms should be on the upswing this quarter, bolstered by stronger
growth in sales to CLECs, or competitive local exchange carriers.
</P>
<P>
   Corsair Communications of Palo Alto, which makes software for
the wireless communications market, was hurt by weaker
international sales, particularly in Asia and Latin America.

HEDGIES ARE EDGY _ SELLING SHORT IS TOUGHER THAN IT LOOKS  
 BY MARK VEVERKA 
</HEADLINE>
 CHRON   c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
If you're worth your salt at selling short, it's a wonderful time
to run a hedge fund.
<TEXT>
<P>
   But if you're not so savvy at betting against the market, you're
probably taking it in the shorts.
</P>
<P>
   Hedge funds have been grabbing headlines because of the
Long-Term Capital Management debacle. But Long-Term Capital is not
your average hedge fund.
</P>
<P>
   The Greenwich, Conn., fund is a multibillion-dollar, high-risk
investment partnership run by a couple of Nobel Prize winners that
relied largely on computerized trading programs that few people in
the free world understood.
</P>
<P>
   Long-Term's biggest mistake was to borrow more money than it
could ever repay, which prompted about 13 securities firms and
commercial banks (i.e. the reckless lenders) to cobble together a
$3.6 billion bailout package.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, the more common hedge fund in which the fat cats
up the hill invest is likely to be a little more modest and,
hopefully for their sake, a little more judicious.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; What are hedge funds? They are private investment partnerships
for the rich that can use leveraged, or borrowed, money to
speculate on stocks, bonds and currencies. These funds are widely
misunderstood because they are largely unregulated and not required
to disclose a lot of information. Today, there are an estimated
3,500 hedge funds, with $134 billion in equity.
</P>
<P>
   The basic concept is that a portion of the portfolio is selling
stock short as a ``hedge'' against a downward stock market. (Short
sellers borrow stocks hoping that their prices go down. Then, they
buy the same stocks back at lower prices and pocket the
difference.)
</P>
<P>
   Trouble is, selling short is tough. And even the pros are having
a difficult time predicting the losers in this volatile market.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, a number of financial analysts and
stock-pickers quit their uptown firms to strike out on their own
and launch hedge funds.
</P>
<P>
   And why not? They have a chance to make 1 percent of their asset
base in fees plus upwards of 30 percent of all the profits they
make. And with all of the digital millionaires in the Bay Area,
there is plenty of uninvested dough to go around.
</P>
<P>
   But these are trying times for the hedgies. The third quarter
was bloody, with the Dow Jones industrial average tumbling more
than 12 percent. And the word on the Street is that the
inexperienced hedgies are getting their heads handed to them during
this, their first downwardly mobile market.
</P>
<P>
   To put it in perspective, the brokerage division at Montgomery
Securities that caters to investment partnerships clears trades for
about 350 funds. Of those hedge fund clients, about 150 have
portfolios down at least 12 percent for the year. What's more,
about 60 of those clients are down more than 27 percent for the
year. Obviously, the latter group is in quite a hole.
</P>
<P>
   But the good news, says Stephan Vermut, chief executive of
Montgomery Prime Brokerage Services, is that only two clients have
folded their tents so far.
</P>
<P>
   More important, about 70 of the clearing house's hedge-fund
clients are up 10 percent for the year. And it's that group of
managers who are proving their worth to their investors, Vermut
says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those who are doing well all have one characteristic in
common: They know how to short,'' Vermut says. ``They're hitting
the cover off of the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, those who don't know how to short are having trouble
making contact.
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; Gussied up:  &LR; Robertson Stephens Investment Management
continues to tidy up its affairs prior to a likely sale by its
parent, Charlotte, N.C.'s Bank of America. One important
housekeeping move is the restructuring of its Contrarian Fund,
which has been run by the firm's co-founder, Paul Stephens, since
the fund's inception in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   The contrarian portfolio has been one of the industry's biggest
clunkers in recent years. In total, investors have yanked some $480
million in net assets from the Robertson Stephens fund group during
the first half of this year.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, it's pretty hard to fetch top dollar for a fund
franchise when your star stock-picker is in a serious slump.
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, Stephens no longer will run the fund by himself.
Instead, he will share responsibilities with two other Robertson
Stephens Investment stock-pickers: Andy Pilara and Rick Barry.
</P>
<P>
   The mutual fund had been dubbed as a ``hedge fund for the
masses'' because it maintains a significant short position, a
characteristic commonly found in privately run hedge funds.
Unfortunately for Stephens, he had been betting short during the
recently tamed bull market.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to a team-management approach, the Contrarian Fund
will no longer own more than 5 percent of any given stock, a more
conventional approach to money management. At times, Paul Stephens
had invested as much as 25 percent of his holdings in a single
position.
</P>
<P>
   And finally, Robertson Stephens Investment has decided against
merging its malnourished Developing Countries Fund into its
small-cap value Partners Fund, a plan that was filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission and previously reported by
Street Smarts.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Robertson Stephens is doing the honorable (and rare)
thing: It's pulling the plug on the Developing Countries funds.
</P>
<P>
   Needless to say, mutual fund experts view most of these sweeping
moves as Bank of America's way of repackaging the fund group for
sale.

TEMPLETON SEES OPPORTUNITIES IN GLOBAL CHAOS  
 BY SAM ZUCKERMAN 
</HEADLINE>
   c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
   The original guru of global investing says plunging world
markets have created investment opportunities for patient
investors.
<TEXT>
<P>
   John Templeton, who was in San Francisco to pick up a lifetime
achievement award yesterday, said, ``You always have to do the
opposite of what everybody else is doing. The time to buy is the
point of maximum pessimism.''
</P>
<P>
   From 1954, when he founded the Templeton Growth Fund, to 1992,
when he sold his fund group to San Mateo's Franklin Resources for
$400 million, Templeton's flagship fund produced average annual
returns of more than 15 percent. And that was when the typical fund
earned a single-digit return.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the Templeton funds, like most foreign investments,
have fared horribly, dragging Franklin stock down with them. John
Templeton is no longer associated with the funds.
</P>
<P>
   Templeton, 85, moved to the Bahamas in 1962. Getting away from
New York, he said, improved his investment returns. ``Once we got
1,000 miles away, it was easier to do the opposite of everybody
else,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Interviewed at the Fairmont Hotel before receiving his award
from the Independent Institute, an Oakland think tank, Templeton
admitted he's hardly glanced at the markets since retiring.
</P>
<P>
   The Tennessee-born former fund manager devotes most of his
energy these days to his foundation, which promotes the growth of
``spiritual information,'' funding research on the healing powers
of prayer.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Templeton stressed, the fundamental principles of
managing money don't change. The current market downturn ``is just
another cycle. It's perfectly normal,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A lifelong adherent of the ``value'' school of stock picking,
Templeton advises investors to look for companies whose shares are
cheap relative to their profit potential. He scorns trend followers
who buy hot stocks, hoping prices will rise further, and warns
against trying to time market tops and bottoms.
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter what the conditions are, (the investor) wants to
have his money in those things that have the lowest price relative
to long-term value,'' Templeton said.
</P>
<P>
   In the years after World War II, Templeton urged clients to put
money into the Japanese stock market, which had just reopened.
</P>
<P>
   Back then, he said, ``I didn't find anyone who invested outside
their own nation. Here was an area that literally no one in the
world was working on.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite market twists and turns, the basic direction of stock
prices over time is up as long as economies grow over the long
term.
</P>
<P>
   Said Templeton: ``In almost every major market the chance of
losing money is almost zero if you leave your money in for at least
10 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Put your investments in markets that have already gone down.
Buy things that have the lowest market price relative to value,''
he counseled.

VAN GOGH'S WORKS SPEAK FOR THEMSELVES AT DAZZLING WASHINGTON
EXHIBIT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JANET TYSON 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The brother. The doctor. The postman.
</P>
<P>
   The ear. The suicide.
</P>
<P>
   As much as most people know about Vincent van Gogh, as
captivated as they are by his turbulent life story, there's one
issue left relatively unexamined: the paintings.
</P>
<P>
   True, a handful of van Gogh's often desperately, ecstatically
expressive pictures are icons of not just Western but world art _
among them ``The Starry Night'' (1889), with its writhing poplars
and swirls of light, as well as ``Sunflowers'' (1888) and
``Irises'' (1889) and his self-portraits. They manifest raw emotion
and spirituality in a way that people find irresistible, even when
printed on coffee mugs and refrigerator magnets.
</P>
<P>
   They are also known as fabulously expensive pictures.
</P>
<P>
   But is it possible to look at his paintings unencumbered by all
the baggage brought to their viewing? Will it be possible for
viewers to set at least some of those issues aside long enough to
appreciate the artist's great achievement as something more than a
document of his life?
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of lucky people will answer those questions for
themselves now that the hottest show of the fall exhibition season
has opened at the National Gallery of Art in Washington. Succinctly
titled ``Van Gogh's Van Goghs,'' it features 70 paintings from
Amsterdam's Van Gogh Museum, the world's single greatest collection
of van Gogh's art. It is the largest survey of his work, outside
the Netherlands, in more than 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   The museum opened 25 years ago, founded by the son of van Gogh's
beloved brother, Theo. And, almost immediately, it was evident that
its popularity exceeded its ability to accommodate visitors. With
one elevator and one staircase, the building was designed to take
in 60,000 visitors a year _ but it was getting nearly 1 million.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, the museum was shut down this year for a renovation and
expansion _ one that permitted several of its 200 treasures to
travel to the United States, rather than languish in vaults.
</P>
<P>
   An additional cache of works from the Van Gogh Museum is
featured through Jan. 13 in an exhibition at the Orsay Museum in
Paris. Also featuring works by Jean-Francois Millet, it shows van
Gogh translating Millet's realistic pictures of peasants into his
own idiom.
</P>
<P>
   ``With van Gogh, the National Gallery can't lose,'' says Mark
Thistlethwaite, who oversees the art history program at Texas
Christian University in Fort Worth. ``People see it because of the
legend and because of the art. Like `Titanic,' this show has
everything a blockbuster should have.''
</P>
<P>
   All 215,000 advance tickets have been dispensed (the NGA does
not charge admission but uses tickets to regulate gallery traffic),
while demand for the 1,800-2,300 daily tickets is expected to be
intense.
</P>
<P>
   Van Gogh mania perhaps reached its height in 1990, when
``Portrait of Dr. Gachet'' was sold at auction to a Japanese paper
magnate for a record $82.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   The first great Dutch master since the Baroque period, van Gogh
was born in 1853 and died by his own hand in 1890. Only the last 10
years of his life were devoted to painting _ but what paintings
they are!
</P>
<P>
   His most important early work, ``The Potato Eaters'' (1885), is
profound in its empathetic treatment of the poor. Its baroquelike
darkness gave way to light, however, after van Gogh visited Theo,
an avant-garde gallerist in Paris. There, van Gogh met Degas,
Seurat, Pissarro and other leading modern painters.
</P>
<P>
   Their impressionist use of color had an electrifying and
enduring effect on the self-taught Dutchman. But it was not until
van Gogh moved to the south of France that he produced his greatest
pictures. Working in the region's dazzling natural light, he wed
color with his early, dark expressiveness to produce canvases
pulsating with urgency.
</P>
<P>
   In those late works, the physical world is in a state of
emotional meltdown. Color for van Gogh was more symbolic than
descriptive _ yellow signified faith and love, cobalt blue
divinity, red and green the gross human passions _ but his
paintings remain rooted in representation.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a way, his work is so profoundly romantic,'' Thistlethwaite
says. ``His sense of translating his experiences to canvas really
comes through.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's work that rarely is chaotic, even though it often seems
on the edge of being in control. But the structuring of his
compositions is very well-informed.''
</P>
<P>
   Between gallery crowds and a surfeit of van Gogh info, ``the
possibilities of a contemplative experience in front of his work
are almost nil,'' Thistlethwaite says. ``But, if you can put all
that aside, just looking at the paintings _ the intensity of the
color, the real physicality of the paint on the surface _ you get a
vital sense of an artist present, creating the work and directly
engaging the viewer.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And that is what modern art is all about.''

   The Tennessee-born former fund manager devotes most of his
energy these days to his foundation, which promotes the growth of
``spiritual information,'' funding research on the healing powers
of prayer.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Templeton stressed, the fundamental principles of
managing money don't change. The current market downturn ``is just
another cycle. It's perfectly normal,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A lifelong adherent of the ``value'' school of stock picking,
Templeton advises investors to look for companies whose shares are
cheap relative to their profit potential. He scorns trend followers
who buy hot stocks, hoping prices will rise further, and warns
against trying to time market tops and bottoms.
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter what the conditions are, (the investor) wants to
have his money in those things that have the lowest price relative
to long-term value,'' Templeton said.
</P>
<P>
   In the years after World War II, Templeton urged clients to put
money into the Japanese stock market, which had just reopened.
</P>
<P>
   Back then, he said, ``I didn't find anyone who invested outside
their own nation. Here was an area that literally no one in the
world was working on.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite market twists and turns, the basic direction of stock
prices over time is up as long as economies grow over the long
term.
</P>
<P>
   Said Templeton: ``In almost every major market the chance of
losing money is almost zero if you leave your money in for at least
10 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Put your investments in markets that have already gone down.
Buy things that have the lowest market price relative to value,''
he counseled.

GRIZZLY QUARTER FOR MUTUAL FUNDS  
 BY ARTHUR M. LOUIS 
</HEADLINE>
   c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
When the quarterly statement from your 401(k) plan arrives in the
mail during the next few days, you'd better sit down and prepare
for a shock.
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was the worst quarter in eight years for the stock market, so
there's a good chance the bear ate a huge chunk of your retirement
money.
</P>
<P>
   The average domestic stock fund suffered a staggering 15.24
percent loss during the September quarter, reports Morningstar
Inc., the Chicago fund-tracking service.
</P>
<P>
   As usual, stock funds as a group trailed the Standard &AMP; Poor's
500 index, the principal market benchmark, which fell 10.07
percent. Only 16 percent of the 2,841 domestic stock funds surveyed
by Morningstar beat the S&AMP;P.
</P>
<P>
   International stock funds performed slightly worse than the
domestic funds, tumbling an average of 16.59 percent. The
worst-performing group of all was the 31 funds specializing in
Latin American stocks, which fell an average of 30.62 percent.
</P>
<P>
   If your retirement prospects hinge on a vibrant stock-market
performance, it's likely you endured a serious setback last
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, in the unlikely event that you switched all
your assets to bond funds when the quarter started, you may not
need any smelling salts when that fateful envelope arrives. Bond
funds gained an average of 0.77 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Funds specializing in federal government bonds rose an average
of 3.58 percent in the quarter, municipal-bond funds were up 2.56
percent, and taxable-bond funds gained 2.63 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The overall performance was pulled down by specialty bond funds
_ those invested in convertibles, junk bonds and other oddball
issues _ which lost 6.83 percent on average.
</P>
<P>
   Many bond funds benefited from the so-called investor flight to
quality during the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Investors concerned about the global financial crisis and its
possible dampening effect on the U.S. economy yanked billions of
dollars out of stocks and poured the money into bonds, which are
perceived as relatively safe investments.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to the positive bond-fund performance, the entire
universe of 6,599 mutual funds surveyed by Morningstar _ stock and
bond funds together _ did somewhat better than the S&AMP;P 500,
declining an average of 7.65 percent.
</P>
<P>
   As they have repeatedly in recent years, stock funds that focus
on large companies generally did better than those that invest
primarily in midsize and smaller companies.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;  Large-cap growth funds were down 11.13 percent for the
quarter, mid-cap growth funds lost 17.39 percent, and small-cap
growth funds fell 22.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The best-performing mutual fund of all was the Prudent Bear
Fund, based in Dallas, which gained a phenomenal 21.93 percent
during the quarter. As its name implies, it takes a pessimistic
view of the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   David Tice, the manager, says the fund, with $175 million in
assets, is a heavy short-seller of stock _ a classic bearish
strategy that often produces big profits in steeply falling
markets.
</P>
<P>
   In a short sale, an investor borrows stock and sells it, hoping
that the price will fall. If it does fall, the investor can buy it
back at the lower price and pocket the difference.
</P>
<P>
   Tice founded his fund in early 1996, when ``it became clear that
this market was dramatically out of control.'' His short-selling
tactics didn't help at first because the market continued to shoot
up through 1997 and into this year.
</P>
<P>
   During 1997, Prudent Bear lost 4 percent, while the S&AMP;P 500 was
gaining 33 percent. Now it has begun to make up the lost ground.
``We are still very, very bearish,'' Tice says.
</P>
<P>
   He holds particularly large short positions in consumer-credit
stocks, such as MBNA and Household International because he
believes that the economy will deteriorate to the point where
personal loan defaults become common.
</P>
<P>
   He also has shorted high-technology stocks, among them Intel and
Gateway, because he thinks that their profits will plunge due to
``too much production capacity and not enough demand.''
</P>
<P>
   The fund's few long positions include mainly precious-metals
stocks _ which tend to rise in periods of economic uncertainty.
</P>
<P>
   The worst-performing fund was Vontobel Eastern European Equity,
which plunged 40.48 percent in the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Wittwer, managing director of Vontobel USA, says the fund
has heavy investments in Hungary and Poland, whose stock markets
have been hit particularly hard by the global crisis.
</P>
<P>
   For a while, the fund, which has $45 million in assets, also was
heavily invested in the decimated Russian market, but managers have
``reduced our exposure there to zero,'' Wittwer says.
</P>
<P>
   Wittwer says he expects the fund to bounce back nicely in the
coming years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hungary, Poland and the Czech Republic will become part of the
European Union by 2003 or 2004,'' he predicts. ``That will have a
favorable effect on their capital markets.''
</P>
<P>
   Kurt Brouwer, with Brouwer &AMP; Janachowski in Tiburon, believes
that the stock market _ and stock funds _ will break out of their
funk fairly soon.
</P>
<P>
   He thinks that the market panic has reached a crescendo _
``everybody is focusing on what's negative'' _ and notes that
historically the market has always turned around when things looked
bleakest.
</P>
<P>
   Craig Litman, with Litman/ Gregory in Larkspur, speculates that
large-cap stock funds eventually may lose their perennial edge over
lesser-cap funds.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to question how long that can go on,'' Litman
remarks. ``A lot of people are throwing in the towel, thinking that
diversification doesn't work anymore. Diversifying across market
caps is supposed to lower risk, but that has not been the case
recently. But I think it still makes sense to be diversified.''

&HT;    COUPLE PLEAD GUILTY TO LURING MICHIGAN TEEN TO HOUSTON TO HAVE
SEX 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By STEVE BREWER 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   HOUSTON _ A husband and wife who used an Internet chat room to
lure a 16-year-old Michigan girl to Houston to have sex with them
have been placed on deferred-adjudication probation.
</P>
<P>
   State District Judge J. Michael Wilkinson also ordered probation
officers Thursday to monitor how Russell Ramsey, 42, and Jennifer
Ramsey, 20, use their computers.
</P>
<P>
   Wilkinson said the couple, who live at 12900 of Brant Rock, can
use the Internet and e-mail only for work purposes. He also ordered
them each to pay a $500 fine and perform 300 hours of community
service.
</P>
<P>
   After striking a deal with prosecutors and with the agreement of
the victim and her family, the couple pleaded no contest to the
charge of sexual assault of a child and Wilkinson withheld the
finding of guilt.
</P>
<P>
   Russell Ramsey was placed on seven years deferred-adjudication
and his wife got five years. Neither had a previous criminal
record.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutor Jerald Graber said the couple met and talked with the
16-year-old in a chat room for people seeking three-way sex and
asked her if she wanted to have sex with them.
</P>
<P>
   They then arranged for the girl to fly to Houston April 20 and
they sexually assaulted her during a five-day period, Graber said.
The girl, who was then weeks shy of her 17th birthday, ran away
from home to meet the couple and was found in Houston by a private
investigator hired by her parents.
</P>
<P>
   The girl told authorities in her home state the story after she
was brought home, Graber said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This just shows how much danger kids can get into in these
chat rooms,'' Graber said. ``Parents needs to be very careful in
allowing their children access to certain areas on the Internet.
It's a great information source, but it needs to be monitored, like
movies and music.'' &QL;

</P>
<P>
   FEATURE Stories
</P>
<P>
   DISNEY-HIGH-CULTURE (Burbank, Calif.) _ Like Coke or McDonald's,
the Disney name and brand is so implanted in the culture of the
nation and the world that to say the word is to evoke a wholly
defined universe _ in this case Disney's familiar panoply of antic,
animated icons and competent, comforting family entertainment. To
some they add up to imaginative, benign, pop culture marvels. To
others, they're just superficial cultural junk. ut the storyboard
outside Michael D. Eisner's office is a window onto another side of
the Mouse. Seemingly unnoticed, under Eisner's watch, Disney has
become a purveyor of what can only be described as high culture. By
Peter Applebome. &UR;  &LR; (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   FILM AND VIDEO
</P>
<P>
   SLAM-FILM (Undated) _ Marc Levin's feature film ``Slam'' is a
vivid marriage of ideas usually seen as contradictions: documentary
and fiction, action and poetry, black and white. ``Slam,'' which
opens here on Friday after screening in the New York Film Festival,
is the story of a young black performance poet, Raymond Joshua
(Saul Williams) who is imprisoned on a petty drug charge but who
manages to establish his identity and his voice within the
maelstrom of a Washington, D.C. jail. By Laura Winters. (Moved).

</P>
<P>
   CELEBRATION-TOWN (Celebration, Fla.) _ There are similarities
between the fictional movie town and this post-neotraditional town
built by those masters of make-believe, the Walt Disney Co. Both
are pretty and orderly, populated by smiling, waving residents and
blessed by sunny skies and warm temperatures. And like the movie
town, Celebration has its own unique rules and designs for social
engineering. But, after living here for 15 months, my family can
testify that Celebration is a real place, with its own attributes
and its own problems. Indeed, the town represents an ambitious,
real-life attempt by Disney to employ architecture and urban design
to revive the sense of community and place that Americans tell
pollsters are missing in traditional suburbs. By Douglas Frantz.
(Moved).
</P>
<P>
   IMPOSTORS-FILM (New York) _ Fox Searchlight on Friday released
``The Impostors,'' an ebullient slapstick comedy about two
down-at-heels actors who stow away on a luxury liner that Stanley
Tucci wrote, directed, produced and stars in with Oliver Platt.
This is his sophomore effort, following ``Big Night,'' the surprise
1996 hit he co-wrote with his cousin and co-directed with Campbell
Scott. By Karen Durbin. (Moved). Photo.
</P>
<P>
   DANCE
</P>
<P>
   KUDELKA-DANCE (Undated) _ James Kudelka walked through the
corridors of American Ballet Theater's headquarters on lower
Broadway in Manhattan as if he belonged there. Although he became
artistic director of the National Ballet of Canada in 1996, his
many years as a freelance choreographer make him feel at home with
troupes all over the world. Last month, he came down from Toronto
to coach Ballet Theater's second ensemble, the Studio Company, and
to make final arrangements for his troupe's one-week engagement at
City Center, which begins Tuesday. By Valerie Gladstone. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   THEATER
</P>
<P>
   DISNEY-ANIMATORS-THEATER (New York) _ The face of the Walt
Disney Co. on Broadway these days has many masks. Some are daring
and innovative, like those of ``The Lion King.'' Others are
theme-park safe yet intimidating _ both Beauty and Beast. Strip
them away and what is left? A matched pair of Disney executives who
reflect the company's theatrical countenance: Peter Schneider,
president, and Thomas Schumacher, executive vice president, of Walt
Disney Theatrical Productions. (They also run the Disney feature
animation empire in Hollywood.) Largely unknown, and mostly unseen,
save for a televised dash to the stage of Radio City Music Hall to
claim the best-musical Tony Award last June for ``The Lion King,''
the two men may be, potentially, Broadway's most powerful concealed
weapons. By Barry Singer. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   With Photo.
</P>
<P>
   CLASSICAL MUSIC
</P>
<P>
   NEW-MUSIC (Undated) _ I have a bad case of the post-avant-garde
blues. Whenever I hear people praise a new piece of music for being
``accessible,'' and for nothing else, I long for the days when new
music could strike terror in the soul instead of just aiming to
please. By David Schiff. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   MELLENCAMP-MUSIC (Minneapolis) _ John Mellencamp, 46, the artist
formerly known as Johnny Cougar, John Cougar and John Cougar
Mellencamp, will release his first album of all new material in
five years on Tuesday for Columbia Records. A kind of rock star
Job, he has somehow endured for two decades and 14 records. By Neal
Karlen. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   MOTHER-NATURE'S-RADIO (Undated) _ To hear Mother Nature's radio,
one must travel to an area free of electronic interference (the
desert, the jungle, Siberia, Central Park) with a specially made
very-low-frequency radio receiver tuned below the AM and FM bands.
And that is what a growing number of hobbyists have been doing over
the last few years, attracted not just by the sweet sounds and the
possibility of making discoveries in this bizarre branch of plasma
physics but also by the notion that to hear nature you must immerse
yourself in nature. By Neil Strauss. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   PIAZZOLLA-MUSIC (Undated) _ During one of the first performances
of Astor Piazzolla's self-described ``little opera,'' ``Maria de
Buenos Aires,'' in 1968, a voice rose from the audience, repeatedly
emitting profane exclamations. Backstage after the show, the
culprit was discovered: it was the Brazilian poet Vinicius de
Moraes, paying homage in his paradoxical way to the composer's
astonishing achievement. Piazzolla, after all, had managed to
compose a musical theater work that, like the rest of his Nuevo
Tango music, defied popular and classical categories and stood in a
class of its own. The violinist Gidon Kremer and his instrumental
ensemble, Kremerata Musica, will present in a concert version of
``Maria de Buenos Aires'' from Wednesday through Friday at the
Brooklyn Academy of Music in New York. By Pablo Zinger. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   CAGE-MUSIC (Undated) _ The Sonatas and Interludes are either the
sins of John Cage's youth or else the last of his important music.
It depends on what you think music is, and Cage had some different
ideas about that. The longest of these 20 pieces is a little over
four minutes, the shortest not quite two. What made them different
from the other music being written in 1948 was the medium: the
prepared piano, in which keyboard sound is transformed by strategic
insertions of foreign objects onto or between the piano strings.
Attached to a new version of the Sonatas and Interludes, played by
Aleck Karis and recorded by Bridge, is Cage himself in 1982,
reading a paper called ``Composition in Retrospect,'' which he
wrote the year before. ``The music is always going on,'' he says
several times. ``It is we who turn away from it.'' By Bernard
Holland. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   POP MUSIC
</P>
<P>
   ROCK-LESSONS (Undated) _ What life lessons, if any, has rock
handed down to future generations from its boundary-smashing
heyday? In ``That Says It All,'' a catchy Bob Dylan-style ballad on
his exquisite second album, ``Humming,'' the singer-songwriter
Duncan Sheik, 28, offers a short list of resonant catch phrases
slung by 1960s rock gods who are now either graying or dead. By
Stephen Holden. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   ART
</P>
<P>
   STERBAK-ART (Montreal) _ The conceptual sculpture of the
Canadian-based artist Jana Sterbak has inspired reams of humorless,
abstruse theoretical writing that leaves none of her layered
metaphors unturned. Yet Ms. Sterbak's work _ seductive, intensely
physical and edged with dark absurdity _ delivers a mind-body
frisson unknowable by intellect alone. In art circles in the United
States, she is perhaps best known for what could be called a piece
of wearable art. ``Vanitas: Flesh Dress for an Albino Anorexic,''
from 1987, is an actual shift of raw, sewn-together flank steak,
which, when fresh, was modeled (but not by the artist) and then
left to hang, rank and wizening, in a gallery. A wider view of Ms.
Sterbak's nuanced provocations will be furnished in a mid-career
survey of her work at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Chicago,
from Saturday through Feb. 21. By Ann Wilson LLoyd. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   CORNELL-DUCHAMP-ART (Philadelphia) _ The intense, cryptic, and
appropriately eccentric friendship between Joseph Cornell and
Marcel Duchamp is now the subject of ``Joseph Cornell/Marcel
Duchamp: In Resonance,'' an exhibition opening Thursday at the
Philadelphia Museum of Art and remaining on view through Jan. 3. By
Deborah Solomon. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   DISNEY-PARKS-ARCHITECTURE (Undated) _ It's easy to grant that
Disney's theme parks are full of strange creations, but do they
rate as poetry? ``The Architecture of Reassurance,'' a show of
Disney's theme park architecture that will open on Tuesday at
Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum, makes an affirmative case.
The work on view may seldom rise to the level of great poetry, but
it does fulfill the Greek idea of poetics as the making of a
culture's connective tissue. By Herbert Muschamp. (Moved). Photo.
</P>
<P>
   TELEVISION
</P>
<P>
   MAGGIE-TV (Los Angeles) _ Lifetime Television for Women, a basic
cable channel known hitherto mainly for documentaries and reruns of
women-in-crisis television movies, will make ``Maggie'' by the
comedy writer Dan O'Shannon one of three new women-oriented series
on its Tuesday night lineup. By Andy Meisler. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   ANTIQUES
</P>
<P>
   CEREAL-BOXES-ANTIQUES (Undated) _ Brightly-colored cereal boxes
that cost 29 cents with the cereal inside sell for $200 or $300 in
good condition. Scott Bruce calls these artifacts of post-World War
II America ``cerealectibles.'' He has been measuring, dating and
cataloguing them for the last several years and has just published
the second volume of a planned trilogy, ``Cereal Boxes and Prizes:
1960s'' (Flake World Publishing). He is also exploring the idea of
building a home for his collection of thousands of boxes. What he
has in mind is a cereal museum in Florida, near Disney World or
Universal Studios. By James Barron. (Moved).

TV PROGRAMMING A MALE GAME, DESPITE ADDING WOMEN TO LINEUP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEN PARISH PERKINS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jamie Tarses was the whiz kid who brought prosperity to NBC by
securing ``Friends'' and ``Mad About You,'' ``Caroline in the
City'' and ``3rd Rock From the Sun,'' but now she's considered to
be in way over her head. Her June 1996 move through the bulletproof
glass ceiling to ABC entertainment president was bold, and since
she had the audacity to be female and young (32), worthy of
unmitigated scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   Because a woman hadn't sat in the big chair of a Big 3 network
in, oh, ``ever,'' she was making up certain gender-specific rules
as she went along. So were others. Though not always in her favor.
</P>
<P>
   Mediawise, Nancy Tellem, settling in as the new entertainment
president at CBS since August, hasn't been met with the same
un-welcome as Tarses, which suggests she had several things in her
favor _ like age (45), loyalty, insiders' status, and crossing a
road now paved and checked for land mines.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, it doesn't matter. What hasn't changed is network
skittishness in allowing women to make key programming decisions
and to usher in some kind of creative change in the junk pushed
down our throats each fall.
</P>
<P>
   Exactly a year after Tarses' hiring, Stu Bloomberg was hired to
right the wrongs and save the world, which I suppose he did, since
Tarses is still on board and ABC still has a pulse. Tarses remains
president, but Bloomberg, a respected ABC exec, is ``chairman.''
They were equals, Bloomberg confirmed in January and reiterated six
months later. He didn't report to her or her to him.
</P>
<P>
   Odd, then, that when meeting the press as a tandem, Bloomberg
always leaps to answer questions first or to ``clarify'' something
Tarses has just said. (Or was he just doing the typical guy thing?)
</P>
<P>
   Tellem was vice president in charge of CBS business affairs and
the network's production studio. Unlike Tarses, who came from
another network, she was a loyal foot soldier marching up the
ranks, keeping her mouth shut, doing what she was told, putting in
zillions of hours.
</P>
<P>
   So when Leslie Moonves stepped up to network chairman, he tapped
his loyal business president for the top spot.
</P>
<P>
   But, as programming is Moonves' ``first love,'' he won't be
pulling away completely. He'll still have the final word on
development at CBS, of what gets on air when, why, where. Which
leaves Tellem to do what?
</P>
<P>
   The rash of female hires this year, including Pat Fili-Kruschel
as president of ABC Television Network, suggests a troubled
industry trying to smarten up and get new ideas from new blood. But
I don't believe it for a minute. The recent female hires at and
near the top of the network programming food chain won't loosen the
testosterone-laced grip on industry control.
</P>
<P>
   Women at the controls of television programming remain
intellectually suspect, despite impeccable successes from folks
like Nickelodeon founder Geraldine Laybourne, USA Network creator
Kay Koplovitz and Fox Kids Network founder and former President
Margaret Loesch. (These women gained programming experience in
cable after finding network doors shut.)
</P>
<P>
   And there are other reasons. In order to prosper, the women who
climb through network ranks are often forced to mold themselves in
their bosses' images, leading one to wonder whether they will be
either reluctant to rock their new boat or simply ill-equipped to
distinguish themselves from the men they replaced.
</P>
<P>
   You look at the 36 new series and wonder whether women would
make other choices. Would Tellem have tried to solve CBS' audience
and image problem by shifting to a male demographic with silly,
cartoonish offerings like ``Martial Law?'' Would she have killed
``Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman?'' Or by the time they make their climb
to network penthouses, have they shed their individualism anyhow?
</P>
<P>
   Last week, during the Radio and Television News Directors
Association convention in San Antonio, a young woman asked a panel
of network chiefs about their views on diversity.
</P>
<P>
   Most gave the corporate line _ we believe in it, we're trying.
But CNN Chairman and CEO Tom Johnson had it right when he looked
down the panel at Fox News Chairman and CEO Roger Ailes and CBS
President Andrew Heyward, and said, ``We are doing an inadequate
job ... what do you see in the three of us sitting here?''
</P>
<P>
   Three men who replaced men and will be replaced by men.

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Pockets of heavy rain amounting to as much as three inches were
reported Friday morning north of Joplin, Mo., along the
Kansas-Missouri border. The piecemeal rains were generated by a
developing low pressure system over the central Plains that lifted
moist air streaming north from the Gulf of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, the focus of rain associated with the low will shift
eastward over the Ohio River Valley. Though the low will not have
access to as rich a supply of Gulf moisture, moderate rains are
still possible from southern Indiana across Ohio and into western
Pennsylvania. Streamers of high and middle clouds will rapidly dim
the sun over the northern Middle Atlantic seaboard, but they should
stay sufficiently far south to insure a rather sunny day in eastern
New England.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, clusters of showers and thunderstorms will douse
parts of the Southeastern states as a small jet stream disturbance
lifts moist air over Mississippi, western Tennessee and Alabama.
</P>
<P>
   Farther west, areas of moderate rain will develop over western
Nebraska, western South Dakota and Wyoming as a low pressure system
emerging from the Rockies draws moist air westward up the sloping
terrain. Showers of rain or snow will fall in the Cascades of
Washington and Oregon and the northern Rockies as a high-altitude
pool of cold air swings slowly eastward from the Pacific Northwest.
Meanwhile, stubborn low clouds and fog will linger along the
southern California coast and in the southern San Joaquin Valley. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Delaying Chill &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Temperatures plummeted toward 32 degrees far inland from Lake
Erie on Thursday night, but readings stayed near 50 degrees at the
lake shore. After a warm September, Lake Erie has been warmer than
normal, but the reason for the disparity between lake shore and
inland temperatures has its roots in a basic difference between
land and water. Water cools off much slower than land, a trait that
meteorologists describe as a high heat capacity. Even once surface
water begins to cool, it sinks and warmer water from the depths
rises to replace it, thus slowing the inexorable slide into winter
chill. &QL;

GLOBAL TREND TOWARD DEMOCRACY HITS SNAGS IN SOME COUNTRIES 
</HEADLINE>
   Eric Alterman is the author most recently of ``Who Speaks for
America? Why Democracy Matters in Foreign Policy,'' which is due
out this month.  
 (bl)  
 By ERIC ALTERMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The worldwide trend toward greater democracy is generally
thought to be one of the clearest and most unarguable benefits of
the end of the Cold War. But recent developments in once hopeful
nations like Russia, Peru, Algeria Cambodia and the former
Yugoslavia, among many others, have begun to give even the most
devoted democrats pause.
</P>
<P>
   In these countries and dozens of others, one can find leaders
who were elected in reasonably respectable elections but who rule
in a manner more consistent with traditional tyrannies, without the
legal protections typically associated with life in Western
democracies.
</P>
<P>
   Fareed Zakaria, the managing editor of Foreign Affairs magazine,
has labeled this disturbing phenomenon ``illiberal democracy'' and
estimates that at least half the 118 ``democratizing'' countries in
the world fit this model. ``Illiberal democracy is a growth
industry,'' Zakaria writes. ``Seven years ago only 22 percent of
democratizing countries could have been so categorized; five years
ago that figure had risen to 35 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   Elections can do more harm than good, Zakaria argues, in nations
lacking a firm foundation in constitutional liberalism, meaning the
rule of law, a free press, an independent judiciary and open
economic transactions.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, Zakaria says that nondemocratic entities like Singapore
and Indonesia ``provide a better environment for the life, liberty
and happiness of their citizens than do either dictatorships like
Iraq and Libya or illiberal democracies like Slovakia or Ghana.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States and the West, he urges, should show more
patience with semi-democratic nations with one-party systems or
elected authoritarian rulers as long as they ``accord their
citizens a widening sphere of economic, civil, religious and
limited political rights.''
</P>
<P>
   His views, first published in Foreign Affairs magazine
(November-December 1997) in an article called ``The Rise of
Illiberal Democracy,'' has started a passionate, worldwide debate.
On one side are scholars who think the 34-year-old editor may have
presented a new theoretical foundation for American foreign policy
in the next century. On the other are those who fear his arguments
will be exploited to excuse and embrace oppression abroad, in much
the same manner that anti-communism was used to justify the
coddling of right-wing dictators during the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   Owen Harries, the Australian-born editor of The National
Interest, says Americans might benefit from a European ``raised
eyebrow approach'' to nations that call themselves democracies in
the third world. John Shattuck, assistant secretary of state for
democracy, human rights and labor, and J. Brian Atwood,
administrator of the U.S. Agency for International Development, for
example, complained in a responding article in Foreign Affairs:
</P>
<P>
   ``Zakaria's liberal autocrats look liberal only in comparison
with the totalitarian rulers that preceded them. The abuse of human
rights and repression of political choice makes these autocracies
poor alternatives to governments committed to democratization.''
</P>
<P>
   If an argument cautioning against the embrace of too much
democracy sounds heretical to Western ears, Zakaria says, it
actually mirrors the West's own historical experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only in the late 1940s did most Western countries become
full-fledged democracies, with universal adult suffrage,'' he
observes. ``But 100 years earlier, by the late 1840s, most of them
had adopted important aspects of constitutional liberalism _ the
rule of law, private property rights and increasingly, separated
powers and free speech and assembly.''
</P>
<P>
   He says, ``The factors most closely associated with full-fledged
liberal democracies are capitalism, a bourgeoisie and a high per
capita GNP.'' Most such regimes can be found in East Asia, with the
model being Hong Kong under British rule. Lee Kuan Yew of Singapore
is also a liberal autocratic hero to Zakaria, even though
Singapore's chief delegate to the United Nations, Bilahari
Kausikan, insists that his nation ``has never pretended or aspired
to be liberal.''
</P>
<P>
   But Zakaria insists that Singapore is nonetheless destined for
democracy in the long run. ``Lee Kuan Yew thinks Singapore will
never hold elections,'' Zakaria says, but Emperor Franz Josef of
the Austro-Hungarian Empire ``thought the same thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Nondemocratic Taiwan, Malaysia and Indonesia all fall on the
positive side of Zakaria's ledger as well because of the
protections they offer their citizens regarding property rights,
legal structures and trade.
</P>
<P>
   Owing at least in part to meager competition, illiberal
democracy seems to be the leading candidate to become American
foreign policy's new guiding paradigm. During the ``long, twilight
struggle'' with the ``evil empire,'' the Cold War foreign policy
establishment steeled itself on the ideas front with a slender
essay published in 1946 by a Moscow embassy official then
relatively unknown, George F. Kennan. Published in the July 1946
issue of Foreign Affairs under the pseudonym X and called ``The
Sources of Soviet Conduct,'' it set out the principles of
containment, which guided American foreign policy through the fall
of the Berlin wall 43 years later.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1989, however, U.S. foreign policy mandarins have drifted
aimlessly in an intellectual sea of circumstance without
ideological ballast. That summer, Francis Fukuyama offered up a
strong contender in the new paradigm sweepstakes, entitled ``The
End of History.'' This former State Department official argued that
no great challenges to Western-style liberal capitalism were likely
to arise and so, ideologically speaking, history had ended.
</P>
<P>
   Critics found Fukuyama's thesis provocative but difficult to
apply to the real world, and recently even Fukuyama has articulated
reservations in light of Russia's backsliding toward the
possibility of a state-controlled economy.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994 Samuel Huntington, the Harvard political scientist and
Zakaria's mentor, offered a thesis based on the notion of a global
``clash of civilizations.'' Huntington divided the globe largely
into Western nations and the Muslim world, which ``threatened
Western domination'' with ``kin-country rallying'' and ``the threat
of broader escalation.'' Despite some initial excitement, his rigid
division also failed to cohere as an agreed-upon new paradigm.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Zakaria's entry, which he plans to expand into a book, is
therefore nothing if not well timed. Huntington, generally
considered a conservative, is quite sympathetic to illiberal
democracy. He sees it as building on work he did in the early 1970s
that was critical of modernization theory, then fashionable, under
which it was assumed that capitalism would inevitably lead to
progressive democracies. Huntington insisted that modernization
models, which some scholars believe led directly to the Vietnam
War, paid insufficient attention to the creation of sturdy
political institutions.
</P>
<P>
   Stanley Hoffmann, who was also an adviser to Zakaria in the
Harvard government department, is considerably less sanguine. He
notes that the idea that ``universal suffrage can be exploited is
something we have known since the French Revolution.'' He shares
the view that the argument will be ``used for a defense for
authoritarian regimes that are preferable to democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics of both the neo-isolationist left and the
neo-conservative right join Hoffmann, a liberal internationalist,
on this point. Bruce Cumings, a Korean specialist at the University
of Chicago, says that Zakaria has wrongly attributed South Korea's
progress as a democracy to the presence of liberal constitutional
prerequisites, like an open economy and respect for the right to
own property.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was pressure from below,'' he argues, ``from the unions and
the radicalization of the middle class that forced the autocrats
from power. Before this took place, whatever rights people had were
to a considerable degree a sham, because property and liberty could
be removed from any individual overnight at the whim of the ruling
elite.''
</P>
<P>
   The conservative Robert Kagan, a senior associate at the
Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington, is also
unpersuaded. He says most of the countries Zakaria is talking about
are simply dictatorships. ``They are tyrannies,'' he says. ``Fareed
has labeled a phenomenon that doesn't exist.'' Kagan also worries
about what will happen if paradigm and policy align themselves. He
says Zakaria's proposal may soon guide U.S. foreign policy because
``the foreign policy community is dominated by realist thinking and
business interests, and the corporate community would love to hear
that you don't want to promote democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone endorsing the theory fits Kagan's categories,
however. Sherle Schwenninger, a senior fellow of the liberal World
Policy Institute, thinks the adoption of the Zakaria paradigm would
improve United States foreign policy by helping ``to temper
America's moralizing tendency to look only at the superficial
aspects of democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   The argument, he says, ``helps people to understand that
democracy building is a longer-term historical process that
requires a lot of favorable conditions coming together.''
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott says the word
``democracy has come to stand for a bit of an oversimplification.''
Without directly addressing Zakaria's model, Talbott maintains,
however, that it ``would be wrong and unfair to suggest that the
U.S. government support for democracy is limited to a simple-minded
`vote free, vote fair, vote frequently' strategy. It is much more
sophisticated about fostering and sustaining liberal institutions
than such criticisms imply.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet whether illiberal democracy gains currency as a governing
paradigm may depend less on the idea's specific merits than on the
historical moment itself. As Hoffmann wearily observes: ``Today is
not a time for big ideas. Foreign policy paradigms today are a lot
like French fashion. They are launched with lots of fireworks, but
we move on so quickly, nothing can be resolved.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Women are losing their grip on status bags. Or so it
seems, judging by the logo-laden bags clenched by well-heeled
businessmen around town. There are now briefcases emblazoned with
double G's from Gucci, double F's from Fendi, LV's from Louis
Vuitton and paisley swirls from Etro _ all a man could want and
more. Can it be long before Oprah Winfrey devotes a show to
shop-aholic executives, ``Today, the man who went out for one new
briefcase and came home with 80''?
</P>
<P>
   Such a prospect would have been impossible 20 years ago. Back
then, cases were confined to a few trusty styles. But like men's
suits, they have had a style evolution. Once stiff and boxy, the
briefcase relaxed in the early 1980s. Coach introduced softer,
suppler, more casual models that became hot accessories for working
men and women alike.
</P>
<P>
   But now, as with men's suits, the virtues of structure are being
explored by a new generation of designers and consumers, who are
trying to find a happy medium between the rigid attache case and
the soft Coach-style bag.
</P>
<P>
   Within the last few years, Prada and Gucci re-ignited interest
in briefcases, offering light, sleek, handled cases in black
leather with a slight luster. A sharp new model from Gucci ($1,150)
is big enough for a laptop and slick enough to carry down Madison
Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   Salvatore Ferragamo, at Saks Fifth Avenue, offers a similarly
neat design ($790), with a slightly sturdier frame and more
substantial leather.
</P>
<P>
   Bergdorf Goodman has a small but distinctive selection,
including a flat portfolio style ($695) in bridle leather from
Tanner Krolle, an English accessories house. Bergdorf also has
cases by Lambertson Truex, a popular new leather goods firm that
has cases not only in the safely stylish Gucci-Prada vein but also
sportier models with tote-bag-style handles. One that includes a
pullout nylon case for a laptop is $780. A simpler, zippered
calfskin model is $890.
</P>
<P>
   One of the best and broadest selections is at Barneys New York,
with dozens of styles, ranging from an old-fashioned black case
reminiscent of a doctor's bag in bridle leather ($650) to a softer,
pigskin case ($795) to a nylon Prada case styled after a suitcase
($730).
</P>
<P>
   The brief-size suitcase, whose vaguely nerdy appeal contrasts
nicely with the luxe label, is also made by Louis Vuitton,
available for $870 at the company's new boutique in Soho.
</P>
<P>
   Such prices may sound like avenue robbery, but the truth is,
status bag or no, men don't run out to buy another briefcase to
match every new pair of shoes. They tend to use the same one for
years.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there are cheaper labels that have their own
idiosyncratic charm. One clever choice is the canvas and leather
bag with the black logo of Klein Tools, $45.98 at Weinstein &AMP;
Holtzman, a hardware store in lower Manhattan. The Klein Tools
14-inch bag makes as hip a briefcase as any. And for the man who
loves matched luggage, there are larger models, for big tools and
weekends.

`STRANGELAND': GRUESOME AND BORING 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Production notes at end of review.)  
(lb) 
 By ANITA GATES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   There are just two good lines in Dee Snider's movie
``Strangeland.'' One is when Robert Englund, best known as Freddy
Krueger, appears in a crowd of reporters and protesters outside a
supposedly rehabilitated mass murderer's house and mutters,
``Somebody's got to take that boy out.''
</P>
<P>
   The other is the mass murderer's own comment after having been
hanged (well, nearly) by a lynch mob: ``What a rush!'' They don't
sound like much, but the delivery and the context help.
</P>
<P>
   ``Strangeland,'' whose writer, star and co-producer is Dee
Snider, lead singer of the heavy-metal band Twisted Sister, is both
gruesome and boring, and that's quite a feat.
</P>
<P>
   It's the story of one upstanding police officer and Kevin
Costner look-alike, Mike Gage (played, for complete nomenclature
confusion, by Kevin Gage), and his teen-age daughter, Genevieve
(Linda Cardelini). Genevieve is abducted and tortured after she and
her best pal accept a party invitation from a guy they met in an
online chat room.
</P>
<P>
   Gage actually finds the guy, Carleton Hendricks a k a Captain
Howdy (Snider, with more face and body piercings than you can shake
a septum spike at), in a dark room lined with candles and inhabited
by naked torture victims with various involuntary piercings of
their own.
</P>
<P>
   Gage arrests Hendricks and saves Genevieve, but _ darn that
criminal-justice system _ the jury finds Hendricks not guilty by
reason of insanity, and four years later he's out on the street,
cleaned up, unpierced and reportedly a completely new man. But you
know better than that, and so does Gage, and the new chase
continues predictably.
</P>
<P>
   Everybody behaves pretty stupidly, even the murderer. There are
a lot of close-ups of human body parts being pierced by large
spikes. There is absolutely no tension. And the only usable moral
seems to be that chat rooms are not always our friends.

   &QL;  GOP: SENATE RACE OVER BEFORE IT STARTED
</P>
<P>
   By Paul Kane
</P>
<P>
   States News Service
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, Oct. 2 -- For State Rep. William Lloyd, his campaign
for the U.S. Senate has been caught in what his aides call a
political ``Catch 22.''
</P>
<P>
   His fundraising totals have been anemic, and his showing in the
polls remains in the 20-percent land. Potential donors would be
willing to give to the Somerset Democrat's campaign against
incumbent GOP Sen. Arlen Specter -- but only if his standing in the
polls rose, which can only occur if Lloyd has the money to put TV
and radio ads on the air.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have to think there's going to be a reason to give,''
said Susan Roach, a Lloyd campaign aide. ``It's a Catch 22. If
Lloyd could get this money, this could be a horse race at the
end.''
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, however, Republicans said Friday that Specter had
made all the right moves long before Lloyd had even gotten into the
race. ``It's been a non-race up there,'' said Dave Hansen, national
field director of the National Republican Senate Committee, the
Washington-based strategy and fundraising wing for Senate
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Specter) basically won the election before the election
arrived,'' Hansen said, calling Specter's effort one of the two
best Senate campaigns for the 1998 election cycle.
</P>
<P>
   Heading into the final month of the campaign Lloyd is driving
around the state in his gold Dodge, trying to rally support and
raise enough money so that he can run some television ads, possibly
on low cost cable stations, Roach said. So far, the Dodge has
logged 11,000 miles crisscrossing the state.
</P>
<P>
   Specter, on the other hand, has $3.2 million in his campaign
account, according to campaign manager Kent Gates. All told,
Specter has raised more than $6.6 million for his re-election bid,
$500,000 of it coming in the July-September quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Specter's fundraising machine has actually cooled off a bit, now
that it appears Lloyd won't be able to mount much of a fiscal
challenge.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of the incumbent's fundraising prowess, Specter still
cannot overwhelm pollsters. According to a Keystone Poll, run by
Millersville University professor G. Terry Madonna, Specter led
Lloyd by 25 points.
</P>
<P>
   The bad news for Specter, and something to give Lloyd a glimmer
of hope, was that the three-term incumbent Republican still only
managed to get 52 percent of the vote in the poll, with about 20
percent undecided.
</P>
<P>
   Gates, Specter's campaign manager, downplayed the polling
numbers, saying that Pennsylvania still has 450,000 more Democrats
than Republicans and that he's a socially liberal Republican from
Philadelphia. Not a good mix in the mostly conservative, rural
state.
</P>
<P>
   Some were less equivocal. ``He's controversial,'' said Madonna,
who coordinated his poll with the Philadelphia Daily News and KYW
news radio in Philadelphia. ``There are people in both parties who
have a visceral reaction to Specter.''
</P>
<P>
   Noting the undecided voters, the Democratic Senatorial Campaign
Committee said, ``Lloyd has an opportunity to capture their vote
and make a serious challenge to Specter.''
</P>
<P>
   But only if he can find the money to get his message on the air.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's under financed and not well known,'' said Madonna.
</P>
<P>
   The most successful fundraiser for Pennsylvania Democrats,
Philadelphia Mayor Ed Rendell, said he just can't generate any
interest for the Lloyd race in the eastern part of the state. He
said Lloyd's best tactic would be to push for getting on as many TV
and radio talks shows -- the ``free'' media -- to try and create a
buzz about his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't give money just because I say to give money,''
Rendell said in a recent interview. ``It's impossible to get our
people interested in (the Lloyd campaign).''
</P>
<P>
   But Hansen, the NRSC aide, said Specter has positioned himself
well on the issues. Cynics would say it is classic Specter, all
over the political map.
</P>
<P>
   One day in late September, Specter cast his vote in favor of
banning the controversial partial-birth abortion procedure, a
conservative position that helped quell any serious challenge in
the Republican primary. A few days after that vote, Specter
supported an effort by liberal Democratic Sen. Edward Kennedy,
D-Mass., to raise the minimum wage.
</P>
<P>
   That's the sort of zigzagging Lloyd would like to highlight in
the next month. ``He's on both sides of all issues,'' Roach said of
Specter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just hard not to have the money to do this.''

A COMPOSER DEFYING CATEGORIES  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, OCT. 4) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 Pablo Zinger, a Uruguayan-born conductor and pianist who worked
with Astor Piazzolla, lives in New York.  
 By PABLO ZINGER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   During one of the first performances of Astor Piazzolla's
self-described ``little opera,'' ``Maria de Buenos Aires,'' in
1968, a voice rose from the audience, repeatedly emitting profane
exclamations. Backstage after the show, the culprit was discovered:
it was the Brazilian poet Vinicius de Moraes, paying homage in his
paradoxical way to the composer's astonishing achievement.
</P>
<P>
   Piazzolla, after all, had managed to compose a musical theater
work that, like the rest of his Nuevo Tango music, defied popular
and classical categories and stood in a class of its own.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Piazzolla's description, ``Maria de Buenos Aires,''
which the violinist Gidon Kremer and his instrumental ensemble,
Kremerata Musica, will present in a concert version from Wednesday
through Friday at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, is not really an
opera as we know it.
</P>
<P>
   The vocal interventions are more often recited than sung; the
singing is written for tango or cabaret performers, and the
original orchestra was a mere extension of Piazzolla's own quintet,
of bandoneon, violin, guitar, piano and bass, with strings, flute
and percussion, adding up to only 11 players.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, the original performances were oratoriolike events,
in which the singers, narrator and band shared the stage, almost
statically.
</P>
<P>
   The music of ``Maria de Buenos Aires'' is choice Piazzolla. The
vocal segments feature memorable melodies in a variety of styles,
from the composer's trademark pulsating tangos to dreamy milongas
and waltzes, and even the odd march.
</P>
<P>
   The music beneath the recitation lends inspiring background
without being obtrusive, and the instrumental segments rank among
the best examples of Piazzolla's output. The theme ``Fuga y
Misterio,'' for example, weaves a superb fugue out of a 12-bar
syncopated theme chock-full of notes, segues into a powerful tutti
and ends in a quiet Baroque arioso.
</P>
<P>
   Piazzolla himself regarded ``Maria'' as the beginning of his
most productive period and the precursor of his most successful
songs. Many of those, like the widely performed ``Balada Para un
Loco,'' were co-authored by the other person indissolubly linked to
``Maria de Buenos Aires,'' the Uruguayan-born poet Horacio Ferrer.
</P>
<P>
   As a teen-ager, Ferrer met Piazzolla, who was 12 years older, in
1948, when the composer was a band leader in Buenos Aires. After
the publication of Ferrer's first book of tango-inspired poems, in
1967, Piazzolla suggested that they work together on a piece for
musical and poetic theater.
</P>
<P>
   They rented a summer house in the tiny seaside resort of Parque
del Plata, Uruguay, and wrote most of ``Maria'' together during 30
days of frantic work.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to writing the libretto, Ferrer played El Duende
(The Goblin), reciting his poetry onstage in the initial run of
performances and in the original-cast recording of 1968. He will
reprise that role in the BAM version alongside Argentine singers,
Julia Zenko and Raul Lavie.
</P>
<P>
   The performances follow a new recording of the work by most of
the same forces, led by Kremer, who is one of the most forceful and
dedicated champions of Piazzolla's music today (Teldec
3984-20632-2; two CDs).
</P>
<P>
   The significance of these efforts cannot be overestimated. Latin
American opera and musical theater are rare commodities outside and
even within Latin America, and ``Maria de Buenos Aires'' has had a
motley performance career. The original run was a financial
disaster.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father had to sell everything to keep the show going, even
his modest Fiat 600 car, in order to pay the carpenters for the
scenery,'' the composer's son, Daniel Piazzolla, said recently.
Reviews were mixed, and the few foreign performances did not
materialize until much later.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem with exporting the work may have stemmed
from the libretto, which is written in Lunfardo, the slang of the
Buenos Aires and Montevideo demimonde and of many tango lyrics. An
obscure dialect of Spanish incorporating Italian, French and
Portuguese expressions, Lunfardo is hard even for Spanish speakers
to understand.
</P>
<P>
   Then, too, the story is bound to confound those expecting a
traditional opera plot. Ferrer's poetry mixes a surreal and
symbolic cocktail of the common life of the Rio de la Plata, the
mythical world of tango and prostitution, and Roman Catholic
religion and rituals.
</P>
<P>
   Maria was born in the suburbs ``one day when God was drunk,''
the text proclaims. ``The mother wove idleness; the father hauled
down failures.'' Rejecting the call of innocent, pure love, she
departs for the great city, where she descends into a life of tango
and prostitution, which ends in her death at the end of Act I,
early by operatic standards, and her condemnation to roam the
streets of Buenos Aires, escaping sunlight.
</P>
<P>
   In Act II, Maria's shadow encounters surreal interlocutors,
including a Circus of Freudian Analysts. The Goblin pines for the
lost Maria and conveys a message, offering her the secret of
fertility and redemption.
</P>
<P>
   Consistent with an elaborate parallel to the Mother of Christ,
Maria, immaterial and thus ``virgin forever,'' is united with the
spirit of the Goblin and gives miraculous birth not to a boy but to
a girl, also called Maria.
</P>
<P>
   A fantastical story, blasphemous to boot, and a challenging
libretto have added to the fascination as well as the difficulty of
``Maria de Buenos Aires.'' Efforts to ``fix'' the work have
included an adaptation by two Argentines, Jacobo Romano and Jorge
Zulueta, which was presented by the Houston Grand Opera in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   With the narration mostly obliterated and the singing parts
extended, the operation was a success, but the patient lay dead on
the table.
</P>
<P>
   The adaptation is roundly condemned by Daniel Piazzolla, who
says that his father disapproved of it, and by Kremer, who hews
close to the original format. Kremer's recording uses a new
arrangement by Leonid Desyatnikov, which reduces the forces to only
eight instruments and tries to update the sound. The reassignment
of parts, though by no means an improvement, remains respectfully
and serviceably close to the original.
</P>
<P>
   The new recording invites comparison with the 1968 version (on a
Trova CD), which may still be found in stores. There, Piazzolla
himself, on bandoneon, was joined by Amelita Baltar and Hector de
Rosas as vocalists. Wisely, Kremer professes no desire to improve
on that performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``The substance of the piece, the incredible balance between the
poetry and the music, was lost in some of the recordings,'' he
said, ``except the very first one, which remains a document that we
should all respect.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Piazzolla leads his instrumentalists with demonic force,
and the vocalists are splendid, obviously benefiting from their
prolonged theatrical exposure. Ms. Baltar, a folk singer, was
Piazzolla's longtime lover in a relationship that ended in
acrimony.
</P>
<P>
   As Maria, her voice is tremulous, breathy, rough and limited in
range, but her unique delivery and involvement are hard to surpass.
</P>
<P>
   None of the Kremerata artists can yet claim such absolute
ownership of the material, but they deliver a loving and legitimate
version. Ferrer, Ms. Zenko and Jairo, the male vocalist, joined
Kremer just days before the recording.
</P>
<P>
   The tempos are consistently slower than in the original version,
and the singers are more cautious with rubato. It will be
interesting to see on Wednesday how the current Kremerata tour with
the work has affected interpretation.
</P>
<P>
   The Kremerata recording is beautifully produced, with extended
historical notes and complete translations of the libretto in
German, French and English. (The English is about 95 percent
accurate.) The sound is clear, but balances sometimes favor the
instruments to the detriment of the singers and narrator, who will
be aided by amplification in live performance.
</P>
<P>
   Kremer's recent dedication to Piazzolla is remarkable. He has
released two splendid volumes on Nonesuch (``Hommage a Piazzolla''
and ``El Tango'') and has recently recorded an album with the young
Kremerata Baltica and another featuring ``The Four Seasons of
Buenos Aires.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Coming to Argentina and listening to plenty of tangos, I
always heard this very special voice that appealed to me and would
say, `There is a personality,' and this personality was Astor
Piazzolla,'' Kremer said. ``As with any other genius of old times
or new times, I just wanted to come as close as possible. At that
time, I didn't even dream of performing it. But later, when I found
myself able to participate in it, there was no other choice than
just to look for more and more scores or instrumentations, or
create instrumentations myself, in order to feel at home in
Piazzolla-land.
</P>
<P>
   ``Piazzolla said, `I wrote all kinds of music, but never happy
music.' This was a striking statement for me because Franz Schubert
said the same in a letter to a friend. Since I was close to
Schubert, it was rather easy for me to build a bridge to Piazzolla.
</P>
<P>
   Piazzolla in his works, in his constructions, gives me the
freedom I don't always find in other contemporary composers. I am
not yet over with the Piazzolla frenzy in my life. I am still fully
in love with this composer, and I can imagine that I will still
have something to do with him in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Kremer offers a rare opportunity to take a serious
look at ``Maria de Buenos Aires.'' Will the public penetrate its
mysteries? Will stage productions follow? From heaven or hell, the
maestro is watching.

   NEW YORK _ Alan Thicke was distracted. In his basement dressing
room at the Shubert Theater, minutes after his second performance
in the hit musical ``Chicago'' on Thursday night (Thicke has the
role of Billy Flynn, originated by Joel Grey), two Hollywood agents
were congratulating him.
</P>
<P>
   But Thicke could think only about an onstage slip of the tongue.
``I said `his,' not `hers' when I referred to Roxy in the first
act,'' he said of Roxy Hart, a star role.
</P>
<P>
   The actor, known as the father of Kirk Cameron on the ABC sitcom
``Growing Pains,'' brooded until the door swung open. In walked
Gina Thicke, his wife, who is a former Miss World. She was bundled
in a long black coat with a fur collar and accompanied by five very
blond, 30-something friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your hair is different,'' Thicke immediately told her.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, she said; she had visited a salon that afternoon and gone
from blond to brunet. ``I wanted to try something different,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hmmm,'' Thicke said.
</P>
<P>
   He offered champagne all around.
</P>
<P>
   A little later, the festivities moved to Simply Caviar on Park
Avenue, where the ``Chicago'' cast gave a party to welcome its new
star, who was making his Broadway debut.
</P>
<P>
   On the way over in a car, Thicke, 51, who had changed into a
perfectly pressed navy pinstripe suit, said he was amused that
everyone seemed to be calling him a fresh face in New York. ``At my
age being a new face is pretty funny, especially in this town, and
especially without liposuction,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Thicke, who is from northern Canada and had never spent more
than three consecutive days in New York before, said that he was
eager to see the sights: the Statue of Liberty, a Yankees game, a
Rangers practice (the Canada thing).
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Thicke, 29, however, was more eager to see the stores.
``Shopping,'' she said. ``Yes, yes. Of course.''
</P>
<P>
   At the party, where mounds of caviar and bottles of Champagne
were consumed with gusto, Thicke mingled with his wife's friends
and cast members, as well as with the Hal Linden (of ``Barney
Miller''), Robert Wuhl (Arliss on the HBO series), Elizabeth
Vargas, the television anchor, and even Robin Cousins, the Olympic
figure-skating gold medalist.
</P>
<P>
   A party crasher approached a press agent for the show, mistaking
him for Thicke, and asked, ``How's your baby?''
</P>
<P>
   ``What baby?'' the press agent said. ``I do not have a baby.''
(The Thickes have a 14-month-old boy, Carter).
</P>
<P>
   Thicke seemed to be having fun until he fell into a serious
conversation with Wuhl, who was upset that his HBO series has been
canceled. ``We're waiting to hear within the next 48 hours if that
decision is going to change,'' Wuhl said.
</P>
<P>
   Toward the end of the evening, around 1 a.m., Mrs. Thicke sat
with her husband at a quiet table.
</P>
<P>
   ``How did you do?'' she asked. She had missed the show.
</P>
<P>
   ``I messed up a pronoun,'' he said.

concerns of national unity and put his 2.7 million people first.
Gov. Dmitri Ayatskov, 47, identified by President Boris Yeltsin
himself as a rising young star who may be president someday, warned
that if the national government cannot fix Russia's problems
``undoubtedly the governors will unite their efforts to solve the
problems themselves,'' he told the Cox News Service in a recent
interview. The central authority of Moscow has been undermined by
the economic turmoil in Russia, prompting governors across the
country's 89 regions to usurp the role of the federal government --
and in some cases to defy it in mutinous fashion. (Holmes, Cox News

narrow strip of land that winds all over the country dividing the
former warring parties. The northern part of Bosnia is still the
most contentious and their job here is very different from soldiers
who patrol the relatively quiet streets of Sarajevo. Here, they put
on flack jackets and helmets when they wake up in the morning and
they don't take them off until they go to bed, even if they stay on
McGovern Base all day long. About 1,000 soldiers from Fort Hood
will ultimately be stationed at this northern base, with the rest

 &HT;    AS READINESS DECLINES, PORK GROWS IN DEFENSE
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ ``Everybody's to blame,'' Sen. John McCain said in
a soft, resigned tone.
</P>
<P>
   Seven years after the Cold War ended, a shrinking U.S. military
has drifted into a decline that is alarming experts. Training has
been shortchanged, Navy ships are setting sail with a shortage of
crew members, and the Air Force can't keep pilots from being lured
away by the higher salaries of private airlines.
</P>
<P>
   But what really irks McCain, he said Friday, is that even as
troop strength and funding have been reduced, members of Congress
continue to spend billions of defense dollars on pet projects for
their home states and districts.
</P>
<P>
   ``More and more often, people look at a defense appropriations
bill as a giant pork barrel, as opposed to a vehicle for defending
our national security interests,'' the Arizona Republican said.
</P>
<P>
   The issue heated to a boil this week as the top military brass,
in a rare open disagreement with the lawmakers who approve their
budgets, complained that defense readiness was suffering because
funds are diverted for building aircraft and ships and keeping
bases that the Pentagon does not want or need.
</P>
<P>
   High on the list of ``pork'' projects are 20 C-130 transport
planes, pushed through by House Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., and
built in his home district at Marietta. The aircraft, which were
not requested by the Pentagon, cost $1 billion over three years.
</P>
<P>
   Those huge transports have another powerful ally in Congress,
since some are destined for National Guard units in the home state
of Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss. Lott has also sought
funds toward building a $1.5 billion ship that the Navy has not
requested, but which will keep the shipyard busy at his Gulf Coast
home town of Pascagoula.
</P>
<P>
   Far from being embarrassed by promoting such projects, lawmakers
openly tout them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The speaker believes that the C-130s are an integral part of
our air fleet and must be modernized,'' said Gingrich spokeswoman
Mary Brown Brewer. She released letters from the speaker imploring
Air Force officials to ask for the transports and a letter written
by Marine Corps Commandant C.C. Krulak calling the planes
``crucial'' to Marine operations.
</P>
<P>
   Lott has publicly bragged about snaring defense projects for his
state. ``Whenever he helps Mississippians that's hardly anything he
ever has much regret for,'' spokesman John Czwartacki said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, the Senate's scold on pork spending, has combed through
the defense appropriations bill now pending before Congress and
found $4.5 billion in ``pork'' that was added by lawmakers. About
$1 billion of the extras are in new Air Force procurements and
research projects that the Pentagon didn't request, ranging from a
$25 million F-16 fighter aircraft to be built in Fort Worth, Texas,
to $9 million to study the ionosphere at an Alaska research center.
</P>
<P>
   ``You put the pork in enough districts and states and it has its
own built-in constituency,'' said David Williams, who researches
spending for the watchdog group Citizens Against Government Waste.
Since 1995, his group has identified more than $8 billion in
``pork'' each year in defense spending.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, once a die-hard Republican, said he has now concluded,
``They're all the same. The Republicans are just as bad as the
Democrats. When they get behind closed doors, it's 'what can we do
for each other?' ``
</P>
<P>
   McCain acknowledged his party's failings in curbing waste.
``Republicans promised to stop this if we gained the majority,'' in
Congress, he said. ``Obviously, that has not happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, McCain and others charged that the Clinton
administration shoulders much of the blame for inattention to the
festering problems in the military.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Clinton politicized the already unpopular issue of
base closings in California and Texas during the 1996 elections.
That has complicated efforts to appoint a new commission to
identify more bases that could be closed, saving an estimated $21
billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president has not focused on these defense issues,''
McCain said. ``So therefore, defense has sort of drifted, as far as
the administration is concerned _ which naturally makes for more
pork barreling.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he had hopes that Congress would eliminate some of the
excess spending this year, McCain offered a firm, ``No.''

   NEW YORK _ No surgically enhanced Barbie clones. No overly
attentive cocktail waitresses. No businessmen with $100 bills in
their teeth. Willkommen to the Blue Angel Cabaret, where crowds
line up for a different kind of erotic entertainment. The weekly
show, at the House of Candles, a Lower East Side performance space,
is part ``Showgirls,'' part ``Broadway Danny Rose.''
</P>
<P>
   From behind the gold lame curtains the other night emerged an
exotic dancer in a furry Minnie Mouse costume; a dancer who poured
hot wax on herself, then writhed on a stage strewn with glitter,
and a chanteuse in a sequined gown singing ``Cry Me a River'' while
stripping down to fishnet stockings and a jeweled G-string, as if
out of a 1950s stag film.
</P>
<P>
   Scores it wasn't. This is burlesque, the deliberately bawdy and
raucous revue that was the underbelly of vaudeville in the 1930s.
Banned by Mayor Fiorella LaGuardia in 1937, burlesque is enjoying a
popular revival at a time when city officials are once again
cracking down on the adult entertainment industry.
</P>
<P>
   While dancers at topless clubs are forced to tie on bikinis,
tassels are spinning from otherwise bare breasts at burlesque shows
from the Lower East Side to Broadway's hottest ticket, the revival
of ``Cabaret.''
</P>
<P>
   How do the shows avoid the fate of conventional adult
entertainment? Shouldn't they end with a chorus of police whistles
and sirens?
</P>
<P>
   By trading on kitsch appeal, burlesque is wrapping itself in the
mantle of performance art _ more Karen Finley than Elizabeth
Berkley _ and escaping the current crackdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always seen erotic dancing as an art form,'' said Ute
Hanna, the producer of the Blue Angel Cabaret, which performs
Friday and Saturday nights at midnight at 99 Stanton St. A native
of Hamburg, Germany, and a pioneer of New York City's burlesque
revival, Ms. Hanna started the Blue Angel in 1993 in a club in
Tribeca. The idea was to create a space where women and couples as
well as single men could watch strippers perform on their own terms
and to their own music, combining striptease with such diverse
elements as spoken word, singing and fire-eating.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd waiting for a midnight show outside the Blue Angel on
a recent Friday bore a closer resemblance to experimental theater
fans than to the stereotypical image of lonely men skulking around
Times Square flesh palaces. As its name suggests, the Blue Angel
conjures images of the Weimar Republic more than of the old 42nd
Street. The doorman wore a pinstriped suit and leather armbands.
Since the club serves only beer, the men and women waiting
impatiently for the doors to open carried bottles of champagne and
margaritas-to-go from a Mexican restaurant down the street.
</P>
<P>
   Although the performers are mostly women, the audience is split
evenly between men and women. Fannie Agri, a baker who lives
downtown, was there with her husband. ``At a topless bar, they're
just entertaining men,'' she said. ``Burlesque is a lot more about
entertaining everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Yuliy Lebedeu, a production company owner, was looking for
contortionists to hire for a film project. ``I've been going to a
lot of burlesque shows around here lately,'' Lebedeu said. ``The
fire-eaters, contortionists, they make it creative. Topless bars
are really boring. All they do is dance around.''
</P>
<P>
   In a burlesque show like the Blue Angel, the strippers range
from the barely daring to the genuinely scandalous _ one woman
performed an explicit routine with a string of pearls. A house
favorite is Bonnie Dunn, a saucy singer with a smoldering voice,
and her traditional fan dance, learned from Bernadette Brookes, who
performed it in the supper clubs of the '50s.
</P>
<P>
   Originally, the Blue Angel featured racier acts _ bottomless
dancers and lap dancing. In the summer of 1996, Ms. Hanna lost her
lease and was forced to close the Blue Angel. When she reopened it
in its current home last June, she toned things down. ``I wanted to
create an alternative to the exploitative strip clubs in New
York,'' she said. ``I think we're living in a time when people
don't even know what eroticism really means.''
</P>
<P>
   Not so coincidentally, her revision of the show dovetailed with
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's crackdown on adult video stores and strip
clubs, which went into effect this summer. How burlesque-style
entertainment fits into the world of a porn-free New York has been
the subject of some debate in the mayor's office.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were discussions about legitimate theatrical
performances which did feature nudity but were not predominantly
focused on adult entertainment,'' said Melanie Myers, the general
counsel for the city Planning Department and a drafter of the
zoning regulations that are closing adult-entertainment businesses.
``I don't recall the word `burlesque' being used, but things of a
similar nature were discussed. My gut reaction is that burlesque is
in the clear.''
</P>
<P>
   Club owners are quick to defend even the most daring acts as a
form of performance art. Even so, they feel pressure to keep city
guidelines in mind when planning a program.
</P>
<P>
   At the Red Vixen Burlesque, a show produced by Catherine
Hourihan and her partner, David Wales, on Sundays at 9 p.m. at the
Flamingo East, 219 Second Ave., Ms. Hourihan performs a routine she
calls ``Kitty Kat.'' Her breasts are hidden by no more than a
dusting of black glitter. Like other burlesque performers, she
distinguishes between her act and traditional topless
entertainment. ``Burlesque is much more about the performance and
the creative element,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Before the burlesque revival, many of the dancers worked in
traditional topless bars. They say they prefer the new scene as
much for the better working conditions as for artistic freedom.
</P>
<P>
   Velocity Chyald, a fixture at the Blue Angel and the Red Vixen,
has worked at Billy's Topless and the Paradise Club, conventional
strip clubs, where a typical night is grueling. ``They put you on
stage every hour for 30 minutes for an eight-hour shift,'' she
said. ``It's like being a hamster on a treadmill.''
</P>
<P>
   Most entertainers at the Blue Angel perform only one or two
routines nightly. The audience also appreciates performances that
are not strictly erotic. ``I don't think I could say half the
things I do at a strip club without having tomatoes thrown at me,''
Velocity Chyald said. For a routine she calls ``Amoeba Sack,'' she
enters the stage draped in a translucent plastic drop cloth,
recites original poetry and projects flashlight beams over her
body, which is naked under the cloth, save for a pair of butterfly
wings.
</P>
<P>
   Despite their professed dismay at the city's increasing
scrutiny, burlesque entrepreneurs may owe the mayor a debt. His
crackdown has fueled interest in their nascent industry. Tom
Tenney, the producer of a revue called the Grindhouse Alternative
Burlesque, Tuesdays at 9:30 p.m. at Tonic, 107 Norfolk St., isn't
sure if his show conforms to the city's statutes. But he senses
that audiences are finding it all the more enjoyably subversive
since the Mayor lowered the boom.
</P>
<P>
   ``Suddenly, without any difference in content, the show is now
more political,'' Tenney said. ``When you see bare breasts on
stage, everyone in the audience knows that this is something that
is no longer being tolerated in the city.''
</P>
<P>
   But how long will it last? The flier for the Red Vixen
admonishes prospective patrons to ``Rush in before Rudy discovers
us!''

 &HT;    JOE LOCKHART, A COMBATIVE PRESS SECRETARY FOR A CONTENTIOUS TIME
 &HT;    750&AMP;add.
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After 20 years in politics and journalism, Joe
Lockhart has reached the natural pinnacle of his twin professional
passions.
</P>
<P>
   As he officially begins his new job as White House press
secretary on Monday, however, Lockhart is puzzled.
</P>
<P>
   ''When I first came to Washington, people who worked on
campaigns weren't celebrities,'' he said, standing outside the
spacious West Wing office he'll occupy. ''When did this get so
glamorous _ and how come I'm not glamorous?''
</P>
<P>
   Behind his glib one-liners, the self-effacing Lockhart seems to
understand at least part of the answer: being the public window
into the Clinton presidency will surely be a highly visible post,
but it won't be all glamour.
</P>
<P>
   After all, Lockhart is stepping up to the podium amid a
'round-the-clock media feeding frenzy over the worst scandal to
rock the White House in a generation.
</P>
<P>
   While his predecessor, Michael McCurry, had to contend with nine
months of press inquiries about Clinton's relationship with former
White House intern Monica Lewinsky, it has now fallen to Lockhart,
39, to become the public face of the administration as House
Republicans lurch toward what could be lengthy impeachment
proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   Intellectually aggressive and quick to rise to a challenge,
Lockhart's press room manner is expected to be decidedly more
combative than McCurry's often dismissive style.
</P>
<P>
   In the verbal fencing that unfolds in the daily White House
briefings, insiders are already poised to see the Lockhart lunge
replace the McCurry parry.
</P>
<P>
   ''He can put the sharp wit to it, and sometimes that comes with
a bit of a sting, but sometimes that's what it takes,'' said Jay
Byrne, who worked with Lockhart on Clinton's 1996 presidential
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ''Joe didn't take any of the barbs lying down,'' said Byrne, who
left the administration last year to become director of public
affairs for the Monsanto Co. in St. Louis. ''He's the perfect
person for the job right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Comfortable with reporters and unintimidated by network
superstars, Lockhart is largely a product of television news.
</P>
<P>
   He's married to Laura Logan, a former television network
producer who covered the State Department until recently, when she
left to help raise their 4-year old daughter, Clare.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart himself has alternated between broadcast journalism and
politics throughout a career that has taken him through three
American networks _ ABC, CNN and NBC _ in addition to the British
SKY Television News.
</P>
<P>
   Like many a Democratic operator, Lockhart paid his dues working
in the press operations for a string of ill-fated presidential
contenders _ Jimmy Carter in 1980; Walter Mondale in 1984 and
Michael Dukakis in 1988. He spent the next six years in London,
moved to Washington in 1995, and served, at McCurry's urging, as
national press secretary in the 1996 race.
</P>
<P>
   During Clinton's second term, Lockhart has served as deputy
press secretary, a post from which he's looked on, at times in
anger, at the often contentious dance between the press and the
president in the era of 24-hour news networks, the Internet and an
insatiable information appetite that never sleeps.
</P>
<P>
   ''Nobody ever stops to take a breath,'' said Lockhart, who
laments that many journalists report information before it has
received the careful vetting and consideration that was standard in
newsrooms just a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everyone's 24 hours and everyone's got a web page,'' Lockhart
said. ''It's no longer an issue of questioning people's motives _
it's questioning the ability of people to work in an environment
where nobody ever stops.''
</P>
<P>
   Even as deputy press secretary, Lockhart waged something of a
personal crusade against reporting that starts out based on
innuendo, gets broadcast by one news reporter, repeated by a few
more, and can, with astonishing speed, become the talk of pundits
who form the conventional wisdom in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ''It starts out as a rumor and by the end of the day its has got
a nice suit on it and it's a fact,'' said Lockhart. ''The bottom
line is, it's still a rumor in a good suit.''
</P>
<P>
   It isn't only journalists who are to blame, Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our political discourse is greatly in need of an injection of
civility, and greatly in need of penalizing those who won't be
civil,'' said Lockhart. ''When the public starts exacting a price
from political leaders who won't be civil, then I think you will
start to see a difference.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart's immediate task will be to defend Clinton from
scandal-related attacks while trying to prevent the president's
career from being defined by his relationship with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ''Generally in the last two years of an administration, a great
deal of it is put into looking at what has been done, and recasting
it and shaping it into a legacy, and I think Joe will be part of
that,'' said Martha Joynt Kumar, who is writing a book on Clinton's
relationship with the White House press corps to be titled ''Wired
for Sound and Pictures.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond simply trying to burnish Clinton's tarnished public
image, Lockhart faces the job of trying to sell White House
initiatives to the public.
</P>
<P>
   ''You have to build support for your programs coalition by
coalition,'' said Kumar, who teaches political science at Towson
University near Baltimore. To do that, she said, ''you will
constantly need a good communications plan.''
</P>
<P>
   That part of the press secretary's job has become infinitely
more difficult amid the daily pulse of the Lewinsky scandal.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think we have some pretty large challenges,'' Lockhart said
in an interview. ''There are serious issues that this president
grapples with every day in leading the country, and our job is to
focus the attention back on those issues in order to move the
president's agenda forward.''
</P>
<P>
   As McCurry learned, it can also be difficult serving two masters
_ the truth and this president.
</P>
<P>
   After months of dodging questions and protecting his own
credibility by intentionally knowing as little as possible about
the Lewinsky matter, McCurry signed off on Thursday by admonishing
Lockhart to remember that his job is to tell the public the truth.
</P>
<P>
   ''The press secretary of the United States works for the people
who pay him _ the people of the United States of America,'' McCurry
said. ''That's where your first and only obligation is _ to the
truth and to helping the American people.''

   RUSSIA-REGIONS _ SARATOV, Russia _ The political and financial
disorder of Moscow seems faraway and irrelevant in this city on the
mighty Volga River, in the heart of Russia's southern farming and
industrial district. When the current economic crisis seized the
country two months ago, the regional governor of Saratov overlooked
concerns of national unity and put his 2.7 million people first.
Gov. Dmitri Ayatskov, 47, identified by President Boris Yeltsin
himself as a rising young star who may be president someday, warned
that if the national government cannot fix Russia's problems
``undoubtedly the governors will unite their efforts to solve the
problems themselves,'' he told the Cox News Service in a recent
interview. The central authority of Moscow has been undermined by
the economic turmoil in Russia, prompting governors across the
country's 89 regions to usurp the role of the federal government --
and in some cases to defy it in mutinous fashion. (Holmes, Cox News

patrol through a northern segment of the Zone of Separation, a
narrow strip of land that winds all over the country dividing the
former warring parties. The northern part of Bosnia is still the
most contentious and their job here is very different from soldiers
who patrol the relatively quiet streets of Sarajevo. Here, they put
on flack jackets and helmets when they wake up in the morning and
they don't take them off until they go to bed, even if they stay on
McGovern Base all day long. About 1,000 soldiers from Fort Hood
will ultimately be stationed at this northern base, with the rest
scattered around the country. (Nesmith, Cox News Service).

GRAND VITARA MAKES MUCH BETTER SENSE THAN ITS NAME
</HEADLINE>
 
(EDS: Accompanied by CARS-GLANCE) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By G. CHAMBERS WILLIAMS III 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Confidential to all of you who are considering a compact
sport-utility:
</P>
<P>
   If you want one that has as much utility as it has sport, a true
sport-ute rather than just sport-cute, you'll want to check out the
all-new Suzuki Grand Vitara.
</P>
<P>
   OK, it is a stupid name, but you have to get beyond that. It was
picked by Suzuki officials in Japan, and they probably had no idea
that it sounds rather silly in English.
</P>
<P>
   Don't let that turn you off the vehicle, though.
</P>
<P>
   Because for the first time, there finally is a vehicle with the
power, style and comfort of a larger and more expensive SUV, with
the off-road prowess that you might expect from a Jeep or a Land
Rover.
</P>
<P>
   Replacing the boxy Suzuki Sidekick (and its clone, the
Geo/Chevrolet Tracker), the Vitara is wedge-shaped with rounded,
aerodynamic lines. The body is similar to those of the Honda CR-V
and Kia Sportage.
</P>
<P>
   And guess what? Even the high-end Grand Vitara is priced to fit
modest budgets. Our fully-equipped test vehicle, the
top-of-the-line JLX-plus version with four-wheel drive, listed at a
remarkably low $21,429, including $430 transportation.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, that's almost as high as the top-end Honda CR-V, but the
Suzuki has a V-6 engine, compared with a four-cylinder in the CR-V,
and it comes with a true off-road-capable four-wheel-drive system
that includes a two-speed transfer case for serious hill-climbing.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, the Suzuki is a lot tougher than the CR-V or the
smaller Toyota RAV4, both of which are built on a car chassis: the
CR-V on the chassis of the Honda Civic and the RAV4 on the
previous-generation Toyota Celica platform.
</P>
<P>
   The Vitara, on the other hand, is built like the Mercedes-Benz
ML-320, Land Rover and Isuzu Trooper _ a body attached to a full
ladder frame, making the vehicle sturdy enough for really rough
off-roading.
</P>
<P>
   With its 8-inch ground clearance, shift-on-the-fly part-time
four-wheel drive and two-speed transfer case, there's almost
nowhere this vehicle can't go, from mild dirt roads on the deer
lease to the roughest stretches of the Rubicon Trail in
California's Sierra Nevada mountains.
</P>
<P>
   Yet this is also a refined, comfortable, smooth-riding passenger
vehicle on the highway, thanks to its front MacPherson-strut and
five-link rear suspension system. Careful attention has been paid
to controlling noise, vibration and harshness, making the Grand
Vitara much quieter and more carlike than the Sidekick. Such
features as liquid-filled engine mounts and rubber body-to-frame
mounts help account for the quiet ride.
</P>
<P>
   The V-6 engine is the most powerful in the mini-SUV class.
Everybody else's model comes with just a four-cylinder. This
all-new engine, designed specifically for the U.S. market, is rated
at 155 horsepower and 160 foot-pounds of torque. It's no speed
demon, but it provides more than adequate power for high-speed
freeway driving, as well as merging and passing.
</P>
<P>
   The Vitara comes with either a five-speed manual gearbox or a
four-speed automatic with lock-up torque converter, which helps
deliver better fuel economy. As a longtime off-road explorer, I
recommend the automatic for serious backwoods use; it's much easier
to maintain traction with an automatic while climbing steep hills.
</P>
<P>
   In two-wheel-drive mode, the Grand Vitara uses just the rear
wheels to move the vehicle. In four-wheel drive, which can be
engaged up to speeds of 62 mph, a pneumatic actuator automatically
engages the front differential and axle, eliminating the need for
locking wheel hubs. That means you don't have to get out of the
vehicle to lock or unlock the front hubs.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, there is plenty of room for five adults and lots of
luggage/camping gear. There are bucket seats up front, and
three-across bench seating in the rear.
</P>
<P>
   My only serious complaint is the poor visibility to the rear
from the driver's position because of the high head rests on the
two outboard rear seating positions. If you regularly carry small
kids or a dog, you might want to remove the head rests so you can
see to back up safely.
</P>
<P>
   The cargo area is accessed by opening a swing-out rear door; the
spare tire is attached to the outside of the door. There is room
for 22.5 cubic feet of gear with the back seat up; with it folded
down, the space expands to 44.6 cubic feet.
</P>
<P>
   The Grand Vitara is the V-6 version of the just-plain Vitara,
which comes with a 2.0-liter inline four-cylinder engine rated at
127 horsepower and 134 foot-pounds of torque. The Vitara is
identical to the new Chevrolet Tracker, and both are made in a
joint General Motors-Suzuki factory in Canada. The Grand Vitara
comes from Suzuki's Japanese plant.
</P>
<P>
   Chevrolet won't be getting a V-6 version anytime soon, Suzuki
officials say. That arrangement allows Suzuki to differentiate the
Vitara from the Tracker by offering an uplevel, higher-powered
version not available at Chevy dealers.
</P>
<P>
   The Vitara and Tracker will also be sold in a two-door soft-top
model, whose standard engine is a 1.6-liter four-cylinder with 97
horsepower and 103 foot-pounds of torque. The 2.0-liter
four-cylinder is optional on the two-door, but the V-6 is not
offered.
</P>
<P>
   There are four versions of each of the Vitaras: the JS and
JS-plus models are two-wheel drive; the JLX and JLX-plus models are
four-wheel drive. The ``plus'' designation adds four-wheel antilock
brakes, which are not available on the other versions.
</P>
<P>
   Standard equipment on our test vehicle included
air-conditioning, alloy wheels, dual remote-control power mirrors,
power rack-and-pinion steering, dual front air bags, remote keyless
entry, power windows and door locks, Clarion AM/FM/cassette stereo
with four speakers, front sport bucket seats, full cloth
upholstery, cruise control, dual cupholders, carpeted floor,
color-keyed bumpers, split fold-down rear seat, automatic-on
headlights, rear wiper and washer, and tinted glass.
</P>
<P>
   Base price for the Grand Vitara JLX-plus is $20,999 plus
transportation; no options are offered.
</P>
<P>
   EPA fuel-economy ratings for our V-6 model with automatic
transmission were 18 miles per gallon in the city and 20 mpg on the
highway. The tank holds 17.4 gallons.

   ``It was so weird. It was really weird. Like really weird.'' _
Monica Lewinsky's vivid description to Linda Tripp of an encounter
with ambassador to the United Nations Bill Richardson.
</P>
<P>
   This is ridiculous. They're ridiculous. We're ridiculous.
</P>
<P>
   Why was I so fascinated by the excerpts of conversations between
confidante Linda Tripp and blabbermouth Monica Lewinsky as they
scrolled across the newswire Friday? Why was I eagerly sifting
through the garbage of these transcripts and then sending choice
snippets to colleagues and friends?
</P>
<P>
   TRIPP: Just because you wear a red sweater does not mean you
have to wear red lipstick.
</P>
<P>
   LEWINSKY: I understand that.
</P>
<P>
   TRIPP: OK. I'm just trying to ...
</P>
<P>
   LEWINSKY: I wouldn't ever wear red lipstick to see him.
</P>
<P>
   TRIPP: Good.
</P>
<P>
   It ain't exactly Nixon and Haldeman discussing hush money and
cover-ups, now is it?
</P>
<P>
   Let's put this in another context. If you were sitting in a
restaurant and Linda Tripp and Monica Lewinsky were at the next
table, having these exact conversations, you'd be rolling your eyes
and yelping: ``CHECK!''
</P>
<P>
   Picture it now. Two unpleasant people, dominating and dragging
down the room. Tripp, sucking on a Marlboro Light and making a
circular hand-motion to the waiter, indicating she'd like another
vodka tonic for herself and a cosmopolitan for her friend;
Lewinsky, seething quietly because they were supposed to share the
creme brulee as a split dessert, but Linda totally monopolized the
plate.
</P>
<P>
   And they're yapping. Loudly discussing Monica's older, married
boyfriend, the one she calls ``the creep,'' among other nicknames.
</P>
<P>
   They're obsessed. Pathetic. Annoying. Obnoxious. Juvenile.
</P>
<P>
   LEWINSKY: And then I'm gonna wear the navy dress I wore to the
radio address that still has the (REDACTED) on it for Thanksgiving.
</P>
<P>
   TRIPP: Well, how _ you're what, you're gonna get it cleaned?
</P>
<P>
   LEWINSKY: Yeah.
</P>
<P>
   TRIPP: Oh, God.
</P>
<P>
   LEWINSKY: Well, I mean, like I haven't worn it for a year, you
know?
</P>
<P>
   TRIPP: Yeah.
</P>
<P>
   LEWINSKY: It's about time. Out with the old, you know?
</P>
<P>
   TRIPP: Oh, that's too bad.
</P>
<P>
   LEWINSKY: I know ...
</P>
<P>
   TRIPP: See, I think I would suggest another outfit for the radio
address that makes you _ I mean, for the radio address _ for the
Thanksgiving that makes you look so beautiful.
</P>
<P>
   LEWINSKY: Well, that dress _ I don't care about pretty; I care
about thin. That's all I care about.
</P>
<P>
   ``Check PLEASE!'' I feel as if the entire country should be
calling for the check right now, trying to escape as quickly as
possible from the hellish feeding trough known as Washington, D.C.,
where they continue to work themselves into a dither over this
stupid affair. Enough!
</P>
<P>
   The legality of the conversations surreptitiously recorded by
Tripp still hasn't been established, but the ``public's right to
know'' has once again prompted the release of reams of supposed
evidence in Kenneth Starr's shameful investigation of the
Clinton-Lewinsky affair.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, expect the Clinton camp to emerge as the
beneficiaries as the strategy backfires. Once again, expect an odd
groundswell of sympathy and support for the president and
especially the first lady in the wake of this release. Tripp's
plotting and Lewinsky's whining does nothing to enhance the
argument of those who favor impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, that prospect seems increasingly ludicrous. What, the
country should be put on hold while government leaders hold
hearings in which they'll rehash the minute details of stained
dresses, cigars and sexual quirks _ and now these chirpy
conversations about lipstick and ``beard burn''?
</P>
<P>
   All those in favor of this entire mess going away forever, say
``Aye.''
</P>
<P>
   All those opposed, drive to the nearest food pantry,
unemployment office and/or under-equipped public school and explain
to the people there why this Starr investigation is so important.

`IN THE PRESENCE OF A CLOWN': BERGMAN'S MOVIE WITHIN A MOVIE MADE
FOR TV
</HEADLINE>
  (editors: production notes at end of review)  
 (bl)  
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   When great filmmakers reach old age, their work tends to grow
sparer and more austere, the texture stripped away so that the core
themes of a lifetime's output jut out like bones under crumbling
flesh.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the Presence of a Clown,'' Ingmar Bergman's two-hour 1997
made-for-television movie, is such a film. A gloomy, murky, static
work laced with an absurdist gallows humor, it doesn't try very
hard to entertain or to look beautiful.
</P>
<P>
   But the movie, which the New York Film Festival is screening
four times at the Walter Reade Theater on Saturday and Sunday, is
still a must-see for Bergman aficionados.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the Presence of a Clown'' takes off from a story Bergman,
who is now 80, discovered among the papers left by an uncle who
appeared as a main character in his autobiographical films ``Fanny
and Alexander'' and ``Best Intentions'' and who is played here, as
in those two movies, by Borje Ahlstedt.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the familiar Bergman themes _ the absence of God, the
meaninglessness of life, the thin line between sanity and madness,
fear and rage at the void _ are restated in the new film, but here
the tone is darkly comic. Be warned, however: ``In the Presence of
a Clown,'' which is set in the mid-1920s, is not the ``rollicking
farce'' the film festival puffery claims. It's quite depressing.
</P>
<P>
   Death, a familiar figure in Bergman films, puts in an
appearance, this time in the person of a leering white-faced female
clown named Rigmor (read rigor mortis), who first appears to Carl
Akerblom ( Ahlstedt), an eccentric inventor, while he is
incarcerated in a mental hospital. Within minutes of her
appearance, she has bared her chalky breasts and coaxed him to have
sex with her. Carl has been hospitalized after trying to kill his
young fiancee, Pauline (Marie Richardson). Exactly why he turned on
her is never specified except that Carl is subject to inexplicable
fits of despairing fury in which he goes temporarily berserk.
</P>
<P>
   When we first meet Carl, he is playing and replaying a scratchy
recording of funereal piano music by Schubert, whose death obsesses
him. He browbeats his doctor into imagining how the composer must
have felt when he discovered a syphilitic chancre. After pondering
the question, the doctor bluntly replies that Schubert must have
felt ``a sinking feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In the Presence of a Clown'' is about how Carl (who appears to
be Bergman's stand-in) deals with that sinking feeling. Upon his
discharge from the hospital, he decides to make a movie. Carl
boasts of having invented a new cinematic art form, the living
talking picture. And the second half of ``In the Presence of a
Clown'' follows the making of the film in which actors from behind
the screen speak dialogue mouthed by the characters in the silent
movie.
</P>
<P>
   The plot of Carl's film is an unwieldy grafting of the story of
Schubert's final years to another story told to him by a fellow
mental patient about a beautiful 14-year-old countess in the early
1900s who is turned into a high-priced courtesan by her stepfather
and becomes a sexual legend while somehow maintaining her technical
virginity. In Carl's version, the countess and Schubert have a
tragic love affair.
</P>
<P>
   After many production woes, the movie is completed and has its
premiere in the village where Carl grew up. But the event, which
begins smoothly, turns into a technical fiasco when an electrical
explosion threatens to burn down the house. The evening is saved by
the actors, who improvise a staged reading by candlelight, and the
tiny audience of friends and relatives agree that the reading was
better than the movie. (Might this be Bergman's assertion that when
all is said and done, theater is a truer art form than film?)
</P>
<P>
   ``In the Presence of a Clown'' opens with that familiar epigraph
from ``Macbeth'' about ``sound and fury, signifying nothing,''
which is as pessimistic as any Shakespearean pronouncement. But as
you watch Carl suffer hellish mental torments during his final days
(the character is 54 but looks much older), his perseverance in the
realization of his cinematic dream acquires a certain nobility.
</P>
<P>
   The movie within a movie even suggests that ``In the Presence of
a Clown'' is Bergman's ``Unfinished Symphony.'' Whatever it may be,
moviemaking keeps Carl sane and distracted for a while. Perhaps
that's the most we can expect of art.
</P>

HOW TO DRESS FOR A DIVORCE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Kan.)   (For release Sunday, Oct. 4)  
(lb) 
 By ANNE JARRELL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It's my first day in divorce court, and I'm waiting
anxiously in the hall for my lawyer _ worried about how my life
will change, whether my two children and I will have to move out of
the city. And I can't believe what I am wearing.
</P>
<P>
   In a headband, pleated skirt and flat loafers, I look like a
parochial schoolgirl _ never mind that I'm a mom in my 40s, given
to dressing in spandex and jeans. I look like an impostor.
</P>
<P>
   But then, so do all the other women on the docket waiting in the
hall, which is the last stop on the train of marital disillusion.
For this lugubrious occasion, we've all been dressed by our
lawyers. They're not interested in our personal style _ they just
want us to win.
</P>
<P>
   It means looking conservative, understated and traditional,
muted, respectful and unadorned. There is freshly snipped hair,
minimal jewelry and no watches with bracelet bands _ only cloth
bands are acceptable. The motto of divorce lawyers everywhere seems
to be: nothing that glitters or glistens. I adjust my headband and
console myself with the thought that it's retro chic.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyerly wisdom has long held that you dress for court as you
dress for church: pearls and pumps for women, a dark suit and a
white shirt for men.
</P>
<P>
   But in divorce cases, strategies of appearance are more complex.
Although everyone agrees that a plaintiff should look restrained
and respectful to win a judge's favor, every divorce lawyer turns
out to be a stylist, with a different opinion of how to achieve a
winning look.
</P>
<P>
   In the year and a half it's taken for my case to come to trial,
I've had three lawyers, and each has had a different say on how I
should dress for this day. Eleanor Grosz, the first one, sounded as
affirming as a Liz Claiborne separates advertisement: ``Be
comfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   But then she gave me her list of don'ts: no miniskirts, no tight
tops, no designer logos, no pants, no sandals, no fish-net
stockings, no red nails, no glamorous hair and, for goodness' sake,
no spandex. (I was wearing a tube skirt at the time.)
</P>
<P>
   I moved on to lawyer No. 2, Frank Bonem, who pictured me in
court as June Cleaver _ if Ward had been an alcoholic with a quick
fuse. ``You want to look like a woman who is most comfortable in
the kitchen or doing homework with the kids,'' he said. ``You want
to look matronly.''
</P>
<P>
   He intended to portray me as a victim, so I had to appear in
need of sympathy. That meant no suit _ a suit suggests an office,
not a '50s kitchen _ and he proposed a conservative dress, the
darker the better.
</P>
<P>
   My current lawyer, Bernard Clair, has an altogether different
vision. He thinks I should look like a working mother, which is
what I am, having returned to an editing career recently after 10
years as a stay-at-home mom.
</P>
<P>
   His advice is to look as if I've gotten myself back in the
saddle and just need a little boost from the court in the form of a
generous settlement. To convey this image, I am not to wear my own
stylish clothes but, in Clair's surprisingly precise words, ``a
dress or skirt, knee-long, no slits, no pants, no hand jewelry,
maybe a scarf for a touch of femininity, nothing too bright, don't
show your toes.'' Oh, and nothing white, either. It's too
aggressive. Do I have a pale blue blouse?
</P>
<P>
   Justice may be blind, but judges are not, and lawyers describe
divorce as putting on a play. The costumes are critical.
</P>
<P>
   ``Appearance is everything,'' said Bradley A. Pistotnik, a
lawyer in Wichita, Kan., and the author of ``Divorce War!'' He is
one of a growing breed of experts who advise lawyers and clients on
their appearance. ``A judge cannot help but be swayed by how you
look, and different colors, styles, fabrics convey different
messages,'' he said. ``This may seem to go against the principles
of justice or seem sexist, but it is an inevitable reality.''
</P>
<P>
   The growing number of judges who are women and can tell the
difference between Armani and what's available from the mall has
complicated the courtroom dress-for-success formula, lawyers say.
</P>
<P>
   Eleanor Alter, who has represented Mia Farrow and other women in
celebrity cases, recalled a case in which a client who was seeking
emergency additional child support dressed head to toe in Yves
Saint Laurent. ``The judge, a woman, ran her eyes down her, adding
up what everything cost, and said, `I don't think so,''' Ms. Alter
said.
</P>
<P>
   In high-profile, high-stakes cases, the rules change. Here a
woman can deck herself out. Robert Stephan Cohen, a Manhattan
divorce lawyer who has represented many well-heeled clients, said:
``I tell them to wear Chanel. If your husband is worth $25 million,
you have to show that your lifestyle is money.''
</P>
<P>
   Raoul Felder, another celebrity divorce lawyer, eschews Chanel
in favor of more understated expensive clothes. ``Those Belgian
loafers that look like nothing but cost about $400 a pair, or
cashmere _ one of those little sweater-over-sweater sets,'' Felder
said. ``I always ask, `Does this say lifestyle, or does this say
I've overspent?'''
</P>
<P>
   Like many lawyers, Felder does a jewelry check just before court
convenes. Marie Vaccarelli, a Boston divorce lawyer, explained that
even if the goal is to suggest that the woman has grown accustomed
to luxury, certain over-the-top jewelry can alienate the court.
``No Cartiers, Rolexes, gold chains, pinkie rings,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Men, too, tackle the wardrobe issue with cunning. Kenneth
Burrows, a divorce lawyer, has sent male clients to the Salvation
Army to buy threadbare suits. ``The guy may not be very affluent,
but he's too proud to let it show,'' he said. ``I help him be who
he is.''
</P>
<P>
   Felder forbids male clients to slick back their hair, manicure
beards or sport handkerchiefs in breast pockets. He goes for Clark
Kent appeal. ``I always ask if they wear glasses,'' he said, adding
that glasses always look good. After one trial in which Felder made
a client wear a cheap suit to court every day, the client
celebrated by burning it up in Felder's office fireplace.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In celebrity cases, flourishes are allowed. Felder, who is
representing Carol Channing in a divorce from Charles Lowe, her
husband of 42 years, persuaded her to shed her signature blond wig
and unveil the gray underneath _ a ploy meant to suggest that
beneath the shimmery exterior, there has been suffering.
</P>
<P>
   Clair, who is representing Jocelyne Wildenstein in her bid for a
share of the fortune the Wildenstein family made buying and selling
art, said he might visit the Chanel boutique on East 57th Street to
buy the same clothes and baubles that her estranged husband, Alec
Wildenstein, is supposed to have bought for a Russian girlfriend.
Then Mrs. Wildenstein would wear the outfit to court ``just to
unnerve him,'' Clair said.
</P>
<P>
   But while the celebrities posture and preen, the rest of us do
our best to blend. After all the advice, what was I to wear on my
day in court? Part of me wanted to look like a competent mother,
part felt like a victim, and in my heart of hearts I wanted to
sweep in in a form-fitting Richard Tyler suit, not so much to
impress my ex, but to appear tall, thin and untouchable in a way
that a power suit conveys.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, I borrowed some advice from everyone. In the back of
my closet, I found an 8-year-old skirt, below the knee: good. But
it was black: bad, because black is a power color. But it had
pleats: good, because pleats are conservative. I chose 5-year-old
black flats _ not ballet slippers, just old Joan &AMP; David loafers.
</P>
<P>
   The one thing I bought was a pale blue blouse at J. Crew. It was
just right, with a little cardigan buttoned to the collar. The
headband, black velvet, was borrowed from my sitter.
</P>
<P>
   I wasn't thrilled about looking so colorless in front of my
former lover on our marital D-day. But when Clair surveyed me
before the court session, he said I'd do. And he assured me that I
would have my day to dress as I pleased in court.
</P>
<P>
   ``The day the judge is signing off _ after the case is settled
and the agreement has been signed, sealed and delivered _ that's
the day to look fabulous,'' he said. ``Wear your best dress, all
your jewelry. It's your last goodbye to your husband, and you want
him to think, `What did I let go?'''

INDIA'S GOVERNMENT BANS OLD AUTOS TO BATTLE POLLUTION 
 
(FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, OCT. 3) 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By MARION LLOYD 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW DELHI, India _ Nand Lal has spent his life at the helm of a
rickety three-wheeled taxi, ferrying passengers through New Delhi's
cow-clogged streets and contributing to the smog.
</P>
<P>
   But not much longer, if city officials have their way.
</P>
<P>
   This year, thousands of auto-rickshaw owners like Lal must turn
in their old vehicles and buy new ones, or give up their trade.
It's part of a new campaign to clean up the world's fourth-most
polluted city.
</P>
<P>
   A ban on commercial vehicles more than 20 years old took effect
on Friday. A ban on commercial vehicles between 15 and 20 years old
had been scheduled to take effect then, too. Late last month,
however, the Supreme Court pushed back the deadline on the newer
vehicles at the request of the city's Transport Ministry.
</P>
<P>
   The actions come a month after the capital switched to unleaded
gasoline. After April 1, no new licenses will be issued for
diesel-powered taxis, like Lal's.
</P>
<P>
   The measures represent the government's first serious effort to
reduce deadly air pollution, which claims an estimated 7,500 lives
in the city each year and sends half of the city's 10 million
residents in search of a doctor, according to a 1996 World Bank
study.
</P>
<P>
   Other government plans include construction of a $23 million
subway system and installation of electronic smog sniffing devices
along major arteries to find and penalize polluting motorists.
</P>
<P>
   The ambitious program is intended as a model for other Indian
cities, 12 of which are dangerously polluted and dozens more of
which are headed that way. But the program is besieged by critics
who claim it may backfire by hurting the poor without substantially
improving air quality.
</P>
<P>
   For Lal, 35, who supports a family of five on his monthly salary
of $80, the government might as well be asking him to buy a Rolls
Royce as cough up the $1,900 for a new auto-rickshaw. Nor can he
afford to take out a private loan at 30 percent interest.
</P>
<P>
   Transport Minister Rajinder Gupta shrugged off suggestions that
the government should provide low-interest loans to help the owners
of old auto-rickshaws to make the change.
</P>
<P>
   ``The inefficient must go; it's the rule of game survival,'' he
said. ``If (the rickshaw driver) hasn't been able to manage his
economics after 15 years, why should the government come to help
him?''
</P>
<P>
   The government says the vehicles, basically souped-up
motorcycles with metal shells tacked on for passengers, are
responsible for producing the largest share of noxious gases and
suspended particulate matter that cause lung diseases and cancer.
Environmentalists say, however, there's no real proof that the
auto-rickshaws are the main offenders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Really, we have no clue who are the biggest polluters,'' said
Anil Agarwal, director of the independent Center for Science and
Environment in New Delhi.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past three years, the number of pollution-rated deaths
has risen 28 percent in New Delhi, accounting for nearly one in
five deaths in the city last year, according to a study by
Agarwal's group.
</P>
<P>
   In Calcutta, where levels of suspended particles _ floating
flecks of coal and dirt laden with hazardous chemicals _ were even
higher than in New Delhi, the number of premature deaths doubled
during the same period, the group found.
</P>
<P>
   Other studies show a rise in cancer rates and deteriorating
fertility among city residents.
</P>
<P>
   Where one in 35 Indian villagers are infected with cancer, the
ratio is one in six in New Delhi, Agarwal's group found. And the
average sperm count in Indian cities is less than one-third the
normal levels, or 20 million per milliliter, according to the
Indian Institute for Research in Reproduction.
</P>
<P>
   The picture is worse for children, who are three times more
susceptible to lead poisoning and respiratory diseases. In New
Delhi, 17 percent of the children suffer from asthma, compared with
6 percent 20 years ago, according to a study by lung specialist Dr.
S.K. Chabra.
</P>
<P>
   A majority of students in New Delhi schools were found to have
dangerously high levels of lead in their blood, largely because of
emissions from leaded fuel.
</P>
<P>
   Residents who gasp for breath on the daily commute cope by
strapping on gas masks or shielding their mouths with bandannas.
But that doesn't prevent healthy lungs from eventually turning
black.
</P>
<P>
   Pollution experts can't agree on what should be done.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalist Agarwal has argued for stricter standards for
unleaded gasoline and more focus on cleaning up the city's three
thermal power plants, which he said are major polluters. He also
said that old vehicles must go.
</P>
<P>
   Agarwal blames the government for being soft on car and scooter
manufacturers, in particular the Indian company Bajaj Auto Ltd.,
which supplies more than 50 percent of the country's two- and
three-wheeled scooters, including the auto-rickshaws.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1996 interview published by Agarwal's group, Rahul Bajaj,
president of Bajaj Auto, acknowledged that his firm's vehicles
continue to pollute heavily. But Bajaj was quoted as saying that
his company's primary responsibility was to provide mobility, not
fight pollution.
</P>
<P>
   Agarwal also opposes the planned metro system, which he called
``an insane waste of time and money.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time the first phase is completed in 2005, it will be too
late to make a difference in the city's air quality, he said.
Construction was scheduled to start last week.
</P>
<P>
   Dinesh Mohan, a traffic-safety expert at the Indian Institute of
Technology, also called the metro project outdated, contending that
it will encourage suburban sprawl and increase air pollution in the
long run. The project also will divert funds from more effective
smog-fighting measures, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Subways are a solution for high-income populations, not
developing countries,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   European cities target high private-vehicle use and crowded
business centers in addressing pollution, but New Delhi has
different problems.
</P>
<P>
   Mohan said the government should realize that most residents
already use public transportation. The government also should
encourage bicycles by building bike paths along the main roads, he
said, and set aside special lanes for buses. However, he said he
opposes the ban on old vehicles, since there's little proof the
gains will offset the losses to the city's poor.
</P>
<P>
   Since India opened its economy in 1991, the number of new cars
on the road has doubled every two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very upper-class thing to say let's ban old cars,
because they don't use them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The lack of a unified approach toward fighting air pollution is
hurting efforts to clean up cities throughout India. Instead, most
city governments tackle the problem on a piecemeal basis and with
little conviction.
</P>
<P>
   All Indian cities are bound by a Supreme Court order to ban
leaded gasoline by 2000 and are expected to follow New Delhi's lead
in banning old commercial vehicles within a year.
</P>
<P>
   Agarwal said the government decided to ban leaded fuel only
after his group and others took their concerns to the Supreme
Court. Furthermore, he has accused Minister Gupta of trying to
delay the court-mandated ban on some old vehicles until after the
November municipal elections.
</P>
<P>
   Gupta denied that his request to the court was politically
motivated. ``It's a matter of not forcing things,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Already, 2,500 auto-rickshaw drivers had traded in their
vehicles as of Sept. 1, Gupta said. That's proof ``that we're not
attempting the impossible.'' &QL;

WHO WAS THE TRUE KING OF THE COWBOYS?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   From the Fort Worth Star-Telegram of Saturday, Oct. 2:
</P>
<P>
   With the death of Gene Autry at 91 on Friday, the question once
again is raised: Who was the true King of the Cowboys _ Roy Rogers
or Autry?
</P>
<P>
   Many Johnny-come-lately fans _ especially those who knew them
only from the pap of TV serials _ considered Rogers at the top of
the heap.
</P>
<P>
   In their heyday, it was much less clear cut. For starters, Autry
_ an authentic Texan from Tioga, just north of Denton _ was
Hollywood's first singing cowboy. When he chose to put his career
on hold so he could serve as an Army flier during World War II, his
unsympathetic studio selected a singer with no trace of cowboy
about him as his replacement.
</P>
<P>
   That replacement _ Leonard Slye of Cincinnati _ earlier had been
renamed Roy Rogers and remodeled in the Autry image. He was given a
trick horse (like Autry's Champion) and a sidekick (like Autry's
Smiley Burnette). The sidekick, Gabby Hayes, was swiped intact from
fellow cowboy star Wild Bill Elliott. (Rogers' very first role,
1938's ``Under Western Stars,'' was intended for Autry and
co-starred Burnette.)
</P>
<P>
   From 1937 to 1943, Autry was the unchallenged champion western
star at the box office. In 1940-42 he was in the Top 10 of all
movie box office favorites.
</P>
<P>
   As a recording star, Rogers was never a serious challenge to
Autry, who recorded 635 songs, including ``Rudolph the Red-Nosed
Reindeer'' and his signature ``Back in the Saddle Again.''
</P>
<P>
   Autry, of course, handled the matter like the authentic cowboy
hero that he was. He never uttered a negative word about his rival.
After Rogers died July 6, Autry called it ``a terrible loss for me.
I had tremendous respect for Roy and considered him a great
humanitarian and an outstanding American.''

 &HT;    COLUMN: Clawing way to top, squirrels have you up a tree come
fall
 &HT;    By Lee May
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Judy Anderson figured she'd left her bushy-tailed rat woes
behind when she moved into a ninth-floor Buckhead condominium more
than two years ago after living in Dunwoody for a long time.
</P>
<P>
   ``You move to a high-rise, and you don't think you'll be
bothered by squirrels,'' she said recently, adding that she quickly
discovered the varmints were able to scale tall buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Like hell-bent commandos, the rodents clawed their way up the
stucco walls and attacked two large potted cedars on Anderson's
balcony. She was puzzled about what befell the trees until a
maintenance man taking out the corpses asked: ``Did you know you
had all these peanut shells in these pots?'' The frenetic little
animals ``had dug out the plants and put the hulls in the bottom.''
</P>
<P>
   Gardeners know these creatures will go a long way to destroy
plantings and aggravate us, but Anderson's experience raises the
question of just how high you have to go to escape them.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson was not the only victim in the building. She recalls
how squirrels ``tore the leaves off silk plants belonging to a
neighbor'' and how ``they were getting in cars, gnawing wires,''
disabling at least one Mercedes and a Bentley.
</P>
<P>
   Something had to be done. Counterattacking, Anderson began
buying various products.
</P>
<P>
   There was the liquid spray repellent: ``The squirrels loved
it.'' (Who among us hasn't seen some pest embrace a supposed
deterrent as if it were an aphrodisiac.) Then, there was an
electronic remedy made of green plastic. It emitted a sound
designed to drive squirrels nuts. ``They'd lay up on my balcony,
thinking it was a stereo,'' Anderson lamented, showing me the
failed gadget that conjured images of finger-popping rodents.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, Anderson arrived at a familiar conclusion: ``Nothing
worked.''
</P>
<P>
   Flaunting victory, squirrels dashed from one spot to another,
around the corner of the building, enjoying havoc they created on
her three balconies.
</P>
<P>
   Then, condo management stepped in, fashioning some sort of
barrier to prevent the determined creatures from climbing the
outside wall. Several weeks ago, Anderson was squirrel-free, her
main balcony lush with a grand combination of indoor and outdoor
plants, including jade, chrysanthemum, cedar (she tried again),
dusty miller, Christmas cactus. On another balcony two crotons
happily, colorfully, showed off.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Anderson was not convinced the squirrels were gone for
good. ``Hot weather gets to them,'' she mused.
</P>
<P>
   On this muggy day, they apparently were resting in the shade.
Perhaps in the treed lot across from Anderson's balcony. Looking
toward the parcel of land, she joked: ``Should I pray for
development?''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, as long as a tree grows anywhere in the
neighborhood, you can bet armies of squirrels will follow.
</P>
<P>
   And now that temperatures are falling, along with acorns, the
gray peril may be back. ``I've seen signs,'' Anderson said with
resignation on Monday. I know what she means; I've seen the signs,
too. Dirt scattered around pots, a flash of tail flicking
obscenely, acorn parts trashing porches. Perennials newly scratched
out of the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, the cruel irony _ no, the injustice of it all _ if squirrels
high and low are the awful price we pay for autumn's glory and
sweet relief from an endless summer.

 &HT;    Think pleasure, not proper, for garden
 &HT;    By Danny C. Flanders
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLESTON, S.C. _ He's a legend among Southern gardeners, the
father of the University of Georgia's horticulture program and the
recipient of the Garden Club of America's highest honor. Allan
Armitage also has written seven books and been honored by the
American Horticultural Society as the best teacher in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   So what kind of worldly advice did this renowned expert have for
those attending the Charleston Garden Festival Friday?
</P>
<P>
   Lighten up.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've gotten so focused on the scientific that we're
forgetting the emotion,'' the Athens resident said. ``That's what
gardening is all about.''
</P>
<P>
   Too many gardeners have become obsessed with struggling to spell
and pronounce Latin botanical names, with achieving the proper mix
of color in their beds, with designing a garden by the book,
Armitage said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a whole bunch of things out there that don't matter.
There's no such thing as the wrong thing in your garden, because
that's what makes the place individual. The most important thing is
to enjoy ourselves while doing it.''
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't mean gardening isn't painful, exhausting and
frustrating. To prove even the experts make their share of goofs,
Armitage shared his own trials and tribulations with the trowel.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike many gardeners who inherit their love and skills from a
parent or grandparent, little Allan knew nothing of gardening
growing up in Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   He learned the basics during his first job as a gravedigger.
Because the cemetery planted the grave sites, he got to know not
only plants but also the emotion their beauty brought to grieving
loved ones.
</P>
<P>
   In his own garden, he began to plant selections from mail-order
catalogs _ ``many of which belong in the fiction section of the
library,'' he said, admitting that like many, he'd fallen victim to
the pretty pictures.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried hostas, but what they forget to tell you is Bambi's
out there, along with its good friends the slugs.''
</P>
<P>
   Armitage then began to experiment with perennials. He shared a
quotation that summed up his luck: ``Perennials _ any plant which,
had it lived, would have bloomed year after year.''
</P>
<P>
   Years later, the middle-aged horticulture professor admits, ``I
still don't know what I'm doing. But I'm having fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Research shows that people garden because it's therapeutic,
creative and exciting. And anyone who enjoys it needs to stay
focused on those benefits, because gardening will keep them young,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no such thing as an old gardener. You can't get old
when you're thinking about where you're going to plant next
spring's bulbs.''
</P>
<P>
   -- The festival, the Southeast's largest fall gardening event,
continues through Sunday, with seminars, garden tours and a
marketplace. Information: 843-722-0661.

 &HT;    Some baseball players, including the Braves' John Smoltz, make
religion a part of daily life
 &HT;    FREELANCE STORY. TO BE USED BY COX PAPERS ONLY. NOT TO BE USED
BY NY TIMES WIRE.
 &HT;    By Patty Rasmussen
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA_While mental toughness is important, it was faith and a
firm belief in God that John Smoltz was relying on when the Braves
took the field against Chicago in the National League Division
playoffs this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``The playoffs allow me to put my faith at a higher level,''
Smoltz says. ``My faith has been put to the test over the past few
years and I'm not trying to please everybody and play for
everybody. ... I am a man of character and I let that speak for
itself.''
</P>
<P>
   While the demands and schedules of professional baseball make it
difficult, Smoltz, some of his Braves teammates and other players
around the league manage to make religion a part of their daily
lives.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent sunny afternoon in late September, as the season
drew to a close, Smoltz was momentarily more concerned about sin
and forgiveness than division standings or the speed of his
fastball.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of poring over scouting reports, he and teammates Tony
Graffanino and Walt Weiss were sharing a few special moments of
Christian fellowship with this day's competition _ Paul Byrd, Rico
Brogna and Mike Grace of the Philadelphia Phillies.
</P>
<P>
   Weiss, who joined the Braves this year, says his best friends on
the team have turned out to be fellow Christians. ``It wasn't a
conscious effort,'' he adds, ``we just have common interests.''
</P>
<P>
   Those interests have no boundaries. Players from opposing teams
are always welcome to attend pre-game Bible sessions and Sunday
services, sponsored by Baseball Chapel Incorporated, a
three-decades-old Christian fellowship program. All 30 teams in the
league are part of the chapel program.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves try to schedule Bible study at least once during each
homestand. Lately they've been studying the Old Testament Book of
Daniel.
</P>
<P>
   But this day, Braves' Chaplain Mike McCoy has invited his
pastor, Randy Elliot, to lead a question-and-answer session.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to Smoltz and a question on ``sin,'' the players spend
time discussing ``stumbling blocks'' and ``temptation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Where you let your mind dwell is shaping your character for
the future,'' Elliot tells the players. ``Ask yourself, 'Where do I
want to be a year from now in my Christian life?' The key to
Christian growth is staying in the Word.''
</P>
<P>
   Making time for daily Bible study is a constant challenge for
these men.
</P>
<P>
   In the world they inhabit _ focused on mega-contracts, home runs
and ERAs; filled with players scrambling to stay on top in a tough
competitive market _ it's often difficult to stay focused on the
``Word.''
</P>
<P>
   Bible study helps. Having other men to share your faith with is
imperative.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to make it on your own,'' Smoltz says. ``It's always
easier to 'go to battle' with more people, than just by yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   Braves second baseman Keith Lockhart agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know Rico (Brogna) that well,'' Lockhart says, ``but
just knowing he's a Christian ... when I get on first I would talk
to him.''
</P>
<P>
   And then there's the constant stress.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way things are going this year,'' says Graffanino, ``it's
been humbling, but the thing that stands out in my mind is who I am
(in Christ) and that's what kept me going every day.''
</P>
<P>
   Most players feel the intense scrutiny that comes with the
uniform, and while none of them resents the attention, they do feel
that it often gets out of hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can be a hero one day,'' says Lockhart, ``and get booed
like crazy the next day. Faith has helped me maintain focus and
keep a humble spirit.''
</P>
<P>
   Smoltz adds that he no longer tries to please other people.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't read the paper or listen to the sports talk shows,''
he says. ``I just want to please God. It doesn't mean I'm going to
win every game, but it will make me a better husband and father.''
</P>
<P>
   Such are the gifts and lessons of Christian fellowship.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't just sit down and talk about 'rightly dividing
Scripture,''' says Tim Cash, North American director for Unlimited
Potential Inc.orporated (UPI), and one of the leaders of the
Braves' Bible study program. ``Jesus just hung out with his
friends. That's what we do,'' Cash says.
</P>
<P>
   After hanging out for an hour or so, the players end their study
and offer a prayer. There are brotherly hugs and backslaps, and
then it's back to business.
</P>
<P>
   But before returning to the Braves' clubhouse and preparing for
the night's game, Smoltz has one last thought.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never thought God was going to use me,'' he says. ``I didn't
think I would ever speak about (my faith) the way I do now.''

 &HT;    Catholics prepare for jubilee of world's salvation
 &HT;    By Gayle White
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Pope John Paul II has called all Catholics to prepare for a
jubilee of the world's salvation in the year 2000 _ and 70 parishes
of the Archdiocese of Atlanta are getting ready.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning Sunday, small groups of Catholics will meet all over
North Georgia to explore their faith. Sessions will continue for
six weeks with the theme ``God, a Community of Love.'' Four other
``seasons'' of six weeks each will follow, with the last ending
Nov. 18, 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a parish-based approach,'' said the Rev. Mark Lacey,
archdiocese chancellor and head of the program, called Renew 2000.
``It's to kind of pull the parishes back to their roots and get
people talking to one another, to bring people back in and
reacquaint them with their faith.''
</P>
<P>
   In each parish, a core group of leaders is coordinating the
process. Future themes will cover conversion, evangelization,
reconciliation and renewal.
</P>
<P>
   Although centered in parishes, the program also is geared to
reach out to non-churchgoers and to non-Catholics, said Lacey.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a first level that's to reach out to the people in
your parish,'' he says. ``Then, there is reaching out to people who
are Catholic who might be inactive. Then, thirdly, we will reach
out to people who aren't Catholic, to work more closely together
with people of other faiths and sharing our commonality with
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Some metro parishes not participating in the small-group program
are planning their own activities to fulfill the pontiff's
directive.
</P>
<P>
   Blessed Sacrament in the Ben Hill area of Atlanta will hold a
series of revival services beginning in January, said the Rev.
Bruce Wilkinson, the parish pastor. To commemorate the jubilee
year, which is also the 40th anniversary of the church, each of the
congregation's 183 families will be asked to make a square for a
quilt, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a primarily black parish and revivals are something
familiar to the black community,'' he said.

   Editors: The following items from The N.Y. Times Week in Review
for Sunday, Oct. 4, will move Saturday in the `a' category.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-REVIEW (Undated) _ Could it be that the latest images of
slaughtered ethnic Albanians from Kosovo _ slashed abdomens,
spilled brains, slit throats, severed limbs _ comfort the West in a
deeply-held notion of incorrigible Balkan violence even as they
spur renewed talk of NATO air strikes against the Serbs? &QL; 
The question is a terrible one. But after a decade of killing set
in motion by the rise to power in 1987 of the Serbian leader,
Slobodan Milosevic, it seems it must be posed. By Roger Cohen.
</P>
<P>
   IMPEACHMENT-REVIEW (Washington) _ Congress is beginning to climb
the impeachment tree. Each time the limbs divide, the politicians
must decide, this way or that way. Each decision will take them
closer to one of the outermost branches: impeachment, resignation
or some form of Congressional sanction. By david E. Rosenbaum.
</P>
<P>
   AIR-RAGE-REVIEW (Undated) _ Newspapers and television stations
around the world have featured scores of accounts of what appears
to be an alarming increase in angry passengers who punch, kick,
scratch, bite and head-butt airline workers or one another. By
Laurence Zuckerman.
</P>
<P>
   SHAME-REVIEW (Undated) _ Shaming people in public has always
been a tantalizing idea to Americans _ punishing wrongdoers by
making them hang their heads before their community. President
Clinton's opera of embarrassment has brought public shaming to a
new high. More than ever, it appears, people are in the mood for
good old red-faced humiliation. By Pam Belluck.
</P>
<P>
   RACE-REVIEW (Undated) _ Different reports, different eras, same
subject: race. Issued 30 years apart, the famous 1968 Kerner
Commission study on race and the newly issued report of President
Clinton's advisory board on race are a study in contrasts. By
Steven A. Holmes.
</P>
<P>
   HURRICANE-REVIEW (Undated) _ When it comes to predicting the
intensity of the storm when it makes landfall, forecasters admit
they have far less skill. And they have almost none in forecasting
how large an area the hurricane will affect when it comes ashore.
``We're back in the dark ages relative to that; I'm not sure anyone
knows where to begin to attack that problem,'' said Jerry Jarrell,
the director of the National Hurricane Center in Miami. So what do
the forecasters do? By William K. Stevens.
</P>
<P>
   MILITARY-REVIEW (Washington) _ Gen. Henry H. Shelton is a good
soldier. But smart salutes and muddy boots don't always take the
hill, especially when it's Capitol Hill. Last week, General Shelton
and the other Joint Chiefs of Staff unexpectedly caught heavy fire
from Senate Republicans, who berated the military's top brass for
the sin of not speaking up sooner and louder about problems the
officers say are eroding the Pentagon's ability to fight and win
wars. By Eric Schmitt.
</P>
<P>
   CONTENTMENT-REVIEW (Undated) _ For millions of people, Prozac
and similar drugs have fulfilled the promise of freedom from
depression. But for some patients, adjusting to a life without
misery turns out to be far more difficult than they imagined.
Doctors and patients are discovering that recovery from depression
can bring a new array of personal problems, from social uneasiness
and crises of identity to professional and marital strains. By
Margolit Fox.
</P>
<P>
   MEXICO-REVIEW (Mexico City) _ Thirty years ago, soldiers and
policemen crushed Mexico's first major pro-democracy movement with
a public massacre of demonstrators that is often likened here to
the Tiananmen Square massacre in China. Each year since, in the
face of that official line, relatives of the victims would
commemorate the Oct. 2, 1968 event by holding candles at Tlatelolco
Plaza, the massacre site, and mourning their loved ones in timid
silence, almost furtively. In every year, that is, but this one. By
Sam Dillon.
</P>
<P>
   ALIENS-REVIEW (Undated) _ I F you wanted to send a message to a
bunch of aliens in outer space, how could you be sure they would
understand it? Would you make the message rich in the opaque
minutia of modern science and write it in code? Would you assume
that beings from other planets are more intelligent _ much more
intelligent? By William J. Broad.
</P>

BEYOND THE POND  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, OCT. 4) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By MICHELLE COTTLE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q.(italics)A year ago, in my early 50s, I started back at law
school at Fordham University and made the law review _ an honor
that gives me the chance to transfer to Columbia. Performing at the
top of the class there will be much tougher. So I'm torn about what
will land me a better job upon graduation: remaining a big fish in
a smaller pond or simply getting a degree from the bigger pond?(end
italics) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Congratulations. Your academic performance will go a long way
toward making you a hot catch, regardless of the school you choose.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being on law review makes you a big fish anywhere you are,''
said Paula Patton, executive director of the National Association
for Law Placement.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, some realities of the legal profession are slightly
less egalitarian. Credentialism is indeed alive and well _ and,
nationally, Columbia's school is considered more prestigious,
meaning that firms may feel comfortable recruiting deep into each
class. (The school ranked fourth in this year's ranking of law
schools by U.S. News and World Report, while Fordham's was tied for
25th.) In other words, if you transfer to Columbia and only manage
to graduate in the top 20 percent of your class, you might enjoy
the same marketability as if you graduated in the top 10 percent at
a lesser-known school.
</P>
<P>
   ``From a name recognition standpoint, we would be more attracted
to someone in Columbia, even if the person was not at the top of
the class,'' said Diane Ross, the recruitment administrator for the
Washington legal powerhouse Verner Liipfert Bernhard McPherson &AMP;
Hand.
</P>
<P>
   The booming job market, however, is temporarily making school
distinctions less important. ``Everything I've read says it's a
wonderful market for law students,'' Ms. Ross said. ``There are
more options for everyone.'' Should the market change, though, a
J.D. from Columbia would prove a better bet, according to some
recruiters.
</P>
<P>
   But don't start filing those transfer papers just yet. If your
post-graduation goal is to hang your legal shingle in Manhattan,
the advantages of transferring to the bigger-name school narrow.
Both Fordham and Columbia have strong reputations among New York
firms and boast extensive alumni networks within the legal
community _ an important factor in hiring, according to Carol
Sprague, the administration director for Skadden, Arps, Slate,
Meagher &AMP; Flom.
</P>
<P>
   ``The network in New York is incredible for both of those law
schools,'' Ms. Patton said. ``A person won't go wrong either
place.''
</P>

   There may be some differences, however, in the schools' employer
markets, added Ms. Patton, who recommended visiting extensively
with career counselors at each school to discuss not only your
individual goals and circumstances, but also the firms at which
graduates tend to land. Ultimately, worrying about the size of your
pond may prove to be less important than finding out who fishes
there regularly. &QL;

   MIRBACAKOT, Afghanistan _ With gunfire snapping in the wind and
artillery blasts punctuating his sentences, the commander of the
Taliban's front-line forces was in a boastful, triumphant mood on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   He removed his artificial leg, sat comfortably on a blanket in
his small brick fortress and pointed a few hundred yards to the
north where, lodged in the foothills, was the last bastion of what
was once grandly called the Northern Alliance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are giving the enemy 10 days, so that anybody who wants to
get out can get out,'' said the commander, Haji Mullah Abdus
Sattar. ``Then, by the will of God, we will crush the life from
anyone who remains behind.''
</P>
<P>
   These are heady days for the Taliban. Mazar-i-Sharif fell to
them in August, Bamiyan in September. They now control 90 percent
of Afghanistan, with only the army of their wiliest opponent, Ahmad
Shah Massoud, left to conquer.
</P>
<P>
   Massoud's redoubt is the Panjshir Valley of the northeast, and
many of his troops are lined up within sight of the Taliban here in
Mirbacakot, about 12 miles north of Kabul, the Afghan capital.
</P>
<P>
   But just as a final Taliban victory seems near in this country
left impoverished and demoralized by 20 years of war, so does the
possibility of a savage new chapter in one of the world's bloodiest
histories.
</P>
<P>
   Some 200,000 Iranian troops are staging military exercises on
Afghanistan's western border, and Taliban officials asserted Friday
that 10 helicopters and 25 fighter aircraft had entered their
airspace.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Iranians would like to help Massoud, and their war games
have already drawn thousands of the Taliban away from the front
lines against him,'' said a foreign military observer in
Afghanistan. ``The Iranians could open up a second front. Or they
could arm the thousands of Afghan refugees in Iran and train them
for guerrilla activities.''
</P>
<P>
   The Shiite Muslims of Iran are very much on the minds of the
predominantly Sunni Muslim forces of the Taliban, especially after
the Iranians, angry over the killings of eight of their diplomats
and a journalist by Taliban forces at Mazar-i-Sharif, massed troops
on Iran's border with Afghanistan and ordered war games. But while
Iran has threatened military action, its leaders say they want to
avoid war with the Taliban.
</P>
<P>
   Sattar sent a few of his men to bring in some rocket-propelled
grenades and automatic rifles that he said had been captured in
battle recently. The Taliban commander said the weapons were made
in Iran and shipped to Massoud's army through Tajikistan.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Iran wants to attack and get into this fight, they should
not forget how we destroyed the Russians,'' said the mullah,
alternately spouting bravado and sipping tea. ``Not only will we
defeat the Iranians, we will chase them into their own land and
take Tehran.''
</P>
<P>
   Sattar's more immediate problem is the estimated 10,000 soldiers
of Massoud, who was once this nation's defense minister and a great
hero in the holy war that drove out Soviet invaders in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   The winter snows will begin to fall in the next two to four
weeks, making the movements of troops and supplies very difficult
and prolonging the standoff.
</P>
<P>
   Massoud, according to the mullah, is a ``caged animal,''
surrounded on three sides with nowhere to retreat except across the
northern border into Tajikistan. He said he expects such a
withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the Taliban, who are mostly members of the Pushtun ethnic
group, Massoud is a member of the nation's Tajik ethnic minority.
Tajikistan would be a logical refuge.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the pilot and crew of one of Massoud's cargo
planes defected to the Taliban. Not only had the pilot been
ferrying supplies from Tajikistan, said Sattar, but on return trips
he had been taking away the personal effects of Massoud and his top
commanders: ``So Massoud knows he is defeated. And so do his
troops. Every day, more of them cross over and lay down their
rifles, and we let them go away.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The hilly terrain around Mirbacakot is littered with the
carcasses of Soviet tanks, some of them twisted heaps that serve as
grave markers along the important and perilous road to Kabul.
</P>
<P>
   Just as the Taliban are hard upon the Massoud forces, the Tajik
commander is but a short drive from the capital. His rockets can
hit Kabul at will, as one did on Sept. 21, killing more than 100
civilians in a medical clinic and the ice cream parlor next door.
These attacks have been infrequent, however, for while they show
Massoud's might, they do little to win hearts and minds.
</P>
<P>
   While Massoud was a famous Afghan warrior, the Taliban seemed to
come out of nowhere in 1995. Rooted in the ancient ways of village
life, the Taliban were appalled at what they described as the
corrupt ways of the mujahadeen, who had come to power after
defeating the Soviets.
</P>
<P>
   The Taliban were educated in strict religious schools and
practice a puritanical form of Islam, insisting on isolation for
women, mandatory beards for men and amputations and summary
executions for thieves, adulterers and blasphemers.
</P>
<P>
   The Taliban are reviled by many for a creed that is considered
repressive, but they prefer to focus on the peace they have brought
to the war-weary areas of Afghanistan they now control.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the gains of the Taliban were relatively easy to
consolidate as they marched through the Pushtun regions of
Afghanistan. Now, however, they have won battles against the Uzbek
and Shiite minorities of Mazar-i-Sharif and the Hazaras of Bamiyan.
They face accusations that they killed thousands of Hazara
civilians when they captured Mazar-i-Sharif.
</P>
<P>
   The Taliban will have to deal with ethnic and religious
suspicions and enmities. ``A lot of the Taliban's enemies weren't
actually defeated _ they just quit fighting and disappeared,'' said
one Western military analyst. ``They did buying as well as
fighting, paying commanders to switch sides. Of course, someone who
takes your money today takes someone else's tomorrow. If Iran wants
to provide much in the way of support, the Taliban will find
themselves in a drawn-out guerrilla war.''

TRIPP TAPES SHOW LEWINSKY ATTEMPTING TO PROTECT THE PRESIDENT 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Former White House intern Monica Lewinsky is
portrayed as a jilted lover desperately trying to move past her
relationship with President Clinton in new material from
Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr's investigation made public
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   In an undated phone conversation between Lewinsky and her
onetime friend, Linda Tripp _ who recorded 20 hours of their phone
calls to each other _ Lewinsky attempted to sort out her feelings
toward Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I just need to start over,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But later in their conversation, Lewinsky said that she couldn't
stop thinking about the man she called ``Boo-Boo''
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky said: ``But what's hard for me is that I know this is
so stupid, but, Linda, I don't know why I have these feelings for
him. Maybe I'm crazy. Maybe I don't really have these feelings.
Maybe I'm pretending it. But I just ... when I tell you that I _ I
never expected to feel this way about him.''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, Lewinsky admitted that she was in love with the
president. ``The first time I ever looked into his eyes close up
and was with him alone, I saw somebody totally different than I had
expected to see. And that's the person I fell in love with.''
</P>
<P>
   In another telephone call, Lewinsky told Tripp about a late
night phone conversation she had with Clinton in which the
president confided that he had an ``empty life.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I have an empty life except for my work,'' Lewinsky said
Clinton told her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he likes to feel sorry for himself,'' Lewinsky added.
``What about his daughter and all the things he does?''
</P>
<P>
   ``No. No,'' said Tripp. ``What he's saying is his compulsion for
female intimacy is the void.'' She added, ``If he were a completely
fulfilled man, you wouldn't exist in his life.''
</P>
<P>
   The documents, released by the House Judiciary Committee,
consisted of almost 5,000 pages in three thick volumes. They
included grand jury testimony by Clinton's personal secretary Betty
Currie and his close friend Vernon Jordan as well as the
transcripts of the taped telephone conversations between Lewinsky
and Tripp. The committee is preparing to vote early next week on
whether to begin an impeachment inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   The massive ``document dump,'' as the press has called it,
provided new details about the Clinton-Lewinsky relationship and
about other key figures in the case, but it did not reveal any
blockbuster development that would change the public's perception
of the events.
</P>
<P>
   At the White House, press secretary Joe Lockhart charged that
the committee's release of the material was ``the clearest
indication that this is a partisan process designed for partisan
gain rather than a solid constitutional process designed to do the
work that framers of the Constitution envisioned.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton acknowledged in his videotaped testimony to a federal
grand jury Aug. 17 that he had an intimate relationship with the
former intern, now 25 years old, but denied that they had sex. He
has also admitted making misleading statements about their
relationship but denied ever asking anyone to lie about it.
</P>
<P>
   In January, Tripp took her recorded telephone conversations with
Lewinsky to Starr's office. FBI agents then had Tripp set up a
meeting with Lewinsky in which Tripp was equipped with a secret
recording device _ a ``bodywire'' _ that enabled her to record
Lewinsky's comments while FBI agents listened.
</P>
<P>
   During the women's meeting Jan. 13 in Arlington, Va., Lewinsky
told Tripp that both Clinton and Jordan were working to find her a
job.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky also said she was asked to sign certain documents, but
that she had refused to do so until she was actually offered a job.
</P>
<P>
   ``So I talked with her (Currie) this week and I said to her. I
said, `Look, I'm supposed to sign something.' And I said, `I'm
supposed to sign something, and I'm not signing it until I have a
job.'''
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky also told Tripp that Jordan was working on getting her
a job at the Revlon Corporation's headquarters in New York City.
Jordan at the time was on Revlon's board of directors.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the conversation, Tripp warned Lewinsky that she could
be in legal trouble if her relationship with the president was
discovered.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky dismissed the possibility that the affair would become
public, saying: ``The only way that I'm gonna get in trouble is if
_ truthfully, is if you say something.''
</P>
<P>
   A short time later in the conversation, Lewinsky admitted that
she feared Tripp might not be reliable.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky said: ``Do you want the honest truth? Do you want me to
tell you the honest truth?''
</P>
<P>
   Tripp said: ``Yes.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky said: ``I have fear about one thing, and that's you
saying something.''
</P>
<P>
   She warned Tripp that if she told authorities about the
relationship, she (Tripp) could be fired.
</P>
<P>
   ``You will then have _ you will have caused a lot more
trouble,'' she said, adding, ``And then you're surely going to lose
your job.''
</P>
<P>
   At another point, Lewinsky said she felt she could be killed for
making public her affair with the president. ``I would not _ I
would not cross these _ these people for fear of my life, number
one,'' Lewinsky said.
</P>
<P>
   But, according to the transcript, Lewinsky said she had no
intention of betraying the president's trust in her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think no matter what _ no matter how he has wronged me, no
matter how many girlfriends he had, no matter how many people he
abused, no matter how many, it _ it was my choice.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky on Jan. 7 signed an affidavit in the Paula Jones sexual
harassment lawsuit against Clinton denying that she had had sex
with the president.
</P>
<P>
   Toward the end of the FBI recording, Tripp asked Lewinsky,
``What is the definition of sex?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Intercourse,'' answered Lewinsky, who had denied having a
sexual relationship with the president in a sworn affidavit. ``I
never had intercourse. I did not have a sexual relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   In his Jan. 17 deposition in the same lawsuit, Clinton also
denied a sexual relationship with Lewinsky. He has maintained that
the testimony was ``legally accurate'' since their activity didn't
include intercourse.
</P>
<P>
   After an eight-month investigation, Starr last month sent
Congress a report alleging 11 possible impeachable offenses by the
president, including perjury, getting others to commit perjury, and
obstruction of justice. The backup material released Friday adds
mounds of detail to Starr's report.
</P>
<P>
   Not all of the new material was damaging to the president.
</P>
<P>
   In one undated telephone conversation between Tripp and
Lewinsky, the former intern's credibility as a witness was called
into question by her own admission that she had lied all of her
life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once my parents were divorced, if I wanted money from my dad,
I had to make up a story. When my parents were married, my mom was
always lying to my dad for everything. Everything. ... That's just
how I was raised,'' Lewinsky said.
</P>
<P>
   Tripp replied that she would not lie under oath, even to protect
members of her own family.
</P>
<P>
   But Lewinsky replied that she would ``lie on the stand for my
family.'' She added, ``That is how I was raised by my family.''
</P>
<P>
   In the same phone conversation, Lewinsky appeared to ask Tripp _
who had been subpoenaed to give a sworn deposition in the Jones
lawsuit _ to lie under oath.
</P>
<P>
   Tripp said she was afraid she would be asked about whether she
had observed Clinton and Kathleen Willey, a former White House
volunteer who claimed the president sexually harassed her,
together, and whether Lewinsky and Clinton had an affair.
</P>
<P>
   Tripp expressed concern about testifying for fear that she would
hurt her friend, Lewinsky. ``I can't bear the pain and anguish and,
frankly, I don't know what you would do ... and I'd have that on my
conscience too, forever.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky sighs several times before saying, ``Okay. Is there
anything _ what about if I could _ what about if I could ensure
that you had job security? No matter what you said about
Kathleen?''
</P>
<P>
   Tripp repeated her intention not to lie.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like I'm sticking a knife in your back, and I know that
at the end of this, if I have to go forward, you will never speak
to me again and I will lose a dear friend,'' said Tripp.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Just before the material was released Friday, House Democrats
proposed a narrowly focused impeachment inquiry that would end by
Nov. 25 and offered the option of censuring Clinton for misconduct
in the Lewinsky matter.
</P>
<P>
   However, that plan has no hope of passing in the
Republican-controlled House Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Committee Chairman Henry Hyde said the plan ``is certainly
made-to-order for the White House but not for the American
people.'' The Republicans want an open-ended inquiry with rules
based on the Watergate proceedings in 1974.

WHEN BUSINESS GETS RELIGION  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, OCT. 4) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 Daniel Akst is a novelist and financial journalist. His column on
the cultural dimensions of money and business will appear the first
Sunday of each month. E-mail: culmoney(AT)nytimes.com.  
 By DANIEL AKST   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's no secret that a new breed of customer-oriented megachurch
is using the tactics of business to win what might be called market
share for Jesus.
</P>
<P>
   Like conventional companies, these fast-growing churches are
using technology and economies of scale to extend their reach. They
focus on who their ``customers'' are, offering hip tunes and
12-step programs, and they try not to lose sight of their ``core
business,'' which happens to be the message of Christ.
</P>
<P>
   Can it be coincidence, then, that as churches have succeeded by
adopting the tools of mammon, businesses are beginning to focus on
matters of the spirit?
</P>
<P>
   Signs of this newfound concern for the corporate soul are
cropping up everywhere. Judi Neal, a management professor at the
University of New Haven, edits Spirit at Work, a newsletter on the
topic that has grown from a dozen subscribers to 1,500 in five
years, and will soon become a magazine published six times a year.
</P>
<P>
   The gap between secular and sacred is thus looking more and more
like a two-way street. Churches are turning to marketing
consultants to learn that new members can be won by giving them
spirituality in the context of ample parking and child care. And
corporate spirituality consultants are catching on just as fast.
Martin Rutte, a consultant whose practice in this area is called
Spirituality in the Workplace, counts among his clients Lucent
Technologies, the World Bank, and the Southern California Personnel
Management Association.
</P>
<P>
   With their traditional flair for euphemism, companies and
consultants are steering clear of ``spirituality'' in favor of
``empowerment'' or ``vitality.'' When asked about the events _
typically layoffs, divorce or illness _ that most often lead to
what William James might have called a conversion experience, Dr.
Neal hastens to correct. ``In business we're using the phrase
`transformation experience,' '' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Why this sudden interest on the part of supposedly soulless
corporations in matters of the spirit? Perhaps America's companies
are feeling empty, even uneasy, in the midst of plenty. ``What's it
all for?'' they may be muttering to themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Downsizing, too, has made people feel insecure. And then there
is the aging of the baby-boom generation: As the boomers awaken to
their own mortality, many are turning to matters of the spirit in
the only church that they have ever known _ the office.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the workplace hasn't always been free of religion's
influence, or vice versa. Biblical moneylenders made themselves at
home in the temple, and in an early example of creative
securitizing, the medieval church sold indulgences.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, business as we know it may itself be the creature of
religious zeal. Max Weber argued that the stage was set for modern
capitalism by Calvinist doctrine, which emphasized predestination
and regarded material success as a sign of salvation, of being
among the elect. The British historian R.H. Tawney later stressed
that individualism, thrift and a powerful work ethic _
characteristics implied even today by the term Calvinistic _ played
a crucial role in the Industrial Revolution.
</P>
<P>
   In a sense, the increasing willingness of business to embrace
spirituality is just the closing of the circle. If Calvinism
created modern capitalism, then capitalism would prove to be a
jealous god whose relentless rationality left no room for any sign
of its own religious upbringing.
</P>
<P>
   Weber called this process ``the disenchantment of the world,''
in which magic and deities were replaced by science and technology.
In this view, the spread of Protestantism fostered secularization,
resulting in a business culture that had no place for religion or
spirituality.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps that rigidly secular culture, which prevails today
by both custom and law, has created the hunger we now see for the
very thing it has so thoroughly vanquished. Today church and
business seem to share an ideology of pragmatism. And each, perhaps
with an eye on the other, seems to agree with William Booth,
founder of the Salvation Army, who asked, ``Why should the devil
have all the good tunes?''

COMMENTARY: PORGY AND BILL 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By FRANK RICH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   If truth is fungible in America these days, then let's have
beauty. Beauty is Audra McDonald singing ``My Man's Gone Now'' from
``Porgy and Bess'' at New York's Carnegie Hall, as Michael Tilson
Thomas' San Francisco Symphony wraps her in a Gershwin hurricane.
And it's a peculiarly American kind of beauty at that _ the
boundaries of class, of race and of high and low art all fall away
in ratification of the ideal that is democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Class falls away because the concert, a costly, elitist event
celebrating George Gershwin's 100th birthday, was disseminated free
to the nation only days later in a particularly stylish replay on
public television. The racial debate that has stalked ``Porgy and
Bess'' since its premiere in 1935 _ how dare white artists have
their way with black musical idioms and dramatize black characters?
_ also seems to have at last been overpowered by the sheer force of
a piece that perennially affords artistic triumphs to both black
artists like Ms. McDonald and white ones like Tilson Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   Forgotten, too, is the angry cultural debate, alive as recently
as the New York Metropolitan Opera's first ``Porgy'' in 1985, as to
whether the work is an opera or not. As the title of another
Gershwin standard has it: Who cares?
</P>
<P>
   The Gershwin-McDonald-Tilson Thomas performance was so beautiful
that the temptation is to look at the world through its rosy lens.
It's the cultural equivalent of the Mark McGwire-Sammy Sosa
home-run derby, a moving picture of racial (and
old-American-new-American) fraternity so genuine that no one could
turn it into a conflict (not that some didn't try).
</P>
<P>
   But even as baseball yielded its perfectly matched pair of
heroes and the Gershwin centennial celebrated the fusion of black
and immigrant Jewish culture into American culture, Washington gave
us another view on race: the report of the president's racial
initiative, the nationwide talkfest that Bill Clinton set in motion
through an advisory board led by historian John Hope Franklin 15
months ago.
</P>
<P>
   To say that this official report was overshadowed by another one
issued a week earlier is an understatement. ``One America in the
21st Century,'' as the document is titled, is for the most part a
toothless recitation of homilies familiar to anyone who's gone
anywhere near a diversity seminar (``Dialogue Is a Tool for Finding
Common Ground'' is one boldfaced heading). Though downloadable from
the Internet, its only hope for an avid readership might have been
to go mano a mano with Kenneth Starr by including sections such as
``Case Studies in Racial Erotic Myths'' or ``Sally Hemings: The
Bedroom Tapes.''
</P>
<P>
   So much of this report is self-parodistic _ including fervent
recommendations for ``a presidential event to discuss stereotypes''
and for the institutionalization of a permanent federal bureaucracy
for racial dialogue _ that its few valuable nuggets are doomed to
be ignored.
</P>
<P>
   Rightly deploring the fact that too much of our racial debate is
fixated on the political flashpoints of affirmative action,
immigration and bilingual education, the panel never forcefully
pushes the discussion in another direction, despite its useful hard
evidence on racial inequalities still unbridged in the bedrock
matters of job opportunities and pay, early education, criminal
justice and health care.
</P>
<P>
   What a waste of time and money and potential presidential
leadership. Three years ago violently segregated reactions to the
O.J. Simpson verdict revealed a racial chasm no sooner noted than
forgotten; it's hardly progress that an even starker split now
greets the Starr rap on Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The tragedy is that Clinton is the only major white politician
we have whose deep understanding of the African-American experience
and comfort level with black Americans is such that he, by forceful
policy as well as words, could have moved us beyond both liberal
exercises like his race initiative and the right's ``Bell
Curve''-driven pandering to white resentments. It's a job that
can't be accomplished by the culture alone, even that of Gershwin
and Sosa and Oprah _ or by the piecemeal initiatives that followed
the president's sign-off on welfare reform.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton wasn't present at Carnegie Hall, but his wife was,
leading the cheers. It takes nothing away from the concert to say
that it was a perfect, if poignant, cultural reflection of the
administration's record on race: high ideals, beautiful show,
one-night stand.

 &HT;    CLINTON UPBRAIDS 'INEXCUSABLE' FAILURE TO PROVIDE IMF FUNDS
 &HT;    With IMPEACH.
 &HT;    BOB DEANS
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON President Clinton, ignoring the release of new
testimony on the Monica Lewinsky scandal, said Friday it's
''inexcusable'' for the Republican-led Congress to hold up his
request for money to help out struggling economies abroad.
</P>
<P>
   The president's legal team, meanwhile, claimed that extensive
reports from Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr painted a one-sided
view of the president's relationship with the former White House
intern.
</P>
<P>
   With Clinton facing a possible House Judiciary Committee vote on
impeachment proceedings as early as Monday, White House special
counsel Gregory Craig said Starr went out of his way to exclude
anything that might exonerate Clinton from charges of perjury and
obstruction of justice or otherwise cast him in a favorable light.
</P>
<P>
   ''In its zeal to prop up its allegations against the president,
the Office of the Independent Counsel, in its referral to the House
of Representatives, intentionally omitted direct exculpatory
testimony, paraphrased unambiguous statements to obscure their
plain meaning, and systematically resolved conflicting testimony in
its favor,'' Craig told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton avoided direct talk about his legal troubles as he left
the White House on Friday morning for a campaign and fund-raising
trip to Cleveland and Philadelphia. But he upbraided the House for
not approving additional funding for the International Monetary
Fund, whose reserves of cash for propping up stumbling currencies
has been largely depleted by the global economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ''The most important thing Congress can do to protect our
farmers, our ranchers, our businesses and our workers,'' Clinton
said, ''is to secure full funding for the International Monetary
Fund.''
</P>
<P>
   Other nations have pledged roughly $82 billion in additional IMF
funding, if the United States will provide the $18 billion Clinton
has requested from Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate has approved the request. The House, however, has
approved only $3 billion, with perhaps as little as one week
remaining to try to reconcile the differences in a conference
committee before Congress goes out on autumn recess.
</P>
<P>
   With a quarter of the world in recession and another quarter
listing in that direction, Clinton said, the United States can ill
afford to stand idly by and watch financial contagion spread
unchecked.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is inexcusable, and we need the money now,'' Clinton
said, ''for Americans and their interests, and for the long-term
stability of the world.''

ALL THE FED RISKED WAS ITS REPUTATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED: The worst thing that can be said about Long-Term
Capital Management is that its capital wasn't invested in much of
anything constructive or productive.
</P>
<P>
   Most, if not all, of the money entrusted to it by investors was
used to make bets on the ups and downs of securities prices. Much
of the activity involved arbitrage, which is an attempt to profit
from buying and selling similar financial instruments having price
discrepancies.
</P>
<P>
   It's an honest calling, and one that has become increasingly
popular since the boom in financial derivatives, which are so
called because they derive their value from tangible underlying
assets.
</P>
<P>
   What has generated the rescued hedge fund's bad PR, though,
isn't its lack of any useful role except to make money for its
investors. No, what riles many is the fact that it was saved by a
bailout supervised by the Federal Reserve.
</P>
<P>
   The misunderstanding of the Fed's role, however, has led to some
misplaced outrage from those who think taxpayer money was involved.
Nothing of the sort happened. The Fed merely coordinated the
salvage job while a consortium of brokers and bankers provided the
actual money.
</P>
<P>
   Altruism didn't motivate the rescuers. They were protecting
investments or seeking to ensure stability for an already unsettled
financial marketplace in which they had a considerable stake. Or
both.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, many who understand that it was private money
protecting private interests still are unhappy because the failed
rocket scientists were protected from the consequences of their
folly. Their main objections were that such actions encourage
foolish risk and that the rich benefit from an unfair double
standard.
</P>
<P>
   They're right. So what? This is reality and they should get over
it. Encouragement of foolish risk _ otherwise known as moral hazard
_ abounds. Moreover, the golden rule in marketplace circles is that
those who have the gold rule.
</P>
<P>
   Be that as it may, the rescuees didn't exactly walk away from
their crash unharmed. Their stake was valued at $4.6 billion when
the year began. The salvage deal gave the rescuers 90 percent of
the company, which left existing investors with just over $400
million. This means investors who put up $10 million, which is
often the minimum stake in these hedge funds, have seen their
investments reduced to $400,000.
</P>
<P>
   As for those in the buyout group, they have assumed a huge risk
that may or may not pay off. No doubt they thought the risk worth
the reward of possible profits while helping calm a world
marketplace already in turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   The thing about these risky investment ventures is that they
exist to serve the needs of high rollers and are thus exempt from
traditional regulation. It's basically a crapshoot for consenting
adults. Given this, it should be unthinkable for governments to use
taxpayer money to cover their bad bets.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed probably used questionable judgment by getting involved
in what should have been an entirely private matter, but the
central bank considers its role justified. Fed Chairman Alan
Greenspan told the House Banking Committee on Thursday that the
involvement was needed to protect the U.S. economy from possible
global market meltdown.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps, but the Fed may have overreacted and thus risked damage
to its credibility, because the fund's estimated $80 billion in
leveraged bets was a relatively small component of overall world
financial activity.

TEEN HACKER PROMPTS LIBRARY TO RESTRICT COMPUTER USES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RASHEEDA CRAYTON  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ The Kansas City Public Library has limited
certain types of computer use after a 16-year-old boy used library
computers to hack into other systems.
</P>
<P>
   The library caught the culprit, but he has yet to be charged.
Interstate hacking is a federal crime.
</P>
<P>
   The hacking occurred this summer when the boy sent a message to
several e-mail account holders at Arbornet.org, an Internet service
provider in Michigan, a library security report said. The message
said they had been chosen as User of the Week and entitled to a
prize. All they had to do to claim it was respond with their name,
user name and password.
</P>
<P>
   The teen received some user names and passwords from the mass
mailing. He then sent out false e-mail impersonating high-ranking
officials in the Arbornet Inc. organization and attempted to gather
more passwords.
</P>
<P>
   The library's Internet service provider, More.net, notified the
library of the attack. Library machines have identification numbers
that are sent with all terminal transmissions. After More.net
pinpointed the computer, library sign-in sheets identified the
user.
</P>
<P>
   Library officials said the first incident appeared to be the
work of someone who accidentally found his way into Arbornet's
system and decided to have some fun while he was there.
</P>
<P>
   But the second hack a month later led officials to believe these
were calculated attacks. In July, the boy tried to hack into the
root directory of C-Plusnet and crashed its system for an entire
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   John Carson, C-Plusnet's system administrator, said: ``If he'd
hacked into a government computer after gaining access to my root,
it would have looked like I was doing it (the hacking) and
everything he'd done would have come back on me.''
</P>
<P>
   The crash prevented roughly 20 customers from using the system.
</P>
<P>
   After the second incident, the library changed security
measures. The library is now limiting access to Telnet, the system
used by the hacker, said Cheptoo Kositany-Buckner, the library's
director of computer support services.
</P>
<P>
   Telnet connections are similar to those used to visit a site on
the World Wide Web. Both are a way to access another computer's
databases and systems, but Telnet connections provide broader
access and usually require a password. At the library, Telnet
allows patrons direct access to databases and catalogs from other
libraries.
</P>
<P>
   Telnet use is now limited to accessing other library databases.
Since the change, Kositany-Buckner said she's received only a
handful of complaints.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people wanted to be able to Telnet into work to get
e-mail,'' she said. ``Once we explain (about the hacker), they've
been pretty understanding.''
</P>
<P>
   This policy is not unusual. Jim King, technology coordinator of
the nearby Johnson County (Kan.) Library system, said the same
thing could not have happened with library computers there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our Internet stations don't allow Telnet, specifically for
that reason,'' King said. ``Our work stations are pretty secure.''
</P>
<P>
   Hackers still make attempts from Johnson County Library
computers, King said, and cautioned that no system is entirely
hacker-proof.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ninety to 95 percent of our users are well-intentioned,'' King
said. ``It's that approximately 5 percent who have other agendas in
mind that are causing the problem, and that's a real shame.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the Telnet misuse, Kositany-Buckner said the
hacker downloaded a program from another site, stored it on the
library computer's hard drive, and then ran that program to execute
his attack on the two systems.
</P>
<P>
   The new rules prevent a machine from running a program not put
on the computer by library staff.
</P>
<P>
   Kositany-Buckner said the hacker has damaged the library's
reputation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would still like to prosecute him because he is damaging our
integrity and cutting away services for the rest of our
taxpayers,'' Kositany-Buckner said.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Bradbury, director of the Kansas City Library, said the
hacker had used Bluford and Main library terminals. The hacker was
suspended from the library for one year and could face criminal
charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``The library took this matter very seriously,'' Bradbury said.
``He did something he shouldn't have done and we took appropriate
action.''

SENIOR ASTRONAUTS SET SIGHTS ON SKY AT KANSAS SPACE CENTER

<TEXT>
<P>
   HUTCHINSON, Kan. _ For the 33 ``astronaut trainees'' here this
week, there is special meaning in John Glenn's plans to return to
space, 36 years after he became the first American to orbit the
globe.
</P>
<P>
   After all, many of those attending the weeklong program at the
Kansas Cosmosphere and Space Center are contemporaries of the
77-year-old Glenn.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm 78,'' said Leland Townley, a retired electrical engineer
from Topeka, Kan. ``It does make it kind of interesting.''
</P>
<P>
   Vernon Coon, a 62-year-old grass-seed farmer from Shedd, Ore.,
said his fellow students ``look at what Glenn is doing as just one
facet of what you can do at an older age.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you think about it, it's pretty darn exciting,'' said Rob
Kuhns, the Cosmosphere's education director. ``It shows space is
not just for the youngest people. He's an honest-to-God hero and
people want to see him go up again.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cosmosphere program is sponsored by Elderhostel, a nonprofit
organization that provides educational experiences for those 55 and
older.
</P>
<P>
   Participants talked about the U.S. senator's Oct. 29 launch into
space aboard the shuttle Discovery and how it would differ from the
ride he took in a cramped Mercury capsule in 1962.
</P>
<P>
   But they spent most of their time talking about what was in
store for them: a rocket shoot; a stress test in a centrifuge that
can produce more G-forces than Glenn will experience in the space
shuttle; time in an F-101 simulator; and a mission aboard the
center's shuttle simulator, the Falcon.
</P>
<P>
   When it's picture time, there even will be a chance to climb
into a spacesuit for that souvenir photo.
</P>
<P>
   Since Sunday, staff members at the Cosmosphere have been
saturating participants, who range in age from 55 to 84, with
training and hands-on opportunities to experience some of the
mysteries of space flight.
</P>
<P>
   One of the lecturers was Randall Chambers, former NASA aerospace
engineer and life scientist and later a faculty member at Wichita
State University. Chambers helped design the launch couches that
protected the Mercury astronauts from crushing G-forces during
their flights.
</P>
<P>
   Chambers, who is retired and volunteers at the Cosmosphere,
showed a 1961 photograph of Glenn being tested in a huge
centrifuge. Copies of medical data on the original tests on Glenn
are included in the center's archives.
</P>
<P>
   A highlight of the week came when the students assembled model
rockets and then took them to the Kansas State Fairgrounds for
blastoff.
</P>
<P>
   From the white launch trailer, five at a time, the participants
positioned themselves behind the individual control panels.
</P>
<P>
   On cue and in order, each activated the launch console with a
flip of a toggle switch. Then the countdown, 5-4-3-2-1, and the red
button was mashed.
</P>
<P>
   Foot-long rockets whooshed into the sky. Heads snapped upward to
watch.
</P>
<P>
   Nose cones separated, and the rockets dropped back to Earth amid
cheers and speculation on how high each flew.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know it would be this much fun,'' gasped Nati
Deupree, a 65-year-old former travel consultant from Branford,
Conn.
</P>
<P>
   The excitement of the launch was universal. Even Albert Yee, a
79-year-old retired Air Force colonel from Oakland, Calif., with
more than 7,000 hours in the air to his credit, displayed the
widest of smiles when his rocket successfully launched.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of us were Depression babies, and we never got a chance
to play,'' said Julianna Hamann, 67, of Alpine, Calif., as she
waited her turn at the launch trailer. ``We had to go to work. Now
we're getting that chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Milks, 63, of Bemidji, Minn., was quick to agree: ``We
were too busy working and raising kids. Now we're picking up what
we missed the first time around.''
</P>
<P>
   Although participants came from across the country with a wide
range of pre-retirement professions, by midweek they already were
on a first-name basis and were cementing new friendships.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike some of the Elderhostel programs, which are more
easygoing and provide more free time, the Cosmosphere offering is
intensive. Most hours are filled with activity focused on the space
program _ past and present.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm totally impressed,'' said Bob Duran, a 58-year-old farmer
and crop sprayer from Johnson City in Kansas' far southwest corner.
</P>
<P>
   Other students came from Arizona, Colorado, New Jersey and a
handful of other states.
</P>
<P>
   About 270,000 people will enroll this year in at least one of
the 10,000 educational programs offered through the international
Elderhostel organization.
</P>
<P>
   Some select their programs based on location and use them to get
away from heat or cold at home or to visit nearby family and
friends.
</P>
<P>
   Others are attracted by special areas of interest.
</P>
<P>
   Townley, from Topeka, has attended Elderhostel classes with his
wife all over the world for more than a decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``Elderhostels are my magic kingdom,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But the Cosmosphere session is special: Instead of his wife,
this time he is attending with his 56-year-old son, Duane, of
Midland, Mich. Both men are electrical engineering graduates of
Kansas State University.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't get together like this very often,'' Leland Townley
said.

SENIOR POLITICAL FIGURES ALREADY DEBATING PUNISHMENT FOR CLINTON 
 
(FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, OCT. 4) 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CRAGG HINES 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Even before the House agrees to launch a formal
impeachment inquiry, senior political figures have leaped far ahead
to consider how Congress will handle the ultimate question of
handing out punishment to President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest question _ and, in the minds of some congressional
leaders, the only remaining one _ is what that penalty will be. The
only recourse mentioned in the Constitution is the Senate removing
the president from office. But as the Clinton scandal stands now,
that remains an unlikely result.
</P>
<P>
   Other alternatives are some form of censure or perhaps even a
fine or forfeiture of some privilege, such as a government pension
_ a constitutionally untested prospect.
</P>
<P>
   Even Senate Judiciary Chairman Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, who believes
the ``totality of the evidence'' against Clinton amounts to
impeachable conduct, does not see a clear outcome.
</P>
<P>
   Impeachment ``may be the best remedy,'' Hatch said Friday. ``It
may be the best thing for the American people. But it may not be.
And we've got to look at that very carefully and do what's in the
best interests of our country.''
</P>
<P>
   The committee's ranking Democrat, Sen. Joseph Biden of Delaware,
said that formal impeachment did not have to be invoked to punish
Clinton _ a view that is unlikely to prevail in the
Republican-controlled House and Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``While I have not decided what ultimately should happen, I do
want to suggest that it is certainly constitutionally permissible
to consider a middle ground as a resolution to this matter,'' Biden
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Such an approach might bring together those of the president's
detractors who believe there needs to be some sanction, but are
willing to stop short of impeachment, as well as those of the
president's supporters who reject impeachment but are willing to
concede that some sanction ought to be implemented,`` Biden said.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., said Clinton's
action ``obviously ... deserves some response on behalf of the
Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   The punishment debate is procedurally premature. The House
Judiciary Committee is scheduled to meet Monday and Tuesday to
determine if a formal impeachment inquiry should be launched. A
Democratic proposal to limit the length and scope of such an
investigation is expected to be defeated by the committee's
Republican majority.
</P>
<P>
   The full House is expected Friday to approve the Republican plan
to mount an inquiry that has no constraints on time or subject
matter. Congress would then begin a three-week campaign recess.
</P>
<P>
   To a significant extent, both parties have their eye on the
calendar _ namely the House and Senate elections on Nov. 3.
Democrats and Republicans would both like to hit the campaign trail
with the troublesome Clinton question framed most advantageously
for their candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats see an edge in having the scandal well on the road to
resolution and hope the public is with them. ``The American people
have said they want it to come to closure,'' Daschle said.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans believe their aggressive pursuit of impeachment is
not only required by the Constitution but also satisfies their more
conservative political base.
</P>
<P>
   The growing debate about punishment for Clinton short of removal
from office stems from a hard political count. Hatch said
proponents of ousting the president will almost certainly be short
of the required two-thirds vote in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may be that if more hasn't come out or if people do not
feel we can get 67 votes, it may be that that is the time when
something else can be resolved,'' Hatch said.
</P>
<P>
   Even though censure is not mentioned in the Constitution, Hatch
believes it is within Congress' right.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it would have to be done very carefully'' to avoid
transgressing the Constitution's prohibition on ``bills of
attainder,'' or a legislatively enacted punishment.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a lot more difficult than people today realize,''
Hatch said.
</P>
<P>
   Other Republican leaders have defended their approach to the
impeachment question as being properly deliberative.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're pursuing a constitutional process,'' said Senate
Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss. ``It's the right thing to do.
We don't have any option.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House sees ``a partisan process designed for partisan
gain,'' the words press secretary Joe Lockhart used Friday to
describe the latest release by the House Judiciary Committee of
evidence amassed by independent counsel Kenneth Starr.
</P>
<P>
   As the House prepares to consider formally kicking off its
inquiry, Democrats have accused Republicans of lowering the bar on
what constitutes an impeachable offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think bad conduct is enough, frankly, for impeachment,''
Lott said last week. ``If you have brought disrepute on the office,
that is sufficient.
</P>
<P>
   Daschle said that was too wide a net.
</P>
<P>
   ``Using that criteria, most presidents would probably have been
impeached at one point,'' the Democratic leader said. ``Seriously,
I don't know that that's a very judicious criteria. ... That
certainly wouldn't be my criteria.''
</P>
<P>
   Daschle was also critical of what appears to be shaping up as an
open-ended House inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what the Republicans are trying to do on
impeachment,'' Daschle said. ``All I do know is they appear to be
dragging it out incessantly.''
</P>
<P>
   Both sides are sensitive to the appearance of how they are
proceeding.
</P>
<P>
   Even as she complained about Republican plans to release the
additional Starr material and launch a full inquiry, Rep. Sheila
Jackson Lee, D-Texas, a member of the Judiciary Committee,
acknowledged that the objections of she and other Democrats could
be misunderstood.
</P>
<P>
   ``When this is played out in the public arena it looks as if we
have strident Democrats, some say political hacks, and the
white-hat-wearing Republicans who want the people to know
everything,'' Jackson Lee said &QL;

RUSSIAN MAIL DELIVERY DISRUPTED BY LACK OF MONEY 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By MICHAEL WINES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ In a season of crashing banks, plunging rubles,
bouncing paychecks, failing cropsand rotating governments, maybe
it is not the ultimate insult. But the nation that bore Tolstoy and
Chekhov, and still regards a well-written letter as a labor of
love, is buckling a little this week, because it can no longer wish
good health to Baba Anya in Omsk.
</P>
<P>
   The Post Office is broke.
</P>
<P>
   In 60 of the country's 89 statelike regions, more than 1,000
mail cars have been sidetracked, many stuffed with up to 18 tons of
letters, newspapers and parcels. The state Railway Ministry refuses
to carry more mail until the Post Office makes good on some 210
million rubles in old bills _ about $13 million in today's dollars,
or $35 million in dollars six weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Air mail, which amounts to one of every four or five letters,
was also suspended at one of Moscow's major airports until this
week, when the Post Office coughed up 5 million rubles for old
bills. A second airport is still demanding 3 million rubles for
past-due debts.
</P>
<P>
   So much mail is backed up that post offices in Moscow and
elsewhere have simply stopped accepting out-of-town mail, except
for areas that can be easily reached by truck. Delivery schedules
have fallen weeks, and perhaps months, behind.
</P>
<P>
   ``The situation is really extraordinary,'' said Vladimir
Sherekhov, the deputy chief of mail service administration in the
government's Communications Committee. ``We've never had anything
like this before.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the Post Office has been lucky. Extraordinary is the rule
elsewhere in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Until Friday, the lower house of Parliament was preparing to sue
the government for failure to provide soap, heat, toilet paper and
copy-machine paper in the legislature's monumental downtown
offices. It turned out that politicians had exhausted their funds
by cutting short their recess and returning to address the nation's
economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the week, officials said Russia's Arctic shipping
routes may close next month because half the nation's icebreakers
are in disrepair and there is no money to fix them. The oldest of
the ships is so ancient that its nickname is Granny.
</P>
<P>
   Such anecdotal evidence that Russia is losing its wheels, like
one of its old, ill-maintained Volga sedans, is everywhere. But
oddly, real signs of public distress are not particularly common,
perhaps because the system rarely seems to shed a part as big as a
postal system.
</P>
<P>
   If the U.S. Postal Service is increasingly a pipeline for
sweepstakes notices and bills, the Russian Post Office still holds
a special place in the national conversation. Russians still write
letters to each other, frequently and fervently, and many in remote
regions get their news through the mail.
</P>
<P>
   Millions use the mails to ship canned goods and other provisions
to needy relatives and friends in faraway areas, an especially
vital service in winter. And in the last few years, the Post Office
has become a vehicle for a growing mail-order trade in books,
clothes and other catalog items not readily available outside big
cities.
</P>
<P>
   Exactly why all this has rumbled to a halt is in some dispute.
What is clear is that the Post Office and the Railway Ministry both
suffer from what ails every Russian venture, private and public
alike: Nobody pays his bills.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The state Railway Ministry complains that it is continually
stiffed by customers who believe the railroads are honor-bound to
carry freight whether they are paid or not. The government has
specified nearly 40 categories of freight which the railroads must
carry for next to nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Among the biggest deadbeats are the ``power ministries'' _ the
military and interior departments _ which did not pay during Soviet
times and feel little need to pay now.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a psychology formed during the socialist period,'' said
Tatiana Pashkova, the deputy spokeswoman for the ministry, ``and
the same situation exists with the Post Office. We've been in
dispute for a very long time. Always we try to understand their
differences. But we can't carry cargo for free.''
</P>
<P>
   No kidding, says the Post Office: It, too, is owed 200 million
rubles by government agencies, and is barred from raising rates
even though freight costs are outstripping revenues. Moreover, the
Post Office is also required by the government to carry some forms
of mail, such as pension checks, at reduced rates.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the state Communications Department say they also
suspect an ulterior motive in the railroads' actions: a struggle to
dominate the thriving mail-order business.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's competition between us and the railroads for the
delivery of parcels, and I think decisions made by the railroads
are mainly explained by this competition,'' Sherekhov said. ``They
blame us for carrying some commercial cargoes instead of mail.''
</P>
<P>
   The Railways Ministry's spokeswoman, Ms. Pashkova, said such
``commercial cargoes'' are indeed a problem, but only because the
railroads know that the Post Office has already gotten cash to
transport the packages. The railroads are still waiting for their
share of that money, she said.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the situation has come to a boil. In late
September the railroads cut mail service in and out of Moscow,
effectively decapitating the postal system and forcing officials to
draft a fleet of trucks to move letters in and out of the city.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of empty and full rail cars have clogged some local
yards to the point where moving cars into position for unloading
has become difficult. At last count, 39 loaded cars were awaiting
service at one yard. And customers are getting angry.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've gotten all kinds of complaints,'' said Viktor Salikov, a
deputy in the Communications Department's mail shipping center.
``People are even coming to us, searching for mail that was sent
weeks ago.''

US JOB GROWTH SLOWS ,  JOBLESS RATE EDGES UP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOANN MULLER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; In one of the clearest signs yet of a weakening domestic
economy, the government Friday reported a significant slowdown in
job growth and higher unemployment.
</P>
<P>
   The Labor Department figures for September, which surprised many
economists, suggest that the financial crisis in Asia and other
parts of the world is beginning to take a wider toll on the US
economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We may not be catching a full-blown case of the Asian flu, but
we sure do have a case of the sniffles,'' said David Wyss, chief
economist at Standard &AMP; Poor's/DRI in Lexington, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Although most forecasters believe the economy is still growing
at a healthy rate, they're worried that things could sour quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Recession is now on the radar screen. It's not our forecast,
but it's on the radar screen,'' said Larry Horwitz, managing
director of Primark Decision Economics in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's unemployment rate edged up to 4.6 percent in
September, from 4.5 percent in August. It's the highest level since
March, when the jobless rate was 4.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The number of new jobs created rose by only 69,000 last month,
far behind the August rate of 309,000. It was the weakest gain
since January 1996, when a series of severe snowstorms curtailed
business activity. Analysts had expected about 195,000 new jobs for
the month.
</P>
<P>
   Manufacturers have been cutting jobs for months, as companies
that rely on exports have been first to suffer the effects of the
overseas &UR;  &LR; turmoil. Manufacturers have shed 114,000 jobs since the
beginning of the year.
</P>
<P>
   What surprised many economists about last month was that service
sectors of the economy _ such as construction, temporary help, and
retailing _ also experienced slower job growth.
</P>
<P>
   Temporary employment agencies are typically among the first to
feel the effects of an economic slowdown because companies that
rely on temps when they're busy soon discover they no longer need
the extra help. The government said temporary services lost 44,000
jobs in September.
</P>
<P>
   Builders also tend to feel the early effects of a slowdown. The
government reported 20,000 fewer construction jobs last month,
reflecting a decline in the number of new homes being built.
</P>
<P>
   ``Up until this point, the service sector, because of its
underlying strength, has been a job engine,'' said Horwitz.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, all of that is either grinding to a halt or growing much
more slowly.''
</P>
<P>
   Workers' average paychecks edged up only a penny last month, to
$12.86 an hour _ proof that inflation is not a problem and that
further interest rate cuts are likely, many economists agreed.
</P>
<P>
   Overtime hours were also down, another indication that the
economy is cooling off.
</P>
<P>
   Last week the government cut short-term interest rates by a
quarter of a point to cushion the US economy from the effects of
the global crisis.
</P>
<P>
   But with all signs pointing to a continued slowdown, economists
are forecasting additional rate cuts.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never get one rate cut. It's like eating one potato chip.
It never happens,'' Wyss said.
</P>
<P>
   Horwitz predicted rates will fall between one-quarter and
three-quarters of a point in the next three to four months,
``depending on how fast the bad news comes.''
</P>
<P>
   While the job figures raised concern about the future, most
economists said US growth continues at a healthy pace.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the the moment, the economy still remains solid,'' said
Mark Zandi, an economist at Regional Financial Associates Inc. in
West Chester, Penn. ``It's just that activity is slowing, and the
outlook at the moment is much darker.''

DEFLATION HAS TWO FACES, AND ONE OF THEM ISN'T PRETTY  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, OCT. 4) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By LOUIS UCHITELLE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   How can lower prices possibly be bad? Who, for example, is not
pleased to buy a new car today for less than the same model cost a
year ago? That isn't hypothetical.
</P>
<P>
   Prices really have dropped for some models. But beware: The
cheerful experience of paying less today for a new car, or new
shoes, or anything else may become a haunting experience tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   The phenomenon in question is deflation, which means a general
decline in prices. The word had become an antique from the Great
Depression. But the spreading Asian crisis, plunging stock prices
and excess capacity (more goods are produced than people will buy)
are bringing deflation back into the language.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, now uses the word,
most recently declaring that ``deflation from the Far East is
heading our way.'' And gradually deflation is becoming a familiar
idea.
</P>
<P>
   Deflation is not yet happening in the United States. Prices are
not falling across the board. But they are dropping for a growing
number of goods. Cars are one example. So is some apparel, steel
and fuel oil. The Consumer Price Index, covering both goods and
services, continues to rise, at a very mild 1.6 percent a year.
</P>
<P>
   But the index for goods alone rose by only 0.2 percent in the 12
months ended in August, the smallest gain in nearly 40 years. Over
the broad spectrum of goods and services, says Mark Blaug, an
economic historian, ``inflation is clearly converging toward
zero.''
</P>
<P>
   Zero inflation has a happy side. A small wage increase adjusted
for nonexistent inflation represents a real improvement in buying
power. Deflation can also be a happy experience, when the next new
suit claims a smaller share of a month's wages than the last one
did.
</P>
<P>
   But deflation, unfortunately, is not limited to falling prices.
It can mean falling wages, too, and it becomes painful when incomes
fall faster than prices. In fact, there is a good deflation and a
bad deflation, and something in between.
</P>
<P>
   Good deflation was the American experience from 1870 until 1896.
Prices fell almost every year, but wages and profits, instead of
being squeezed out, climbed. The reason was rapidly rising
productivity.
</P>
<P>
   In an era of rapid expansion and much new technology, the
revenue each worker earned for his company rose despite falling
prices. More money was available for both wages and profits, and
both rose.
</P>
<P>
   Consider transportation. As railroads spread across the country,
replacing horses, more freight and more passengers were moved
longer distances, faster, through all seasons. Revenue per railroad
worker rose while rates fell. The telephone brought a similar
result in communications, and the Sears, Roebuck catalogue in
retailing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The 19th-century deflation was productivity driven and the
current deflation is not; it is driven by excess capacity around
the world,'' said Jeffrey Madrick, who is writing a book on
productivity.
</P>
<P>
   Various economists agree. Official statistics show little, if
any, enduring improvement in the weak rate of productivity growth
that has prevailed for 25 years. A few experts maintain that a new
era of rising productivity has dawned that is not yet captured in
the statistics.
</P>
<P>
   But these days, as prices fall or cease to rise, corporate
profits have grown more slowly or disappeared entirely. Job growth
has also subsided, and layoff announcements appear more frequently.
Rising productivity does not seem to be saving the day.
</P>
<P>
   Does that mean the United States is condemned to experience the
bad kind of deflation again? Not necessarily. The Depression
featured the classic bad deflation. A stock market crash,
unexpected bankruptcies, defaults, bank runs and bank failures
dried up the credit on which any economy depends.
</P>
<P>
   With prices and wages falling rapidly, people and companies
found themselves without enough income to repay debts. That
produced more defaults, and even harder times.
</P>
<P>
   Something like that is happening in Asia today, and could spread
to the United States. But having learned from the Depression,
governments today have the policy tools and knowledge to prevent
this. What's more, they know how to to get a stagnant economy
moving again, by using big increases in government spending, if
lower interest rates don't do the trick.
</P>
<P>
   If good deflation seems unlikely and bad deflation preventable,
the in-between scenario could well develop. Prices would fall
slowly, not swiftly, and corporate revenue would contract
gradually, leaving less money for wages and profits.
</P>
<P>
   Without faster productivity growth, as Blaug put it, ``there
will be increasing conflict between labor and management over who
gets what share of the smaller pie.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   What a difference two months can make.
</P>
<P>
   As recently as this summer, the debate between market-timers and
buy-and-hold investors was all but dead: Buy-and-hold investors had
declared victory, and few were disagreeing. After all, this year
was shaping up as yet another in which virtually no market timers _
investors who try to jump in and out of stocks at the most
opportune moments _ were doing better than the overall market.
</P>
<P>
   But with the broad market down 20 percent from its midsummer
highs, buy-and-hold investors are having their faith tested.
</P>
<P>
   How should you decide whether to try timing the market? Begin by
acquainting yourself with the compelling statistical case against
it: Fewer than 20 percent of market timers are able to beat a
buy-and-hold strategy on a risk-adjusted basis. And when taxes are
taken into account, it's even more difficult for market timers to
come out ahead because of capital gains.
</P>
<P>
   Buy-and-holders, however, mistakenly consider the matter to be
solely about statistics. These investors don't throw in the towel
at the wrong times because they are ignorant of the data; they do
so because they can't take the psychological pain of an extended
market decline.
</P>
<P>
   The lesson, of course, is that you shouldn't wait until the
bottom of the next bear market to discover that you're a closet
market timer. After all, investors who try to execute a
buy-and-hold strategy but lose nerve at the bottom of the next bear
market will likely be worse off than investors who pursue a
thoughtful market-timing strategy that looks inferior on
statistical grounds.
</P>
<P>
   Latter-day converts to the buy-and-hold strategy assure me that
they won't be foolish and throw in the towel in a bear market. But
I don't believe them. The only investors who could persuade me
otherwise are those who were fully invested in late 1974, at the
bottom of the last severe bear market. And there are precious few
of them. All the other buy-and-holders either aren't telling the
truth or are too young to have anything more than hope about how
they will behave in the next bear market.
</P>
<P>
   How do investors behave at market troughs? In the 1973-74 bear
market, Martin Zweig, a market forecaster, counted the percentage
of newsletter ads in Barron's that were bullish _ a sensitive
barometer of the public mood, because newsletter publishers know
which way the wind is blowing. In the last six months of that
market, he said, there were a number of weeks in which not one ad
was bullish.
</P>
<P>
   Why is it so psychologically difficult to stay fully invested,
when it's clear statistically that most investors would be better
off in the long run if they did? A main reason is that the long run
is much longer than the typical investor's attention span.
</P>
<P>
   Ask yourself this: How long do you think you must hold your
stocks to be assured that you'll at least stay even with riskless
Treasury bills? Five years? Not good enough.
</P>
<P>
   According to Professor Jeremy Siegel at the Wharton School of
the University of Pennsylvania, stocks failed to keep pace with
inflation in 25 percent of the rolling five-year periods since
1802. The situation is barely better when investors hold for 10
years; 20 percent of those periods failed to keep up with T-bills.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, to get the failure rate down to just 5 percent _ a
benchmark for an acceptable bet _ investors must be willing to hold
stocks for more than 20 years. No wonder so few investors have
sufficient staying power to buy and hold.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the psychological strain of buying and holding
shouldn't seduce you into thinking that following just any market
timing system will do better: Not all market timers are created
equal.
</P>
<P>
   But there are a select few market-timing newsletters _ just five
among all those that I track _ that have shown that they can at
least immunize investors, relatively speaking, from more risk than
the performance they forfeit in the process. The Elliott Wave
Theorist, for example, has had an annualized return of 12 percent
since 1982 _ 3.6 percentage points shy of the Wilshire 5000, but at
just about half the risk.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1982, however, only one newsletter beat the market's
overall return through Aug. 31 _ Systems and Forecasts, published
by Gerald Appel in Great Neck, N.Y.

STOCKS BOUNCE BACK, BUT RALLY IS UNEVEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   After four days of free fall, stocks bounced back Friday, with
the Dow Jones Industrial Average rising more than 150 points on
heavy trading. But it was a fretful, uneven rally. And given the
enfeebled state of the world economy, specialists warned that more
unpleasantness lies ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Still, for one day this week, investors could take comfort from
a solid gain in the Dow. The good news was delayed by an 84-point
drop in the first hour of trading. Investors may have been spooked
by a weak unemployment report from the Labor Department. The
nation's jobless rate rose a tenth of a percentage point to 4.6
percent. More troubling was the sparse number of new jobs created
last month _ 69,000, the poorest performance since January of 1996.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, figures on industrial production offered still more
disappointment. The Commerce Department announced that factory
orders rose 0.9 percent, due to increased aircraft orders and the
end of the strike that shut down auto production at General Motors
Corp. But apart from transportation machinery, orders actually fell
by 1.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   However, the market shook off these problems as the day
progressed. President Clinton offered encouraging words about a
Monday meeting of the world's central bankers aimed at heading off
a global recession. In addition, bottom-feeders began to snap up
stocks that had become a lot cheaper in recent days.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the Dow closed up 152.16 to 7784.69, on volume of
897 million shares. That put the Dow index about 4 percent lower
for the week. The S&AMP;P 500 index rose 16.21 to 1002.60, but the
Nasdaq composite index, home of the hottest high-tech stocks, rose
only 2.65 to 1614.98.
</P>
<P>
   ``It turned out being a decent day, when all is said and done,''
said Robert MacIntosh, vice president and portfolio manager at
Eaton Vance Management in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   It might have been better except for the weakness in tech
stocks. Computer networking and telecommunications firms like Cisco
Systems Inc. and Lucent Technologies Inc. lost ground as investors
worried that the Asian economic crisis would cut into their export
revenues. Software maker PeopleSoft Inc. was the most actively
traded US stock Friday. It lost 25 percent of its value on
analysts' predictions of weaker sales, falling 83/16 to 245/16 on
the Nasdaq exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Aspen Technology Inc. of Cambridge, Mass., halted trading in its
stock Friday, after shares had fallen 93/16 to 1413/16 on the
Nasdaq exchange. The company said it will release preliminary
figures on its first quarter of fiscal 1999, which ended Wednesday.
A statement issued by the company suggested that the preliminary
numbers will show an unexpected drop in earnings and revenues.
</P>
<P>
   However, utility stocks and consumer products companies like
Procter &AMP; Gamble, helped to lead a solid blue-chip recovery.
Meanwhile, US Treasury bond prices continued to soar as investors
sought a safe haven for their money. Higher bond prices mean lower
bond yields. In fact, the yield for 30-year Treasury bonds fell to
4.84 percent, a record low.
</P>
<P>
   What will Monday bring? David Wyss, chief economist with
Standard &AMP; Poor's DRI in Lexington, Mass., expects continued
volatility in stock prices, but thinks the worst is over. ``As long
as we avoid a recession,'' Wyss said, ``we should start seeing a
healthy rally.''
</P>
<P>
   But Tim Ghriskey, senior portfolio manager for Dreyfus Corp. in
New York, noted that October can be the cruelest month for stock
investors. There's a long tradition of October crashes, after all.
And then there's the tax law that requires mutual funds to dump
their money-losing stocks this month, if they want to write off the
losses on their tax returns.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you think about it, there are a lot of mutual funds that
have negative returns this year,'' Ghriskey noted. And that could
mean a lot of stock dumped on a shell-shocked market in the next
four weeks.

FOR CELTICS, BUSINESS AS USUAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILL MCDONOUGH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   They are all dressed up with no place to go. Every workday, Rick
Pitino and his staff gather at the Celtics' downtown office and go
over the practice schedules, knowing there is not going to be any
practice. As crazy as it might seem, Pitino and his staff go
through all of their preparations just as though the players were
in the locker room ready to go. But there are no players _ and no
practices _ because of the NBA lockout.
</P>
<P>
   Pitino told fans at the annual Red Auerbach golf tournament this
week that his staff keeps everything up and running so it can swing
into action as soon as the lockout is over. The Celtics even have a
lineup of free agents they are ready to court. It seemed evident
from his remarks that Pitino plans to have Antoine Walker, Ron
Mercer, Kenny Anderson, and rookie Paul Pierce carry his club this
year, and is looking for a big man to put in the middle.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   In terms of talent, the Patriots should have little trouble with
the Saints Sunday at New Orleans. But the Saints are playing as
hard as any team in the league and Mike Ditka will work the
anticipated crowd of 67,000 into a frenzy. Ditka played to the fans
after his team won its only prior home game this season (19-14 over
Carolina), awarding a game ball to the fans, who created enough
noise to impact the game even though there were only 50,000 in the
building for that one.
</P>
<P>
   Noise will be critical to the Saints' chances. New Orleans has
given up just 44 points in three games. However, they have played
offensive pushovers Carolina, St. Louis, and Indianpolis. This will
be their first test against a team with major firepower. The
Saints' success on defense can be attributed to the talent of
coordinator Zavan Yaralian. Last week, when they won at
Indianapolis, the Saints blitzed more than 50 percent of the time,
which means they will be coming after Patriots quarterback Drew
Bledsoe with a vengeance. This is where the crowd will come into
play.
</P>
<P>
   If the Superdome is as loud as anticipated, Bledsoe likely will
have trouble changing plays at the line of scrimmage without
calling some unwanted timeouts to gather his senses. He had to do
that three times in the season opener at Denver when he couldn't
get his teammates in the right places to block the Bronco blitzes.
If the Patriots can handle the New Orleans blitz package, they
should put some big numbers on the scoreboard.
</P>
<P>
   Defensively, the Patriots should be able to handle the Saints
offense. Lamar Smith is a solid runner, but the Patriots have shut
down backs a lot better than him in the last couple of years.
Quarterback Danny Wuerffel is limited. He does not have the arm
strength to throw with accuracy to the outside of the field. Almost
all of his passes are to the middle of the field. If he does go
outside, it is on a fade route where he throws it up for grabs and
hopes one of his receivers can run underneath it.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A look at the Saints from people who have played against them
this year:
</P>
<P>
   Dom Capers, head coach, Carolina: ``Their defense is very good.
Last year they finished fourth overall in the league on defense and
third in total sacks. They have good team speed on defense, and are
very fast in the front seven. Their defensive ends, Wayne Martin
and Joe Johnson, make plays. Joe Fields at linebacker will be all
over the field. Offensively, they are very conservative. Last year
they had a terrible time with turnvoers so Ditka has them
protecting the ball. They have two hard-hitting backs (Smith and
Ray Zellars) and they like to run the ball behind William Roaf at
tackle. He is one of the best run blockers in the league. They are
a very physical team.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Polian, general manager, Indianapolis Colts: ``If the
Patriots don't protect the ball and give away a few gifts, they
will get beat. This team is surprising. I give them a chance for
the playoffs. They could be 9-7. They are very strong and active on
defense. They have a bunch of guys that can hit. Offensively, Roaf
is as good an offensive tackle as anyone in the league, and that
includes guys like Jonathan Ogden (of Baltimore) and big (Tony)
Boselli in Jacksonville. Their backs are straight-line runners, but
they run for their lives. The young tight end (Cam) Cleeland will
be a good player in this league. The receivers are just average and
don't have a lot of speed. Danny Wuerffel does what they want him
to do. He doesn't make mistakes. He'll take a sack rather than put
one up for grabs. He's a little better at throwing the long ball
than he was a year ago, but he is still limited in some areas of
the throwing game.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Ronald Schouten of Massachusetts General Hospital, who ran
the tests on Mike Tyson that will be used to decide if Tyson's
license to box in Las Vegas should be reinstated, did not want to
comment about the tests, but referred this reporter to a colleague,
Dr. Howard Zonana at Yale. ``I'm not all that familiar with the
background on Tyson, and this is not the usual type of thing we
deal with,'' Zonana said. ``What are the criteria to decide whether
he is capable to return to the ring? In the other things we do,
there are criteria to be used to make such a determination.
</P>
<P>
   But, in general, I would imagine he had a complete examination,
including an MRI to determine if there is any brain damage from
boxing, and other tests that are more subtle that would try to find
out why his behavior is the way it has been. Why is he impulsive?
Does he have any underlying mental disorders? Are drinking or drugs
part of it? There are psychiatric and neuropsychiatric tests that
are used to find the answers for something like this. But to
evaluate a boxer is not the usual thing we do. To box can be
perceived as a bizarre piece of behavior to begin with.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bill Parcells thinks the new Cleveland Browns will be very good
in a hurry. ``The last two teams, Jacksonville and Carolina, were
in the conference championship game in two years,'' said the Jets
coach, ``and Cleveland has a better shot at it than they did. If
they put that team togther right, they could go right past most of
the teams in this league almost immediately. Carolina went old.
Jacksonville went young. Carolina is alerady trying to change its
team around. Jacksonville has kept its nucleus and keeps adding to
it. Cleveland has all of the benfits of those two'' _ expansion
draft, extra college draft choices _ ``plus they will have more
money to spend on free agents than those teams did. They will sweep
the free agent market this year because they will have a big edge
on everyone.''

ECONOMIC VIEW: DEFLATION HAS TWO FACES, AND ONE OF THEM ISN'T
PRETTY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Oct. 4)  
 (bl)  
 By LOUIS UCHITELLE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   How can lower prices possibly be bad? Who, for example, is not
pleased to buy a new car today for less than the same model cost a
year ago?
</P>
<P>
   That isn't hypothetical. Prices have really dropped for some
models. But beware: The cheerful experience of paying less today
for a new car, or new shoes, or anything else may become a haunting
experience tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   The phenomenon in question is deflation, which means a general
decline in prices. The word had become an antique from the Great
Depression. But the spreading Asian crisis, plunging stock prices
and excess capacity (more goods are produced than people will buy)
are bringing deflation back into the language.
</P>
<P>
   Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan now uses the word, most
recently declaring that ``deflation from the Far East is heading
our way.'' And gradually deflation is becoming a familiar idea.
</P>
<P>
   Deflation is not yet happening in the United States. Prices are
not falling across the board. But they are dropping for a growing
number of goods. Cars are one example. So is some apparel, steel
and fuel oil. The Consumer Price Index, covering both goods and
services, continues to rise, at a very mild 1.6 percent a year. But
the index for goods alone rose by only two-tenths of a percent in
the 12 months ended in August, the smallest gain in nearly 40
years.
</P>
<P>
   Over the broad spectrum of goods and services, says Mark Blaug,
an economic historian, ``inflation is clearly converging toward
zero.''
</P>
<P>
   Zero inflation has a happy side. A small wage increase adjusted
for nonexistent inflation represents a real improvement in buying
power. Deflation can also be a happy experience, when the next new
suit claims a smaller share of a month's wages than the last one
did.
</P>
<P>
   But deflation, unfortunately, is not limited to falling prices.
It can mean falling wages, too, and it becomes painful when incomes
fall faster than prices. In fact, there is a good deflation and a
bad deflation, and something in between.
</P>
<P>
   Good deflation was the American experience from 1870 until 1896.
Prices fell almost every year, but wages and profits, instead of
being squeezed out, climbed. The reason was rapidly rising
productivity. In an era of rapid expansion and much new technology,
the revenue each worker earned for his company rose despite falling
prices. More money was available for both wages and profits, and
both rose.
</P>
<P>
   Consider transportation. As railroads spread across the country,
replacing horses, more freight and more passengers were moved
longer distances, faster, through all seasons. Revenue per railroad
worker rose while rates fell. The telephone brought a similar
result in communications, and the Sears, Roebuck catalog in
retailing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The 19th-century deflation was productivity driven and the
current deflation is not; it is driven by excess capacity around
the world,'' said Jeffrey Madrick, who is writing a book on
productivity.
</P>
<P>
   Most economists agree. Official statistics show little, if any,
enduring improvement in the weak rate of productivity growth that
has prevailed for 25 years. A few experts maintain that a new era
of rising productivity has dawned that is not yet captured in the
statistics. But these days, as prices fall or cease to rise,
corporate profits have grown more slowly or disappeared entirely.
Job growth has also subsided, and layoff announcements appear more
frequently. Rising productivity does not seem to be saving the day.
</P>
<P>
   Does that mean the United States is condemned to experience the
bad kind of deflation again? Not necessarily. The Depression
featured the classic bad deflation. A stock market crash,
unexpected bankruptcies, defaults, bank runs and bank failures
dried up the credit on which any economy depends. With prices and
wages falling rapidly, people and companies found themselves
without enough income to repay debts. That produced more defaults,
and even harder times.
</P>
<P>
   Something like that is happening in Asia today, and could spread
to the United States. But having learned from the Depression,
governments today have the policy tools and skill to prevent this.
What's more, they know how to to get a stagnant economy moving
again, by using big increases in government spending, if lower
interest rates don't do the trick.
</P>
<P>
   If good deflation seems unlikely and bad deflation preventable,
the in-between scenario could well develop. Prices would fall
slowly, not swiftly, and corporate revenue would contract
gradually, leaving less money for wages and profits. Without faster
productivity growth, as Blaug put it, ``there will be increasing
conflict between labor and management over who gets what share of
the smaller pie.''

NASA TO START ASSEMBLY OF SPACE STATION 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By MARK CARREAU 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   After consultations in Moscow, NASA said Friday it plans to
sidestep further delay and start assembly of the international
space station by making new payments to Russia for early
components.
</P>
<P>
   Manufacture of the components in Russia have lagged behind
schedule because of the country's faltering economy.
</P>
<P>
   The controversial strategy, which Congress plans to scrutinize,
depends on Russia's space agency receiving $60 million within days.
</P>
<P>
   NASA also proposed in September that it pay Russia another $600
million over the next four years to preserve a role for the former
Cold War rival in the U.S.-led international project.
</P>
<P>
   NASA believes the payments will reduce much of the uncertainty
over the five to six-year assembly of the new orbiting laboratory.
The project already is a year late in commencing primarily because
of Russia's lagging contributions. Other experts, however, fear
there is little to guarantee that Russia's track record will
improve.
</P>
<P>
   After Friday's meetings in Moscow with delegates from Europe,
Japan, Canada and Russia, NASA said the alliance plans to:
</P>
<P>
   Proceed with the launch of the first component from Central Asia
on Nov. 20 as scheduled.
</P>
<P>
   Stick with plans to launch the second component aboard the U.S.
space shuttle Endeavour on Dec. 3.
</P>
<P>
   Postpone the launching of the third component, Russia's service
module, from April until July 1999, but ensure it will not be
delayed longer with the $60 million payment.
</P>
<P>
   The service module is the station's first habitable component
and is slated to receive its first U.S./Russian crew about three to
four months after its launching. The service module is equipped
with a propulsion system that is needed to keep the new station
orbiting at safe altitudes above the Earth.
</P>
<P>
   Chronic funding problems in Russia have kept the service module
from meeting its original launching date of April 1998. NASA's
station managers now consider the massive module 98 percent
finished, lacking only a few critical components and ground tests.
</P>
<P>
   According to NASA spokesman James Hartsfield, the Russians
agreed at Friday's session to finish and launch the service module
and make other concessions in exchange for the $60 million.
</P>
<P>
   Those concessions include the use of Russian crew time and
stowage space in the early assembly phases of the new station for
American sponsored science experiments.
</P>
<P>
   The funds also are to prime the production of Russian Progress
cargo and Soyuz crew transport capsules.
</P>
<P>
   A half-dozen Progress capsules are needed during construction.
Thrusters on the capsules are necessary, along with those on the
service module, to periodically boost the massive station to safe
altitudes above the Earth and to furnish new propellants.
</P>
<P>
   Hartsfield said the new agreements with the Russian Space Agency
include performance milestones that will govern the transfer of
funds. One of those milestones is the shipping of the service
module from an assembly facility in Moscow to Russia's Baikonur
Cosmodrome launch site in Kazakhstan in February.
</P>
<P>
   Russia will still be required to make substantial investments in
the new space station even with the subsidy, and some outside
experts believe there is reason to question whether Russia will
ante up those funds.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you look at the Russian situation, it's unlikely the
Russian government would decide this is a priority over all the
other things that require their money,'' said Marcia Smith, an
aerospace policy analyst with the Congressional Research Service.
``They have not felt required to spend their money on this program,
perhaps feeling that sooner or later the United States would come
through with funding for it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an article of faith until quite recently that it would
be more expensive for the United States if we did this without
Russia. ``I don't know if that is still true,'' added Smith. ``The
point is the further down the path you go with Russia, the more and
more leverage they have to get money from the U.S. because then
more and more we will be locked into the current design.''
</P>
<P>
   Last month, NASA's space station managers acknowledged it will
cost them more than $660 million to hedge against Russia's
obligations. The cost of building a new refuelable U.S. propulsion
module and modifying NASA's shuttles to do station boosting will
drive the price tag to at least $1.2 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The House Science Committee has asked the White House as well as
State Department and NASA officials to a hearing in Washington next
week.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, NASA's Senate oversight committee has asked the
General Accounting Office to assess the cost of dropping the
Russians from the station partnership.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given NASA's track record, we are justifiably concerned about
what this announcement means in terms of the space station's
overall costs and time line for completion,'' said U.S. Sen. John
McCain, R-Ariz., chair of the Commerce, Science and Transportation
Committee. ``The situation in Russia could signal future needed
bailouts, and raise concerns over quality control procedures.'' &QL;

THE 100-YEAR CONUNDRUM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CAROL BIDWELL 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; ``Old age isn't for sissies,'' reads a bumper
sticker you'll likely find on a handful of cars at any senior
center.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing could be truer for 100-year-olds. They've lived through
the Great Depression and two world wars, the advent of the nuclear
age and space exploration, witnessed the rise and fall of
communism, and seen two presidents assassinated.
</P>
<P>
   While the elusive goal of evading mortality has tantalized
mankind since civilization's infancy _ the mythical Shangri-La,
Ponce de Leon's search for the fountain of youth _ scientific and
medical advances are making longer lives possible.
</P>
<P>
   But living to be 100 is a decidely mixed blessing unless you
have reasonably good health, a resourceful personality and a
spiritual outlook that allows you to keep growing and absorbing new
experiences.
</P>
<P>
   Today, because of large-scale improvements in diet, sanitation
and medical treatment, we can expect to live an average of 76
years. In another decade, that may rise to 85, said John Wilmoth, a
research demographer and professor at the University of California,
Berkeley. And in these times of exercise and low-fat diets,
open-heart surgery and cancer-fighting drugs, cloning and gene
therapy, more of us will reach that 100-year mark than ever before.
</P>
<P>
   But do we want to brave this new world?
</P>
<P>
   Looking at today's centenarians may help us answer that
question.
</P>
<P>
   ``Up until our 50s, most of us never worried about getting
old,'' said Dixon Arnett, director of the state Department of
Aging, which funnels federal and state money to local agencies.
</P>
<P>
   ``But more of us are. All of a sudden, this aging population is
!ital!us. It worries me because as people grow more frail _ and
frailty means disability _ they need more help. The question is,
how are we going to provide it?''
</P>
<P>
   That's a new worry, which state and federal legislators are now
grappling with, because it's only in the past few decades that
large numbers of people have lived to be what we consider really
old.
</P>
<P>
   Many Americans contemplating living to a ripe old age are
worried. They cite a Social Security system on the brink of
collapse as an aging population takes more from it than younger
workers will be able to pay into it. They're skeptical about a
Medicare system threatened by rising health-care costs. And, more
than anything, they fear living in a body that grows more frail
with each birthday.
</P>
<P>
   And that is the real dilemma: Seniors only want longer lives if
they can be guaranteed a relatively high quality of life, which
includes having enough money to live on along with good health.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd love to be 153 if everything hangs together,'' said
retired businessman Fred Simson, 65, of Los Feliz. ``It's the only
chance that we're ever going to get at this, and you might as well
make it as full as you can.''
</P>
<P>
   But Deirdre English, 68, of Glendale says living to be 100 is
not on her to-do list _ although she does what she can to stay
active and healthy after successfully battling ovarian cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Besides, nobody wants to be in a nursing home,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   About half the nation's 57,000 centenarians are disabled and in
nursing homes, said Lynn Adler, head of the Phoenix-based nonprofit
National Centenarian Awareness Project.
</P>
<P>
   And virtually all the remaining 28,000-plus 100-year-olds are
frail and need help from family, friends and neighbors to do daily
tasks.
</P>
<P>
   And they've been through a lot. Today's centenarians have seen
virtually all their contemporaries _ including brothers, sisters
and spouses _ and even many of their children succumb to death.
Their careers are long behind them. And the future, for many, is
just one more day in front of the TV set until heart failure,
cancer, stroke, pulmonary disease or pneumonia _ the five leading
causes of death for people 85 and older _ claim them.
</P>
<P>
   But everything isn't on &UR;  &LR; the downside.
</P>
<P>
   Today's medical advances _ the ability to replace arthritic
joints with new parts, heart bypass operations and transplants that
keep the old ticker beating, laser surgery that removes cataracts
to restore vision in old eyes _ can repair an aging body much as a
body shop restores an old car. It's not new when the mechanics _
the doctors _ are through, but it still runs.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Rumin of Pasadena, who at 66 suffers from rheumatoid
arthritis, says without joint replacement, he'd be disabled. Since
1986, surgeons have replaced both knee joints, his right hip and
his right wrist.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I found out I could have knee replacements, I was the
most grateful man in the world,'' Rumin said. ``Fifty years ago ...
I probably never would have walked at all.''
</P>
<P>
   The ability to live a full life until 100 may depend not only on
good health but on what Adler calls the ``centenarian spirit'': a
combination of positive, yet realistic attitude; love of life;
strong will and personal courage; deep spiritual beliefs; and ``an
ability to renegotiate life at every turn'' as circumstances
change.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are inevitable losses and changes that come with growing
older,'' said Adler, who has interviewed more than 3,000
centenarians. ``But how you cope with that, to be able to go
through those changes, makes the difference. The difference is some
people will say, `I've lost my husband, the love of my life, my one
and only, and I don't want to go on' _ and they don't. But
centenarians always find a reason to go on. They handle whatever's
thrown at them, and they cope _ they adapt.''
</P>
<P>
   As science fiction becomes established medical science, more
people are taking the decision about prolonging or ending their
lives into their own hands. But much like the issue of cloning,
technological advances related to aging are raising ethical and
moral questions. Euthanasia and cryogenics are two extremes.
</P>
<P>
   About 20 people _ ranging in age from their 30s to their 80s _
have paid from $55,000 to $125,000 to have their heads or their
whole bodies placed in suspended animation in tanks of liquid
nitrogen, hoping that when science can fix whatever ailed them,
they can be thawed out and brought back to life, says Jim Yount,
chief operating officer of the 800-member American Cryogenics
Society in Cupertino.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't want to die. They see this as a way to avoid
that,'' Yount said. `` But people don't want to live old.... People
who die at 80 want to come back as a 20-year-old. Most people don't
just want to live to be 100. They want to live forever.''
</P>
<P>
   Others faced with a terminal illness, or just a life of
loneliness and hopelessness, choose to end their lives, a practice
that is taboo in many religions and cultures.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the 27,000-plus members of the Denver-based Hemlock
Society, which aids and supports those who choose to end their own
lives, joined the group when they hit their late 50s or early 60s
and were staring old age in the face for the first time, said
Hemlock spokesman Don Blake.
</P>
<P>
   And for those in the middle of the road, who yearn to avoid
total deterioration but can't fathom freezing themselves to prolong
life, there is a scientifically proven method to do just that.
Proven in fruit flies and rats, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists have found that cutting back on intake of calories by
about one-third leaves creatures in a state of semi-starvation in
which the body conserves energy to save itself. That method has
prolonged the lives of fruit flies and rats by 20 percent to 30
percent. But there's no proof it will work with humans _ even if
humans, who seem genetically programmed to live a maximum of 120 to
130 years but die much sooner, would accept a longer life of
privation and hunger, said Dr. Bruce A. Ferrell, a geriatric
physician and associate professor of medicine at UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no indication that, whatever we do, we're going to
affect the human life span anytime soon _ or ever,'' he said.
``There is no such thing as the fountain of youth. It doesn't
exist.''
</P>
<P>
   But if there were a fountain of youth, how much would be pay for
a sip? Would we sell our souls for a few extra years?
</P>
<P>
   It's a knotty question without a right answer, say theologians
who specialize in medical ethics.
</P>
<P>
   Christopher Kaczor, a professor and medical ethics specialist at
the Catholic Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles, said
people with lots of money who want to use it to prolong their lives
by any means have that right, but could probably do more good by
donating to charity or other worthy causes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a question of what's prudent and reasonable,'' he said.
``If a person was 100 and he'd spend all his family's resources to
live longer, that wouldn't be prudent and reasonable. We're talking
about what's ethical, not what's legal.''
</P>
<P>
   Rabbi Scott Meltzer of the Brandeis-Bardin Institute in Simi
Valley, who is also a student of medical-ethics issues, said Jews
believe it is valid to prolong life. But it goes against the
religion's tenets to interfere with death that comes naturally as a
result of aging.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pacemakers are part of the world God created,'' he said.
``Cryogenics is an artificial block to the dying process.''
</P>
<P>
   People who seek immortality aren't ready to accept the reality
that all things that are born eventually die, theologians say, and
that some higher power decides when death comes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all need to prepare ourselves to die,'' Meltzer said. ``We
were placed on Earth and we're given an indeterminate amount of
time. The challenge is to live every day, not to try to cheat
death. Trying to live forever robs us of what it is to be alive.''
</P>
<P>
   The greatest gift younger Americans could give to aging
generations _ of which, one day, they will be a part _ is to learn
from the lives they've lived, to listen to their advice, to absorb
their wisdom, as many other cultures do, Kaczor said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to decide: Are we works of art that you keep forever?
Or are we like cars that you send to the junkyard when they get old
and broken down? It's an issue we're having to decide as more of us
get older.''

JOB CREATION LAGGED IN SEPTEMBER, U.S. REPORTS 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Job creation fell in September to the lowest rate in more than
two years, the Labor Department reported Friday _ the most
persuasive evidence yet that the financial crisis abroad is slowing
the booming U.S. economy.
</P>
<P>
   The Labor Department said the unemployment rate edged up only
slightly, to 4.6 percent from 4.5 percent in August. But payrolls
expanded by just 69,000 jobs, a fraction of the 309,000 jobs
created in August or the roughly 200,000 that had been expected by
forecasters.
</P>
<P>
   Total hours worked dipped, suggesting that production and income
were leveling out, and hourly pay barely inched up.
</P>
<P>
   The Labor Department's monthly employment report is considered
the most substantial assessment of the economy's health. Coming on
top of other signs of weakness _ falling exports, slowing retail
sales and weaker business investment _ the data reinforced a view
among economists that the eight-year-old expansion was being
crimped by the economic problems that began afflicting Asia last
year and have since spread.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a warning sign of slower economic growth ahead,'' said
Steven Roach, chief economist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter.
</P>
<P>
   Investors treated the weak jobs report not as a warning, but as
a pleasant surprise _ a green light for further easing of interest
rates by the Federal Reserve, which cut rates Tuesday for the first
time in nearly three years in an effort to forestall an economic
downturn.
</P>
<P>
   Stock prices strengthened Friday after two days of heavy losses,
and the Dow Jones industrial average rose 152.16 points, or 1.99
percent. Long-term bond yields, a barometer of interest rate
trends, fell to 4.84 percent, another in a series of 31-year lows.
</P>
<P>
   The Labor Department also reported that employment growth had
been stronger in July and weaker in August than initially reported,
underscoring that the slowdown in job growth since midsummer has
been steep.
</P>
<P>
   Excluding the gyrations caused by the General Motors strikes,
gains in employment shrank from 270,000 jobs in July to 160,000 in
August to the very modest September gain.
</P>
<P>
   ``The revisions don't change our sense of where we are,'' said
Katherine Abraham, the commissioner of the Bureau of Labor
Statistics. ``But they make the decline in job growth more
marked.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   A fraying at the edges of what was until recently a vibrant
labor market has already been reflected in a retreat in consumer
confidence in the last few weeks from record highs. The University
of Michigan, which tallies a widely followed index of consumer
confidence, reported Friday that the index slipped to 100.9 in
September from 104.4 in August.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the U.S. labor market still remains healthy by any
historical measure. The change in the overall unemployment rate,
for example, reflected a change of a few hundredths of a percentage
point that was then magnified by rounding. Unemployment among most
demographic groups _ at the lowest levels in 25 or 30 years _ has
not budged. And the percentage of Americans working actually
rebounded to a near record of 64.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are still signs of a very strong labor market,'' said
Alan Krueger, a labor economist at Princeton University. ``Most
people who want jobs are still able to find them.''
</P>
<P>
   But the snapshot of the labor market confirmed that the risks
facing the economy have shifted toward much slower growth, maybe
even recession.
</P>
<P>
   Signs of cooling in the labor market were widespread. Factory
payrolls continued to shrink in September, dropping by 16,000 jobs
and bringing the total number of manufacturing jobs lost this year
to 114,000. With exports to Asia and Latin America plunging,
imports soaring and production flat or contracting, the makers of
electrical equipment, machinery and other industrial products have
been forced to lay off workers.
</P>
<P>
   The weakness in manufacturing is likely to persist. Orders for
long-lasting goods were up over all by 0.9 percent in August, but
excluding aircraft and automobiles (which were bolstered by the end
of the GM strikes) orders declined 1.2 percent. Construction
contracted by 20,000 jobs, not just in residential building but
also in heavy construction like roads and bridges. That is the
first decline this year other than those that reflected the
vagaries of the weather and seasonal adjustments. It is also a
sharp contrast to the average monthly gains of around 24,000.
</P>
<P>
   Most striking, however, was a sharp slowdown in hiring in the
sprawling service sector, which employs more than 80 percent of
American workers. Services added just 105,000 jobs in September,
compared with the average of 215,000 a month since the start of the
year. Particularly noteworthy was that the head count at
temporary-help suppliers, a leading indicator of future permanent
hiring, dropped sharply, by 44,000. Temporary hiring has been
zigging up and down all summer, but the September slump was bigger.
</P>
<P>
   Wage inflation seems to be cooling with the labor market. The
trend in hourly pay, which seemed to be picking up in the first
half of the year, now seems to be leveling out or even slowing.
Hourly pay was up just 4 percent from a year earlier, compared with
a rise of 4.3 percent from May 1997 to May 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the overall pattern of cooling off, hiring did pick up
in a number of industries, including wholesale and retail trade,
computer services, management consulting and financial services.
The brightest spot: the amusement industry, which includes theme
parks, bowling alleys, movie theaters and video parlors, all places
where Americans can leave their worries at the door.

FIRMS HANDLING N.Y. PENSION FUND ARE DONORS TO COMPTROLLER

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Executives of a Los Angeles investment firm took a
striking interest late last year in the political fortunes of a
faraway public official: H. Carl McCall, the New York state
comptroller.
</P>
<P>
   On a single day in December, McCall's re-election campaign
received a total of $16,000 in donations from seven executives of
the firm, Freeman Spogli &AMP; Co. Three days later, the New York state
pension fund, which McCall solely controls, invested $85 million in
a fund managed by Freeman Spogli.
</P>
<P>
   The transactions involving Freeman Spogli fit a clear pattern.
Throughout his term, McCall has repeatedly awarded contracts and
other work for the $100 billion pension fund to businesses that
have given sizable sums to his re-election campaign. In numerous
instances, the donations came just before or after the firms won
work from the pension fund, according to pension fund and campaign
records.
</P>
<P>
   Since his term began in 1995, McCall has collected more than
$1.8 million from those donors, or at least 35 percent of his total
fund raising of $5.2 million, the documents show.
</P>
<P>
   McCall is well positioned to benefit from their largesse. While
pension funds for public employees in nearly every other state are
run by boards comprised of public officials and employee
representatives, New York state law grants the state comptroller
total control over the pension fund that serves public employees.
That gives McCall the power to hire investment firms, real estate
advisers, lawyers and others to help invest the holdings of the
fund, the second largest of its kind in the nation, after the
California Public Employees Retirement System.
</P>
<P>
   While it is legal for McCall to accept donations from these
firms _ unless there is explicit trading of contracts for
contributions _ this practice has come under scrutiny elsewhere.
Earlier this year, the California pension fund voted to prohibit
businesses involved with the fund from donating to board members,
saying that it wanted to avoid the taint of what is known as
``pay-to-play.''
</P>
<P>
   McCall's ability to raise money from businesses connected to the
pension fund has greatly expanded his fund-raising reach. Roughly
40 percent of his contributions are from out-of-state donors, a far
higher percentage than that of any other statewide candidate. The
heft of his campaign treasury helped McCall ward off a more
formidable Republican challenge in the November election than he
now faces. He is running against Bruce Blakeman, a Nassau County
legislator who is far behind in the polls.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, McCall said politics did not influence how he
supervised the pension fund, pointing to the growth of its assets
as evidence of his prudent management. ``We have a very
independent, professional and fair approach,'' McCall said. ``We
are very proud of our record.''
</P>
<P>
   Like similar funds around the country, the state pension fund's
assets have risen with the stock market _ to about $100 billion
from $65 billion in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that some of the donors that received pension fund work
had been involved with the fund since well before he took office.
And he pointed out that many of his donors had no ties to the
pension fund.
</P>
<P>
   McCall said that neither he nor his campaign aides had pressured
businesses or executives involved with the pension fund to make
political donations. He said his campaign fund-raisers had not
obtained the names of donors from pension fund records, but that
those names happened to appear on lists of potential donors that
the campaign had acquired from other sources, like political
consultants.
</P>
<P>
   ``They show up on other lists,'' he said. He said he could not
explain why so many names of businesses and executives working for
the pension fund were on those lists.
</P>
<P>
   But the timing of contributions suggest a correlation between
McCall's fund raising and the activities of the pension fund.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, the fund conducted a competition to choose advisers to
help it manage its real estate holdings. Of the 33 firms that
applied, the pension fund chose eight. Those eight firms and their
executives have given a total of more than $325,000 to the McCall
campaign during his term, most of it after they were selected,
records show.
</P>
<P>
   Executives at one of the firms, Clarion Partners, gave a total
of $25,000 about a month before it was selected in November 1995.
Since then, Clarion executives have given another $75,000. Clarion
has done work for the pension fund for years, but under McCall, its
fees jumped to $4.1 million 1997, from $2.8 million in 1995.
Charles Grossman, managing director of the firm, did not respond to
several messages seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   Donors linked to another of the eight firms, Heitman Capital of
Chicago, have given a total of more than $134,000 to the McCall
campaign, most of it after the firm was selected to advise the
fund. Norman Perlmutter, a Republican who is the firm's chairman
and has served on fund-raising committees for McCall, declined to
comment.
</P>
<P>
   McCall's fund raising is a stark example of a routine practice
among politicians _ receiving contributions from donors with an
interest in official actions. While there are no rules against this
practice in New York, there has been a movement around the country
to restrict such giving in certain fields.
</P>
<P>
   Under new national regulations governing the bond industry, if
firms pursue bond contracts with government agencies, they are
largely prohibited from giving to the politicians who control such
work. And other pension funds are considering following
California's lead and barring businesses involved with the funds
from giving to those who oversee them. The California rules are not
now in effect because of a court challenge.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   McCall's predecessor, Edward Regan, a Republican, was
investigated by federal and state prosecutors in the late 1980s
because of his fund-raising practices. The inquiries followed the
disclosure of memos written by members of Regan's staff, one of
which pointedly said that ``those who give will get.'' Regan denied
any impropriety and he was not charged.
</P>
<P>
   McCall, who was the president of the New York City Board of
Education before he became comptroller, said he favored tightening
state campaign finance laws, but would not restrict his fund
raising while Republicans abide by the existing rules.
</P>
<P>
   Even without changes in the law, McCall said he has avoided
mingling politics and his pension fund duties, by relying on career
professionals to run the fund and by using an advisory board to
approve all real estate investments.
</P>
<P>
   ``We stand on our record in terms of the way in which we have
selected people to do business,'' McCall said.
</P>
<P>
   McCall's donors have a variety of dealings with the pension
fund.
</P>
<P>
   Among the fund's investments are more than $1.5 billion in
mortgages, including several that are on buildings that are owned
by big contributors to McCall. Those include real-estate magnate
Paul Milstein, who made a single $28,000 donation, the legal limit,
in January 1998.
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks after the campaign received the money, the pension
fund, after extensive negotiations, agreed to lower the interest
rate on a $130 million mortgage on 7 Hanover Square, a building in
lower Manhattan that is co-owned by Milstein's company. Milstein
declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   The pension fund also lowered the interest rate on mortgages
that it holds on shopping centers owned by Pioneer Development of
Syracuse earlier this year, McCall's aides said. Pioneer vice
chairman Michael Falcone and his wife, Noreen, have made six
donations totaling $38,000 to McCall, from October 1995 to
September 1998. Falcone did not respond to several messages seeking
comment.
</P>
<P>
   The comptroller's office hires brokerage firms to assist the
pension fund in buying and selling securities, such as stocks and
bonds. Those firms are another source of donations.
</P>
<P>
   McCall's campaign has collected more than $185,000 from four
minority-owned brokerage houses in New York City, and their
executives, that work for the pension fund. That includes $53,000
received in December 1996 and January 1997, just as the pension
fund was conducting a search specifically to hire minority- and
women-owned brokerage houses.
</P>
<P>
   The four brokerage houses _ Blaylock &AMP; Partners, Ormes Capital,
Utendahl Capital and Williams Capital Group _ were among 10 that
were selected from a pool of 87 applicants, said Steven Greenberg,
a spokesman for McCall. Five of the other six firms chosen are
barred from contributing to the McCall campaign because they fall
under the rules restricting the political activities of firms that
receive work on bond deals from government agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Executives at Williams Capital Group and Utendahl Partners said
the McCall campaign called them to ask for contributions shortly
before the application process, but did not mention the pension
fund. The executives said there was no connection between the
donations and the pension fund.
</P>
<P>
   Williams Capital Group president Christopher Williams said he
had known McCall for years and was pleased with his performance as
comptroller. ``He has tried to make sure that the state manages its
activities in a prudent manner,'' Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   Executives at Ormes Capital and Blaylock &AMP; Partners did not
respond to several messages seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   Among McCall's donors, some of the most generous groups has been
executives of investment funds. Many of them, like the California
firm of Freeman Spogli &AMP; Co., appear to have little connection to
New York state government except for their business with the
pension fund.
</P>
<P>
   Executives of Freeman Spogli, which received an $85 million
investment from the pension fund in December 1997, have given
McCall's campaign more than $44,000 since June 1996. That includes
the $16,000 donated right before the investment deal was signed in
1997 and another $10,000 earlier that year while negotiations were
underway with the comptroller's office.
</P>
<P>
   Bradford Freeman, a principal at the firm, did not respond to
several messages seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   Around the time that the pension fund was investing with Freeman
Spogli last December, it also decided to invest $100 million in a
fund operated by Olympus Real Estate of Dallas. Donors connected to
Olympus have donated a total of more than $33,000, much of it
around the time that the pension fund made this and an earlier
investment with Olympus. The firm declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Other transactions follow a similar pattern. For example, in
July 1995, the pension fund decided to invest $75 million in an
investment fund run by Colony Capital of Los Angeles. Three months
later Thomas Barrack, the firm's chairman, donated $10,000, to
McCall's campaign. Over the next two years, Barrack, who declined
to comment, gave another $18,000 in donations. Others linked to the
firm donated another $21,000. Then, in March 1998, pension fund
decided to invest another $100 million in a Colony investment fund.

EFFECTS OF REUNIFICATION BESET GERMANY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN _ Saturday is Unity Day, the anniversary of the official
reunification of Germany eight years ago. The festivities that
lasted for days then are conspicuously absent this morning.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, the mood here was euphoric as fireworks lit up the sky
over the Reichstag _ the brightest it has been since Allied planes
bombed the city to near-oblivion 45 years earlier. The end of the
Cold War and the collapse of the Berlin Wall were reason to
celebrate.
</P>
<P>
   But the hangover has only recently lifted, and Germans have
begun to inspect the party scene in the light of a new day. Most
don't like what they see. Reunification and the unemployment it
spawned remain the biggest challenges facing Germany.
</P>
<P>
   The 17 million people who live in the five states that make up
the former East Germany say that government efforts to raise their
standard of living have been condescending, half-hearted, and often
counterproductive. Worse, the free market has priced many of them
out of their jobs and homes.
</P>
<P>
   Cynicism is growing. A recent survey by the Allensbach Institute
found that 37 percent of easterners believe the former East Germany
remains a place apart from the 11 states that constitute the former
West Germany _ compared with 30 percent a year ago. Another poll
found that while only 17 percent of easterners favor a return of
the old communist regime, more than 60 percent do not consider
themselves citizens of a united Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Neo-Nazi groups have exploited the growing alienation among
eastern youths. Their recruitment message stresses that ``nobody
cares about you,'' and it resonates because of the economic
disparity between the two Germanys. The unemployment rate in the
East is nearly double the national average of almost 11 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Helmut Kohl considered reunification his most important task. He
staked his political career on it. And he lost. Last week, East
Germans deserted Kohl in droves, paving the way for the victory of
Gerhard Schroeder and the return to power of the Social Democrats
after 16 years in opposition.
</P>
<P>
   Kohl's promises of ``blooming landscapes'' made his Christian
Democrats the biggest vote-getters in the East in the first two
post-reunification elections. But last week, the party's eastern
vote plummeted from 38 to 27 percent. The East, in effect, threw
Kohl out.
</P>
<P>
   In his victory speech, Schroeder promised to raise the standard
of living for easterners. He said that unity was an essential part
of his plan to create a stronger, more economically competitive and
prosperous Germany. But the evasive Schroeder has not specified how
he plans to narrow the gap between West and East.
</P>
<P>
   Ordinary people here complain that the government has been
preoccupied with improving the infrastructure _ roads and rail
lines _ without paying enough attention to human beings. They
complain that too few federal government officials are easterners
and say that the absence of government regulation has allowed
western speculators to gobble up office buildings and apartment
blocks.
</P>
<P>
   The 65 million people in the West who are paying for unification
are cynical about the $100 billion-a-year bailout of the East. They
consider easterners too dependent on the government and hopeless at
adapting to the realities of the global market.
</P>
<P>
   Klaus Voigt, however, belies the perception that easterners lack
entrepreneurial spirit. He is the third generation of his family to
run a paint store. Voigt's grandfather founded the business by
selling paints from a horse-drawn wagon. His family's store has
been a fixture in the Neustadt section of Dresden since 1919,
surviving two world wars and a repressive communist regime hostile
toward consumerism.
</P>
<P>
   Some are surprised, then, to hear Voigt concede, ``It's much
harder to run a business since reunification.''
</P>
<P>
   A powerful man with a brutal handshake, Voigt, 47, says that in
its rush to lure businesses and jobs to the East, the German
government has subsidized huge chain stores and built roads for
shopping malls. This, strategy, he argues, is unfair to small
business owners like him who receive no subsidies, and
counterproductive for the local economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever money I make goes back into the local economy,''
Voigt says. ``These big chains are headquartered in the West and
even outside Germany. Their profits go to the West, or abroad.''
</P>
<P>
   Voigt notes that in the West, the government stopped helping the
large corporations years ago. Why such help continues in the East
is a mystery. None of the civil servants installed in the East can
explain the situation. ``Most of them are `wessies,''' he says,
using the colloquial for westerners.
</P>
<P>
   In the Prenzlauer Berg section of East Berlin, Ingrid Mann sat
down the other day to a meal of chicken and french fries at one of
the ubiquitous Turkish imbisses, or cafes. Mann, 59, who retired
after 38 years as a secretary in an East German courthouse, says
she splurged on her $4 meal. Her monthly pension, she explains, is
about $2,000, half of which goes for rent. After other fixed
expenses, like a telephone and electricity, she has about $500 a
month to spend on food and other ``luxuries.''
</P>
<P>
   What really irritates Mann is that someone who did the same job
for as many years but who, by a quirk of fate, was living a mile
away from her when the Berlin Wall went up receives nearly three
times her pension. ``It's not fair,'' she says. ``They treat us
like second-class citizens.''
</P>
<P>
   Even now, easterners work longer hours with fewer benefits and
take home wages about 70 percent of those in the west, where many
employees work 35-hour weeks and get six weeks of vacation each
year.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the cost of living is cheaper in much of the
east. A piece of cake that would cost one dollar in Berlin costs
about 70 cents at the Metasch Konditorei, a Dresden bakery. And
there are eastern businesses that could not have existed before
reunification. The Schulz Activ Reisen travel agency would have
been unthinkable under a regime that sent its people to dreary
communist theme parks.
</P>
<P>
   But business is booming. Travel agent Stefan Birkefeld says that
most of his customers take vacation in Africa, South America, the
Far East, and India. ``Not many to North America,'' he adds, almost
apologetically.
</P>
<P>
   Arnold Vaatz, a Kohl loyalist and local politician in Dresden,
maintains that the increase in the number of easterners taking
vacations is proof that life has gotten better. Over the last eight
years, Vaatz says, there have been 53,000 kilometers of railroad
lines and 115,000 kilometers of new roads built in the east. Life
expectancy has increased two years, due in part to a dramatic drop
in pollution and the ready availability of quality medical care
that was scarce under the communist regime.
</P>
<P>
   So, Vaatz argues, the common perception here that life has
gotten worse does not conform with reality.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Kohl seemed to sense his impending doom two weeks
before his crushing defeat. ``I would never have believed that 40
years of separation could have such a deep impact on people of the
same language, the same history, and the same cultural past,'' he
said. ``We have grown much further apart than I would have
believed.''
</P>
<P>
   Kohl learned too late that while the Berlin Wall could be
brought down, the walls in people's hearts and minds are often
stronger than sledgehammers.

TRUCK ART BLAZES DOWN THE HIGHWAY

 (EMBARGOED FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, OCT. 4)  
 (ART ADV: PHOTOS WILL MOVE SATURDAY, OCT. 3 TO NYTNS CLIENTS)  
 By BOB FENSTER  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - I was driving west on I-10 out past Buckeye, Ariz.,
when I realized I wasn't just speeding through miles of emptiness.
</P>
<P>
   I was speeding through miles of art.
</P>
<P>
   I don't mean the desert scenery.
</P>
<P>
   It was the trucks.
</P>
<P>
   Semitrailers are giant canvases for some of the most exciting
artists ever to hit the art world at 80 mph.
</P>
<P>
   These artists have turned our highways into a mobile art museum,
creating works for mass transit if not the masses.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the metaphoric ``Flight of the Chips'' painted on the
side of the Lay's potato-chip delivery van.
</P>
<P>
   Its trompe l'oeil bag of potato chips flies open tantalizingly,
just enough for the wind to blow out three lighter-than-air chips.
The painting's symbolism expresses the ephemeral quest for the
ultimate chips to satisfy man's eternal craving for snacks.
</P>
<P>
   Truck art is ego art. An 18-wheeler is not a canvas for the
timid, the introverted, self-reflective artist.
</P>
<P>
   Artists who think big and fast fill these giant canvases with
bold strokes. Brawny art.
</P>
<P>
   No swirls, no curlicues, no subtleties. None of the anemic art
of the minimalist painters from the Civic, the Metro, the Nash
Rambler schools.
</P>
<P>
   Semitrailer canvases are ablaze with lines that zip, swoop,
streak, jab.
</P>
<P>
   Truck art points the way: ahead into the future. This is not the
art of people who don't know where they're going. This is the art
of movers and shakers who don't take detours.
</P>
<P>
   Burlington trucks, with their wind-swept stars blowing off the
side of the canvas, offer an answer to the question: What is art?
The answer, says Burlington's long-distance, freight-hauling
artists: The median is the medium, but speed is the message.
</P>
<P>
   Truck art embraces the abstract: large swipes and swatches of
color that explore realms of the line in descending and ascending
degrees of thickness, the lines conveying a sense of motion, as if
the artist is trying to say that modern art is not about flat,
static canvases. These paintings can really haul.
</P>
<P>
   North American Van Lines, with its abstract arrow bursting
through black and white circles, is art that moves you even as they
move you.
</P>
<P>
   Arrows on the sides of semis are the favorite symbol of truck
artists. The arrows demonstrate that art can point the direction
for a society that needs desperately to figure out where it's
going.
</P>
<P>
   Art can lead the way for people who feel lost no matter which
way they turn.
</P>
<P>
   The Snap-On Tools truck, with its floating, detached tools,
makes the snappy but wrenching counter-statement that art can show
you reality but never really fix anything.
</P>
<P>
   You'll even find existential art, like the truck with crossed
arrows pointing in four directions, embodying the philosophical
imperative that no matter where you go, there you are.
</P>
<P>
   More traditional schools of art are also represented on our
highways. You may enjoy combative art commemorated by such
companies as Knight, with its drawing of a charging knight whose
lance tilts at other drivers, as if to say: If you can't create,
then get out of the way.
</P>
<P>
   Truck art demonstrates its utilitarian origins in folk art:
flatbeds stacked with bales of hay cleverly arranged to re-create
the entire farmer/cubist/hay zeitgeist.
</P>
<P>
   Sculptural art is advanced with Christo-like wrappings on
flatbeds, their colorful vinyl tarps pointing out that half of all
commerce and art is packaging.
</P>
<P>
   The bright wraps on these flatbeds evoke the mystery of
merchandise: What is underneath those coverings? Tightly cinched
with rope and chains, flatbed art establishes the erotic
connections between S&AMP;M (sales and marketing) and M&AMP;T
(manufacturing and transportation).
</P>
<P>
   Some truck artists brighten the landscape with pop art collages,
symbolic re-creations of stamps, stickers and licenses from state
agencies.
</P>
<P>
   These works of art remind us that while government may decide to
stop supporting art, art will never stop supporting government.
</P>
<P>
   The double and triple trailers, each with repeated graphics, are
like mobile mobiles, waving in the air currents created by 75-mph
illusions of motion.
</P>
<P>
   Many truck artists sign their names only in initials (RSP), as
if to say about words: These symbols are too slow.
</P>
<P>
   Some truck artists confront us with blank semi-canvases,
reminding us that art is nothing, commerce is nothing, and the
contents of the truck will eventually come to nothing once they
stop to unload.
</P>
<P>
   Pulling into a rest stop, I saw a work of truck performance art:
a semi broken down with its hoods up, representing how any act of
creation contains within it an act of destruction.
</P>
<P>
   I even found a roadside masterpiece. The Phoenix restaurant La
Madeleine has Renoir's ``Luncheon on the Boating Party''
``''painted on the side of its delivery truck. That goes beyond
truck art. That's an art truck.
</P>
<P>
   My trip to the museum of mobile art reminded me of that old song
about the semi carrying a truck-load of paintings from one museum
to another. When the truck jackknifes on the interstate, the call
goes out, `There's art all over the highway!'' &QL;

BLACK PROTEST DELAYS PREMIERE OF NEW SITCOM 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)   (bl)

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   A protest headed by a Los Angeles-area African-American group
that accused a new sitcom of making light of slavery has led the
UPN television network to delay the scheduled first episode of the
show. It will substitute the second episode for the series'
premiere Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   The protesters say that ``The Secret Diary of Desmond
Pfeiffer,'' a broad farce lampooning Abraham Lincoln and his wife,
should be taken off the air. They have scheduled a rally outside
UPN's offices in Los Angeles for Monday.
</P>
<P>
   UPN president Dean Valentine said the sitcom was not about
slavery except for being set during Lincoln's presidency. He added
that the black character, a transplanted English nobleman of
Moorish descent named Desmond Pfeiffer, who becomes Lincoln's
butler, is the only intelligent person in the ensemble.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles City Council joined the protest Tuesday when it
unanimously passed a motion ordering the city's Human Relations
Commission to review the episode and report back within 10 days.
</P>
<P>
   Valentine said UPN had decided to review the pilot episode but
did not expect to find anything objectionable because the show had
not offended black focus groups last spring.
</P>
<P>
   Danny Bakewell, who has led the protest as chairman of the
National Black United Fund and president of its Los Angeles
chapter, called the Brotherhood Crusade, said he had seen only the
pilot episode but argued that the sitcom's core subject matter
trivializes slavery.
</P>
<P>
   ``Slavery is not funny,'' Bakewell said. ``The show trivializes
our suffering, exploits our pain and distorts history. Slavery is
no joke to us.''
</P>
<P>
   Last season Valentine's network ranked last among the six
broadcast networks in total audience, but it has had a strong
following among African-American viewers. In view of that, he was
``particularly outraged,'' he said, ``to have these people claim
these falsehoods'' about the ``Desmond Pfeiffer'' show.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a misbegotten and false charge that there's any racial
sensitivity to the show,'' he said. ``The show has nothing to do
with slavery. It has about as much to do with slavery as `F-Troop'
had to do with the Grant administration. The historical events
happen at the same time.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked why, if he feels this way, he had bowed to protesters'
demands to remove the pilot episode, Valentine said, ``To extend an
olive branch, not to the protesters but to the entire
African-American viewership of UPN to let them know we're sensitive
to their concerns.'' Also, he said, he thought the second episode
was funnier and would give the show a more successful debut.

PRESSURE MOUNTS FOR ACTION AGAINST SERBIA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ As pressure mounted on Western powers to retaliate
against Serbian military targets for the recent massacres of
civilians in Kosovo, Russian officials meeting here Friday were
becoming increasingly isolated in their opposition to possible NATO
air strikes.
</P>
<P>
   During a daylong meeting of the Contact Group on Yugoslavia,
Russian officials repeated the reservations their government and
China voiced Thursday when the United Nations Security Council
condemned the massacres.
</P>
<P>
   The Contact Group consists of Britain, France, Germany, Italy,
Russia, and the United States. It was set up in 1994 as part of an
approach to end the war in the former Yugoslavia. Only Russia is
opposed to the use of force to punish Serbian President Slobodan
Milosevic and deter him from launching more attacks on ethnic
Albanians, who make up 90 percent of the 2 million people in
Kosovo, a Serbian-held province.
</P>
<P>
   But British officials, who chaired Friday's session, played down
any suggestions of a rift.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Contact Group is united and intends to remain united,''
British officials said in a statement for the group. ``We are
united in condemning what is happening on the ground and in support
for humanitarian efforts. We all concluded that time is running
out.''
</P>
<P>
   There was, meanwhile, growing evidence that because of its
economic crisis and need for international aid, Russia is losing
its ability to hold back the rest of the international community.
French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine suggested Friday that air
strikes were possible even if Russia vetoed the idea in the UN
Security Council.
</P>
<P>
   Britain Friday pledged four more warplanes, doubling its
commitment. That follows earlier pledges of warplanes from Germany,
Norway, the Netherlands, and Spain. England also canceled a Nov. 18
soccer game here against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Britain and the United States are leading the calls for an
attack on Milosevic's forces, believing that he will listen only to
force. But Russian officials, who have traditionally been
sympathetic to Milosevic, said it was still unclear who butchered
more than 30 civilians in the past week. At the very least, the
Western powers want Milosevic to identify and hand over the
killers.
</P>
<P>
   Ostensibly, the Serbian security forces have been trying to
flush out members of the Kosovo Liberation Army, or KLA, who are
fighting for independence. But most of the estimated 800 people who
have died in fighting the last eight months are civilians, and
there is increasing evidence that Serbian authorities are punishing
civilians for KLA actions. The Western powers worry that many of
the estimated 275,000 refugees created by the Serb offensive will
starve or freeze to death if the Serbs don't back off and allow
humanitarian groups free access in the region.
</P>
<P>
   Western diplomats and human rights organizations say the latest
round of atrocities appeared to be sparked by the killing of seven
Serbian police officers last week. In reprisal, or perhaps because
they knew they were going to be withdrawn in an attempt to avert
air strikes, the security forces went on a killing spree, diplomats
said.
</P>
<P>
   Photographs of dead women and children filled newspapers
throughout Europe this week, causing widespread revulsion and
increasing pressure on Europe's leading nations and the United
States to act.
</P>
<P>
   But Russian officials seem more sympathetic to Milosevic's claim
that this is a domestic security operation aimed at rooting out
terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in Montenegro, the smaller of the two republics that
with Serbia makes up Yugoslavia, Friday distanced themselves from
Milosevic, all but giving their blessing to air strikes.

U.S. MOVES TOWARD NEW CURBS ON INDIA AND PAKISTAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ While Congress debates a temporary waiver of
sanctions imposed on India and Pakistan because of their nuclear
tests in May, the Clinton administration is getting ready to
release a long list of companies and government institutions in
those countries that Americans will be barred from doing business
with if the sanctions stay in place.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say that the list, required under an amendment punishing
nations that test to develop nuclear weapons, is due out soon and
could not come at a worse time for Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif of
Pakistan and Atal Behari Vajpayee of India.
</P>
<P>
   Both men pledged last week in speeches to the United Nations
that they would sign the nuclear test ban treaty within the coming
year although both do not have solid support for the move at home.
</P>
<P>
   In India and Pakistan, where the nuclear tests met with
jubilation, there have been second thoughts about the consequences
of those tests, which altered the strategic map of Asia and
increased the number of countries with nuclear weapons for the
first time in 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. sanctions that followed _ covering loans, credits,
credit guarantees, military and munitions exports _ were felt worse
initially by Pakistan, which was already under congressional
restrictions, but India did not escape the effect, which will
worsen if links to U.S. trade and investment are disrupted. Even
with a waiver, bars will remain on deals with Indian and Pakistani
nuclear institutions. The United States earlier waived some
restrictions on agricultural sales.
</P>
<P>
   The hope of the two prime ministers had apparently been to
convince people that signing the 1996 test ban treaty would bring
benefits _ at the very least the lifting of sanctions. The
publication of a list of prohibited business partners, however
coincidental, could negate that argument.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials say that they have no option, since the
drawing up of the list was required by Congress under the 1994
Glenn Amendment, named for its author, Sen. John Glenn, D-Ohio.
Officials call it an ``entities list'' because it is a mixed bag of
targets, including government institutions, military units,
government-owned companies and private firms doing business with
the nuclear establishment in either country.
</P>
<P>
   About a dozen Indian and Pakistani companies and fewer than 20
government departments in India and 15 in Pakistan are involved,
officials said, but dozens more subdivisions are also listed,
bringing the list to 100 or more names. The most severe
restrictions cover government organizations involved in nuclear or
missile activities.
</P>
<P>
   Karl Inderfurth, assistant secretary of state for South Asia,
said the impending release of the list did not in any way reflect
disappointment with the statements made by the two leaders,
although administration officials said at the time the pledges were
made that Washington also wanted to see progress in other
disarmament areas.

SCHROEDER OPENS TALKS WITH GREENS ON FORMING COALITION GOVERNMENT  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By EDMUND L. ANDREWS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany _ Having decisively defeated Chancellor
Helmut Kohl in Germany's national election last Sunday, Gerhard
Schroeder and his Social Democratic Party began defining their new
government Friday by opening coalition talks with the
environmentalist Green Party.
</P>
<P>
   Though both parties say they want to form a governing coalition
in parliament, the negotiations could prove prickly because the two
sides disagree on many issues, including tax reform and nuclear
energy.
</P>
<P>
   The Greens, who remain split between pragmatists and staunch
environmentalists, have never been part of a governing coalition.
</P>
<P>
   Though popular among many young professional voters, the party
infuriated mainstream political leaders during the campaign by
calling for a huge new gasoline tax. Some of its members in
parliament also created a furor by opposing Germany's taking part
in NATO peacekeeping efforts in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   In the coalition talks, which both sides hope to finish by Oct.
17, the two parties must commit themselves to a common set of
legislative goals as well as the allocation of Cabinet seats.
</P>
<P>
   The Greens have demanded four Cabinet seats, though Schroeder is
believed to want to give them only two. Political leaders generally
assume that Joschka Fischer, the Greens' popular and pragmatic
leader in parliament, will become foreign minister. Juergen
Trittin, the Greens' more ideological and leftist party chairman,
is expected to be named environmental minister.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Greens have deep roots in the anti-military
movement of the 1970s and early 1980s, neither Fischer nor
Schroeder is expected to change Germany's foreign policy. Fischer
is a strong supporter of Germany's role in NATO's peacekeeping
forces.
</P>
<P>
   The more serious clashes are over taxes and nuclear energy. The
Green Party is pushing a stiff new ``ecology'' tax on oil and
gasoline to reduce the use of cars and trucks and to pay for a
reduction in individual taxes and social security payments.
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder has said he will support only a modest increase in the
fuel tax of several cents per liter.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be no crazy demands or unacceptable burdens on
motorists who rely on their cars to get to work,'' said Franz
Muentefering, the Social Democratic Party's campaign manager.
``Certainly the cost of labor has to be decreased and the cost of
energy increased. But there will be no extremes.''
</P>
<P>
   The Social Democrats want to protect Germany's generous social
programs and push through a moderate tax reform that would that
would close many loopholes and lighten the burden on middle- and
lower-income workers.
</P>
<P>
   Another dispute is over abandoning nuclear energy, which still
contributes a big share of Germany's electricity. The Greens have
called for shutting down all nuclear plants within 10 years, and
the issue is central to many party members. But Schroeder wants no
firm deadline and has hinted that the process might need to last 20
years or more.
</P>
<P>
   As they emerged from long meetings Friday in Bonn, party leaders
portrayed the talks as harmonious and businesslike. If all goes
according to plan, the two sides said they would sign a formal
agreement on Oct. 22. Schroeder hopes to take office by Oct. 27.

JORDAN COMES ACROSS AS SMART LAWYER INTENT ON SELF-PRESERVATION 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By GREG McDONALD 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Power broker, adviser, confidant and friend are all
roles Vernon Jordan has assumed in his relationship with President
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   But in his testimony before the federal grand jury investigating
the Monica Lewinsky matter, Jordan also comes across as a smart
lawyer intent on self-preservation. His testimony indicates that he
knew how and where to draw the line in seeking information about
Clinton's request that he help Lewinsky find a job, because to
inquire further might reveal more than he wanted to know.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan insisted during his appearances before the grand jury
that he was not aware of any sexual relationship between President
Clinton and Lewinsky while he looked for a private sector job for
the former White House intern.
</P>
<P>
   Both the president and Lewinsky assured him in early December,
1997, that there was no such relationship. But even when his
suspicions _ and finally news reports _ indicated otherwise, Jordan
told investigators that he did not ask the president about it again
because the two had already ``visited that issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, according to Jordan's testimony, called him several
times immediately after the stories first broke charging that the
president had an affair with Lewinsky. Jordan said he asked Clinton
whether he had discussed the stories with the first lady. The
answer was no.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan made five appearances before the grand jury, but he gave
up nothing in his testimony that would help independent counsel
Kenneth Starr prove his allegation that there was a White House
cover-up that centered on finding Lewinsky a job in return for her
silence.
</P>
<P>
   To the contrary, Jordan stuck to his claim that the president
never broached the subject with him and that Clinton's personal
secretary Betty Currie was the one who ``asked me to help Monica
Lewinsky get a job and I agreed to do that.``
</P>
<P>
   In her own testimony, Currie said she was never asked by the
president to seek out Jordan's help, but turned to him because of
his connections to help Lewinsky, who she described as a young
friend.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky also told the grand jury that no one was enlisted to
help buy her silence.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan's testimony was included in the release of more than
4,600 pages of documents compiled during Starr's investigation of
the Lewinsky matter. The documents also included some computer
e-mail sent by Lewinsky to friends that offered a different version
of the job search.
</P>
<P>
   Although Jordan testified that he didn't recall meeting Lewinsky
until early December, one Lewinsky e-mail message refers to an
early November meeting at the White House in which she talked about
being introduced to Jordan by Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Woo, what a day. I met with the big creep's (Clinton's) best
friend today,'' she wrote. She added that Jordan indicated then
that he had been recruited by the president to help her find a job.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan's efforts finally paid off for Lewinsky. His influence
got her a job with Revlon, the cosmetics company, in New York at a
salary of $40,000 a year. But Revlon withdrew the offer after the
stories broke in January about her involvement with the president.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan recalled in the testimony that Lewinsky was pleased with
the job offer, but upset at what she considered was a low salary.
</P>
<P>
   ``She thought her value was 60 and I thought she was lucky to
get 40,'' Jordan told the grand jurors.
</P>
<P>
   He also described his great relief when he received word that
Revlon, on whose board he serves, had offered Lewinsky a position.
He acknowledged that trying to find her work and introducing her to
a lawyer to help her prepare an affidavit in the Paula Jones sexual
harassment case had been somewhat of a ``nuisance.''
</P>
<P>
   During his appearances before the grand jury, prosecutors tried
repeatedly to get Jordan to admit that he knew more than he was
letting on because of his frequent phone calls and contacts with
the president and other White House officials. But Jordan never
faltered in his insistence that he was not aware of any plan to buy
Lewinsky's silence, despite his status as one of Clinton's most
influential friends and advisers.
</P>
<P>
   When questioned specifically about how he first learned about
the allegations concerning the president and Lewinsky, Jordan said
that Clinton aide Bruce Lindsey had given a copy of an Internet
story about audio tapes that would prove it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you agree with me, sir, that presidential advisers don't
just share items of the day affecting the president with just
anyone?'' he was asked by a prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I am not just anyone,'' Jordan snapped back. &QL;

SCANDAL REFLECTS CONTRADICTORY OPINIONS ABOUT SEX 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARY LEONARD  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ People say they're embarrassed by all the sordid,
sexy detail and sick of hearing about it. Yet the Starr report
became an overnight bestseller, and Linda R. Tripp's homemade tapes
of talks with the lovesick Monica S. Lewinsky are making a splash
and will soon saturate the airwaves.
</P>
<P>
   Americans have never experienced such a public, high-profile,
and protracted clash of Puritan virtue and promiscuous behavior. It
makes them curious, uncomfortable, guilty, embarrassed, eager for
it to end, and dying for more, all at the same time, scientists who
study sexual behavior say.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ours is one of the most sexually confused societies in the
world,'' said Debra Haffner, president of the Sexual Information
and Education Council of the United States, a private group in New
York. ``On the one hand, the popular culture says everybody does it
_ hotter, heavier, and enjoying it more than you. On the other
hand, our official line is: `Just say no.'''
</P>
<P>
   While the permissiveness of the sexual revolution of the 1960s
prevails in practice and dominates the entertainment world, Haffner
said fear, shame, guilt, and histories of bad experiences still
color American attitudes toward sex. ``We're not at all in the
European mode,'' she said, adding that people across the Atlantic
find all the fuss over President Clinton's extramarital affair with
Lewinsky ``bizarre.''
</P>
<P>
   The culture's sexual hangups are, to William Bennett, the former
education secretary and author of the best-selling ``Book of
Virtues,'' exactly what make Americans morally superior to their
cousins on the continent.
</P>
<P>
   ``In America, morality is central to our politics and attitudes
in a way that is not the case in Europe, and precisely this moral
streak is what is best about us,'' Bennett wrote in his new book,
``The Death of Outrage.'' ``Europeans may have some things to teach
us, say, wine or haute couture. But on the matter of morality in
politics, America has much to teach Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   Bennett blames the president's friends for making people think
only ``bigots and intolerant fanatics'' fault Clinton's behavior,
while the sophisticated, worldly, European response is to portray
it as a private matter. ``That temptation should be resisted by the
rest of us,'' Bennett wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Americans say they are trying to resist an irresistible story.
According to a recent New York Times/CBS News poll, 78 percent of
the respondents said the House Judiciary Committee should not have
released the videotape of the president testifying before
independent counsel Kenneth W. Starr's grand jury, and 66 percent
of those who were tempted to watch at least some of it said it was
right for Clinton not to answer the questions about his sexual
relationship with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   What has surpised the pollsters most, however, is the huge gap
between the public's high approval of the president's performance
and the low estimation of his character. In the same poll, 21
percent of those surveyed said having the president be a moral role
model was important; 65 percent said it was more important to have
an effective president.
</P>
<P>
   Everyday Americans will give you an earful about the scandal. A
group of women gathered in a neighborhood bookstore to hear author
Erica Jong read from her newest work ``What Do Women Want?'' say
they are outraged by the president's and Lewinsky's conduct. Yet
they also say they are reluctant to judge it too harshly, are tired
of the media's focus on it, and are disturbed by the invasion of
privacy. They are happy with the job Clinton is doing as president
but certain they would throw the cad out if he were their husband.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that so many of us are willing to accept this and
move on says, I think, that our morality has changed more than we
are willing to admit,'' said Susan Small, a housewife in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   If the country is sexually conservative _ at least in attitude,
surveys show 90 percent of Americans say adultery is wrong _ where
does the tolerance for the president's sexual misconduct come from?
Los Angeles psychologist Robert Butterworth said Americans are
taught not to be judgmental, and these days, they are bombarded
with ``so much dirty laundry on shows like Jerry Springer that they
think everybody has a disorder. Clinton's behavior doesn't look so
bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Another view is while the salacious details can titillate, they
also can cut a little too close to home.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the detail wakes up a little piece of guilt in all of us.
People look at the president and say, `There, but for the press, go
I,''' said Dr. Sharyn Lenhart, an associate professor of psychiatry
at both the University of Massachusetts and Harvard medical
schools. ``Everybody in their personal lives has done things that
weren't the best things to do. And many have been sexually
indiscreet.''
</P>
<P>
   But sexual behavior can't be accurately gauged by surveys.
Pollsters say the two things Americans consistently lie about are
their incomes and their sex lives. The most comprehensive work has
been done by the National Opinion Research Center at the University
of Chicago, which in confidential surveys over a series of years
has determined that between 20 and 25 percent of all married people
have at one time or another cheated on their spouse. Many believe
that figure is low.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Smith, director of the center's General Social Survey, says
that while infidelity is common, the level of disapproval for it
remains very high. ``People basically say it's wrong, but it is a
private matter best handled by the spouses involved _ by working it
out through divorce, throwing dishes, or a soulful talk. That works
very much in the president's favor.''
</P>
<P>
   The president's behavior is not, however, going to permit more
people to be unfaithful, says Butterworth, and it may even
encourage a few more to confess. Haffner agrees: ``I'm watching a
couple of marriages rip themselves over that, and it isn't
pretty.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead of finding something positive in the sudden frank talk
about sex in the news and in offices, marriages, and families,
Haffner and other professionals in the field fear a conservative
backlash that could diminish sex education in the schools, the
fight for sexual rights, and the pursuit of sexual-harassment
cases, as well as criminalize sex.
</P>
<P>
   Last week feminist Betty Friedan warned that today's atmosphere
is creating a ``sexual McCarthyism'' in which public figures may
become the targets of witchhunts not for their Communist leanings,
as in the 1950s, but for their secret sexual peccadillos. Several
members of Congress already have admitted to or had their
adulterous relationships exposed. Some wonder if presidential
candidates in 2000 will have to pass a fidelity litmus test.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure that's such a bad thing,'' says Robert Knight,
director of cultural studies at the Family Research Council, a
conservative group. ``McCarthy did find Communists, despite his
mistakes, and this attempt would unearth some secrets that many
people who we entrust with upholding the law would rather keep
hidden.''
</P>
<P>
   Knight says the public must put sexual conduct back in the
character debate. ``The people who have raised environmentalism to
a new religion, demonized tobacco, and presented us with a whole
new series of moral threats have also persuaded Americans that sex
is the only area that lies outside of character and morality,''
Knight said. ``In fact, sexual misconduct may pose the greatest
potential for destroying civilization.''
</P>
<P>
   Author Jong, an advocate of sexual liberation, says public
morality plays, like the Clinton-Lewinsky scandal and the O.J.
Simpson trial, are key bellwethers of how the American culture is
changing in a positive way.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we learn from this drama is that American morality has
changed. Today, we are capable of separating the president from the
imperfect man in the job,'' Jong said. ``The president's no hero,
but be realistic. We all lead complicated lives.''

<P>
   Small investors who cannot find lawyers to handle their Wall
Street grievances may now find counsel at a small but growing
number of law school clinics.
</P>
<P>
   So far, only four law schools have such clinics, with a fifth
set to open one in January. But if the idea catches on, advocates
say, the odds faced by lawyerless investors in securities
arbitration, which is mandatory in most customer-broker disputes,
could be greatly improved.
</P>
<P>
   Investors in general fared better in their fights with their
brokers in 1997 than they have in any year since at least 1980,
according to statistics released in July by the Securities Industry
Conference on Arbitration, a national advisory panel that monitors
the arbitration process. The panel's survey showed that investors
won almost 57 percent of the arbitration cases decided last year,
up from 52 percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   But the success rate has been substantially less impressive in
recent years for investors whose claims were too small to attract
the help of a lawyer, according to a study early last year by the
Securities Arbitration Commentator, a journal that tracks
arbitration awards.
</P>
<P>
   Among investors with claims of less than $10,000, those who
appeared pro se _ that is, representing themselves _ won less than
45 percent of their cases in 1996. And when they did win, they
recovered a smaller percentage of their losses, the survey showed.
The percentage recovered was even more meager in pro se cases
involving claims of $10,000 to $25,000.
</P>
<P>
   The first clinic opened in November 1997 at Pace University Law
School in White Plains, N.Y. This fall, clinics have opened at
Fordham University in Manhattan, Brooklyn Law School and the
University at Buffalo Law School. Stetson University College of Law
in St. Petersburg, Fla., is set to open its clinic in January.
</P>
<P>
   Professor Pamela Rogers Chepiga is getting Fordham's clinic up
and running, with the support of Constantine N. Katsoris, a Fordham
law professor who served for 20 years on the Securities Industry
Conference on Arbitration. Professor Chepiga said interest among
students was so strong that she had to turn many away after filling
the six openings. Now she is looking for cases to keep the students
busy.
</P>
<P>
   The most promising source of cases for the clinics are referrals
from local lawyers or bar associations. Allen J. Charne, executive
director of legal referral services for the New York City bar
association, applauded the arbitration clinic initiative. ``Our
members have been suggesting something like this for years,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   One query at Fordham came from ``a working woman of limited
means'' whose $14,000 nest egg had shrunk to $4,000 _ and for this,
she paid $13,000 in commissions, Professor Chepiga said.
</P>
<P>
   ``To her, that loss can be a very significant part of her
savings,'' the professor said.
</P>
<P>
   Romaine Gardner, the professor overseeing the Brooklyn clinic,
said that students benefit from the experience and that investors
need the help. ``But the clinics are really beneficial to
everybody, including the brokerage firms,'' he added. ``It is often
difficult to defend a case when it is being handled pro se, as
opposed to one that is well presented.''
</P>
<P>
   Investors are generally screened for hardship at the clinics so
millionaires who can't find a lawyer willing to take their case
need not apply.
</P>
<P>
   The Legal Referral Service of the Association of the Bar of the
City of New York can provide referral information for any New York
area clinic at (212) 626-7373. The clinics' direct phone numbers
are: Fordham, (212) 636-7231; Pace, (914) 422-4333 (ask for the
securities arbitration clinic), and the University at Buffalo,
(716) 645-2167.

NARROWING THE BANKRUPTCY ESCAPE HATCH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Oct. 4)  
 (bl)  
 By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Congress is about to make it a whole lot harder for many
Americans to walk away from their debts. And, depending on whom you
talk to, that will either throw untold numbers of people into
lifelong economic bondage in the next recession or teach them a
much-needed lesson in financial responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   Under current law, people who get in over their heads can get a
fresh start by filing for Chapter 7 bankruptcy, wiping out all
their debts except taxes, mortgages, student loans, child support,
alimony and, in some cases, loans on a car needed to get to work.
Such filings are made by hundreds of thousands of people each year.
</P>
<P>
   But under legislation expected to be passed soon by Congress _
it is unclear if President Clinton will sign it _ debtors would
have to pay back up to 30 percent of their credit card bills. Such
a requirement would save the credit card industry an estimated $4
billion or more a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who can afford to pay should not be able to not pay,''
said Tom Layman, chief economist for Visa, the big credit card
organization. He calls the current law ``welfare on demand'' for
borrowers.
</P>
<P>
   Many financial specialists agree that it has become too easy for
debtors to just say no to their creditors. Dawn Sims-Munoz, a
counselor for the Consumer Credit Counseling Service in Phoenix who
herself filed for bankruptcy 12 years ago to wipe out nearly $4,000
in medical bills and other costs, urges her clients to go down the
repayment path. And she is all for the proposed changes.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're going to teach many people responsibility, whether
they want it or not,'' Ms. Sims-Munoz said.
</P>
<P>
   But critics say the proposed overhaul would create a nightmare
for some families when bankruptcies start mounting in the next
recession from their already torrid pace. The House version of the
legislation would require bankruptcy filers who earn more than the
median income _ $17,900 for a single person, $51,000 for a family
of four _ to pay back a portion of their credit card debts by going
into Chapter 13 bankruptcy, under which debtors must try to repay
their creditors. The Senate version leaves some discretion to
bankruptcy judges.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, most Chapter 13 cases fail and convert to Chapter 7,
bankruptcy court statistics show. But that escape hatch would be
closed in both versions of the proposed law. And Elizabeth Warren,
a Harvard Law School professor and personal-bankruptcy specialist,
said both versions of the legislation would have dire consequences
for people who are forced into Chapter 13 and then run into
unexpected expenses like uninsured medical emergencies.
</P>
<P>
   ``When that happens, it is as if there was no bankruptcy filing
and creditors can go back and charge penalty interest rates, say 27
percent, from the first day a payment was late plus a late fee for
every month and legal fees,'' Professor Warren said. ``These
families will have no protections at all. People will be at their
mercy until they die.''
</P>
<P>
   William Binzel, vice president for government affairs for
 &UR; Mastercard International &LR; , the other credit card giant, said that
a fanciful imagination might conjure up such a case, but that it
was unlikely in real life.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Richard Durban, D-Ill., a leading advocate of the overhaul,
said the House version would do just what Professor Warren says,
but he said that under the Senate version judges ``will be able to
deal with these kinds of cases fairly.''
</P>
<P>
   But Professor Warren said the legislation was ``so bad that if
it becomes law, it will last through exactly one recession, and
then the horror stories about what happened to people will force
Congress to correct its mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   Both sides agree on one thing: The next recession will be the
test of whether the proposed new rules are workable. ``The industry
wants additional ammunition to deal with the losses they will
face,'' said David Robertson, president of the Nilson Report, a
credit card industry newsletter in Oxnard, Calif. He said the
changes in bankruptcy law were just one part of the card industry's
broad strategy to prepare for the next recession.
</P>
<P>
   Robertson and Spencer Nilson, the newsletter's publisher, said
the industry was also devising new mathematical models to measure
risk and to more carefully rate customers for it; some lenders are
also selling off parts of their portfolios to reduce their exposure
in the next recession _ developments that should improve the flow
of credit. Both men said current bankruptcy law was far too
lenient.
</P>
<P>
   But Lawrence Ausubel, an economist at the University of
Maryland, said he saw no reason to strengthen the hand of credit
card lenders in bankruptcy proceedings. His research shows that the
industry is already twice as profitable as banking over all, with
returns on equity as high as 56 percent in recent years, though
that is down from 75 percent in the late 1980's.
</P>
<P>
   Visa's Layman said that only about 1 percent of credit card
accounts ended up in bankruptcy proceedings, showing that ``the
industry is doing a very fine job'' of measuring credit-worthiness.
But he and Binzel of Mastercard said no refinement in lending could
address the shortcoming in current law that allows individuals who
can afford to repay some debts to walk away by filing Chapter 7.
</P>
<P>
   Ausubel said the changes Congress is about to adopt ``will
create a worse social outcome'' than current law, by making it
impossible for some people to start over. The changes, he said,
would also ``encourage even more lending to marginal customers
because the credit card industry's calculation will be that their
probability of collecting will go up.''
</P>
<P>
   ``So they will lend even more to already overextended
customers,'' he said.

BOSTON COLLEGE IN UPROAR OVER RACIST E-MAIL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JORDANA HART   AND THOMAS FARRAGHER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Electronic bits of hate _ evil e-mail selectively sent
to minority student leaders on campus _ have galvanized students at
Boston College, who said the anonymous messages teach the lesson
that diversity and complacency don't mix.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is cowardly and this one act of hate isn't BC,'' George
Atallah, a 20-year-old junior and student government leader, said
Friday. ``But no institution can ever fully say that the struggle
for diversity is over.''
</P>
<P>
   Campus police are investigating the electronic message that
began popping up on computer screens around campus early Thursday
morning.
</P>
<P>
   The e-mails follow an incident that outraged many Asian students
at Tufts University two weeks ago, when a fraternity brother at an
on-campus party referred to an Asian student at the party as a
``Chinese Ho Chi Minh bitch.''
</P>
<P>
   Those were fighting words for the young woman, who demanded and
got an apology. Letters and commentaries about the incident flooded
the ``Tufts Daily,'' the student newspaper, and some 400 students
packed a previously scheduled forum last week to talk about race
and culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``More people would speak up for freedom of speech, but it is
hard to stand up when you know you risk being called a racist,''
said Suzanne Chan, president of a student group called the Asian
Community at Tufts, who attended the forum.
</P>
<P>
   Gail Bambrick, a spokeswoman for Tufts, said Friday that
students concerned about the incident filed a complaint, then met
with the dean of students. ``The individual who made the insulting
remark subsequently apologized to the woman, and the dean of
students' office is now weighing various disciplinary actions that
may be taken,'' Bambrick said. She declined to speculate on the
type of discipline that might result.
</P>
<P>
   At Boston College, meanwhile, word spread of the e-mail likening
minority students to animals and suggesting they quit a college the
writer described as, ``for white men.'' More than 1,000 students
gathered in a campus auditorium Thursday night, deploring the
incident and urging that its energy be channeled to promote
tolerance.
</P>
<P>
   BC students and campus leaders said they were determined that
the author be caught and that the college send a message that hate
speech has no place at The Heights.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to ask ourselves: Is this a community that fosters
diversity? Are we moving in the right direction?'' said Chris Goff,
a 20-year-old junior from Lynn who directs social and cultural
issues for the college's student government. ``I think we are, but
we have to do a lot more if we want to be the community we want to
be.''
</P>
<P>
   Reid Oslin, a BC spokesman, said that 425 students in BC's
freshman class of 2,247 are AHANA students, the college's acronym
for the group that represents Asian, Hispanic, African-American,
and native-American students. That is a 22 percent increase from
1988, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Oslin said that Thursday night's meeting, moderated by the
student body president and attended by college president William P.
Leahy, S.J., was emotional. ``The kids are devastated, as they
should be,'' Oslin said.
</P>
<P>
   Kohtaro Takeuchi, a spokesman for the school's Asian caucus,
said many BC students are tired of fighting barriers they still
feel exist based on race, gender and sexual orientation. He said
five incidents involving hate-filled graffiti &UR;  &LR; preceded this week's
e-mail messages.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president of the university said we're not a perfect
community,'' Takeuchi said. ``But I also believe we're not even a
community, because we can't accept our differences. We're full of
fragmented groups of individuals torn apart by evil, ignorance and
hatred.''
</P>
<P>
   Several students said the author of the hate e-mail is presumed
to have used another student's password to send the messages. The
sender's targets may have been selected out of a four-page special
section of Monday's student newspaper, which carried photos of
minority campus leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they have a number of people they're looking at,''
Oslin said of the campus investigation. He said nearly all students
own computers and all of them have access to electronic mail at
computers scattered around the campus.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of AHANA declined comment about the incident Friday,
saying they intend to discuss it during a press conference next
week.
</P>
<P>
   ``The AHANA freshmen are saying that maybe this is not the place
they thought it was,'' said Tim Garry, a 19-year-old junior from
Beverly and an editor at the campus newspaper, The Heights. ``As a
campus that's looking to diversify more right now. We're not really
sure that we're doing a very good job.''
</P>
<P>
   The episodes at BC and Tufts have prompted renewed discussion
about whether and how the most hateful words can be curtailed by a
university.
</P>
<P>
   The episodes at both schools are obviously obnoxious, said First
Amendment attorney Harvey Silverglate, co-author of a new book,
``The Shadow University: The Betrayal of Liberty on America's
Campuses.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But the question should be, how can we deal with this kind of
hate speech in a manner that does not use the disciplinary
processes of the university to shut them up, but appeal instead to
people's better instincts and sense of civility?'' Silverglate said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that students on private campuses are, contrary to
popular belief, not protected by the First Amendment as students at
publicly funded ones are. But their right to speak should be
protected, he said, by ``all the principles of academic freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   Bambrick, the Tufts spokeswoman, said the university dropped its
speech code in the early 1990s, following the results of court
challenges elsewhere, and replaced it with a bigotry policy now in
the student handbook.
</P>
<P>
   It has been more than a decade since speech codes and an
emphasis on ``political correctness'' came into being on college
campuses, after students and some faculty insisted that certain
offensive expressions be curbed because they lead to a repressive
learning environment.
</P>
<P>
   Almost all campuses currently have some sort of speech code or
policy on verbal harassment or bigoted speech. Court battles have
led to some being shot down; in 1995 Stanford University had to
discard a code that forbade the use of ``gutter epithets and
symbols of bigotry'' and ``discriminatory harassment.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent months around the nation, college students and
professors all along the political and social spectrum have
declared that ``political correctness'' on campus is on its
deathbed.
</P>
<P>
   Some Tufts students interviewed this week said they resent the
lockstep mentality ``PC'' has represented.
</P>
<P>
   The ``PC'' movement ``has made us all scared to say how we
really feel,'' said Tufts senior Sheila Bhandari, 20, who attended
the recent student forum on race and culture.

JAPANESE PARLIAMENT MOVES TO ENACT BANKING REFORM LAW 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By SHERYL WuDUNN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ The lower house of Japan's Parliament on Friday took a
major step toward stabilizing Japan's frail banking system, passing
legislation that is also expected to improve the prospects for
Japanese economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation, which could pass the Upper House and become law
as early as next Friday, has been the focus of worldwide attention
because of the pivotal role Japan could play in influencing the
direction of the global economy. Despite complaints from around the
world, Japanese politicians have been bickering for months over
this legislation as the economy, the world's second largest,
suffers its worst recession since the end of World War II.
</P>
<P>
   The markets were not overwhelmed; even though the bill's
eventual passage appeared certain, stock prices in Tokyo briefly
touched yet another 12-year low Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
   But some officials say that the bills passed Friday night in the
lower house, the key legislative body, will help Japan chart a way
out of its bad debt problems and confront the sensitive issue of
how to deal with the country's largest and weakest financial
institutions.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an epoch-making incident,'' said Naoto Kan, the leader
of the Democratic Party, the main opposition group.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation, however, still faces challenges, and the
economy will need more prodding before it improves. The government
says it expects the economy to contract by 1.8 percent in the year
ending March 31, 1999, and senior U.S. officials have renewed their
calls for Japan to strengthen its financial system and stimulate
growth.
</P>
<P>
   Business sentiment is still gloomy, and worrying economic
statistics keep piling up.
</P>
<P>
   The number of jobless in August rose to 2.97 million people, the
largest number on record, and brought the level of unemployment
back up to its June level of 4.3 percent, according to statistics
released Friday. If unemployment figures were calculated by U.S.
methods, the percentage would be considerably higher.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, the Bank of Japan released its closely watched
quarterly corporate survey, which suggested that capital spending
could continue falling and that companies were encountering
difficulties borrowing from the nation's banks.
</P>
<P>
   Even as the legislation passed the lower house Friday,
politicians were snapping at each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that this law was made based on the opposition
proposal is proof that the direction that the current Cabinet has
been taking has not been the right one,'' Kan said.
</P>
<P>
   The governing Liberal Democrats were relieved by the approval
Friday, but shot back a response to Kan:
</P>
<P>
   ``We shouldn't talk about who won or who lost or who conceded or
who pushed through,'' said Yoshiro Mori, the secretary general of
the Liberal Democratic Party, the majority group.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation, the result of weeks of intense negotiations,
was drawn up rapidly on the basis of proposals from a group of
opposition parties. The centerpiece is a three-way strategy to
manage an orderly disappearance of failed banks. Such banks may be
temporarily nationalized, liquidated under a bankruptcy
administrator, or turned into a publicly owned bridge bank that
would separate out the good loans and good borrowers and sell or
collect on the bad loans.
</P>
<P>
   Another crucial element of the legislation will be the creation
of a new ministry-level financial committee to deal with bank
failures and draft plans to manage financial turmoil. Until this
new committee is formed, the prime minister will be endowed with
these powers.
</P>
<P>
   There were suggestions in the Japanese media earlier Friday that
the Finance Ministry would also play a role in these areas, but
with passage Friday night in the lower house, few details were
released.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most debated issues has been the power of the Finance
Ministry. The opposition has demanded that the ministry be stripped
of some powers, but it has vociferously fought back. The ministry
is expected to lose some of its financial policy-making authority
by the year 2000, but the debate on this point has not yet ended.
</P>
<P>
   A law passed earlier this year to inject taxpayers' money into
weakly capitalized Japanese banks would also be abolished by the
new financial bills, and politicians will begin creating a new plan
to replace it.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's legislation also calls for creating a U.S.-style
agency, similar to the Resolution Trust Corp. that helped clean up
the savings and loan crisis in the United States, to expedite the
disposal of more than $600 billion in bad bank debts.

   Congress is about to make it a whole lot harder for many
Americans to walk away from their debts. And, depending on whom you
talk to, that will either throw untold numbers of people into
lifelong economic bondage in the next recession or teach them a
much-needed lesson in financial responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   Under current law, people who get in over their heads can get a
fresh start by filing for Chapter 7 bankruptcy, wiping out all
their debts except taxes, mortgages, student loans, child support,
alimony and, in some cases, loans on a car needed to get to work.
Such filings are made by hundreds of thousands of people each year.
</P>
<P>
   But under legislation expected to be passed soon by Congress _
it is unclear if President Clinton will sign it _ debtors would
have to pay back up to 30 percent of their credit card bills. Such
a requirement would save the credit card industry an estimated $4
billion or more a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who can afford to pay should not be able to not pay,''
said Tom Layman, chief economist for Visa, the big credit card
organization. He calls the current law ``welfare on demand'' for
borrowers.
</P>
<P>
   Many financial specialists agree that it has become too easy for
debtors to just say no to their creditors. Dawn Sims-Munoz, a
counselor for the Consumer Credit Counseling Service in Phoenix who
herself filed for bankruptcy 12 years ago to wipe out nearly $4,000
in medical bills and other costs, urges her clients to go down the
repayment path. And she is all for the proposed changes.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're going to teach many people responsibility, whether
they want it or not,'' Ms. Sims-Munoz said.
</P>
<P>
   But critics say the proposed overhaul would create a nightmare
for some families when bankruptcies start mounting in the next
recession from their already torrid pace.
</P>
<P>
   The House version of the legislation would require bankruptcy
filers who earn more than the median income _ $17,900 for a single
person, $51,000 for a family of four _ to pay back a portion of
their credit card debts by going into Chapter 13 bankruptcy, under
which debtors must try to repay their creditors. The Senate version
leaves some discretion to bankruptcy judges.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, most Chapter 13 cases fail and convert to Chapter 7,
bankruptcy court statistics show. But that escape hatch would be
closed in both versions of the proposed law.
</P>
<P>
   And Elizabeth Warren, a Harvard Law School professor and
personal-bankruptcy specialist, said both versions of the
legislation would have dire consequences for people who are forced
into Chapter 13 and then run into unexpected expenses like
uninsured medical emergencies.
</P>
<P>
   ``When that happens, it is as if there was no bankruptcy filing
and creditors can go back and charge penalty interest rates, say 27
percent, from the first day a payment was late plus a late fee for
every month and legal fees,'' Professor Warren said. ``These
families will have no protections at all. People will be at their
mercy until they die.''
</P>
<P>
   William P. Binzel, vice president for government affairs for
Mastercard International, the other credit card giant, said that a
fanciful imagination might conjure up such a case, but that it was
unlikely in real life.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Richard J. Durban, D-Ill., and a leading advocate of the
overhaul, said the House version would do just what Professor
Warren says, but he said that under the Senate version judges
``will be able to deal with these kinds of cases fairly.''
</P>
<P>
   But Professor Warren said the legislation was ``so bad that if
it becomes law, it will last through exactly one recession, and
then the horror stories about what happened to people will force
Congress to correct its mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   Both sides agree on one thing: The next recession will be the
test of whether the proposed new rules are workable. ``The industry
wants additional ammunition to deal with the losses they will
face,'' said David Robertson, president of the Nilson Report, a
credit card industry newsletter in Oxnard, Calif. He said the
changes in bankruptcy law were just one part of the card industry's
broad strategy to prepare for the next recession.
</P>
<P>
   Robertson and Spencer Nilson, the newsletter's publisher, said
the industry was also devising new mathematical models to measure
risk and to more carefully rate customers for it; some lenders are
also selling off parts of their portfolios to reduce their exposure
in the next recession _ developments that should improve the flow
of credit. Both men said current bankruptcy law was far too
lenient.
</P>
<P>
   But Lawrence M. Ausubel, an economist at the University of
Maryland, said he saw no reason to strengthen the hand of credit
card lenders in bankruptcy proceedings. His research shows that the
industry is already twice as profitable as banking over all, with
returns on equity as high as 56 percent in recent years, though
that is down from 75 percent in the late 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Visa's Layman said that only about 1 percent of credit card
accounts ended up in bankruptcy proceedings, showing that ``the
industry is doing a very fine job'' of measuring credit-worthiness.
But he and Binzel of Mastercard said no refinement in lending could
address the shortcoming in current law that allows individuals who
can afford to repay some debts to walk away by filing Chapter 7.
</P>
<P>
   Ausubel said the changes Congress is about to adopt ``will
create a worse social outcome'' than current law, by making it
impossible for some people to start over. The changes, he said,
would also ``encourage even more lending to marginal customers
because the credit card industry's calculation will be that their
probability of collecting will go up.''
</P>
<P>
   ``So they will lend even more to already overextended
customers,'' he said.

 DAVID SMITH: IS TV's FUTURE IN HIS HANDS?  
 (For release Sunday, Oct. 4)

 By BILL CARTER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   Where do you go to find a visionary in the television business?
One place to look, according to Wall Street analysts, is a spare
cubicle in a bunker-like building in a neighborhood of aging,
weather-beaten, frame rowhouses in Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   From that unlikely nexis of power and prestige, David D. Smith,
chief executive of the Sinclair Broadcast Group, runs a group of TV
stations that has grown so fast he is unsure exactly how many he
now controls.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's either 61 or 63,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   It's actually 64, enough to put Smith in the same league as Babe
Ruth and Roger Maris, if not quite Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa. It
also gives Sinclair control of more stations than any of the major
broadcast networks _ by one measure, greater reach into the
nation's households than the stations owned by one of the giants,
ABC.
</P>
<P>
   More important, the spending power represented by those stations
is giving Smith and his ideas influence in an industry that has
long seen local television as the seedy but rich uncle of the
television business _ a salesman in garish clothes and diamond
pinkie rings. Now, however, station group owners like Smith may
have more say about what American television viewers watch in the
future than the media elite on Broadcast Row in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Already, local stations control so much of the revenue generated
by the television business _ more than $20 billion a year, versus
the $14 billion produced by the networks _ that more network
programming decisions are being made on the basis of what works
best for local stations, not national ratings.
</P>
<P>
   CBS, for instance, has shifted its programming priorities to
attract more urban than rural viewers, specifically to try to
benefit the stations it owns, most of which are in the nation's
biggest cities. One example: This season, CBS canceled ``Dr. Quinn,
Medicine Woman,'' a Western, in favor of ``Martial Law,'' a series
about a martial-arts expert in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, almost all the new programming in recent years on every
network _ including the two would-be networks, UPN and the WB _ has
been aimed at young urban viewers. At one point, the entire NBC
lineup of Thursday-night comedies was set in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   The Fox network is so committed to maintaining profits at the
stations it owns that it has resisted expanding beyond 15 hours in
prime time; the other networks fill 22 hours. ``You have to
consider the network as wholesale and the local stations as
retail,'' said Fox Television president Larry Jacobson. ``The
growth is really in retail sales. That's why we're staying at 15
hours, to allow the stations to be more profitable.''
</P>
<P>
   So what's the vision in all this? In Smith's view, it is leading
to a television world ruled by 10 to 15 enormous station groups
like Sinclair that will hold sway over what programs get on the
air. And when the day comes that digital technology takes hold,
Smith envisions his company dividing each of his local broadcast
signals into five or six different channels _ including some that
viewers would have to pay for _ rather than transmitting
high-definition pictures on a single frequency.
</P>
<P>
   For good measure, Smith also intends to dominate the business of
providing local Internet content in each of his markets.
</P>
<P>
   The first step in this process would be to make Sinclair even
bigger, if the government allows companies' reach to extend beyond
the current limits _ 35 percent of the nation's households. In the
last two weeks, many of the big station group owners have been
calling for relaxation of the 35 percent limitation. CBS station
group chairman Mel Karmazin told a Federal Communications
Commission panel Thursday that ``the 35 percent cap has to move and
it's got to move quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the present limitations, the big TV networks are
struggling to reach single-digit profit margins. Smith, meanwhile,
is upbeat about Sinclair's prospects _ even under the current
restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is absolutely a great business,'' he said. ``I don't
think there are many other businesses where you can do a 50 percent
profit margin without manufacturing anything. And I know. I tried
manufacturing high-powered antennas, and I had to fight and die for
a couple of percent profit.''
</P>
<P>
   Even underperforming TV stations often manage to hit 30 to 35
percent profit margins. Stations also continue to be sold at
extravagant prices. Just last August the Hearst-Argyle station
group bought an NBC affiliate in Sacramento, Calif., for $520
million. That price is about 15 times the station's annual profit,
one of the highest multiples ever paid for a television station.
</P>
<P>
   (The cost of acquisitions means the profits Smith brags about
are on an operating basis only. Over all, Sinclair has lost money
three of the last five years, and its stock has badly lagged behind
the bull market _ up about 30 percent since the company went public
in June 1995, versus an 80 percent gain in the Standard &AMP; Poor's
500-stock index. But revenues have climbed steadily, increasing
sixfold from 1993 to 1997.)
</P>
<P>
   Most network executives share Smith's bullishness about the
local station business. CBS has such high hopes for economic gains
at its stations that executives have taken to shrugging off likely
losses at the network level. After all, the company is now being
run by Karmazin, who gained fame in the last decade at Infinity
Broadcasting for assembling an enormous number of radio stations
and then bolstering their sales and profitability with his tough
approach to management.
</P>
<P>
   Some experts say local stations are bound to be hurt by a range
of competitive incursions _ foremost, perhaps, the sale of local
advertising by cable companies. But Jonathan Klein, the president
of CBS's stations, dismisses the threat.

CALIFORNIA SHIFT MOST SIGNIFICANT IN JOSTLING FOR EARLIER
PRIMARIES 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CRAGG HINES 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The landscape for the 2000 presidential nominating
race is changing dramatically, shifting toward an early, expensive
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   A rush among the states is on to snag a bit of the electoral
spotlight as soon as possible after the major opening guns sound in
Iowa and New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   Despite disputes about the wisdom of front-loading the national
political season, it seems tailor-made for well-known,
well-financed White House prospects, including Vice President Al
Gore, the leading Democratic possibility, and Gov. George W. Bush
of Texas, who is out front in early Republican soundings.
</P>
<P>
   The game of leapfrog is being led by populous states tired of
having so little say in the presidential nominating process.
</P>
<P>
   California last week moved its primary to the first Tuesday in
March, joining New York, which made the switch soon after the 1996
election.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Christine Todd Whitman of New Jersey said she wanted her
state to move its primary, now in June, shortly before the
season-ending nominating conventions, to March 7, 2000, and would
work to get neighboring Pennsylvania and Delaware to come along.
</P>
<P>
   That is the first day that most states can hold presidential
preference voting under party rules and past practice. It is the
day already on the books for four New England states as well as
Maryland and Georgia. Washington state and Oregon may seek to join
the parade lest California hog the West Coast action.
</P>
<P>
   Texas' primary is scheduled on the second Tuesday in March,
along with Florida, Mississippi, Oklahoma and Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   Even if those are the only states in the early lineup _ and more
are almost certain to try to squeeze in _ more than half the
nation's voters would cast presidential nominating ballots within
eight days in early March.
</P>
<P>
   That would be a historic _ and probably decisive _ concentration
of presidential primary power.
</P>
<P>
   Candidates flock to the early primary states, many of which are
small and unrepresentative and as the races are decided, paying
little attention to bigger states, whose primaries come later in
the process.
</P>
<P>
   The early primaries would be a major change from the lengthier,
more deliberative nominating process which is the textbook ideal _
even if it has not worked that way in practice.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Pete Wilson of California, in signing the primary
legislation, said the shift of dates was needed to make the
nation's most populous and diverse state relevant to the nominating
process.
</P>
<P>
   ``California voters are finally going to have some clout in
deciding who it is that the major parties nominate for president,''
said Wilson, who made an unsuccessful bid for the GOP nomination in
1996 and may try again in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, the state had moved its primary to the third week in
March but found it was still missing out on the real action.
</P>
<P>
   But other officials thought California had made a bad move.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts Secretary of State William Galvin called it ``a
disaster for the traditional presidential primary process as we've
known it.''
</P>
<P>
   The theory is that in an elongated primary season, a host of
candidates can test their policies and personalities with voters
over the late winter and spring in a number of states. The reality
more recently has been that all but two or three contenders are
eliminated after the Iowa caucuses and New Hampshire primary and
then each party has pretty much settled on a candidate by
mid-March.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier primaries in big states, especially California and New
York, are expected to accentuate that trend.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest likelihood is that it closes the whole (primary)
process down'' by the second week in March, said William N.
Carrick, a Democratic consultant in Los Angeles who has worked on
several presidential campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   But a mass of early primaries will also mean some different
twists on how candidates approach the primaries.
</P>
<P>
   Several analysts agreed the early concentration of primaries
would make the results in Iowa and New Hampshire even more
important.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's going to be so much ground to cover that anyone who
isn't riding a media wave can't compete,'' said Dan Schnur, a San
Francisco-based Republican consultant and former adviser to Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   And it could change, or at least increase, the issues which are
discussed in the two earliest states.
</P>
<P>
   ``Iowa and New Hampshire become a microphone to talk to the
nation,'' Carrick said.
</P>
<P>
   Gun control and abortion rights are staple issues for some
candidates, especially conservative Republicans, in Iowa and New
Hampshire. Those topics could take on a different coloration if
contenders know that voting in more liberal California and New York
are just down the pike.
</P>
<P>
   A top Republican consultant said the new timetable could make it
easier for a more moderate GOP contender to have a chance, assuming
the candidate can scrape through the first two contests.
</P>
<P>
   Another big difference will be fund-raising.
</P>
<P>
   The need for a serious candidate to have at least $35 million on
hand when the election year opens ``will be even more emphasized,''
said Ken Khachigian, a California-based Republican consultant.
</P>
<P>
   There will be no time-outs in which a candidate who did
surprisingly well in New Hampshire could spend a few days raising
money for television ads in California.
</P>
<P>
   ``California will just swallow money,'' with up to $4 million
needed to run a two-week media campaign in the state, Khachigian
said.
</P>
<P>
   The advantages to having deep pockets could bolster the apparent
plan of publisher Steve Forbes, who spent $38 million of his own
fortune on an unsuccessful Republican campaign in 1996, to try
again in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   News of Wilson's signing the California primary bill quickened a
few political pulses around the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It moves up the timetable for everything,'' Khachigian said.
``Frankly, planning has to begin Nov. 4,'' the day after next
month's election. &QL;

 UNDATED: the threat.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``No cable station is going to have 40 years invested in
Pittsburgh, the way our station, KDKA, has,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But with the media industry roiled by change in the last decade,
some executives believe that local television will prove
vulnerable: to what some see as an inevitable conflict over the
issue of payments that the stations receive for carrying network
programs, or to the same pressures of increasing viewer choice that
have squeezed the economics of network television, or to a downturn
in the national economy that will affect advertising sales, still
the only real source of revenues for local broadcasters beyond
those annual checks from the networks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Local television is still a great business, but I think there
are concerns about the age-old issue of audience erosion,'' said
Paul Sweeney, a media analyst for Salomon Smith Barney. ``That sets
up the classic squeeze on profits. Costs are rising faster than
revenues, even though the squeeze is still less apparent at the
local stations at this point.''
</P>
<P>
   Others see the future for local stations as truly cloudy. ``The
smart people I see are selling out,'' said a senior executive from
one of the big broadcast networks, who spoke on condition of
anonymity. ``The people who say that stations are where the money
is don't know what they are talking about. It's true today, but if
you look out five years, you can start to hear people say, `What's
the reason for this station's existence?' Do you need seven local
newscasts in New York? Can the seventh station in a market compete
with a cable channel like TNT or USA?''
</P>
<P>
   Looking ahead, this executive said local television might
someday look more like the newspaper business. ``There used to be
10 viable newspapers in New York,'' the executive said. ``Now there
are two and a half. That doesn't mean the newspaper business is
over. It means for those that can't compete it's over.''
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper analogy certainly fits with what is already
happening in the local television business: a move toward
consolidation of ownership among media companies and away from
local ownership by everything from mom-and-pop family companies to
local newspapers or insurance companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ownership is where it's at,'' said Lowell Paxson, who has
aggressively assembled a group of small stations with frequencies
like Channel 67 in Wilkes-Barre, Pa., and Channel 61 in Fresno,
Calif., into what he hopes will be a viable new broadcast network,
PaxTV, which emphasizes family fare.
</P>
<P>
   Making all this possible have been changes in federal
regulations that allowed station owners to expand from what was
once a limit of seven stations nationally. Besides Paxson
Communications and Sinclair, other big group owners include the
networks themselves and companies like Hearst-Argyle Television,
A.H. Belo Corp., Young Broadcasting and Granite Broadcasting.
</P>
<P>
   Among the people who run these companies, Sweeney says
Sinclair's Smith is the ``only true visionary in an industry not
noted for producing visionaries.'' Salomon Smith Barney has a buy
recommendation on Sinclair but considers it a ``high risk'' pick.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Sinclair is an unlikely center of entrepreneurship, a
company whose headquarters are, for the moment, housed in the
former Baltimore Power and Light building just off Interstate 83,
along with the offices of WBFF-TV, the city's Fox affiliate and the
station from which the company grew.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said he planned to move the corporate offices next year to
a complex in suburban Hunt Valley. But until a few months ago, he
didn't even have his own office, sitting instead in a large room
that included desks for his three brothers, who are his partners,
and all their secretaries. More recently he gave in and moved into
a 12-by-13 cubicle of his own.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just got a bit too noisy when we were in the same room,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sweeney, who has visited the Sinclair headquarters, describes it
as ``a bit of a dump.'' But that does not mean Sinclair should be
underestimated. ``Dave Smith is years ahead of everybody else in
the business,'' Sweeney said.
</P>
<P>
   How so? First, Smith pioneered a technique known as the local
management agreement, which allows one station to run another
without owning it. By combining such functions as sales and
administration, and creating additional newscasts, the arrangements
can cut costs and improve profitability. Among the 64 stations
Sinclair controls, more than 20 are in such agreements. (In
Baltimore, for example, the company also operates WNUV-TV, an
affiliate of the WB.)
</P>
<P>
   Lately, too, Smith has been the most vocal advocate of dividing
the signals at his stations into multiple services for narrowly
defined audiences once digital television becomes possible, as
opposed to using them to transmit high-definition pictures. If that
begins to make the future of television sound like the present of
radio, that is OK with Smith, who owns about 60 radio stations too,
as many as six in a single market.
</P>
<P>
   More than anything, Smith's vision is bigness _ the aggressive
acquisition of stations, which has put him in the position to
manage rapidly rising program costs. It isn't just networks, with
their huge bills for professional football or series like ``ER,''
that have experienced programming inflation. Local stations spend
most of their budgets on newscasts and syndicated programming, both
first-run shows like ``Jeopardy'' and ``Xena: The Warrior
Princess'' and repeats of ``Seinfeld'' and ``Frasier.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith negotiates with syndicators to buy programs for his entire
group _ and if that contributes to the homogenization of local
television, it makes the transaction more efficient for both the
content provider and the station owner. ``There are big advantages
in scale,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Like almost all the big group owners, Smith has also tried to
spread his network associations around. Sinclair has stations
affiliated with all six networks _ an ideal situation, he said,
because it insulates him against the cyclical nature of success and
failure at the networks.
</P>
<P>
   But Sinclair has consistently preferred to affiliate itself with
up-and-coming, less-than-full-time networks like Fox, and more
recently the WB and UPN.
</P>
<P>
   On one hand, Smith said, he simply likes to be ``associated with
gamblers like Rupert Murdoch,'' the chairman of News Corp., which
owns Fox. But he also likes not having to share so much of his
broadcast day _ and so many of his commercial slots _ with a
network. (Local stations get to sell only a couple of minutes of
commercials an hour during network programs.)
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the economic relationship that has bound local
stations to the long-established networks is beginning to fray.
</P>
<P>
   Since the days of radio, ABC, CBS and NBC have paid stations an
annual fee, known as compensation, for carrying network programs.
Today, each network pays its affiliates $175 million to $200
million a year.

 UNDATED: a year.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   But network executives increasingly attack compensation as a
crippling anachronism in an era when NBC must pay $286 million a
year for ``ER.''
</P>
<P>
   This year, ABC and CBS engaged in fractious negotiations with
affiliates about sharing the $500 million annual cost for new
National Football League broadcast deals. CBS won some concessions;
ABC mainly ran into a brick wall of resistance.
</P>
<P>
   Network executives agree that more confrontations are coming _
probably by 2004, when many stations' contracts with their networks
will expire.
</P>
<P>
   Will there be war at that point? ``I don't want to say war,''
said Klein of CBS. ``But I'd be surprised if there weren't some
serious disagreements.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith sees no reason for a fight. The problem, he said, is that
at the moment, too many parties are sitting at the table for
fruitful negotiations to take place. But if the government were to
raise the limit on market coverage _ to, say, 50 percent of all
households _ Sinclair and other big groups would kick off a new
round of consolidation.
</P>
<P>
   Then, he said, he might go to NBC and suggest that he be treated
as a partner on a key show like ``ER.'' ``If I deliver 7 percent of
the country for them,'' Smith said, ``I'd want 7 percent of the
show. And I'd pay for that. I would have done that if they came to
me four years ago when the show went on the air. Why not? We all
gamble everyday. You just have to be more astute in gambling.''
</P>
<P>
   No network, of course, has ever been willing to cede any
percentage of its advertising profits to a local affiliate.
</P>
<P>
   For the long term, Smith is looking to the Internet as a place
where local station ownership will find its ultimate advantage.
``What's going to be on the Internet is all sorts of new
information,'' he said. ``My stations will have more information
than anyone in the cities we operate in.''
</P>
<P>
   But he sees the Internet developing as a powerful revenue base
only at some indefinable point ``in my lifetime.'' In the much
shorter term, he said, Sinclair and other broadcasters will be able
to open up an additional revenue stream from the division of
signals under digitalization.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Smith endured some tough questioning by Sen. John
McCain, R-Ariz., and others on the Senate Commerce Committee for
his reluctance to explore the possibility of broadcasting
high-definition television on new digital frequencies rather than
splitting the signals of his stations into as many new program
services as possible _ some of them carrying subscription fees.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes no sense to want to be a single channel,'' Smith
says. ``Why should I continue to allow the cable guys to pick me
apart?''
</P>
<P>
   Other broadcasters question how stations can hope to fill five
or six additional signals with worthwhile programs. ``There's no
way to fill even the shelf space we have today,'' said WB chief
executive Jamie Kellner, who also controls a separate company, Acme
Broadcasting, that owns six WB affiliates. ``How many of the 70
channels that most people receive can you sit and spend even a
half-hour a week with?''
</P>
<P>
   Kellner argues that the far better pictures and sound promised
by high-definition television will be so impressive that consumers
will eventually demand it. ``It will add a dimension to the viewing
experience,'' he said. ``Our industry needs another jolt in
technology.''
</P>
<P>
   Each of the big networks is obligated by the FCC to establish a
digital capability in three of its markets by November. So far,
that looks like a lot of cost without much hope of return, said
Mitchell Stern, the chairman of the Fox Television stations, the
biggest of the network-owned groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``It costs a minimum of $1 million to convert a broadcast tower
to digital,'' he said. ``If you have to bring in all new equipment,
it's a $7 million to $10 million investment. You may have to buy
land; it can be nightmarish. And how many sets will be able to
receive this technology in November? Two? The answer is essentially
none. You have to go in the hole big time before you see any
return.''
</P>
<P>
   Going in the hole is not how Smith foresees moving Sinclair
Broadcasting forward. ``The guys who are spending money to get a
better-looking single channel,'' he said, ``are just creating a
better chance for me to go whack them.''

DOCUMENTS ILLUMINATE CAST OF CHARACTERS IN LEWINSKY SAGA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN FREEDMAN  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The 4,610 pages of documents released Friday by the
House Judiciary Committee do not alter the basic contours of
President Clinton's affair with Monica Lewinsky. And they are not
likely to remold the increasingly partisan impeachment debate on
Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   But buried deep in the eye-splitting type of miniaturized grand
jury transcripts are the accounts of the players, big and small, of
what they knew about the affair, when they knew it, and what went
through their minds as the magnitude of it sunk in.
</P>
<P>
   Washington super-lawyer and presidential confidant Vernon
Jordan, for instance, looked upon the former White House intern as
``a bobby-soxer who was mesmerized by Frank Sinatra'' when she
arrived at his office on Dec. 19, 1997, declaring that she had
received a subpoena in the Paula Jones sexual harassment lawsuit
against Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky ``was quite taken with the man because of his position,
because of who he was, because he was tall and he was handsome and
because he was president,'' Jordan said. ``That was clear to me.''
</P>
<P>
   As he prepared to find Lewinsky a criminal defense lawyer,
Jordan asked her whether she had ``sexual relationships'' with the
president. Jordan told prosecutors and grand jurors she said no.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan, however, became irate when Thomas Beinert, a lawyer in
the office of Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr, pushed him on
whether he had intended his question to Lewinsky to cover oral sex
as well as sexual intercourse.
</P>
<P>
   ``My view of it was sexual intercourse,'' he said. ``Period.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, he added that he didn't want Lewinsky to ``tell me
anything about her relationship with the president. But I knew I
had to ask ... I did not get graphic.''
</P>
<P>
   Later that night, Jordan recalled, he confronted Clinton with
the same question. Clinton replied ``no, never.'' Once again, he
became irate when Deputy Independent Counsel Robert Bittman focused
in on oral sex.
</P>
<P>
   ``I explained that to you, counsel, and I'm not going to explain
that again,'' he said. ``I have explained to you, as best I could,
as honestly as I could, what I asked Monica Lewinsky about sexual
relations and what I asked the president about sexual relations,
and I do not view it as my responsibility to have two people define
for me what that meant.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton denied a sexual relationship with Lewinsky in his Paula
Jones deposition last January. However, when he acknowledged an
``inappropriate relationship'' with Lewinsky on Aug. 17, he
insisted that he had not committed perjury. In his videotaped
deposition released last month, Clinton drew a distinction between
intercourse and other sexual acts.
</P>
<P>
   In grand jury testimony also released last month, Lewinsky said
she told Jordan that while ``we didn't have sex,'' she and Clinton
``did everything but sex.'' Jordan ``didn't really respond to me,''
Lewinsky said. ``So I took that as a cue to drop the subject.''
</P>
<P>
   In another transcript released Friday, Lewinsky's mother, Marcia
Lewis, said she first learned of the relationship when her daughter
told her she was ``seeing'' Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   She referred to him as handsome and was ``happy'' when he
called, Lewis said, adding that she thought the calls from Clinton
``unusual,'' and that a 1997 Valentine's Day ad she put in the
Washington Post to Clinton (identified only as ``handsome'') was
``inappropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky told her she thought she was in love with Clinton, but
feared that the president was ``using'' her. This rang true to
Lewis. ``There were times that I couldn't imagine what else was
going on, why she was going there.''
</P>
<P>
   An author of a book on the private lives of operatic stars,
Lewis declared that ``in my experience ... men use women all the
time for different things.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis said she ``begged (Lewinsky) to leave Washington. I begged
her to get a different job. I begged her to date other people and
start a different life.''
</P>
<P>
   In her grand jury testimony, also released Friday, presidential
secretary Betty Currie said she thought Lewinsky had ``a very
serious crush'' on the president, but so did ``a lot of people.''
</P>
<P>
   Currie acknowledged making phone calls to Lewinsky for Clinton,
fielding calls from Lewinsky to Clinton, and ushering her into the
White House to avoid suspicion.
</P>
<P>
   But she insisted she never witnessed any sexual contact between
them. And she made it clear _ in this exchange with prosecutors
before the grand jury _ that the less she knew, the better she
felt.
</P>
<P>
   Question: You told us, Mrs. Currie ... that you always like to
believe the best of people, is that right?''
</P>
<P>
   Answer: That's correct.
</P>
<P>
   Q: And that with regard to the relationship between the
president and Ms. Lewinsky, that you purposely wanted to believe
there was no intimate relationship between them ... correct?
</P>
<P>
   A: Correct.
</P>
<P>
   Currie recalled Lewinsky pressing her on the subject, saying
that ``as long as no one saw us _ and no one did _ then nothing
happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Currie responded: ``Don't want to hear it. Don't say anymore.
Don't want to hear anymore.''

WHAT SANK   THE TITANIC? 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, October 04, 1998)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID WARSH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Fifteen years ago, Michael Mussa was a trade economist at the
University of Chicago, working on the mathematics of duality and
proud of it. Then the policy bug bit and he went to Washington as a
member of the Council of Economic Advisers for Ronald Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   Today Mussa is chief economist of the International Monetary
Fund. It was in this capacity that he wrote the single best
formulation I have heard of one of the thornier economic problems
of the present day: namely, the perverse incentives &UR;  &LR; collectively
known as ``moral hazard.''
</P>
<P>
   He did so by parsing the mystery of what caused the sinking of
the Titanic.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; The simple answer, of course, is that it was an iceberg. But
the real story, says Mussa, is not really quite that simple.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were some errors in design and manufacture of the
Titanic. There were certainly errors in the way the captain managed
it,'' he told a Federal Reserve Bank of Boston research conference
last summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was the failure of the lookouts to have binoculars, the
excessive speed, the inadequate supply of lifeboats, the inadequate
deployment of those lifeboats at a sufficiently early time, the
failure of the California to recognize the distress signals. All of
these things contributed ultimately to the disaster.
</P>
<P>
   ``However, there are some who believe that the real disaster in
the North Atlantic on that cold April morning was not that the
Titanic sank with the loss of 1,500 lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was instead that 800 were saved.
</P>
<P>
   ``Think of it. If we had had a policy of no rescues, we would
have sent a clear message, a clear message that ocean safety has to
be of paramount concern, of passengers, crews, and ocean shipping
lines.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus did Mussa illuminate the extreme and, in some circles,
oddly prevalent view of the problem known among economists as
``moral hazard.'' This deeply ambiguous term has evolved to
describe those situations in everyday economic life in which it is
possible to make a one-way bet: heads, you win, tails somebody
bails you out. Moral hazard is when the insurance company pays all
claims.
</P>
<P>
   When he made these remarks, Mussa was only partly joking,
because, as he said, ``there are those who wave the bloody flag of
moral hazard every time the international community steps forward''
to provide support on an actual or potential disaster.
</P>
<P>
   Moral hazard is real, Mussa quickly added. The US savings and
loan debacle was rife with it. So was the trillion-dollar
reconstruction of East Germany. And it was possible, he allowed,
that aid policies of the International Monetary Fund could be
encouraging bad behavior.
</P>
<P>
   But the mere possibility that somebody, somewhere, might have
gamed the system should not stop all rescue efforts, said Mussa,
who by most standards is a cautious, conservative man. Each case
should be judged on its merits.
</P>
<P>
   The IMF's rescue of the Mexican economy during the peso crisis
of 1994 was a good example, he said. It was ``simply silly'' to
think that moral hazard was the root of the problem. Russia _ where
the perception of ``too nuclear to fail'' was widespread _ is a
different matter, Mussa said; there is plenty to argue about there.
</P>
<P>
   Sure enough, the moral hazard diagnosis has been quickly adopted
by populists of the right and left to describe what happened when
the Federal Reserve Board last month forced the sale of a big
hedge &UR;  &LR; fund to a consortium of 14 banks and securities firms that
had lent money to it.
</P>
<P>
   Long-Term Capital Management LP was a collection of some of the
best and brightest on Wall Street. They included Robert Merton and
Myron Scholes, business school professors who had won Nobel Prizes
for developing the options pricing formula that has become the
basis for the trading of all risk.
</P>
<P>
   The partners who started LTCM in 1994 put in some money of their
own, accepted more from the richest investors whom they charged the
highest fees, leveraged their equity an astounding twenty-fold with
billions borrowed from banks _ and waded into the markets to buy
and sell risk, using complicated mathematical strategies.
</P>
<P>
   The firm came to grief in August when other investors,
stampeding from Russia after the government defaulted on some of
its obligations, messed up Long-Term Capital's carefully organized
book. Rather than liquidate these positions immediately in a
hyper-distress sale that might have taken down several banks with
it, the government simply ordered it sold, giving its new owners
time to unwind its positions.
</P>
<P>
   Was this a government bailout? It was if you listen to Jeff Faux
of the Economic Policy Institute. Or to James Glassman of the
American Enterprise Institute. As usual, the editorial page of The
Wall Street Journal took the argument furthest, that Long-Term
Capital was simply ``the latest bailout'' in a Decade of Moral
Hazard engineered by _ who else? _ Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   But was it really? No public money was involved; the government
simply organized the sale of the assets to a consortium with
considerably deeper pockets, thus preventing a fire sale of assets
that truly could have precipitated a global crash. The partners who
started Long-Term Capital lost about 90 cents on the dollar. It was
the banks which so extravagantly lent to them that were saved.
</P>
<P>
   True, joint ownership poses some conflict-of-interest problems
that wouldn't have arisen had Warren Buffett been the lucky winner,
as House Banking Committee chairman Jim Leach (R-Iowa) pointed out
last week. Buffett bid a package that would have given the owners a
flat $250 million, or only two thirds as much as what the Wall
Street firms are paying, with no upside.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  It's easy to undertand why Long-Term Capital preferred the
banks, but why did the government? Moral hazard, perhaps. If
Buffett thought the Fed felt it must tip the sale to him, he could
have bid far less than he thought the assets were worth. Then
again, maybe the feds got taken.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the thing to remember is the kind of business that
LTCM was doing in the first place. Yes, it was a hedge fund, a
risky vehicle designed for only the wealthiest investors. Its easy
access to other people's money was absurd. But it served a useful
purpose.
</P>
<P>
   In essence, LTCM served as a kind of reinsurance company for the
big international banks, buying up the risk they considered
excessive and laying it off with other investors. In the end, it
was itself too risky. Yet LTCM and other funds like it have made it
possible to develop a couple dozen nations around the world at the
same time.
</P>
<P>
   Like the Titanic, Long-Term Capital Management was a piece of
showy machinery. It could have been better designed. Doubtless it
will be next time. The leverage ratios of such investment vehicles
will be reduced, their transparency to lenders and investors
increased. Gradually, international-risk arbitrage will become as
safe as ocean travel.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, however, the decision to slowly unwind hedge
fund's positions was every bit as sensible as rescuing the
survivors of the Titanic.

GORDON TO RUN FIVE BGN RACES IN '99
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By JOHN STURBIN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CONCORD, N.C. _ Two-time NASCAR Winston Cup champion Jeff Gordon
will run an abbreviated five-race Busch Grand National schedule in
1999, including his first appearance in the Coca-Cola 300 at Texas
Motor Speedway in Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon's return to the BGN circuit in a Chevrolet co-owned by
his wife, Brooke, and Winston Cup crew chief Ray Evernham, is part
of Gordon-Evernham Motorsports' plan to develop a ``farm team'' in
conjunction with Hendrick Motorsports. Ricky Hendrick, the
18-year-old son of Rick Hendrick _ the owner of Gordon's Cup team _
is scheduled to drive five BGN races for Gordon next year.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon plans to run five BGN superspeedway races in 1999 and
2000 in the No. 24 Pepsi-Frito Lay Chevrolet Monte Carlo, with
Evernham calling the shots and his Winston Cup ``Rainbow Warriors''
working the pits.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know a lot of people are asking why I want to do this,''
Gordon said during a news conference at the Hendrick facility
yesterday morning. ``This is a great way to get back in the series
and for me to make some laps at tracks I need more laps at. It's a
great way to give other young drivers a chance to get behind the
wheel of a race car.''
</P>
<P>
   Evernham said Gordon will race in both 1999 BGN events at
Charlotte Motor Speedway, the site of today's All Pro Bumper to
Bumper 300, and single races at TMS, Las Vegas Motor Speedway and
Michigan Speedway. The Busch race at the 1.5-mile TMS is scheduled
for March 27, 1999, as a prelude to the Primestar 500 Cup event
March 28.
</P>
<P>
   Evernham said Michael Landis of Hendrick Motorsports will be
team manager of Gordon-Evernham Motorsports.
</P>
<P>
   Ricky Hendrick is completing his rookie season in the Late Model
Stock division at Concord Motor Speedway and area short tracks.
Hendrick has scored three victories and three poles this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't really have a farm team for the 24 or for Hendrick
Motorsports,'' Evernham said. ``I don't want to say it's a research
and development team because we're going to run good. But it's
going to be a training ground for crew members and drivers.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon acknowledged that he has two new bosses to report to.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm only the driver. I'm not the owner,'' said Gordon, who has
a 199-point lead over Mark Martin in the Cup points chase heading
into tomorrow's UAW-GM Quality 500. ``It's going to be tough taking
orders from my wife as a car owner and from my crew chief as a car
owner, but I think we're going to have a lot of fun.''

SEEING NO CHANGE IN U.N. POLICY, IRAQ WILL DENY ACCESS TO
INSPECTORS  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By BARBARA CROSSETTE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Iraq failed to gain any ground here this week
and decided Friday not to resume cooperation with arms inspectors
after days of hints that a change of policy could be imminent,
diplomats and officials said.
</P>
<P>
   After a meeting Friday between Secretary-General Kofi Annan and
Tariq Aziz, Iraq's deputy prime minister and liaison with the
United Nations on sanctions issues, a spokesman for the
secretary-general said only that the two had talked and would meet
again on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   That will coincide or follow on the heels of a Security Council
meeting to consider major reports on Iraq's compliance with
disarmament requirements. The reports _ from the U.N. Special
Commission, which monitors biological, chemical and missile
systems, and by the International Atomic Energy Agency, which
watches nuclear programs _ are due to be sent to the council by
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The previously scheduled periodic review of sanctions that
should follow the reports is now on hold because of Iraq's decision
on Aug. 5 to bar spot or surprise inspections and allow only remote
monitoring and repeat visits to known sites. Those periodic reviews
cannot resume _ and therefore sanctions cannot be lifted under
Security Council resolutions _ until inspectors get full freedom of
action.
</P>
<P>
   The obstacle to an arrangement that would allow the Iraqis to
alter their position on inspections in return for a more
comprehensive review of all of Baghdad's relations with the United
Nations is the lack of consensus in the Security Council on what
that review would cover, and in what sequence.
</P>
<P>
   The Iraqis continue to hold out hope that a different kind of
review, which they want the secretary-general to oversee, would be
the key to lifting at least some part of the embargo which has
crippled the Iraqi economy since it was imposed in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   The Iraqis, backed by friends on the Security Council, would
lobby for a closing of files on nuclear weapons and missile
systems, diplomats said, and follow that with a demand that oil
sales be allowed to resume. The United States would insist on
looking at a range of demands, some of them unrelated to weapons,
that Iraq has not met in more than eight years of sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   But neither the friends nor the foes of Iraq on the Council gave
Aziz any hope this week that a comprehensive review could be held
before inspections resumed. He heard the same message from Annan
and other U.N. officials, aides said.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq was on the offensive this week against the Special
Commission, known as UNSCOM, and its chairman, Richard Butler, an
Australian arms-control expert. In a letter to the
secretary-general on Thursday, Aziz asked again for an
investigation of the commission because Baghdad believes that it
harbors spies.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday in Baghdad, Iraqi newspapers, all of which reflect the
government line, specifically cited the United States and Israel as
the nations with which UNSCOM was sharing information about Iraq.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Iraqi newspapers said Aziz told the secretary-general in his
letter that an investigation of the commission was necessary ``to
guarantee the United Nations credibility, neutrality and
reputation.''
</P>
<P>
   The renewed clamor for an investigation follows remarks made by
Scott Ritter, an American who resigned from the commission in
August, asserting that the United Nations and the United States
were failing to put adequate pressure on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Ritter's comments were made to an Israeli newspaper, in
which he was quoted as saying that he had shared information on
Iraq with the Israelis. Ritter, an expert in concealment
techniques, is under FBI investigation in Washington on charges
that he passed intelligence to the Israelis, charges that he
denies.
</P>
<P>
   The situation has, however, created significant diplomatic
problems for the Special Commission and the United Nations itself
in the Middle East, diplomats said Friday, because Iraq has claimed
that Ritter's remarks prove that its charges of Israeli and
American espionage were true.

CALIFORNIA SHIFT MOST SIGNIFICANT IN JOSTLING FOR EARLIER
PRIMARIES 
 
(FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, OCT. 4) 

</HEADLINE>

c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The landscape for the 2000 presidential nominating
race is changing dramatically, shifting toward an early, expensive
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   A rush among the states is on to snag a bit of the electoral
spotlight as soon as possible after the major opening guns sound in
Iowa and New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   Despite disputes about the wisdom of front-loading the national
political season, it seems tailor-made for well-known,
well-financed White House prospects, including Vice President Al
Gore, the leading Democratic possibility, and Gov. George W. Bush
of Texas, who is out front in early Republican soundings.
</P>
<P>
   The game of leapfrog is being led by populous states tired of
having so little say in the presidential nominating process.
</P>
<P>
   California last week moved its primary to the first Tuesday in
March, joining New York, which made the switch soon after the 1996
election.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Christine Todd Whitman of New Jersey said she wanted her
state to move its primary, now in June, shortly before the
season-ending nominating conventions, to March 7, 2000, and would
work to get neighboring Pennsylvania and Delaware to come along.
</P>
<P>
   That is the first day that most states can hold presidential
preference voting under party rules and past practice. It is the
day already on the books for four New England states as well as
Maryland and Georgia. Washington state and Oregon may seek to join
the parade lest California hog the West Coast action.
</P>
<P>
   Texas' primary is scheduled on the second Tuesday in March,
along with Florida, Mississippi, Oklahoma and Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   Even if those are the only states in the early lineup _ and more
are almost certain to try to squeeze in _ more than half the
nation's voters would cast presidential nominating ballots within
eight days in early March.
</P>
<P>
   That would be a historic _ and probably decisive _ concentration
of presidential primary power.
</P>
<P>
   Candidates flock to the early primary states, many of which are
small and unrepresentative and as the races are decided, paying
little attention to bigger states, whose primaries come later in
the process.
</P>
<P>
   The early primaries would be a major change from the lengthier,
more deliberative nominating process which is the textbook ideal _
even if it has not worked that way in practice.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Pete Wilson of California, in signing the primary
legislation, said the shift of dates was needed to make the
nation's most populous and diverse state relevant to the nominating
process.
</P>
<P>
   ``California voters are finally going to have some clout in
deciding who it is that the major parties nominate for president,''
said Wilson, who made an unsuccessful bid for the GOP nomination in
1996 and may try again in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, the state had moved its primary to the third week in
March but found it was still missing out on the real action.
</P>
<P>
   But other officials thought California had made a bad move.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts Secretary of State William Galvin called it ``a
disaster for the traditional presidential primary process as we've
known it.''
</P>
<P>
   The theory is that in an elongated primary season, a host of
candidates can test their policies and personalities with voters
over the late winter and spring in a number of states. The reality
more recently has been that all but two or three contenders are
eliminated after the Iowa caucuses and New Hampshire primary and
then each party has pretty much settled on a candidate by
mid-March.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier primaries in big states, especially California and New
York, are expected to accentuate that trend.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest likelihood is that it closes the whole (primary)
process down'' by the second week in March, said William N.
Carrick, a Democratic consultant in Los Angeles who has worked on
several presidential campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   But a mass of early primaries will also mean some different
twists on how candidates approach the primaries.
</P>
<P>
   Several analysts agreed the early concentration of primaries
would make the results in Iowa and New Hampshire even more
important.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's going to be so much ground to cover that anyone who
isn't riding a media wave can't compete,'' said Dan Schnur, a San
Francisco-based Republican consultant and former adviser to Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   And it could change, or at least increase, the issues which are
discussed in the two earliest states.
</P>
<P>
   ``Iowa and New Hampshire become a microphone to talk to the
nation,'' Carrick said.
</P>
<P>
   Gun control and abortion rights are staple issues for some
candidates, especially conservative Republicans, in Iowa and New
Hampshire. Those topics could take on a different coloration if
contenders know that voting in more liberal California and New York
are just down the pike.
</P>
<P>
   A top Republican consultant said the new timetable could make it
easier for a more moderate GOP contender to have a chance, assuming
the candidate can scrape through the first two contests.
</P>
<P>
   Another big difference will be fund-raising.
</P>
<P>
   The need for a serious candidate to have at least $35 million on
hand when the election year opens ``will be even more emphasized,''
said Ken Khachigian, a California-based Republican consultant.
</P>
<P>
   There will be no time-outs in which a candidate who did
surprisingly well in New Hampshire could spend a few days raising
money for television ads in California.
</P>
<P>
   ``California will just swallow money,'' with up to $4 million
needed to run a two-week media campaign in the state, Khachigian
said.
</P>
<P>
   The advantages to having deep pockets could bolster the apparent
plan of publisher Steve Forbes, who spent $38 million of his own
fortune on an unsuccessful Republican campaign in 1996, to try
again in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   News of Wilson's signing the California primary bill quickened a
few political pulses around the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It moves up the timetable for everything,'' Khachigian said.
``Frankly, planning has to begin Nov. 4,'' the day after next
month's election. &QL;

SCIENTIST SAYS DEVICE WILL HELP PRESERVE TRANSPLANT ORGANS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, Oct. 4)   (EDs: Art available on Wieck database)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TRAVIS E. POLING  
 c.1998 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ More than 3,000 organs destined for transplant
each year end up in the garbage cans of operating rooms. But a
Texas researcher says he and his associates have developed a way to
stop the waste.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1907, live organs removed for transplant have been flushed
out and put on ice. Nine decades later, the medical profession
still uses the same method that allows an organ to remain viable
for transplant for as few as three hours.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Leonid Bunegin of the University of Texas Health Science
Center, along with his business partners in the newly formed
Intravital Technologies LLC, say they have developed
organ-preservation technology that will revolutionize organ
donation and distribution.
</P>
<P>
   The new device will keep hearts, kidneys, livers and other
organs in top transplant form for at least 12 hours.
</P>
<P>
   If the patient waiting for a transplant dies while the organ is
in transit or an organ is the wrong size, there is usually not
enough time to get the tissue to another patient using existing
methods.
</P>
<P>
   ``You throw the organ in the garbage can and send the patient
down to the morgue,'' Bunegin said of how as many as 3,500 U.S.
harvested organs were disposed of in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   What makes the new device tick is ``portable perfusion.''
Bunegin said the LS2000, as the mobile unit has been dubbed, keeps
oxygen-rich fluid moving through the organ from the time it is
taken from the donor until just before transplant.
</P>
<P>
   A similar device, weighing 150 pounds, is used in the operating
room to pump solution and oxygenate the organ immediately before
transplant, but that technology is too bulky for transport.
</P>
<P>
   The prototype LS2000 is about 40 pounds and will be reduced to
about a third of that size by the time it goes into production.
</P>
<P>
   Intravital Technologies, or IVTL, has obtained the marketing and
manufacturing rights to the device from the university's Health
Science Center, which will receive royalties on future sales. IVTL
is seeking about $10 million in venture capital or a line of
credit.
</P>
<P>
   Bunegin, the co-inventor of the LS2000 and a partner in the new
company, said the product could be ready for commercial use about a
year after obtaining the capital.
</P>
<P>
   The management team for the San Antonio company is in place, but
the top executives asked not be named because they are working for
other companies until IVTL gets the money to be fully operational.
</P>
<P>
   IVTL's business plan anticipates about $66 million in annual
sales by 2004.
</P>
<P>
   Although the device has not been tested on human organs, it has
kept comparable-sized animal organs preserved for more than 12
hours with almost no deterioration during transport or after
transplantation.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would be a great leap forward,'' said Bill Teator, an
executive with the United Organ Sharing Network, the organization
that oversees organ transplant distribution for the country.
</P>
<P>
   Heart transplantation would benefit most from the technology
because current methods will only keep a heart viable for
transplant for about three or four hours, Teator said.
</P>
<P>
   Under orders from Health and Human Services Secretary Donna
Shalala, the organ network is rewriting distribution criteria to
ensure that organs go to the sickest patients with the best tissue
match rather than less-sick patients who may be closer to where the
organ is.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that the emphasis on geography instead of medical
judgment is the reason that patients in one part of the country
wait as much as five times longer than patients in other parts of
the country who have the same severity of illness,'' Shalala told a
Senate subcommittee Sept. 10.
</P>
<P>
   Making distribution more equitable, especially with hearts,
means finding the best match and the most dire need for transplant
within a several-state region. But Bunegin and other transplant
industry insiders said the new device would make the system work
nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Mandatory sharing and matching has been done for years with
kidneys, because of the ability to keep them preserved for up to 12
hours, said Joe Nespral, director of clinical services for the
Texas Organ Sharing Alliance in San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   The improved preservation time for other organs will give a
``tremendous advantage'' to transplant patients because the
pre-transplant organ typing _ the testing to find the best
compatibility - will mean longer survival rates for transplant
patients, Nespral said.
</P>
<P>
   Bunegin said future possibilities for the device go beyond large
organs. Eventually, he said, the LS2000 would allow safe transport
of corneas, skin and even veins. He said researchers also would be
able send cultures of cells around the world without damage from
freezing using traditional methods.

 &HT;    PECULIAR TIDBITS REVEALED IN DOCUMENTS RELEASE BY JUDICIARY
COMMITTEE
 &HT;    By ANDREW MOLLISON
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The thousands of pages of documents released Friday
by the House Judiciary Committee contain odd insights into the
peculiarities of life in the nation's capital. Here are some of
them:
</P>
<P>
   LAW TALK. Attorney Harold Ickes, a former Clinton aide, was
asked to tell the grand jury what kind of law practice former
Commerce Secretary Mickey Kantor has. ``Lucrative,'' replied Ickes.
``That's what he says.''
</P>
<P>
   HOBBIES. Glenn Maes, a Navy senior chief petty officer who has
been a presidential steward since the Reagan administration,
revealed during grilling before the grand jury that Clinton relaxes
by fiddling with his collections of medallions, political buttons,
miniature frogs, caps and T-shirts. Prosecutors asked him 12
questions about the frogs.
</P>
<P>
   CANDY. In the small dining room off of the Oval Office, are two
drawers full of M&AMP;M candies. One has plain and the other has
peanuts. There are usually 120 boxes in the drawers.
</P>
<P>
   ETHICS. Linda Tripp taped a phone call last fall in which she
told Monica Lewinsky: ``Most people who are going through what
you've gone through would have said, 'Hey, (deleted) you and the
horse you rode in on and let me call the National Enquirer,' . . .
How did he know that you weren't taping his wacko conversation with
you at 4:00 in the morning?''
</P>
<P>
   CHOCOLATES. According to a written report from Starr's
investigators, Lewis Fox, a uniformed Secret Service policeman who
has since retired to Waynesburg, Pa., watched a White House
photographer take photos of the president with a tour group that
included a new intern, Monica Lewinsky. Fox told her she could get
an autographed copy by submitting a written request. Later, she
thanked him for the tip by sending him a box of Godiva chocolates,
and Fox's fellow workers began to refer to her as ``your girl.''
The investigator described this as ``the chocolate affair.''
</P>
<P>
   MOTHERS. Under a court order, Marcia Lewis, the mother of Monica
Lewinsky, was forced to answer questions like these from Starr's
assistants before the grand jury:
</P>
<P>
   ``You wouldn't remember if your daughter said to you that the
president is only fooling around with me because other girlfriends
were out on furlough?''
</P>
<P>
   ``How did you react when she said that? Your heart must have
fallen out of your chest!''
</P>
<P>
   `` Don't you ask her about it? Don't you talk to her about it?
Don't you say 'Baby, how can I help?' Don't you reach out to her?
Don't you try to support her?''
</P>
<P>
   BREAKDOWN. Right after Monica's mother was asked by an assistant
prosecutor to confirm that ``Babba'' was her family's nicname for
her grandmother, she broke down. One of Starr's employees, who was
sitting outside the grand jury room, filed this report on her exit:
``This writer observed the witness (identified as Marcia Lewis)
crying loudly and exclaiming, 'I can't take it. I can't take any
more. I can't stand it.' The witness was immediately ushered into a
small cloakroom by her attorney, Mr. Billy Martin, who also told
the marshals to summon medical aid. The courthouse nurse arrived in
about five minutes and briefly spoke to Ms. Lewis, who declined to
have her blood pressure taken, and was escorted out of the
courthouse by her attorney, Mr. Martin.''
</P>
<P>
   PAY. Though Monica Lewinsky was paid $36,000 a year at the
Pentagon, she complained to friends in 1997 that she had the same
responsibilities as co-workers who earned $60,000 a year. Vernon
Jordan, a friend of Clinton's for 25 years, helped her get job
interviews in New York and she got an offer from Revlon in January
1998. She amazed Jordan by saying she didn't know whether to take
the job. ``What I remember is that she was happy about the job but
not happy about the salary,'' Jordan told the grand jury. ``I think
she was going to be paid $40,000 and she wanted $60,000 and I think
my conversation with her was that she was not negotiating money,
but she was negotiating opportunity and that this was an
opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   THERAPY. One of Monica Lewinsky's therapists, who had been given
her patient's permission to testify, told the grand jury that
Lewinsky consulted her about two old problems and one new one: her
relationship with her father, the termination of a pregnancy
several years previously, and the deterioration of her relationship
with the president.
</P>
<P>
   DELICACY. In redacting (blotting out) some segments of e-mails
between Lewinsky and her friends, the committee ran across several
uses of an eight-letter word for bovine excrement. Sometimes only
the last four letters were blotted out; other times only the first
four letters were excised.
</P>
<P>
   WHO DID WHAT TO WHOM. New York literary agent Lucianne Goldberg
taped her phone conversations with Linda Tripp. Tripp fired her own
lawyer after he went ``ballistic'' when he learned that Tripp
ignored his advice to stop taping her own phone calls from Maryland
to Monica Lewinsky. An assistant to Starr summed up Goldberg's
testimony this way: ``Tripp gave Goldberg permission to say that
Lewinsky told Tripp that Clinton knew Lewinsky would lie and that
Lewinsky said Tripp should lie.''
</P>
<P>
   LINGO. On March 24, 1998, one of Starr's investigators described
a phone call by saying that a potential witness ``was
telephonically contacted in Tokyo, Japan.''
</P>
<P>
   TAPES. Robert Ferguson, a Secret Service agent who had retired
and moved to Davison, N.C., was asked in July to testify on whether
President Clinton had a taping system similar to the one that led
to the downfall of President Nixon. Ferguson's reply: ``To make
sure I understand it correctly, your question is, does the
president of the United States have the ability to manually or
automatically tape conversations within the Oval Office. Is that
correct sir? To be best of my knowledge, he does not.''

CALIFORNIA STILL DEBATES BILINGUAL EDUCATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By DON TERRY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Bilingual education in California was supposed to
be in a grave by now, essentially killed when residents voted last
spring to end it.
</P>
<P>
   The ballot initiative, supported by 61 percent of the voters,
sought to replace 30 years of using Spanish and other foreign
languages to help immigrant children in the state learn to read,
write and speak English with a method that uses ``nearly all''
English instruction.
</P>
<P>
   But more than a month into the current school term, bilingual
education is clearly still breathing. The reasons are a subject of
hot debate.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the initiative, Proposition 227, assert that
school districts and the education bureaucracy are resisting the
will of the voters, taking advantage of loopholes to preserve a
rejected method of teaching.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the proposition see the bumpy transition as a result
of confusion, reluctance on the part of some parents and teachers
to push children into instruction they are not ready for, and even
basic logistical issues like the lack of textbooks.
</P>
<P>
   What is clear is that the fight over Proposition 227 is not over
yet.
</P>
<P>
   Doug Stone, a spokesman for the state Education Department, said
he had heard of no open defiance of the law and ``when push came to
shove, virtually all of the districts are complying.''
</P>
<P>
   Some do not agree with that assessment.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people are trying to loosely interpret and undermine
this law,'' said Sean Walsh, a spokesman for Gov. Pete Wilson, a
Republican and a critic of bilingual education. ``The law says
`nearly all' should be taught in English. But many districts are
using 40 percent Spanish and 60 percent English.''
</P>
<P>
   The law does not define what ``nearly all'' means, so there is
much disagreement over what constitutes compliance.
</P>
<P>
   Elena Soto-Chapa, the statewide education director for the
Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, which has gone
to court seeking to block the initiative, said that how the
hundreds of school districts across the state defined ``nearly
all'' was ``just all over the spectrum.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Soto-Chapa said some districts were using a 60-40
English-foreign language formula while others were using 70-30 or
80-20. ''There's a lot of confusion,'' she said. ``It's a very
political, murky environment right now.''
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles United School District, with 681,505 students
the second largest in the country behind New York City, offers two
programs for pupils with limited English ability: Model A and Model
B. In Model A, the classes are taught virtually all in English. In
Model B, 65 percent to 70 percent of the classes are taught in
English.
</P>
<P>
   Alice Callaghan, one of the leading proponents of Proposition
227, said ``L.A. is absolutely out of compliance.''
</P>
<P>
   The state Education Department has set up a study group to help
districts implement the law.
</P>
<P>
   ``We realized that before June 2 and after June 2 there would be
more questions than answers,'' Stone said, referring to the day the
initiative was approved. ``But that isn't a sign from heaven that
school districts can thwart the law.''
</P>
<P>
   Out of the 5.5 million public school pupils in California, about
1.4 million have a limited understanding of English, but only 30
percent of them were enrolled in bilingual education programs last
year. The rest were in classes in which teachers used nearly all
English. There were not enough qualified teachers for bilingual
classes.
</P>
<P>
   Under Proposition 227, some parents are eligible to request that
their children be retained in a bilingual program, and such waivers
can be be granted by a school district under three circumstances:
The child has a physical or psychological need to be in bilingual
education, the child is over 10 years old or the child speaks
English.
</P>
<P>
   But the question of waivers is also the subject of intense and
varied interpretation and debate. Before a waiver can be granted, a
child must spend the first 30 days of school in a class taught
primarily in English. That period has now expired for about 25,000
Los Angeles pupils with limited English skills who started the new
year in late summer. Although many expected a wave of request for
waivers, only about 1,300 have been sought so far, said Forrest
Ross, director of language acquisition for the Los Angeles
district.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Soto-Chapa said, ``I think a lot of parents are taking a
wait and see approach,''
</P>
<P>
   At the Logan Street School in Los Angeles, a few blocks from
Dodger Stadium, parents of 250 of the 360 pupils eligible have
asked for and received waivers. Those children are now in bilingual
classes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not trying to circumvent the law,'' said Logan Street's
principal, May Arakaki. ``We're just giving the parents the options
they and their children deserve and are entitled to.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Arakaki and her staff have had to do some fancy juggling.
Mrs. Arakaki had to move three children whose parents signed
waivers into Helen Trevino's second-grade class, which is primarily
bilingual, and move three others into an English-immersion class.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Ms. Trevino has a class of nine bilingual pupils and six
who are taught primarily in English, forcing her to go from table
to table and tongue to tongue. Ideally, the class would be either

 &HT;    NEW IMPEACHMENT EVIDENCE HINTS AT OTHER CLINTON RELATIONSHIPS
 &HT;    770&AMP;adds.
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The House Judiciary Committee released a final
batch of evidence from its impeachment investigation Friday, three
hefty tan volumes that include allegations that President Clinton
had ``close relationships'' with women other than Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   The 4,610 pages of grand jury testimony, FBI interviews and tape
transcripts were provided by Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr as
``supplemental materials'' to his original impeachment referral.
</P>
<P>
   They mainly provide additional details about familiar aspects of
the scandal, including edited transcripts of the phone calls that
Lewinsky's former friend Linda Tripp secretly taped and turned over
to Starr, and the grand jury testimony of many central figures,
including Clinton's secretary Betty Currie and his close friend
Vernon Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   One deposition, however, includes a tantalizing reference to
rumors within the Secret Service that Clinton had trysts with at
least six other women, including White House staffers.
</P>
<P>
   Brent James Chinery, an officer in the uniformed division of the
Secret Service, told Starr's grand jury July 23 that ``we've heard
rumors'' of Clinton having ``a very close relationship'' with at
least six women, and that Lewinsky was simply ``the newest one.''
</P>
<P>
   On one occasion, Chinery said of one relationship, ``I witnessed
it for myself.'' But the pages of his testimony were censored by
the House Judiciary Committee to delete names and the details of
the encounter he claims to have witnessed.
</P>
<P>
   The White House responded to the release of the volumes, coming
just days before the Judiciary Committee is to launch a formal
impeachment inquiry against the president, by accusing Starr of
deliberate bias in his original report.
</P>
<P>
   Gregory Craig, a special counsel to the White House, said
Clinton's legal defense team would give the Judiciary Committee ``a
complete accounting of the pattern of evidentiary manipulation and
misdirection employed by the independent counsel.''
</P>
<P>
   Craig said Friday's evidence shows several instances of such
alleged misconduct, including testimony by Lewinsky, Currie and
Jordan that he said refuted Starr's charge that the president tried
to get Lewinsky a job in order to buy her silence about their White
House affair in 1995 and 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Craig said the evidence also revealed the ``central and
troubling'' role of Tripp.
</P>
<P>
   While Tripp told Starr's grand jury that her relationship with
Lewinsky ``was sisterly and I cared,'' in the edited phone
transcripts Tripp often seems manipulative, trying to get Lewinsky
to acknowledge having had sex with the president and prodding her
to get the president to enlist the well-connected Jordan to get her
a ``kick-ass job.''
</P>
<P>
   Echoing previous testimony from the president, Craig suggested
Clinton could have used a White House job to buy Lewinsky's
silence, but chose not to.
</P>
<P>
   However, White House chief of staff Erskine Bowles told the
grand jury that Clinton had approached him in the ``summer or
fall'' of 1997, after Lewinsky has been transferred to the
Pentagon, and asked him to try to find her a new job at the White
House complex.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan's testified that his efforts on Lewinsky's behalf came in
response to a request from Currie, not the president. And Currie
said of her efforts to help Lewinsky, ``I was doing it on my own.''
</P>
<P>
   Currie's testimony also provided a portrait of a worried Clinton
at the White House on the night of Jan. 18 after learning that The
Washington Post would report the next morning that Starr was
investigating Tripp's allegations of his affair with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Currie, who often acted as a go-between for the president and
Lewinsky, told the grand jury that she was awakened late that night
by a telephone call from the president telling her that ``something
would be in The Washington Post'' and ``it wasn't good.'' Currie
said Clinton asked her to contact Lewinsky and ``see what's
happening.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House secretary paged Lewinsky, using the code name
``K'' that they had previously established. But Lewinsky did not
return the call until the next morning, and then told Currie, ``I
can't talk to you.'' Clinton interpreted that response as advice
the young woman had received from her lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky told prosecutors of having acknowledged to Currie her
relationship with the president. But Currie, in her testimony,
refused to confirm that Lewinsky had told her, ``As long as no one
saw us _ and no one did _ then nothing happened.'' But after being
reminded that she was under oath, Currie said, ``If that was said,
I would have said, 'Stop, stop, I don't want to hear anymore'.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky concluded her testimony to the grand jury with the
observation: ``I hate Linda Tripp.'' And Friday's evidence showed
how their friendship ended so bitterly.
</P>
<P>
   Tripp, at Starr's urging, wore a hidden recording device during
a Jan. 13 lunch with Lewinsky. Playing the role of a sympathetic
counselor, Tripp suggested that Jordan's job-hunting efforts were
in ``his buddy's best interests,'' not hers. She also questioned
Lewinsky about the whereabouts of a dress stained during one of her
sexual encounters with the president. And she pressed Lewinsky
about ``the definition of sex.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Intercourse,'' replied Lewinsky, who had denied having a
sexual relationship with the president in a sworn affidavit in the
Jones lawsuit, which accused the president of sexual harassment
when he was governor of Arkansas. ``I never had intercourse. I did
not have a sexual relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   In his deposition in the Jones lawsuit, Clinton also relied on
such a narrow definition of sex in denying a sexual relationship
with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky told Tripp that she could not ``get him (Clinton) out
of my heart'' and expressed ``fear of my life'' is she were to
disclose her secret relationship with him.
</P>
<P>
   During the lunch with Tripp, Lewinsky said she was being urged
to be untruthful in the Jones lawsuit and offered money to Tripp if
she would also lie. ``I would be indebted to you for life,'' she
told her friend.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Documents released Friday also included grand jury testimony by
White House adviser Sidney Blumenthal, who was compelled to recount
his private talk with the president about Lewinsky after the court
dismissed his claims of executive privilege.
</P>
<P>
   Blumenthal quoted Clinton as telling him that Lewinsky had
``threatened'' him, after making ``a sexual demand on me'' which
was ``rebuffed.'' Blumenthal said Clinton had told him ``she would
tell people they'd had an affair, that she was known as the stalker
among her peers and that she hated it and if she had an affair or
said she had an affair then she wouldn't be the stalker any more.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the testimony, that conversation took place on the
evening of Jan. 21 _ the same day the president had issued his
initial false public denials in the breaking scandal and some hours
after the first lady had told Blumenthal privately that ``the
president ministers to troubled people all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Lindsey, another Clinton confidant, characterized himself
as a frequent ``confidential intermediary between the president and
his private attorneys.'' He refused in his all of his appearances
before the grand jury, including a fourth encounter on Aug. 28,
``to discuss my conversations with the president,'' citing
``attorney-client privilege.''
</P>
<P>
   During its current term, the Supreme Court is due to rule on
White House appeals from lower court decisions that struck all
privilege claims and compelled Lindsey to testify.

 LOS ANGELES: with it.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In one twist, 39 of the nearly 1,000 schools districts in
California _ including Los Angeles, San Diego, Fresno and Oakland _
have requested waivers of some kind to teaching all classes
primarily in English_ whether for individual schools or for entire
districts.
</P>
<P>
   But in August, the state Board of Education, whose 11 members
are appointed by the governor, refused to consider the waiver
requests, saying it did not have the authority to grant them to
districts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The initiative was very clear about waivers,'' said Bill
Lucia, executive director of the state school board. ``And it
doesn't say anything about districtwide waivers.''
</P>
<P>
   After the board refused to hear the requests, the districts of
Oakland, Hayward and Berkeley took the board to court, demanding
that it be forced to do so.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel that bilingual education works and we feel that our
community believes in bilingual education,'' said Sue Piper, a
spokeswoman for the 53,000-pupil Oakland Unified School District.
``That's not to say it's perfect. But our test scores show that the
children who graduate from bilingual education do very well.''
</P>
<P>
   Alameda County Superior Court Judge Henry Needham ruled last
month that the board had to hear the districts' waiter requests.
The board appealed the decision and voted to postpone action on the
requests pending the outcome of the appeal. That could be months,
and in the meantime the districts are required to implement the
proposition.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson had urged the board to appeal Needham's decision, saying
his decision ``could potentially eviscerate Proposition 227.''
</P>
<P>
   Lucia said that some of the board members were also concerned
that they might be sued by proponents of the proposition if they
ruled on the waivers before the issue of the board's authority had
been determined in the appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could require individual board members to get lawyers,'' he
said. ``It's a serious matter. It's a question of losing your
house.''
</P>
<P>
   The initiative says that teachers and administrators who
implement the law improperly can be held liable.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to be suing soon,'' said Ms. Callaghan, a leading
supporter of the proposition. ``We won't let this go on much
longer.''
</P>
<P>
   The threat of lawsuits has also had a chilling effect on
teachers. Hundreds of teachers in Los Angeles signed a petition
last spring pledging open rebellion if Proposition 227 passed. The
teachers vowed to risk being sued and dismissed by continuing to
use bilingual education methods in their classrooms. But so far,
the rebellion has not materialized _ at least not openly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Open defiance would be dismissal, and that was made very clear
to us,'' said Steve Zimmer a member of On Campus, the teachers'
group that organized the pledge of resistance. ``But you certainly
still have defiance. It's just being done behind closed doors.''
</P>
<P>
   Zimmer said that some teachers were simply teaching how they had
always taught immigrant children, using bilingual methods, while
others who otherwise comply with the law were still using a lot of
bilingual methods because they did not yet have the books and other
materials necessary to put the proposition into effect.
</P>
<P>
   ``There aren't enough books,'' he said. ``There are stories
about fourth graders using kindergarten books.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Zimmer said, the majority of teachers are doing their
best to comply with the law.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though we did the pledge,'' he said, ``I can't in good
conscience tell a teacher to let this fail so we can get rid of it.
The efforts of teachers not to damage children is what is making
this work at all.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Callaghan said she received almost daily reports of
widespread non-compliance by teachers and districts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Name me a district that is not defying the law,'' she said.
``There will be less Spanish spoken, but that doesn't mean they
will teach English immersion. The law required that bilingual
education be replaced, not mended. It's going to be a very
unfortunate year.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet at individual schools like Logan Street in Los Angeles, it
is more a year of improvisation, of trying to accommodate and
educate at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   Gloria Rodriguez has two children at Logan, a daughter,
Christina, 8, a third grader, and a son, Gabriel, 9, a fourth
grader. Her daughter began school in bilingual classes but tested
high enough to move into classes taught in English before
Proposition 227 became the law.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Rodriguez signed a waiver for her son. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not ready yet,'' she said. ``My daughter is doing very
well, and I think it is because of bilingual education. When she
goes to college, she wants to learn Japanese and French. That will
be four languages she will know how to speak and write. Employers
will love her.''

 By GRETCHEN MORGENSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ During a rough patch for stocks in general last week,
financial shares in particular took a beating. Though bank and
brokerage stocks rallied Friday with the overall market, most of
these shares remain near their lows for the year.
</P>
<P>
   Investors may be tempted to think that recent market turmoil
makes bargains out of the financials. After all, Bankers Trust is
trading at 1.1 times its book value, down from the 2.4 multiple it
fetched just five months ago. Merrill Lynch trades at 1.73 times
its book value, down from a multiple of 4 in July.
</P>
<P>
   Does Friday's rally mean that the rout in these shares is over?
Bank stocks may have jumped on hopes that Brazil's financial woes
would be stanched by an international bailout. Investors also seem
to think that another interest-rate cut is in the offing.
</P>
<P>
   But optimism on both of these matters is not enough to argue for
a stampede into international financial services shares. There are
solid reasons to hold off from bottom-fishing in the group right
now.
</P>
<P>
   One is the not-unreasonable fear that other bombs from the hedge
fund world might soon drop on the big international banks and
brokerage firms that do business with these risk-takers.
</P>
<P>
   UBS, the world's second-largest bank, said on Friday that its
chairman, Mathis Cabiallavetta, and three top executives had
resigned in the wake of the bank's taking a $696 million charge as
a result of its investment in Long-Term Capital Management.
</P>
<P>
   The bank said the resignations came after internal auditors
found ``shortcomings in risk-management processes.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if Long-Term Capital's near-collapse is the last fund
disaster, the heavy exposure that banks and brokers have to the
fund does not give investors confidence that effective risk
controls are in place at financial firms. The announcement from UBS
confirms that.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas R. Cliggott, head of United States equity market
strategy at J.P. Morgan Securities in New York, is wary of
financial services stocks for other reasons. ``To have confidence
to move back into the group, we'd want to see actual stability _ as
opposed to the hope of stability _ in emerging economies, a
movement toward a more positive yield curve and some
cost-reductions at banks and brokers,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The yield curve is a big factor here. Even though the Federal
Reserve cut interest rates by one-quarter of a point last week,
longer-term rates are still well below the federal funds rate of 5
percent. The 2-year Treasury note closed at a yield of 4.16 percent
on Friday and the 10-year at 4.28 percent.
</P>
<P>
   When long-term interest rates fall below the short-term variety,
profit margins at banks get squeezed. That's because banks are
unable to make as much money in their long-term loans as they can
when shorter rates are lower. So as long as the yield curve remains
flat, as it is today, banks' profitability will be pinched.
</P>
<P>
   Bank earnings may also be hurt by the contraction in credit that
began with the collapse in emerging markets this summer and was
exacerbated by the crash of Long-Term Capital.
</P>
<P>
   Banks seem increasingly unwilling to lend; if this goes on for
long, the loss of fees will harm financial institutions' results.
It will also hurt the overall economy.
</P>
<P>
   How financial stocks fare is significant because, as Cliggott
points out, the fortunes of these companies are inextricably linked
to the performance of the entire stock market. Financial companies
account for almost 17 percent of the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock
index, one of its larger components.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, financial stocks have led the overall market up and down
in each of the last eight years. Recent weakness in these shares
has contributed to stock market malaise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Financial stocks are a wonderful microcosm of the economy,''
Cliggott said. As a result, until they recover, the overall market
might not. For this reason, Cliggott sees the market remaining in a
trading range of 950 to 1,050 on the S&AMP;P 500. For how long? ``Until
we get some confidence about earnings,'' he said.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Appearing last January as the first witness before
the grand jury investigating President Clinton and Monica Lewinsky,
Betty Currie, the president's private secretary, conceded that her
memory about important events ``was getting worse by the minute.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, as the months wore on and Mrs. Currie was recalled
repeatedly to the grand jury, her testimony grew increasingly
forgetful and confused.
</P>
<P>
   Her testimony, disclosed in its entirety on Friday by Congress,
showed that while she never totally disavowed much of her earlier
account _ which seemed to be somewhat damaging to her boss _ she
also did not, in the end, turn into the powerfully incriminating
witness against Clinton that some investigators might have hoped
for.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Currie was an important witness on three central questions
that the investigators spent months exploring, questions that they
ultimately transformed into some of the grounds for the possible
impeachment of the president.
</P>
<P>
   Those questions were:
</P>
<P>
   _ whether Clinton testified truthfully in the Paula Jones
lawsuit when he said he could recall being alone with Ms. Lewinsky
perhaps briefly, but only when she was delivering papers to him in
the Oval Office
</P>
<P>
   _ whether Mrs. Currie's retrieval of a box of presidential gifts
from Ms. Lewinsky last December was an effort by Clinton to keep
them away from Mrs. Jones' lawyers, who had subpoenaed them in
their sexual harassment lawsuit
</P>
<P>
   _ whether Clinton was improperly trying to coach a potential
witness in the Jones suit when he ordered Mrs. Currie into the Oval
Office on a Sunday, the day after his deposition in the Jones
lawsuit, and repeated a series of questions, suggesting the
answers, such as ``We were never alone, right?'' and ``You were
always here when she was here, right?''
</P>
<P>
   The impeachment referral sent by the Whitewater independent
counsel to Congress last month makes clear many instances when Mrs.
Currie's testimony shifted or was confused. But the report cites
other evidence in order to bolster Mrs. Currie's most damaging
testimony to make the case against Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   In the report Mrs. Currie comes across as the person who helped
to arrange the clandestine rendezvous of the president and Ms.
Lewinsky, helping the young intern to avoid the other officials who
were trying to limit her access to the West Wing.
</P>
<P>
   But in her testimony, Mrs. Currie comes across as highly
forgetful, a reluctant witness who has to be repeatedly prodded by
prosecutors and reread old testimony to refresh her memory on
points that she had sworn to in earlier appearances before the
grand jury or interviews with prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   In her first interview with investigators last January, Mrs.
Currie told investigators that sometimes Ms. Lewinsky ``would visit
Clinton alone,'' for 20 to 30 minutes. But by July, she amended her
testimony to say that they were ``never really alone,'' since Mrs.
Currie was always in the outer office.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president, for all intents and purposes, is never alone,''
Mrs. Currie told the grand jurors. ``There's always somebody around
him.''
</P>
<P>
   By her July appearance, Mrs. Currie testified that she had also
forgotten some of her earlier testimony about an Oval Office
encounter she had with Clinton on the day after he was questioned
in the Jones lawsuit. During the meeting, she said, Clinton posed a
series of questions that prosecutors now assert was an attempt to
shade Mrs. Currie's recollection in the event she was called as a
witness.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Currie also appeared to have differing views about Ms.
Lewinsky. On the first day that she was interviewed by a
prosecutor, three days after the investigation became public, she
described the relationship as ``a friendship.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Currie advised Lewinsky was very helpful to Currie when Currie
was dealing with some personal tragedies,'' an investigator wrote
in January. ``Currie advised she had a motherly relationship with
Lewinsky.''
</P>
<P>
   But in her testimony in May, she said that she came to regard
Ms. Lewinsky as ``a pain in the neck'' and ``a little pushy.''

MARKET RALLIES, BUT IT MAY SIGNIFY NOTHING  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ After plunging the last two days, stocks rallied
Friday. But the recovery may be no more than the expected rebound
after a long fall.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Dow Jones industrial average rose 152 points, it
had plunged 448 points on Wednesday and Thursday and ended the week
lower, breaking a three-week rally.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's surge was led mostly by the stocks that had fallen the
previous two days. And the forces that are pushing stocks lower
have not gone away: financial crises abroad, declining earnings
expectations at home and uncertainty about what the United States
and its allies will do to contain the situation.
</P>
<P>
   The selloff on Wednesday and Thursday, according to some
analysts, was prompted by disappointment in the Federal Reserve's
decision to limit its cut in interest rate to a quarter of a
percentage point, instead of a half.
</P>
<P>
   Now some analysts are saying the market rallied Friday on the
expectation of further rate cuts by the central bank.
</P>
<P>
   Alfred Goldman, the director of market analysis at A.G. Edwards
Inc. in St. Louis, had a simpler view. ``The market was oversold
and bargains showed up,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The September employment report, released Friday, showed that
job creation was less than forecast, signaling an economic
slowdown. That report raised expectations for further Fed rate
cuts, which could encourage equity investors because lower
short-term interest rates would help prevent a recession. But the
slowdown in growth could also create more earnings problems in the
short term for American companies, which would be a negative for
equities.
</P>
<P>
   On a day when the stock market rallied, bond prices moved
higher, which also may be a negative. On most days recently, when
the stock market has risen, it has drawn investors out of the bond
market, pushing bond prices lower and their yields, which move in
the opposite direction, higher.
</P>
<P>
   But Friday's bond rally may mean that many investors remain
worried about the economic outlook and skeptical that a stock
market rally can last long enough to be worth joining.
</P>
<P>
   The near-failure of Long-Term Capital Management, the hedge
fund, has caused such nervousness, said Ward McCarthy, a managing
director at Stone &AMP; McCarthy Research Associates in Princeton,
N.J., that some people believe there are only two assets to invest
in: Treasury securities and everything else, which is too risky.
</P>
<P>
   The 30-year bond yield dropped to 4.84 percent Friday, the
lowest for long-term government securities in more than 30 years.
The Dow jumped 152.16 points, or 2 percent, to 7,784.69, while the
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index rose 16.21 points, or 1.6
percent, to 1,002.60.
</P>
<P>
   The market indexes were led higher by stocks like Coca-Cola,
which have recently fallen after warning that their earnings would
be lower than forecast, and by financial stocks, which had been
hurt by fears of the fallout from Long-Term Capital. Coca-Cola rose
2 11/16, to 58 15/16; Citicorp climbed 6}, to 95, and Bankers Trust
finished 2] higher at 57 7/16. Oil stocks also rose.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq index, which is dominated by big technology stocks,
rose 2.65 points, or two-tenths of 1 percent, to 1,614.98. It was
held back by sharp falls in Peoplesoft, which fell 8 3/16, to 24
5/15, and BMC Software, which dropped 6[, to 51~. Peoplesoft makes
software used to track personnel and inventories and is facing
stiff competition in a market that is being hurt by slowing growth.
BMC, a maker of corporate management software, may have been hurt
by fear of fallout from that market.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell index of 2,000 smaller-company stocks fell 0.33
point, or 0.9 percent, to 349.71, indicating that the rally Friday
focused on the bigger-name companies that have drawn investor
attention all year.
</P>
<P>
   One of the big decliners was Monsanto. It plunged almost 15
percent before rallying to close at 52, down 2[, on rumors that the
company's pending acquisition by American Home Products was
collapsing.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said investors had become suspicious of the deal's
closing after American Home Products repeatedly delayed the release
of the deal's proxy statement. American Home Products said Friday
that the acquisition was still on track.
</P>
<P>
   As investors look ahead, the key to the outlook seems to be what
the United States and its allies will do to try to contain the
economic crisis that has toppled Asia and engulfed Russia and now
menaces Latin America. To that end, President Clinton announced a
series of initiatives Friday that coincide with the semiannual
meeting of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Goldman of A.G. Edwards argued that one of the sparks for
Friday's rally was the approval of bank reform legislation in
Japan, a key part of any program to turn around the Japanese
economy.
</P>
<P>
   There are two obvious paths from here. Both seem to be positive
for bonds. One is not good for stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Under the first scenario, there would be more money for the IMF;
a provisional rescue package for wobbling countries in Latin
America, and more international cooperation, reassuring investors
that the contagion can be contained.
</P>
<P>
   Although contained, the economic drag from the recessions in
much of the rest of the world would still force the Fed to lower
interest rates further. That would be good for bonds and could
stabilize stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Alternatively, there would be no rescue package for Latin
America and no new money for the IMF. That would put more pressure
on the Fed to cut rates. This would not be good in the near term
for stocks, as it would encourage fears that the crisis might
spread to Latin America and finally the United States. But a new
flight to safety and prospect of much slower growth here would send
bond prices higher and yields lower.

<P>
   DOBROVODE, Yugoslavia _ For the second day, the thud of
artillery and columns of smoke from burning villages were largely
absent from much of Kosovo Province, leading Western officials to
conclude that President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia had
ordered his troops to halt obvious operations against separatist
rebels.
</P>
<P>
   The eerie calm in places in central Kosovo that had been the
scene of artillery fire, killings and looting just a few days ago
suggested that Milosevic was anxious to fend off military action
that has been threatened by NATO.
</P>
<P>
   But diplomatic observers, who tour the countryside on daily
monitoring missions, said that in the last two weeks Milosevic's
forces had completed punishing offensives against ethnic Albanian
villagers and the rebels they support.
</P>
<P>
   Tens of thousands of ethnic Albanians became refugees in the
period that began with a Serbian offensive in Podujevo, just
northwest of the capital, Pristina, swung around to the Cicavica
Mountains last week and ended among villages west of Suva Reka this
week.
</P>
<P>
   The lack of obvious military action and the sightings of long
convoys of tanks and personnel carriers apparently heading toward
barracks this week still left uncertainties about the status of
Belgrade's military forces, Western diplomats said.
</P>
<P>
   To forge a political settlement in Kosovo, where the Kosovo
Liberation Army is seeking independence from Serbia, Washington has
demanded that Milosevic withdraw the extra army and police units
sent to fight the insurgents. Serbia is the dominant republic of
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Some units of the Serbian interior ministry's police appeared to
have left Kosovo altogether, said the diplomatic observers, who
come from the United States, the European Union and Russia.
</P>
<P>
   There were some ``minor'' movements of tanks and sporadic
gunfire and shooting in some places around Suva Reka Saturday, they
said.
</P>
<P>
   On main roads and dirt tracks from Pristina to the towns of
Mitrovica and onto Klina Friday checkpoints were much freer. Places
that had been sealed by the military were open. Army tanks and
armored personnel carriers were not visible.
</P>
<P>
   In Mitrovice, the ethnic Albanian deputy chairman of the local
branch of the Council for Human Rights in Kosovo, Halid Berani,
said that in the last two days he had received no reports of
shelling and only a few incidents of shooting in the Cicavica
Mountains.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbian police were still in the region, he said. But they
appeared to have established temporary posts and were not on the
move.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the Serbian government declared victory against the
Kosovo Liberation Army, and a group of Serbian paramilitary forces
paraded through Pristina in a convoy of trucks.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, there have been continuing announcements by the
Serbian authorities of the return of various kinds of police units
and army personnel to barracks.
</P>
<P>
   The state-run Yugoslav news agency Tanyug said
``anti-terrorist'' police units returned to their bases on
Wednesday and Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   But the authorities have also stressed that they have the right
to retaliate against any ``terrorist'' attack from the insurgents.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   As well as issuing threats of military force against Milosevic,
Western officials have appealed to him to take measures that would
encourage ethnic Albanian refugees to return to their villages. An
estimated 250,000 ethnic Albanians in Kosovo have been forced from
their homes since March. And up to 50,000 are still in the
outdoors, too intimidated by the presence of the Serbian police
around their villages to go home, relief officials say.
</P>
<P>
   Here in the village of Dobrovode, only one family has dared to
come back. The other houses, burnt and shattered by shells,
remained empty Friday.
</P>
<P>
   On the hill above the center of the village, a family of three
brothers, their wives, 13 children and a grandmother were cleaning
up the debris left in their three-story house from shells that hit
on Aug. 2.
</P>
<P>
   The men of the family refused to give their last name, saying
that as the lone returnees they still felt vulnerable to attack
from the Serbian police.
</P>
<P>
   They had been camping since the attack on the village but
returned Monday, they said, pulling up to the house with a tractor
and large wooden trailer packed with possessions they had
transferred to the forest.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the furniture in the house, built with the proceeds of
money earned by Binak, 38, as a builder in Switzerland, had been
destroyed. The middle floor of the house was burned, and only a few
windows were still intact.
</P>
<P>
   His herd of sheep had been stolen by the Serbian forces and
eaten at their temporary headquarters in the village school, Binak
said.
</P>
<P>
   But the roof of the house was intact, and Binak said he wanted
to restore the rooms before winter.
</P>
<P>
   His return did not signify the end of the conflict in Kosovo, he
said. ``If the war was over,'' he said, ``all the villagers would
be back and normal life would return.''

   WASHINGTON WATCH VOTE CHART Questions regarding this
transmission should be directed to 202-628-3100, ext. 224.
WASHINGTON, Oct. 2 -- The following chart shows how senators and
representatives voted on key bills and amendments within the last
week. A ``Y'' means the member voted for the measure; an ``N''
means the member voted against the measure; a ``?'' means the
member did not vote; and a ``P'' means the member voted
``present.''
</P>
<P>
   SENATE VOTES:
</P>
<P>
   1) BILL NUMBER: ALASKA
</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Thursday approved, 59-38, a measure to build a
27-mile road through a wildlife refuge in Alaska. The measure,
which has been threatened with a presidential veto, would
facilitate access from the remote fishing village of King Cove to
Cold Bay, where there is an airport. Supporters said the $29
million road would make it easier for King Cove residents to get
emergency medical attention. Opponents said building the road may
endanger the environment and sets a bad precedent. A ``yes'' vote
favors the bill.

   HOUSE VOTES:
</P>
<P>
   1) BILL NUMBER: FASTTRACK
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Sept. 25, the House rejected, 180-243, a measure that
would have given the president the authority to negotiate
international trade agreements that could not be amended by
Congress. Supporters said the bill would have opened markets in the
unstable economy. Opponents said the measure would endanger
American jobs and the environment because trade agreements
negotiated through this so-called ``fast-track'' authority could
enable American companies to move their manufacturing facilties to
countries with lower wages or less restrictive pollution
regulations. A ``yes'' vote favors the bill.
</P>
<P>
   2) BILL NUMBER: TAXCUT
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Sept. 26, the House approved, 229-195, an $80
billion tax cut. The Taxpayers Relief Act of 1998 would use 10
percent of the anticipated budget surplus to provide tax breaks for
farmers, small investors and married couples. Supporters said the
tax cuts would return money to the taxpayers and curb ``big
government.'' Opponents said that although they supported the idea
of a large tax cut, they opposed spending money that should be
earmarked for the Social Security Trust Fund. A ``yes'' vote favors
the bill.
</P>
<P>
   3) BILL NUMBER: DEFENSE
</P>
<P>
   The House on Monday approved, 369-43, a $250 billion defense
spending bill that raises salaries of military personnel and
provides funds for anti-missile defenses. Supporters said although
the bill falls $488 million short of the amount the president
requested, it meets the most urgent needs of the Defense
Department. Opponents said there were some provisions, such as ones
calling for the Defense Department to take possession of certain
properties, that were not fully considered and were unnecessary. A
``yes'' vote favors the bill.
</P>
<P>
   4) BILL NUMBER: ENERGY
</P>
<P>
   The House on Monday approved, 389-25, a $21 billion measure to
finance water and energy projects across the country. Supporters
said the bill will continue investments into public infrastructure
and research while at the same time reducing funding for less
productive programs. No one rose in oppositiion to the bill. A
``yes'' vote favors the bill.
</P>
<P>
   5) BILL NUMBER: TREASURY
</P>
<P>
   The House on Thursday rejected, 106-294, a motion to bring a $27
billion spending bill up for debate. The bill would have allocated
funds for the Treasury Department, U.S. Postal Service and several
smaller agencies. Supporters of the motion said it was important to
first debate the bill and then vote on it rather than simply
killing it because of possibly unacceptable provisions. Critics
opposed the motion for different reasons. Some opposed the bill's
provisions to expand federal employees' insurance coverage to
include prescription contraceptives. Democrats also opposed the
bill because it would remove the top two staff members at the
Federal Election Commission by imposing term limits. A ``yes'' vote
favors bringing the bill up for debate.

U.S. CONCERNED BY RUSSIA'S ECONOMIC PROBLEMS, ALBRIGHT SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By STEVEN ERLANGER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The United States is disappointed by the economic
confusion within the new Russian government of Prime Minister
Yevgeny Primakov, said Secretary of State Madeleine Albright on
Friday, and she warned Russia about the dangers of an anti-Western
policy.
</P>
<P>
   In her first comprehensive review of U.S.-Russian relations
since Primakov was confirmed as prime minister last month, Albright
said Washington was ``deeply concerned'' about Russia's direction
and did not think the crisis there would soon abate.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have heard a lot of talk in recent days about printing new
money, indexing wages, imposing price and capital controls and
restoring state management of parts of the economy,'' she told the
U.S.-Russia Business Council in Chicago. ``We can only wonder if
some members of Primakov's team understand the basic arithmetic of
the global economy.''
</P>
<P>
   While praising Primakov, once her counterpart when he was
foreign minister, as a pragmatist able to cooperate on key issues
with Washington, she had harsh words of warning for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our initial reaction to some of the direction he's going in
has not been particularly positive,'' she said, adding, ``The
question now is whether that cooperation can continue.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States must keep up its aid to Russia but is
adjusting it to promote the building of democracy and student
exchanges as well as arms control, Albright said. Washington does
not favor more direct aid.
</P>
<P>
   ``More big bailouts are not by themselves going to restore
investor confidence in Russia,'' she said. ``In the long run, the
gap between Russia's needs and its resources must be met not by
foreign bailouts but by foreign investment.''
</P>
<P>
   Albright sharply criticized as self-defeating the ``many voices
in Russia who want to shift the emphasis in Russia's interaction
with America and our allies from one of partnership to one of
assertiveness, opposition and defiance for its own stake.''
</P>
<P>
   Russia could not stand alone in the world, she said, and the
United States' ability ``to help Russians help themselves will go
from being merely very, very difficult to being absolutely
impossible.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, she said, Washington would not ``assume the
worst, for there are still plenty of people in Russia who will
fight against turning back the clock.'' And she urged the world _
and American critics _ to ``be patient with the workings of the
democratic process in Russia'' and ``not start each day by taking a
census of reformers in the Kremlin,'' a census that American
officials themselves promoted before President Boris Yeltsin
dismissed the previous government.
</P>
<P>
   While Moscow may continue to oppose any NATO use of force
against Serbian forces in the southern province of Kosovo, Albright
said, NATO must be prepared to act regardless.

UCLA STILL SEARCHING FOR ANSWERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The chatter began eight days before a kickoff the
Bruins have waited 57 weeks for _ a kickoff they hope will at once
cleanse their psyches and spark a Rose Bowl charge.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the Cougars, baby,'' one Bruin shouted midway through
practice on Sept. 25.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's go! Remember 37-34,'' another yelled.
</P>
<P>
   No one has forgotten UCLA's three-point loss at Washington
State, a game that both started the 1997 season and ended UCLA's
Rose Bowl dreams. No one has forgotten the miserable defense, the
sputtering offense or the spirited second-half comeback. And
certainly, no one has forgotten the failed fourth-and-1 attempt
from Washington State's 1.
</P>
<P>
   But a few seconds into today's rematch at the Rose Bowl, they
will have.
</P>
<P>
   ``The (revenge) only lasts for the opening kickoff,'' UCLA
quarterback Cade McNown said. ``It's all talk. Emotions never carry
a team. You have to know what to do and execute.''
</P>
<P>
   Do they? Can they? No one knows. Because of their late start and
the canceled game at Miami, the Bruins have played just twice;
that's two fewer games than everyone in the Pac-10, save
Washington. For all their gaudy numbers _ a 12-game winning streak,
a No.4 national ranking, 46 points per game _ the Bruins have just
as many questions today as they did a month ago, most of them
regarding the young defense.
</P>
<P>
   With five October games, including critical matchups against
Arizona and Oregon, the Bruins don't have time to tinker. Any
chance for experimenting was blown away by Hurricane Georges.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure about the team,'' coach Bob Toledo said. ``We had
a real good first half against Texas, then went through the
motions. Then we had a so-so first half (against Houston). We're
2-0, but I don't have a good grasp.''
</P>
<P>
   More a pop quiz than final exam, Washington State (3-1, 0-1)
should provide moderate resistance. The Cougars have gorged on Big
Sky competition and failed to generate much offense last week at
California. Like UCLA, they are young, having lost 16 starters from
the Rose Bowl roster, including, of course, quarterback Ryan Leaf.
</P>
<P>
   The Cougars defense may pose a greater obstacle for McNown than
either Texas or Houston. Fast and aggressive, it leads the Pac-10
in total defense, it's second in run defense, and it has allowed
just one touchdown pass while intercepting nine.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins may not need 40 points to win, however. Wazu
quarterbacks Steve Birnbaum and Paul Mencke are struggling, and
that's good news for UCLA's revamped defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can only get better from where we are,'' free safety Larry
Atkins said. ``We've made the changes, and now we have to play with
them. At least we had that practice time to make sure everybody got
their assignments down.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins are three-touchdown favorites, but there is precedent
for an upset. They haven't been ranked this high since ascending to
No.1 in October '88. That lasted two weeks, until a shocking loss
to Washington State at the Rose Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Cougars coach Mike Price was at Weber State at the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember crying as I watched it, I was so happy for
(ex-Cougars coach) Dennis Erickson,'' Price said. ``We had a night
game, and I was in the basement watching. I was so happy. It was a
great, great game.''
</P>
<P>
   Note: XTRA-AM (1150), UCLA's flagship station, will have a giant
card for injured receiver Freddie Mitchell available for public
signatures in the food zone (area H) before kickoff.

 EX-INTERN DESCRIBED AS PERSISTENT `CLUTCH'
 &HT;    (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS BLACK  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton described Monica S. Lewinsky as
``a good girl'' during his grand jury testimony, but some members
of his staff found her exasperating. She hung around the West Wing
and failed to do her job, according to depositions and grand jury
testimony released Friday by the House Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; ``She was what we used to call a clutch and ... she was always
some place she shouldn't be,'' testified Evelyn Lieberman, the
deputy chief of staff.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman, an enforcer of discipline in the West Wing, defined
``clutch'' as ``a slightly derisive term'' for someone who hovered
around the president or top staffers. ``She was not that unusual,''
recalled Lieberman. ``She was unusual in that she was persistent.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman ordered Lewinsky, a former intern, out of the White
House after repeatedly discovering her in places other than her
work station and after learning that Lewinsky and a co-worker
responsible for answering correspondence from Capitol Hill had not
done their work. Piles of unanswered letters, some more than six
months old, were found in the office. Both women lost their White
House jobs in the legislative correspondence office.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman, questioned as part of independent counsel Kenneth W.
Starr's investigation of Clinton, said, ``an intern who was caught
by me, I would never see again.''
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutor asked: ``Except for Monica Lewinsky?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' replied Lieberman.
</P>
<P>
   But Lieberman said Lewinsky was an insignificant figure in the
White House. ``As a matter of fact, I didn't know her name,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the White House staff members who did remember her were
male, and they all remembered the same thing: She wore tight,
revealing clothing and was flirtatious.
</P>
<P>
   ``She liked to talk, talk a lot,'' said Bayant Nelvis, the White
House steward whom Lewinsky befriended. Lewinsky gave him four
neckties. He gave her souvenirs and White House M&AMP;M's.
</P>
<P>
   ``She likes candies,'' he said. ``She was very friendly.''
</P>
<P>
   Another who took notice of her was Patrick J. Griffin, who ran
the president's lobbying shop for awhile. He said he tried to
counsel the young woman.
</P>
<P>
   He described her as ``a little too eager and effervescent'' and
advised her that her dresses were too short and her blouses too
tight. He testified that he felt sorry for her because she was
overweight and self-conscious about it. He counseled Lewinsky to
``chill'' and not try to draw attention to herself.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Pape, a Secret Service agent who monitored the White
House gate that Lewinsky used for visits after her transfer to the
Pentagon, had a less than flattering recollection.
</P>
<P>
   ``I specifically made notes of two times that I dealt with
her,'' he testified, ``specifically because she ... was a pain.''

THE WEIGHT OF THE WORLD ON THE U.S. AND EUROPE  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, OCT. 4) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By KENNETH N. GILPIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   More than a year ago, when what is now looking very much like a
global financial crisis was primarily an Asian phenomenon, the
conventional wisdom was that Europe and the United States were
strong enough economically to help the world ride out the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, that was before Russia's default eviscerated Latin
America's ability to borrow. It was before Long Term Capital
cratered. And it was before companies started to acknowledge, as
Northern Telecom did last week, that sales on the continent would
likely not meet expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Robert D. Hormats, vice chairman of Goldman Sachs International
who was an assistant secretary of State for economic and business
affairs in the Reagan administration, spent some time last week
talking about Europe, and whether the twin-pillar theory of global
stability was still operative. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Q. (italics)European markets got creamed last week. Are things
starting to unravel, or was Europe due for a correction?(end
italics) &QL; 
 &QL; 
A. Europe's markets have performed extremely well over the last
couple of years, and for a variety of reasons.
</P>
<P>
   First, European Monetary Union has cemented things together.
Many countries have benefited from falling interest rates. And many
countries are undergoing the kind of industrial restructuring that
took place in the United States during the late 1980s and early
1990s. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Q. (italics)Many European economies were moribund in the early
1990s. The last few years have been better. What about 1999?(end
italics) &QL; 
 &QL; 
A. European economies will grow around 3 percent this year,
following a 2.5 percent rate of increase in 1997. We think there
will be some weakening next year, but the growth will be marginally
higher than in the United States. A drop in net exports won't help,
but domestic demand in Europe will be enough to offset much of
that.
</P>
<P>
   The fundamentals of Europe's economy and currency are pretty
sound. Europe's real challenge is to address the structural
problems of its social safety net, which is very expensive to
maintain. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Q. (italics)Last week the Federal Reserve cut interest rates. The
Germans have said they have no intention of following the Fed's
lead. Is that likely to change when the European Central Bank
swings into action next year?(end italics) &QL; 
 &QL; 
A. With inflation running at a little over 1 percent this year, and
just a bit more in 1999, there probably is room to lower interest
rates. But the new central bank probably won't cut rates. Over
time, if the international situation worsens and if growth in this
country falls, then it clearly will put more pressure on the
European Central Bank to lower rates. But I don't think they will
move quickly. I think they will need to see a real weakening in
order books before they do. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Q. (italics)In light of all the turmoil, is now a dangerous time to
move to a common currency?(end italics) &QL; 
 &QL; 
A. Not at all. If this crisis had occurred 10 years ago, there
would have been a great deal of volatility among European
currenices. EMU has been a stabilizing force for their currencies,
particularly the southern European countries'. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Q. (italics)Do you see any evidence of a credit crunch in
Europe?(end italics) &QL; 
 &QL; 
A. There are not many signs of a credit contraction yet, but it is
an interesting dimension to consider. When the Asian crisis began,
the general view was that it would have an effect by reducing
exports. That has been true. But so many investors have lost money
in general that it has created an enormous aversion to risk and
pumped up premiums in the safest assets. That is where the concern
about a slowdown in this country, and to a degree in Europe, is
going to be focused for some time. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Q. (italics)The Clinton administration is having an enormously hard
time getting Congress to approve an $18 billion increase for the
International Monetary Fund. Are Europeans worried about the
consequences if that package doesn't pass?(end italics) &QL; 
 &QL; 
A. The view I pick up is that few in Europe are happy with the IMF,
either. But they are beginning to worry about America's leadership
capability, and a vote against this would signal that the
administration and the Congress can't agree on much of anything,
particularly on something as important to international financial
markets. But the negative symbolism would be almost as important as
the loss of the money. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Q. (italics)Do you still subscribe to the notion that Europe and
the United States can carry the rest of the world through this?(end
italics) &QL; 
 &QL; 
A. The United States and Europe can grow at reasonable rates, but
the risks are clearly on the downside. Therefore, there is more
dependence on central banks than previously, because fiscal policy
doesn't move quickly enough; they will be shouldering the bulk of
the responsibility for sustaining growth over the next few
quarters. If there is an expectation that Europe or the United
States will slump into recession, that will add to the problems in
the emerging markets.

SO FAR, `MEDICARE PLUS CHOICE' IS MINUS MOST OF THE OPTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill., Mass., N.M.)   (For release Sunday, Oct. 4)  
(js) 
 By MILT FREUDENHEIM   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   John Regan, a retired Bell Atlantic employee, wanted to join a
health maintenance organization near his home in Centerville,
Mass., on Cape Cod. But the HMO said no _ he lived in the wrong zip
code.
</P>
<P>
   ``The health care field today is a very confusing one,'' Regan
said.
</P>
<P>
   For people in Medicare, that is an understatement. Congress
decided last year to make over the program, the government
insurance plan for 38 million elderly and disabled Americans. As
part of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, private insurance
companies, hospitals and groups of doctors were invited to offer an
array of new types of taxpayer-financed health coverage.
</P>
<P>
   The revised program, called Medicare Plus Choice, was to start
taking shape this fall. But with only a handful of exceptions,
Medicare options have not changed. Additionally, by last Thursday,
the day before the deadline for HMOs to say whether they would
participate in Medicare, existing Medicare HMOs had announced that
they were exiting more than 300 counties around the country,
forcing an estimated 200,000 elderly people to seek new
arrangements.
</P>
<P>
   Scrambling to explain choices that barely exist, government
officials will mail bulletins or handbooks early next month to
millions of people who, not surprisingly, often have little
understanding of the thicket of rules that already govern Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   The new law portends ``mass confusion,'' said Geri Dallek, a
health care researcher at George Washington University.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is this choice or is it chaos?'' she asked.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy-Ann Min DeParle, head of the Health Care Financing
Administration, the agency that runs Medicare, said she ``never
expected that there would be a lot of new plans this year.''
</P>
<P>
   She added: ``For the first time, we're going to educate
beneficiaries about what is out there. We will make them aware of
the choices they already have.''
</P>
<P>
   Standing pat may be the best policy, many health care experts
say. As the government's mailing says, ``If you are happy with the
way you receive your Medicare benefits now, you don't have to do
anything.''
</P>
<P>
   But even consumers who stay on the sidelines are likely to be
upset. In many parts of the country, Medicare HMOs are raising
charges and paring benefits. The entire Medicare program is being
squeezed between government budget balancers holding down payments
on one side and medical costs rising on the other.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of our clients already have fewer choices and much higher
out-of-pocket health care costs,'' said Diane Archer, executive
director of the Medicare Rights Center, a nonprofit consumer
advocacy group based in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   The cost pressures are pushing up premiums for 10 million people
who supplement their traditional fee-for-service Medicare with
private Medigap policies _ insurance that fills some gaps in
government payments for care. And they are clouding the future of
extra benefits offered by Medicare HMOs, which until recently were
adding about 1 million members a year.
</P>
<P>
   The legislated changes were an attempt by Congress and the
Clinton administration to give Medicare consumers a variety of
health care options like those available to the under-65
population. Policy makers were also hoping to help restore
Medicare's fiscal health: in its latest warning, the administration
estimated in April that the program could run out of money by 2008.
</P>
<P>
   But the new options will actually add $2.5 billion over five
years to Medicare costs, the Congressional Budget Office said,
because younger, healthier beneficiaries are likely to congregate
in the new Medicare-financed options, leaving traditional
fee-for-service Medicare to bear a heavy burden of sicker, older
people who tend to dislike taking chances on losing access to
familiar doctors. Most of the savings in the period will come from
provisions in the 1997 law holding down annual increases in some
fee-for-service Medicare payments. Additionally, premiums paid by
beneficiaries for nonhospital Medicare coverage will rise, starting
next year. The net savings through 2002 should total $112 billion,
the budget office said.
</P>
<P>
   The law also imposed new requirements on the 347 existing
Medicare health maintenance organizations. Those not already doing
so must start providing preventive services, like flu shots, and
all will have to collect data to assess members' health.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, Medicare payments will be adjusted to reflect the
balance of healthy and sickly members in each health plan. But for
now, HMOs must provide the added services at their own expense.
</P>
<P>
   In the new law, Congress established five new Medicare options:
</P>
<P>
   _ HMOs sponsored by medical groups or hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   _ Point-of-service HMOs, which typically let members visit
doctors outside an HMO's network when pre-approved and for an extra
charge.
</P>
<P>
   _ Preferred provider organizations, which offer incentives to go
to certain doctors and hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   _ Government-financed medical savings accounts for people who
feel healthy and prosperous enough to gamble on a high-deductible
policy.
</P>
<P>
   _ A private fee-for-service arrangement that would let patients
use their own money to pay up to 15 percent above Medicare fees for
all services. Well-off patients would get access to celebrity
doctors who had pushed heavily for a loophole in traditional
Medicare fee schedules, which forbid extra charges to patients.
</P>
<P>
   So far the Health Care Financing Administration has received
just two applications for any of the new plans: one from an HMO
sponsored by the St. Joseph Health System in Albuquerque, N.M., and
one from a preferred provider organization, which the agency
declined to name. Neither has yet been approved.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the insurance companies, hospitals and doctors who had
lobbied to get into Medicare apparently had second thoughts when
they studied the new law and gauged the chill of rising medical
costs that are outdistancing Medicare payments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody came to the party,'' said David Helms, a senior health
care consultant at DuPont , the diversified chemical company based
in Wilmington, Del. Some 90,000 retired DuPont employees and their
spouses are eligible for Medicare.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, no one has stepped forward to set up Medicare medical
savings accounts, which had been promoted by some insurance
companies as a potential cure-all for the anticipated crisis in
Medicare finances.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates argued that people who bought high-deductible
insurance would be careful about demanding health care, because
they would be paying with their own money.
</P>
<P>
   But in a test that began before Congress authorized the accounts
for Medicare participants, insurers had a difficult time selling
the policies to healthy young people, let alone cautious elderly
Americans. Golden Rule Insurance Co., based in Lawrenceville, Ill.,
which lobbied hard for the idea, has sold only about 50,000
policies.
</P>
<P>
   Insurance executives complain that restrictions imposed by
Congress when the accounts were introduced last year _ for example,
they could be sold only to self-employed people or workers in small
companies _ have made them difficult to market. Regulations
implementing the Medicare option are even more onerous, they say,
requiring expensive investments in systems to gather data about
customers.
</P>
<P>
   They also require companies to offer the high-deductible
policies at the same rates to everyone in a county, from healthy
65-year-olds to ailing 90-year-olds, whose medical bills would
quickly eat through a deductible.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way the regulations are being written is making demands
that insurance companies would not normally be in a position to
fulfill,'' said Jeff Burman, a vice president of Guarantee Trust
Life Insurance Co. The insurer, based in Glenview, Ill., decided to
delay offering medical savings accounts in the hope that Congress
will ease the requirements next year.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, most hospitals and medical groups are resisting the
government's invitation to sponsor their own HMOs. They worry that
HMO companies would boycott hospitals and doctors that did so,
seeing them as competitors.
</P>
<P>
   There may also be fundamental flaws in the economics of such
HMOs. The best hospitals, for example, would be most likely to
attract the sickest, most expensive Medicare patients, while
drawing fewer healthy members who would help spread the costs.
</P>
<P>
   And the provider groups would also have to make new investments
in computer systems, marketing, claims administration and tracking
the quality of care. ``Congress required that provider-sponsored
organizations would have to become insurance companies,'' said Mark
Skubic, a vice president of Healthsystem Minnesota, a nonprofit
network that includes a hospital, groups of doctors and the big
Park Nicollet Clinic in Minneapolis. ``That is not in our
interest.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Healthsystem Minnesota is seriously considering whether
it should even continue its money-losing contract to treat patients
who belong to Medicare HMOs, Skubic said.
</P>
<P>
   Like other providers, Healthsystem Minnesota is reeling from a
decision by Medicare officials to limit increases in managed-care
payments to 2 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
   Congress had asked the Health Care Financing Administration to
adopt a system of payments that better reflects differences in
costs _ raising reimbursements in cities like Minneapolis, where
health costs have been held down, and making up the increases by
cutting back on annual rises in payments in high-cost markets like
New York and South Florida. But Congress also authorized the 2
percent increases for all Medicare HMOs as well as a special
increase for rural areas, which used up all the available money.
</P>
<P>
   The adjustments in payments that Congress has ordered have been
put off until 2000, according to the Health Care Financing
Administration. That was terrible news for Healthsystem Minnesota.
Facing double-digit increases in costs, it will lose $1,000 on each
of the 2,000 people in its HMO contract, Skubic said.
</P>
<P>
   Numbers like those have dissuaded most providers from setting up
the new managed-care programs envisioned by the 1997 law.
</P>
<P>
   Crozer-Keystone Health System, a five-hospital, nonprofit group
based in suburban Philadelphia, is one of a handful of providers
operating an HMO under a Medicare trial run. Officials there say
the group views the plan as a link in a chain that already includes
primary care doctors, a preventive care center, social programs for
the elderly and special Alzheimer's care.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not an immediate slam-dunk win in terms of
profitability,'' said John McMeekin, president of Crozer-Keystone,
who has a knack for understatement. He expects to lose $3 million
on the project this year and next, but hopes it will turn a profit
in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, about one in six Medicare beneficiaries has joined
an HMO. In places where government payment rates reflect the
historically high costs of fee-for-service medicine, some HMOs have
offered plans that cost enrollees no extra but provide generous
coverage of prescription drugs, an item not covered by traditional
Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   Now, some plans are shutting down in states and rural areas
where federal payments to HMOs are low. For members of these plans,
Medicare Plus Choice means fewer choices, as they will have to
either switch to another health plan, if one is available, or
return to traditional Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   Those affected include 59,000 people in Medicare plans run by
United Healthcare, &UR;  &LR; 58,000 in those run by Aetna U.S. Healthcare
and 33,500 in Humana plans in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   The managed-care industry recently asked the Health Care
Financing Administration to immediately permit HMOs to raise
premiums and other costs they pass along to their members. But Ms.
DeParle said she did not think that would be appreciated by
Medicare beneficiaries.
</P>
<P>
   Next year, the American Association of Health Plans, the
managed-care industry's trade group, plans to request changes in
government Medicare payments. Karen Ignagni, president of the
association, said that in some parts of the country, government
payments to Medicare HMO plans were falling well below those for
traditional fee-for-service Medicare. ``Many plans may have to cut
benefits, raise premiums or both,'' she said in a statement to a
national commission created by Congress to consider the future of
Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   For most elderly Americans who have stayed in traditional
Medicare _ and who do not receive health benefits from former
employers _ the struggle has been to pay rising monthly premiums
for Medigap insurance. These policies offer 10 levels of coverage
for Medicare deductibles and other charges, at varying monthly
premiums. The premiums range from $48 to $825 a month, according to
a recent survey by Consumer Reports magazine.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot afford a supplemental policy,'' said Christina
Morgan of Okanogan, Wash., who retired with $10,000 in a lump sum
from the bank where she had worked and whose Medicare HMO is now
withdrawing from her rural community. ``A lot of people who are
living on Social Security alone are in the same boat.''
</P>
<P>
   Insurance experts say Medigap costs are soaring partly because
of the loss of healthier policyholders to HMOs. ``Our enrollees are
a little older, a little less healthy,'' said Robert Hussey, a vice
president of United Healthcare, which provides Medigap coverage to
2.5 million members of the American Association of Retired Persons.
</P>
<P>
   United raised premiums 12.5 percent this year in the AARP plan
and is requesting 9 percent increases for 1999. Other insurers have
imposed similar increases.
</P>
<P>
   Marilyn Moon, a Medicare researcher at the Urban Institute, a
Washington research center, said increases in Medigap premiums may
drive more Medicare participants into HMO plans. Another option is
to buy a recently introduced type of Medigap policy that costs less
if a person uses certain hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   Besides retirees, probably no group has a bigger stake in
Medicare changes than the companies that subsidize supplemental
health care benefits for 13 million retired workers. And they are
using the opening provided by Washington's efforts to encourage
retirees to consider Medicare HMOs, which can save the companies
huge amounts of money.
</P>
<P>
   But the closing of some Medicare HMOs has left some employers
scrambling. Allied Signal, for example, was ``put in a bind'' last
month when Aetna announced shutdowns of Medicare HMOs in which
Allied had 800 retirees.
</P>
<P>
   The company rushed to seek replacement HMOs that would take its
retirees and as many of their doctors as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Though most employers are woefully unprepared for an avalanche
of inquiries _ more than half the 498 companies in a recent survey
by the William M. Mercer consulting firm said they had not
considered how to respond _ Allied Signal is moving vigorously to
help 100,000 retirees understand the new Medicare choices. The
company has scheduled 110 retiree meetings this fall, drafted an
explanatory booklet and hired a consultant to field questions on a
telephone hot line.
</P>
<P>
   General Motors, Bell Atlantic and DuPont are taking similar
steps.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not something we want to just step back from and let
the buyer beware,'' said Bruce Bradley, director of managed care
plans at GM. ``It's very easy for people to make a decision not in
their interest by just responding to the marketing.''

SALINAS' BANKROLL MUCH GREATER, MEXICO SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JULIA PRESTON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Even in Mexico, where people are used to hearing
that politicians have fat bank accounts, Swiss police caused a stir
when they announced three years ago that Raul Salinas de Gortari,
the brother of the former president, had about $100 million in
secret Swiss bank accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Now Mexican investigators say that his fortune is even heftier.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican federal prosecutors disclosed Friday that they are
investigating 289 bank accounts in Mexico, the United States and
Europe controlled by Salinas or his accountants, with deposits
totaling $119 million. Those funds are separate from the Swiss
accounts, the investigators said.
</P>
<P>
   The Mexican government had also earlier seized an account in
Britain holding $23.5 million. In addition, investigations have
turned up 123 properties that the authorities say belonged to
Salinas, from homes to horse ranches, including 37 outside Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   No new charges were brought Friday against Salinas, who has been
formally accused of graft when he was a government employee, and
homicide in the 1994 murder of a politician, Jose Francisco Ruiz
Massieu. Nor did the investigators disclose what they believe may
be the origin of the funds. No narcotics or drug money-laundering
charges have been brought against Salinas in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   But the police and prosecutors in Switzerland are preparing a
civil drug money-laundering case against Salinas, the older brother
of former President Carlos Salinas de Gortari, in an effort to
seize his funds there. In a secret 369-page report on their
inquiry, Swiss police investigators asserted that ``a cautious
estimate'' of the money Raul Salinas earned from drug traffickers
during the 10 years before his arrest would be ``a total of at
least $500 million.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Swiss investigators also acknowledged that they gathered
``sometimes precise and sometimes less precise information
concerning the amounts of the drug money given to Raul Salinas.''
</P>
<P>
   Salinas, who has been confined since February 1995 to a maximum
security prison near Mexico City even though he has not been
convicted of any crime, adamantly denies that he had any dealings
with drug traffickers.
</P>
<P>
   His lawyer, Eduardo Luengo Creel, called the Swiss police report
``a fantasy.'' He insisted that all of his client's money in Swiss
accounts was of legitimate provenance and had been contributed by
prominent businessmen who were building an investment fund to be
run by Salinas.
</P>
<P>
   Luengo called the figures released Friday by Mexico's attorney
general ``truly inconceivable,'' adding, ``They simply don't check
at all with the audits we have done of Salinas' assets.''
</P>
<P>
   Mexican prosecutors have created confusion in the past over bank
account totals by listing only deposits without calculating
withdrawals. Salinas used a number of international bank accounts
that were simply conduits, where large amounts of money were
deposited and withdrawn every day, his lawyers said.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Luis Ramos Rivera, the top prosecutor in Salinas' case,
said investigators came upon a trove of new financial information
about Salinas after his chief accountant, Juan Manuel Gomez
Gutierrez, jumped bail and disappeared in July.
</P>
<P>
   Police searched 25 homes and offices in Mexico City and the
northern city of Chihuahua linked to Gomez, and found computer
disks and documents with information on at least 70 bank accounts
that the authorities had not known about.
</P>
<P>
   Ramos said Gomez had operated a network of front companies and
had issued false loans through a foreign ``tax paradise,'' which
Ramos declined to identify, to conceal millions of dollars in
transactions.

 &HT;    Wright brothers film soars with help of supercomputer effects
 &HT;    By John Keilman
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Imagine if Wilbur and Orville Wright had tackled the problem of
flight without lugging hundreds of pounds of wood and canvas to the
wind-blasted dunes of North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   What if, instead, they plopped down in a lab and run their
theories through $500 million, 21st century supercomputers.
Creating the world's first airplane would have taken, what, three
minutes?
</P>
<P>
   That fanciful notion is the subject of a short, digitally
animated film by Charles Abruzzino, a multimedia wizard at the
Wright-Patterson Air Force Base supercomputing center.
</P>
<P>
   Using the same technology that gave birth to Toy Story and the
special effects in Titanic, Abruzzino is creating a virtual world
where Orville and Wilbur are the stars.
</P>
<P>
   The 3-minute sequence shows the Wrights' glider twisting through
the skies of Kitty Hawk and crashing into a sand hill. It then
shows the brothers correcting their design problems at a drafting
table, which slowly morphs into the state-of-the-art system
Abruzzino uses.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is to demonstrate how the Wrights might have worked had
they lived in the information age _ and to show off the firepower
of the base's supercomputing center.
</P>
<P>
   Its heart is a large room filled with dozens of wardrobe-sized
machines. Together, they have the power of 700,000 PCs (a figure
that will triple after a January upgrade). More than 600
researchers nationwide are linked to the center by an exclusive
super-fast network.
</P>
<P>
   Abruzzino's lab includes a system known as ImmersaDesk, which
hooks a computer to a 4-foot by 5-foot monitor. Slip on a pair of
special glasses, and you can view images in startlingly vivid 3-D.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force has used the system to conduct virtual wind tunnel
tests on wings and fuselages, and to determine how aircraft would
react to enemy fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``It saves the government a lot of money because you can do a
lot of preliminary research this way,'' Abruzzino said.
</P>
<P>
   The Wright brothers did much of their planning work with pencil
and paper. They developed the principle of wing warping by twisting
a cardboard box. They built dozens of tiny wing shapes and tested
them in a homemade wind tunnel to determine which would work best.
</P>
<P>
   Abruzzino's film, on the other hand, shows the Wright brothers
wearing 3-D glasses, manipulating images and data with a mouse-like
wand.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the ImmersaDesk, they wouldn't have had to go to Kitty
Hawk and put up with the expense and the travel and the
mosquitoes,'' he said. ``They could have done it right here in
Dayton.''
</P>
<P>
   That might take away from the romance of the two humble bicycle
mechanics who conquered the air with little more than their wits
and few old tools. But one expert thinks the brothers would have
jumped at the chance to play with microchips.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you have to understand with them is that they were
cutting-edge guys. They were engineering geniuses who saw the world
differently than other people,'' said Tom Crouch, a Wright scholar
at the Smithsonian Institution.
</P>
<P>
   ``So sure, I think they would have been fascinated.''

 &HT;    Clinton's ratings climb to record highs in Georgia
 &HT;    By Ken Foskett
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Despite an impeachment inquiry hanging and
turbulent world financial markets, President Clinton's job approval
ratings continue to climb to new record highs in Georgia, according
to an Atlanta Journal-Constitution/WSB-TV2 poll of 616 registered
voters.
</P>
<P>
   The survey, conducted Sept. 26 to 29, also contained good news
for House Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.). Nearly half of Georgia
voters _ 49 percent _ now have a favorable view of Gingrich,
compared with one-third who felt that way in 1996. Two years ago,
Gingrich's negative ratings were 54 percent; now they are 36
percent.
</P>
<P>
   The poll suggests that both Gingrich and Clinton may be
benefiting from the positive view voters have of life in Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Three-quarters of those surveyed said Georgia is on the right
track, a more than two-fold increase since 1991. The poll's margin
of error is plus or minus four percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   Among Georgians, Clinton's job approval rating of 58 percent, up
from its lowest point in recent history, 39 percent in October
1994, is potentially good news for the Democrats, some of whom have
expressed concern over how Clinton's relationship with Monica
Lewinsky and potential impeachment hearings may affect voter
turnout.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly three-quarters of likely voters said that independent
counsel Ken Starr's investigation into Clinton's affair will have
no impact on which party they will support in November. Twelve
percent said the scandal made them more likely to vote Democratic
and 14 percent said they were more likely to vote Republican.
</P>
<P>
   The poll also asked registered voters what effect, if any, the
Starr investigation has had on their likelihood of voting at all in
this election. Almost one in four said the Starr investigation
would make them more likely to vote, with 27 percent of those
saying they would vote Republican and 20 percent saying they would
vote Democratic.
</P>
<P>
   The poll may offer slight evidence to back the claims of Rep.
John Linder (R-Ga.) and other Republicans who say the president's
problems have energized Republican voters, but those energized
voters do not appear as abundant as was widely predicted.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's job approval numbers in Georgia mirror recent national
polls, which in itself is a turnaround for the president.
Historically, Clinton has polled lower in Georgia than the rest of
the country. A Washington Post/ABC News poll conducted Sept. 25 to
28 found that 57 percent of likely voters approved of his job
performance.
</P>
<P>
   In Georgia, Clinton polled highest among black voters, with 93
percent giving him good marks. Just over half of white voters
polled said they disapproved of Clinton's job performance.
</P>
<P>
   The poll also showed pronounced gender differences as well.
Sixty-one percent of women said they approved of Clinton's
performance. The figure was 54 percent for men.
</P>
<P>
   Less than a third of Republican voters approved of the way
Clinton was handling his job, but two-thirds of swing voters --
voters who vote either Republican or Democrat -- gave the president
good marks.
</P>
<P>
   While Gingrich's numbers are up from two years ago, the
newspaper's poll suggests that the speaker continues to have
problems among women and minorities.
</P>
<P>
   While 57 percent of men had a favorable impression of Gingrich,
only 39 percent of women and 11 percent of blacks shared the same
view.
</P>
<P>
   Connie Morris, one poll participant from Colbert, Ga., said she
thought Gingrich had overcome his political problems, while the
president had not. In 1997, Gingrich was fined $300,000 for giving
misleading statements to to the House Ethics Committee regarding
his use of a political action committee.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich ``stepped forward and said I made a mistake and he was
willing to pay the price,'' Morris said. As for Clinton, Morris
said, ``I don't think there is a person alive who is caught in the
same situation who wouldn't initially say 'I didn't do that.' But
he could have gained a lot of respect in my mind if he had asked
for forgiveness in a manner that made it seem he was really sorry
for what he had done.''

 By JAMES BENNET

<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ In a cocoon of loyal and wealthy supporters,
President Clinton said Friday that he must ``live with the
consequences'' of his mistakes, although he contended that
Democrats should take pride in the achievements of his presidency
and take heart from its possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has stopped apologizing for his conduct with Monica
Lewinsky, but he has taken to making glancing, at times humble,
references to it, before moving on to attack the Republican
Congress as indifferent to Americans' needs. He did so Friday at a
series of fund-raisers.
</P>
<P>
   In one deft sentence, he acknowledged his personal pain while
claiming credit for the country's economic strength, making a
compact appeal for both sympathy and support in an appearance
earlier in the day in Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   After thanking the gathered donors for the ``very kind personal
things'' they had said to him, the president declared, ``If I had
to do it all over again, every day, I would do it in a heartbeat,
to see America where it is today as compared to six years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   As the applause died away, Clinton continued, ``I want you to
understand, too, that we all have to live with the consequences of
our mistakes in life.'' He added with a chuckle: ``Most of us don't
have to live with it in quite such a public way. But nobody gets
out of life for free.''
</P>
<P>
   To the music of a saxophone and a hammered dulcimer, Clinton
raised about $200,000 over lunch in a private home in Cleveland for
the Democratic Senate candidate in Ohio, Mary Boyle. Then he flew
to Philadelphia to raise half a million dollars for the Democratic
Party.
</P>
<P>
   By midsummer, the president's aides were delighted to have
persuaded him to condense his fund-raising remarks to just 10
minutes of policy points and partisan jabbing. But as his troubles
have grown and the mid-term elections have approached, his
free-form remarks have become longer. In Cleveland on Friday, he
spoke for 26 minutes and here on Friday evening he spoke for almost
20 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   These fund-raising visits have fallen into a pattern since
Clinton's videotaped grand jury testimony on Aug. 17. He is lauded,
applauded and embraced by his hosts and the donors. ``Mr.
President, these are your friends here today,'' said Tony George,
the host of the Cleveland event, offering the refrain of those who
have played a similar role.
</P>
<P>
   But in Cleveland as elsewhere, protesters who were scattered
along the president's motorcade route were reminders of calls for
his resignation and impeachment, and of the mockery some are
heaping upon his presidency.
</P>
<P>
   At a rally for the president outside city hall here Friday night
a group of Teamsters chanted, ``two more years.'' Clinton's
motorcade route was lined downtown with hundreds of people, some of
them carrying supportive or condemnatory signs. After an impromptu
shopping trip, during which he was greeted with shouts of ``We love
you,'' Clinton told some donors at the beginning of an impassioned
reprise of his Cleveland speech: ``I didn't even mind the
protesters, that's the American way.'' But, he added, he preferred
it when they were in the minority, ``and that seemed to be the
case.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   As he rode into Cleveland, Clinton passed a billboard for a
local radio station, WNCX. ``Lovin', touchin', squeezin','' it
read, the words superimposed on a cartoon of the president with his
arm over Ms. Lewinsky's shoulders, the Washington Monument beside
them.
</P>
<P>
   The president left it to his aides on Friday to respond directly
to the latest gusher of grand jury disclosures in Washington.
Instead, in his remarks, Clinton spoke with pride of his record and
with urgency about addressing the international economic crisis and
the needs of struggling farmers and schoolchildren. As he typically
does now before such partisan audiences, he also walked through his
political calculation for the mid-term elections.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said in Cleveland that Republicans had bragged privately
to him about their prospects. ``They tell me, `Oh, we're going to
do very well, Mr. President, in these mid-terms because we have so
much more money than you do,''' and because Democrats who turned
out to re-elect Clinton would not return to the polls in an
off-year.
</P>
<P>
   That argument, of course, would also insulate Clinton from any
blame for depressing the Democratic vote.
</P>
<P>
   But he often goes further than that, saying that his predicament
could actually help the Democrats. Lower-income Democratic voters,
he said, might not bother to vote in a typical election. ``The
people that were good enough to serve you here at this event today,
they've got a lot of hassles in their life,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But, he said, ``adversity is our friend,'' because it can
overcome apathy and ``focus us on what is at issue here.''
</P>
<P>
   What should be at issue, Clinton said, are his achievements and
agenda and the Republicans' record, which he described harshly.
``What have they done?'' he asked in Cleveland. ``They killed the
minimum wage increase for 12 million Americans. They killed
campaign finance reform. They killed the tobacco reform
legislation.''

<P>
   CLEVELAND _ Wrapping his own woes inside America's prosperity,
President Clinton said Friday he is glad he ran for office just to
see the United States where it is today.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton renewed his campaign for cash in Ohio and later in
Pennsylvania, raising money for Democrats facing an uphill
challenge this year because of the scandal surrounding his
extramarital affair.
</P>
<P>
   The president also chided Republicans for hoping the Monica
Lewinsky scandal depresses the turnout of Democratic voters. He
suggested the adversity may help the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me say I can't thank you enough, a lot of you who came by
and said hello to me earlier, for the very kind personal things you
said to me and, through me, to my wife. But, I want you to
understand something very clearly. If I had to do it all over
again, every day, I'd do it in a heartbeat to see America where it
is today as compared to six years ago,'' Clinton told contributors
to Mary Boyle, the Democratic candidate for Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want you to understand, too, that we all have to live with
the consequences of our mistakes in life. Most of us don't have to
live with it quite such a public way, but nobody gets out of this
life for free, nobody does,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton made no reference to the House Judiciary Committee's
decision to make public the secret documents from independent
counsel Kenneth Starr's grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   ``Adversity is our friend; complacency is our enemy,'' Clinton
told the contributors. He said Republicans think they will win
because they have more money, because these are midterm elections
and because Democrats won't show up at the polls.
</P>
<P>
   ``Adversity is our friend because it will focus us one what is
at issue here,'' Clinton maintained.
</P>
<P>
   Boyle is seeking to replace Sen. John Glenn, the first man to
orbit the Earth, who's making a return trip to space as a senior
citizen this fall. Republican George Voinovich, the Ohio governor,
is leading the race.
</P>
<P>
   Boyle made no direct reference to Clinton's political or
personal problems. Instead, she focused on issues, saying ``family
matters in Ohio'' and praising Clinton for putting education on the
national agenda.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm proud to have your support,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The president's appearance helped Boyle raise $100,000-$200,000.
He later traveled to Philadelphia where he helped the Democratic
Party raise $500,000 at two events.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton continued his new practice of remaining in the
presidential cocoon, venturing out only for fund-raising events and
tightly controlled appearances in public. So far in this election
season the president has not attended one public rally on behalf of
a candidate, limiting himself instead to fund-raising events and
``impromptu'' stops in friendly environs.
</P>
<P>
   In Cleveland, Clinton stopped by an Irish diner called
Kathleen's Kitchen where Boyle's supporters greeted him with
welcoming signs. Clinton talked with customers and staff before
leaving.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really appreciate what you have done for us. No other
American president has done what you have done,'' waiter Tom Roche
told Clinton, referring to the president's peace efforts on behalf
of Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   In Philadelphia, the president went shopping for first lady
Hillary Rodham Clinton and onlookers at the mall shouted words of
encouragement and support. Clinton later told Democratic
contributors, ``I was so moved by the things people said to me
today I didn't even mind the protesters.''
</P>
<P>
   Protesters calling for his resignation have dogged him for
weeks. &QL;

PENN STATE IS BIG TEST FOR OHIO STATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK BLAUDSCHUN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBUS, Ohio _ Listen to the words and you wonder why Penn
State is even here, why it has bothered to show up for what has
become one of the Big Ten's most anticipated matchups each year.
</P>
<P>
   Can Penn State beat Ohio State? No way, many say, which seems
pretty outrageous since the Nittany Lions are the seventh-ranked
team in the country and should have at least a chance at the No. 1
Buckeyes Saturday afternoon in Ohio Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  But listen to what Penn State coach Joe Paterno has to say
about the Buckeyes. ``They're going to move the football, they're
going to score points,'' said Paterno. ``The only thing we can do
is try to make sure the points they score are not easy ones and
that we don't make mistakes when we have the football.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  And consider the words of Nittany Lions linebacker LaVar
Arlington. ``We're going to have to play our hearts out to slow
them down,'' he said. ``They have a high-powered offense. We're
going to have to play over our heads.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  On paper, it all makes sense. The Buckeyes (3-0) have
averaged 39 points and 531 yards per game. From quarterback Joe
Germaine to tailback Michael Wiley to linebacker Andy Katzenmoyer,
Ohio State's star power is overwhelming and intimidating.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; ``We know they're good,'' said Paterno, who has brought his
young team to this point without a blemish (3-0), but without a
gut-check game. ``We'll see how good we are.''
</P>
<P>
   The answer will come quickly enough. Ohio State has proven,
among other things, that it can score quickly and turn the momentum
of a game around even quicker.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Take the Missouri game two weeks ago. The Buckeyes trailed the
Tigers at halftime, 14-13. Final score: Ohio State, 35-14, thanks
to a series of dazzling plays that changed the nature of the game
in a heartbeat.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; ``That's us, big plays,'' said Ohio State fullback Matt
Keller. ``I think that's what separates us from a lot of teams. We
pride ourselves on making the big play. That's what makes our
offense.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Not that they need it, but the Buckeyes should be further
motivated by last year's 31-27 come-from-behind victory by the
Nittany Lions, creating a situation that could be every bit as one
sided as Penn State seems to fear.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; If there is hope for the Lions, it lies with the genius of
Paterno, who is a master at preparing teams when he has the luxury
of an off week. Penn State has won each of the last four seasons
coming off an off week.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; But Ohio State also had last week off and John Cooper has
proven he's pretty good at X's and O's, too, especially when the
opponent isn't Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; If the Buckeyes can get past Penn State, the road to the
Michigan game Nov. 21 should be as smooth as a newly paved highway.
There's not a ranked team on their schedule.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  Yet, as we've seen time after time, most recently on Thursday
night when Syracuse was ambushed by North Carolina State, nothing
can be counted on as a given this season.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Penn State will have to play over its head to beat the
Buckeyes. And Ohio State should win, probably easily, but the Lions
make it clear that they will show up for the game.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; ``Ohio State, you're playing the No. 1 team in the country,''
said Penn State linebacker Brandon Short. ``You can't have a bigger
test than that.''

 &HT;    TAPES SHOW TRIPP AND LEWINSKY RELATIONSHIP
 &HT;    740&AMP;adds. With IMPEACH.
 &HT;    By BOB DART
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ They were unlikely girlfriends _ a sex-obsessed,
self-absorbed twentysomething from Beverly Hills 90210, and a
prudish, chain-smoking bureaucrat and divorced mom nearly twice her
age _ but they found a lot to talk about.
</P>
<P>
   In hours of phone conversations, Monica Lewinsky poured out her
heart about her dying affair with President Clinton while Linda
Tripp clucked sympathetically, asked all the right questions and
secretly reduced their strange, symbiotic relationship to the tapes
that would shake the world.
</P>
<P>
   In hundreds of pages of edited tape transcriptions released
Friday by Congress, neither woman comes across as a friend to
cherish. Lewinsky prattles on and on about her problems, rarely
pausing to inquire about Tripp's life. But only Tripp knows their
talk is being recorded, and she is only too willing to listen and
sometimes to manipulate.
</P>
<P>
   Tripp is encouraging, for instance, when Lewinsky lets her hear
a sexy audiotape she is considering sending to Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's so cute already,'' said Tripp. ``I love your voice. You
have a great voice.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky asks her to listen to more.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're so good at it. No wonder he likes phone sex with you,''
said Tripp. ``You're just like a little Marilyn Monroe vixen. ... I
know in my wildest dreams, I could never have phone sex.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh yes you could,'' said Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``No I couldn't,'' said Tripp. ``I would laugh.''
</P>
<P>
   (Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   They both laugh, however, when Lewinsky jokes she's going ask
Clinton on the tape, ``Hey baby, why don't you come over and show
me those distinguishing characteristics?''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the two women share laughter and tears on the tapes _
and seem to genuinely like each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``Linda, if I ever want to have an affair with a married man
again _ especially if he's the president _ please shoot me,''
Lewinsky moans in one conversation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone who cares about you, Monica, wants you out of this
mess,'' advises Tripp.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he wants you out of this mess and doesn't know how to
do it,'' said Tripp.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know. Everybody does,'' said Lewinsky. ``If he could just be
nice to me. Why can't he just say, 'Look. Go enjoy your life and in
three years, we'll get married.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh you don't want much,'' laughs Tripp.
</P>
<P>
   (End optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   They shared girl talk. Tripp, now 45, complained about a
haircut. Lewinsky, now 25, expressed hopes of getting fixed up with
Matt Lauer. ``He's so cute,'' she said. ``Is he Jewish?'' asked
Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   They worried about their weight. But with the clarity of
hindsight, it is easy to find ulterior motives when Tripp presses
Lewinsky not to send the infamous semen-stained blue Gap dress to
the cleaners so she can wear it on Thanksgiving.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now all I would say to you is: I know how you feel today and I
know why you feel the way you do today, but you have a very long
life ahead of you and I don't know what's going to happen to you.
Neither do you,'' said Tripp. ``I would rather that you have this
in your possession if you need it years from now.''
</P>
<P>
   ``So why can't I scratch that crap off and put it in a plastic
bag,'' wonders Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't scratch it off. You would have to use a Q-tip,''
advised Tripp, adding that she would want her own daughter to keep
the dress.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could be your only insurance policy down the road,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Tripp describes their friendship as ``sisterly,'' but it is
considerably more complex. Sometimes the older woman seems
star-struck by her young colleague at the Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know it's so weird having grown up in L.A. and gone to
Beverly High?'' said Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' said Tripp.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are all these people now on TV that went to my high
school.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Come on,'' said Tripp as Lewinsky lists former classmates now
appearing in sitcoms and soap operas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a nobody. A working stiff,'' whines Tripp in one
conversation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who knows a lot,'' said Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``Huh?''
</P>
<P>
   ``There are three kinds of people in this administration: peons,
peons who know stuff and FOBs,'' said Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   At times, Tripp is shocked at their difference in sexual mores.
</P>
<P>
   ``You mean it's less personal to give a (deleted) job than to
have intercourse?'' Tripp asks in one discussion that began with
Lewinsky unable to remember the name of a man she slept with.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really depends,'' said Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I'm getting an education late in life,'' marvels Tripp.
</P>
<P>
   Only once does Tripp tire of hearing Lewinsky talk about her
troubled relationship with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Share this sick situation with one of your other friends,''
Tripp says in a 1997 e-mail. ``Frankly, I'm past nauseated about
the whole thing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I will respect that,'' Lewinsky e-mails in reply. ``I would
only like to ask that I have your assurance everything I have
shared with you remains between us.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course by then, Tripp had already told literary agent
Lucianne Goldberg about the affair, and Lewinsky had told her
mother and several friends.
</P>
<P>
   The ban was short-lived, of course, and the two women were
talking about the affair and its aftermath right up until last
January, when Tripp wore a ``body wire'' to tape Lewinsky moments
before Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr's investigators stepped
in.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   On that final tape, Lewinsky urged Tripp not to reveal her
relationship with Clinton if Tripp were called to testify in the
Paula Jones sexual harassment suit. But Tripp maintained she would
tell the truth.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard for me to understand how you could want to do that
to me,'' said Lewinsky. ``I mean, you are hurting one person.
...You will help Paula Jones and you will hurt me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not here to help Paula Jones,'' said Tripp. ``You know
that.''
</P>
<P>
   In actuality, Tripp had earlier talked to one of Jones's lawyers
on the phone moments after hanging up with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is very sad and the girl will deny it to her dying breath.
Um, she is very, very angry with him because of the way he's
handling this, but she would rather martyr herself in a way rather
than expose him,'' Tripp told the attorney. ``I feel strongly that
the behavior has to stop, um, or should at least be exposed.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In any event, just so you're aware, if I am asked the right
questions, I will not lie,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Lewinsky reveals much about herself on the tapes,
but Tripp remains a mystery.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe things happen for a reason, although I have yet to
figure out why this happened,'' said Tripp.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't figure it out,'' said Lewinsky. ``Nothing really good
has come of it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe it's so that you can tell your grandchildren you had an
affair with the you-know-what of the you-know-what.''

   ECON-REPORT (Undated) _ The economy added jobs at a
slower-than-expected pace during September, and the unemployment
rate rose to 4.6 percent from 4.5 percent in August as factories
and builders slashed jobs. September's job growth was the weakest
since payrolls fell by 48,000 jobs in January 1996, and the
unemployment rate was the highest since March, when it was 4.7
percent. In a separate report, the government says that factory
orders rose 0.9 percent in August. And the University of Michigan
says its index of consumer sentiment stood at 100.9 at the end of
September, up from 100.4 early in the month. By Sylvia Nasar.

began his climb to fame in the mid-1930s. Although he later owned

the notion of fighting one drug with another is still being

effectiveness in stopping heroin use has been endorsed by no less
than the National Institutes of Health. But as the White House drug
policy director, Gen. Barry McCaffrey, spoke this week of making
methadone more available, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani continued to
insist that abstinence, not methadone, is the only solution for
heroin addicts. Saying he wants to abolish the city's methadone
clinics, the mayor derides methadone as no better than heroin. By

   WASHINGTON WATCH VOTE CHART Questions regarding this
transmission should be directed to 202-628-3100, ext. 224.
WASHINGTON, Oct. 2 -- The following chart shows how senators and
representatives voted on key bills and amendments within the last
week. A ``Y'' means the member voted for the measure; an ``N''
means the member voted against the measure; a ``?'' means the
member did not vote; and a ``P'' means the member voted
``present.''
</P>
<P>
   SENATE VOTES:
</P>
<P>
   1) BILL NUMBER: ALASKA
</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Thursday approved, 59-38, a measure to bulid a
27-mile road through a wildlife refuge in Alaska. The measure,
which has been threatened with a presidential veto, would
facilitate access from the remote fishing village of King Cove to
Cold Bay, where there is an airport. Supporters said the $29
million road would make it easier for King Cove residents to get
emergency medical attention. Opponents said building the road may
endanger the environment and sets a bad precedent. A ``yes'' vote
favors the bill.

   HOUSE VOTES:
</P>
<P>
   1) BILL NUMBER: FASTTRACK
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Sept. 25, the House rejected, 180-243, a measure that
would have given the president the authority to negotiate
international trade agreements that could not be amended by
Congress. Supporters said the bill would have opened markets in the
unstable economy. Opponents said the measure would endanger
American jobs and the environment because trade agreements
negotiated through this so-called ``fast-track'' authority could
enable American companies to move their manufacturing facilties to
countries with lower wages or less restrictive pollution
regulations. A ``yes'' vote favors the bill.
</P>
<P>
   2) BILL NUMBER: TAXCUT
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Sept. 26, the House approved, 229-195, an $80
billion tax cut. The Taxpayers Relief Act of 1998 would use 10
percent of the anticipated budget surplus to provide tax breaks for
farmers, small investors and married couples. Supporters said the
tax cuts would return money to the taxpayers and curb ``big
government.'' Opponents said that although they supported the idea
of a large tax cut, they opposed spending money that should be
earmarked for the Social Security Trust Fund. A ``yes'' vote favors
the bill.
</P>
<P>
   3) BILL NUMBER: DEFENSE
</P>
<P>
   The House on Monday approved, 369-43, a $250 billion defense
spending bill that raises salaries of military personnel and
provides funds for anti-missile defenses. Supporters said although
the bill falls $488 million short of the amount the president
requested, it meets the most urgent needs of the Defense
Department. Opponents said there were some provisions, such as ones
calling for the Defense Department to take possession of certain
properties, that were not fully considered and were unnecessary. A
``yes'' vote favors the bill.
</P>
<P>
   4) BILL NUMBER: ENERGY
</P>
<P>
   The House on Monday approved, 389-25, a $21 billion measure to
finance water and energy projects across the country. Supporters
said the bill will continue investments into public infrastructure
and research while at the same time reducing funding for less
productive programs. No one rose in oppositiion to the bill. A
``yes'' vote favors the bill.
</P>
<P>
   5) BILL NUMBER: TREASURY
</P>
<P>
   The House on Thursday rejected, 106-294, a motion to bring a $27
billion spending bill up for debate. The bill would have allocated
funds for the Treasury Department, U.S. Postal Service and several
smaller agencies. Supporters of the motion said it was important to
first debate the bill and then vote on it rather than simply
killing it because of possibly unacceptable provisions. Critics
opposed the motion for different reasons. Some opposed the bill's
provisions to expand federal employees' insurance coverage to
include prescription contraceptives. Democrats also opposed the
bill because it would remove the top two staff members at the
Federal Election Commission by imposing term limits. A ``yes'' vote
favors bringing the bill up for debate.

 By R.W. APPLE Jr.   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ More than nine months ago, on Jan. 13, 1998, as
Linda Tripp was preparing to surreptitiously record a conversation
with Monica Lewinsky at a hotel in the Virginia suburbs, a member
of the independent counsel's staff explained the purpose of the
enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   The counsel, Kenneth Starr, was ``conducting this recording with
your assistance to assist its investigation of possible obstruction
of justice by Vernon Jordan and/or others,'' Mrs. Tripp was told by
the staff member.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Jordan ``and/or others'' were already suspected by Starr of
having found jobs for former Associate Attorney General Webster
Hubbell as a payoff for his silence in the Whitewater
investigation. Now Starr was trying to find out if an effort had
been made to buy off Ms. Lewinsky _ was there a pattern here?
</P>
<P>
   In effect, Jordan was the bridge on which Starr crossed from the
Arkansas-based Whitewater matter to the Lewinsky affair in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Millions of dollars and hundred of witnesses later, after the
release of Starr's report to Congress and two immense batches of
documents, there is no definitive answer to the question.
Certainly, Jordan _ assisted, according to testimony, by some White
House aides including John Podesta, Marsha Scott and Betty Currie _
looked for a job for Ms. Lewinsky in New York. They found her one,
though it was withdrawn when the news of the scandal broke.
</P>
<P>
   But nowhere in the thousands of pages of documents is there
unambiguous evidence of an unambiguous quid pro quo. Nowhere is
there unambiguous evidence that the job was sought to persuade Ms.
Lewinsky to lie, which would amount to the subornation of perjury.
There are only hints, conflicting stories, partial views of
reality, and circumstances that slide about in the mind.
</P>
<P>
   In such a murky situation, a legislator unfriendly to President
Clinton _ a Republican, say _ could reasonably argue that Jordan,
the president's friend, would only have gone to such great lengths
if he had reason to believe he was silencing a mortal threat. But a
Democrat friendly to Clinton might just as well conclude that
Jordan was only attempting to spare the president further bother
from an unstable woman by getting her out of town.
</P>
<P>
   The subornation charge looked a little shaky to outsiders when
it was listed in Starr's report. The documents, the last of which
were released Friday, do little or nothing to build a stronger
evidentiary scaffold under it.
</P>
<P>
   At one point in their taped conversation, a transcript of which
was part of Friday's batch of documents, Ms. Lewinsky advises Mrs.
Tripp that people are telling her, ``It doesn't matter what anybody
says _ you just deny it.'' The people involved are not specified.
At another point, Ms. Lewinsky quotes Jordan as telling her she
would not go to jail for perjury in a civil suit such as the Paula
Jones case, in which she had been called as a witness.
</P>
<P>
   But in the first batch of documents, released earlier, Ms.
Lewinsky stated flatly that no one had asked her to lie to the jury
in the Jones case.
</P>
<P>
   And so the Lewinsky controversy has come to focus mainly _ some
would say almost exclusively _ upon statements made about
consensual sexual acts.
</P>
<P>
   The nation is in for more hair-splitting and more defining of
terms, for it will be in Clinton's interest to muddy the waters
here as well.
</P>
<P>
   Were the president's statements merely misleading and incomplete
and wrong, as he has said, or were they lies? If lies, did they
rise to the legal definition of perjury, which involves intent? If
perjury, did they constitute grounds for impeachment? Those
questions, more or less, have been before the public for weeks;
soon the debate will be formally joined on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   In Friday's documents, the most vivid picture is that of Ms.
Lewinsky trying her level best to persuade Mrs. Tripp to lie along
with her. She offers Mrs. Tripp her interest in an Australian
condominium as an inducement.
</P>
<P>
   The most potentially persuasive evidence of an intention to
obstruct justice may be the trip of Mrs. Currie, the president's
secretary, to pick up presents Clinton had given Ms. Lewinsky. In
his own testimony to the Starr grand jury, Clinton said he was
unconcerned about the presents. So did Mrs. Currie decide on her
own that they needed to be retrieved? If not, who sent her?
</P>
<P>
   Those questions were not answered definitively by the documents,
either.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Clinton's new spokesman, Joe Lockhart, said Friday that the
release of Friday's documents was part of ``a partisan process
designed for partisan gain.'' But it was hard, on first reading, to
see much gain for anyone.
</P>
<P>
   Next week the House Judiciary Committee will vote on whether to
launch an open-ended impeachment inquiry sponsored by the
Republicans. With a 21-16 majority, the Republicans are all but
certain to get what they want, not only in the committee but also
when the House as a whole votes, probably a few days later. Up to
50 Democrats are expected to vote with the Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   The president's lawyers contended Friday night in a memorandum
that Congress was about to embark on a proceeding that violates due
process, because the offenses charged have not been specified
before the inquiry begins. They argued as well that ``nothing in
the Starr referral is remotely sufficient to warrant an impeachment
inquiry.''
</P>
<P>
   But they appear already to have lost that argument in the House.
No doubt echoes of the competing contentions will be heard during
the foreshortened campaign leading up to the Nov. 3 midterm
elections. The outcome of the elections could have a large impact
on what comes next: Big Republican gains would embolden Clinton's
foes, but if the Democrats hold their own, the House may have
second thoughts as it debates articles of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone from Rep. Henry Hyde of Illinois, the Judiciary
Committee chairman, to the president's lawyers will talk legal
talk. But politics will count at least as much.
</P>
<P>
   Impeachment is so fundamental an act, an act that would undo the
only choice that the American people make in common, that of a
president. So it is inevitable and perhaps proper, as Alexander
Hamilton wrote, that the process ``will enlist all their
animosities, partialities, influence and interest'' _ even if many
of them insist that they are already sick of the subject.

PROUST DEBUTS IN COMIC BOOKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ALAN RIDING   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ It has already happened to Victor Hugo, Dumas, Balzac,
Flaubert and other French literary greats, so why shouldn't Marcel
Proust also have his masterpiece, ``Remembrance of Things Past,''
turned into a comic strip?
</P>
<P>
   After all, argues its adapter and illustrator, Stephane Heuet,
Proust may be considered a giant of modern French letters, but who
actually reads his immense semiautobiographical novel these days?
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, when you say `Madeleine,' people will say Proust and
they're proud of it,'' Heuet said, referring to the famous little
cake that set off Proust's flood of memories and reflections that
would eventually fill 12 volumes. ``But that's all the Proust they
know. Proust has been kept in a ghetto of snobs as a sort of
precious gold and diamond object. For me, any effort to democratize
Proust is valid.''
</P>
<P>
   So, after several years of research and preparation, Heuet, a
41-year-old advertising executive, has published ``Combray''
(Editions Delcourt), the first of what he hopes will be a dozen or
so 70-page comic strip volumes of ``A la Recherche du Temps
Perdu,'' as Proust's most famous work is known in French. The first
printing of 12,000 copies of the $15 large-size, hard-cover comic
book sold out in three weeks; a further 8,000 copies are now being
printed.
</P>
<P>
   Yet if Heuet sounds a tad defensive about his enterprise, it is
because the critical response to the book has been mixed _ and when
it has been negative, it has been very negative.
</P>
<P>
   ``It Is Marcel Who Is Assassinated'' was the headline on a
review in the conservative daily Le Figaro by Herve de
Saint-Hilaire, who went on to describe the book with a lexicon of
epithets including ``prodigiously inane,'' ``cruel,''
``catastrophic,'' ``blasphemous'' and quite simply ``horrible.''
</P>
<P>
   Saint-Hilaire's complaints ranged from Heuet's drawings of such
legendary characters as the maid Francoise, the intimidatingly
elegant Madame de Guermantes and the author as a child (``a
formless little boy with idiotic eyes'') to his selection of
Proust's text and the dialogue he adapts to include with the
illustrations, notably the newly famous phrase that Proust never
wrote: ``Tiens! Une madeleine?'' The reviewer also became exercised
about the ``ding, ding'' of the dinner bell and the ``dong, dong''
of the church bells, although they are in fact the only sound
effects provided.
</P>
<P>
   Le Monde, which might be expected to issue the ultimate
intellectual verdict on ``Combray,'' has not yet spoken, although
the left-of-center daily Liberation sounded less indignant than
patronizing when it spoke of the author's ``disarming innocence.''
It urged readers to choose Proust's original, but conceded that
this was an acceptable comic strip, albeit likely to have less
impact on the history of comic strips than Proust did on
literature.
</P>
<P>
   As it happens, Proust's own impact was slow in being felt. Born
into a wealthy Parisian family in 1871, he suffered frequent ill
health as a child and, after a busy social life as a young man, he
spent the last 15 years of his life, before his death in 1922, in
relative seclusion. In 1913, he had to pay Editions Grasset to
publish ``Swann's Way,'' the first of the volumes of ``Remembrance
of Things Past,'' and few copies were sold. Six years later, the
next volume, ``Within a Budding Grove,'' won the coveted Goncourt
Prize, but it also sold poorly. Several other volumes were
published after his death.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it was not until the 1950s that Proust was suddenly
transformed into a literary icon with the publication of his
complete works in the prestigious Pleiade collection of Editions
Gallimard in 1954. Since then, millions of copies of different
volumes of the series have been sold, with ``Swann's Way'' at the
top of the list. Today, however, only about 15,000 copies of
``Swann's Way'' are sold in France each year, and Heuet's comic
strip may well exceed that number in the coming weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The choice of a comic strip format is not that surprising.
France is the home of perhaps the most successful comic strip
character ever, Asterix, whose 30 books of stories have sold close
to 300 million copies worldwide. Last year, sales of comic books in
France exceeded $50 million, with a Culture Ministry poll in 1997
estimating that every French person reads an average of 14 comic
books per year. And, interestingly, a third of sales are to adults.
Indeed, everything from Hugo's great novel ``Les Miserables'' to
Dumas' ``Count of Monte Cristo'' has appeared as comic strips.
</P>
<P>
   Heuet said that when he first read ``Remembrance of Things
Past'' just six years ago, he was immediately struck by the book's
visual content and its comic strip potential. ``Proust was almost
an Impressionist painter,'' he said. ``He thought and wrote in
images. `Remembrance' is an extraordinary fresco of high society in
France during the Belle Epoque, and a comic strip permits the
reconstitution of this past without resort to a Hollywood budget.''
</P>
<P>
   Before starting work on the illustrations, he said, he re-read
the entire book 14 times, gradually identifying passages that would
preserve its sense of narrative. He researched extensively,
collecting photographs and spending time in Proust's childhood home
at Illiers outside Paris (which is called Combray in the book). He
even won backing for the project from the Society of Friends of
Marcel Proust and from Nathalie Mauriac, Proust's great-grandniece,
who is the heir to the author's literary rights.
</P>
<P>
   With the exception of surprisingly few ``balloons'' of dialogue,
Proust's own words are used throughout, which means there are far
more long sentences in ``Combray'' than in most comic strips. The
absence of dialogue and action even raises the question whether the
book is little more than an illustrated summary of ``Remembrance of
Things Past.'' But Heuet responded that action works better in film
while his illustrations support the text. ``My only crime is not to
have shown what Proust wanted us to imagine, but what he saw and
described,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Heuet said that ``Combray'' (the name of the first part included
in ``Swann's Way'') is aimed primarily at people who have not read
Proust, but he believes that people who read his work as students
can also profit since they frequently retain little beyond vague
sentiments and impressions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone says Proust is a genius, that his every word
counts,'' Heuet went on, ``but in practice they mix everything up.
I don't say read my book instead of Proust, but it is a way into
Proust. I hope people go on to read Proust thanks to the comic
strip. In fact, it's more than a hope. It's an order!''

 &HT;    Impeachment inquiry prepared by House Judiciary Committee
 &HT;    By Rebecca Carr
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Attorneys for the House Judiciary Committee were
preparing a joint letter Friday asking Independent Counsel Kenneth
Starr if he intends to send the House any other impeachment charges
against President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Judiciary Chairman Henry Hyde (R-Ill.) agreed to send the letter
after a request from Rep. John Conyers of Michigan, the ranking
Democrat on the committee.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last four years, Starr has investigated a series of
allegations against the president arising from the Whitewater land
deal in Arkansas, the firings of White House travel office
employees, the suicide death of former White House counsel Vince
Foster, and the use of FBI files by the White House.
</P>
<P>
   With such a laundry list of possible charges, some Republicans
such as Georgia Republican Rep. Bob Barr have said that the
Judiciary panel should examine all allegations that come its way
from Starr and other on-going congressional investigations.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats oppose expanding the inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure if these people are not going to want to set up
an a Ouiji Board and talk to Vince Foster,'' said Rep. Barney
Frank, (D-Mass.), a member of the Judiciary panel.
</P>
<P>
   Even before Congress got a look at the latest release of 5,000
pages of documents from independent counsel Kenneth Starr on
Friday, Democrats were maneuverng to capture ground in the ongoing
batle for public opinion.
</P>
<P>
   Conyers unveiled a proposal to wrap up any impeachment process
by Thanksgiving. He called for holding hearings on whether the 11
impeachable offenses alleged by Starr have any credibility before
the committee takes the next step and approves a formal impeachment
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without a date certain, this proceeding could turn into a
year-long, two years long, politicized fishing expedition of
enormous expense,'' Conyers said.
</P>
<P>
   Given the committee's Republican majority, the proposal has
virtually no chance of passage and was largely seen as another
example in the partisan division on the committee charged with
overseeing the first impeachment proceedings since 1974 when the
same panel investigated former President Richard Nixon.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP is squarely behind a proposal from Hyde to launch an
open-ended impeachment inquiry closely mirroring the way the panel
investigated Nixon under the Democratic leadership.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Democrats are proposing an alternative resolution which is
more concerned with coming to a hasty conclusion, rather than the
right conclusion,'' Hyde said. ``Despite efforts to derail the
search for truth through cries of procedural unfairness, I am still
committed to doing everything I can to move this process forward in
a fair and expeditious manner.''
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, lawmakers said they found no surprises in the
third batch of material released by the Judiciary panel. Instead of
focusing on the documents, most of the committee members continued
to draw battle lines, giving a glimpse of what Monday will be like.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are just acting like a defense attorney for the
president,'' said Barr, a member of the Judiciary panel and one of
the first to propose impeachment of the president. ``They just want
this to go away.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats contend they just wanted fairness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing in it will add clarity to the constitutional question
of what is an impeachable offense,'' said California Democratic
Rep. Zoe Lofgren.
</P>
<P>
   While the documents appear to have no bombshells, Florida
Republican Charles Canady said they backed up the 445-page report
turned over by Starr's office alleging that the president committed
perjury, obstructed justice and abused his presidential powers in
attempting to conceal an adulterous affair with Monica Lewinsky, a
former White House intern.
</P>
<P>
   ``This supplemental material is really more of a side show,''
Canady said. The real show will be on Monday, he said, when the
impeachment inquiry is slated for debate. The Democratic proposal,
he said, is an indication that the other side of the aisle are out
to ``sweep under the rug'' all of the allegations against the
president.
</P>
<P>
   Not so, said Bill Delahunt, (D-Mass.), a member of the committee
who supports limiting the scope and duration of the investigation.
``I'm not defending the president, I'm defending the United States
Constitution.''
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Republican John Linder, a member of the House Republican
leadership, said he is tired of the ``sleaze'' detracting from the
work of Congress. Important debates --such as the GOP focus on
personal choice--are being eclipsed in favor of the president's
adulterous affair with Lewinsky, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Linder has said in the past that he does not think that the
American people are ready for impeachment if Starr's referral to
Congress is solely about the Lewinsky affair. But on Friday, Linder
said that he believed the president lied under oath and that
``lying under oath to win a lawsuit shows enough bad character that
he shouldn't be president.''
</P>
<P>
   The partisan feuding continued as both sides prepare for
Monday's meeting of the Judiciary Committee. The panel will hear
opening arguments from Hyde and Conyers as well as individual
statements from members. Then David Schippers, the chief Republican
counsel and Abbe Lowell, the chief Democratic counsel, will present
facts from their perspective.

 &HT;    New impeachment evidence hints at other Clinton relationships
 &HT;    By Scott Shepard
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The House Judiciary Committee released the latest
batch of evidence from its impeachment investigation Friday, three
hefty tan volumes that include allegations that President Clinton
may have had ``close relationships'' with women other than Monica
Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   The 4,610 pages of grand jury testimony, FBI interviews and tape
transcripts were provided by Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr as
``supplemental materials'' to his original impeachment referral.
</P>
<P>
   They mainly provide additional details about familiar aspects of
the scandal, including edited transcripts of the telephone calls
that Lewinsky's former friend Linda Tripp secretly taped and turned
over to Starr, and the grand jury testimony of many central
figures, including Clinton's secretary Betty Currie and his close
friend Vernon Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   One deposition, however, includes a tantalizing reference to
rumors within the Secret Service that Clinton had trysts with at
least six other women, including White House staffers.
</P>
<P>
   Brent James Chinery, an officer in the uniformed division of the
Secret Service, told Starr's grand jury July 23 that ``we've heard
rumors'' of Clinton having ``a very close relationship'' with at
least six women, and that Lewinsky was simply ``the newest one.''
</P>
<P>
   On one occasion, Chinery said of one relationship, ``I witnessed
it for myself.'' But the pages of his testimony were censored by
the House Judiciary Committee to delete names and the details of
the encounter he claims to have witnessed.
</P>
<P>
   The White House responded to the release of the volumes, coming
just days before the Judiciary Committee is scheduled to vote on a
formal impeachment inquiry against the president, by accusing Starr
of deliberate bias in his original report.
</P>
<P>
   Gregory Craig, a special counsel to the White House, said
Clinton's legal defense team would give the Judiciary Committee ``a
complete accounting of the pattern of evidentiary manipulation and
misdirection employed by the independent counsel.''
</P>
<P>
   Craig said Friday's evidence shows several instances of such
alleged misconduct, including testimony by Lewinsky, Currie and
Jordan that he said refuted Starr's charge that the president tried
to get Lewinsky a job in order to buy her silence about their White
House affair in 1995 and 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Craig said the evidence also revealed the ``central and
troubling'' role of Tripp.
</P>
<P>
   While Tripp told Starr's grand jury that her relationship with
Lewinsky ``was sisterly and I cared,'' in the edited phone
transcripts Tripp often seems manipulative, trying to get Lewinsky
to acknowledge having had sex with the president and prodding her
to get the president to enlist the well-connected Jordan to get her
a ``kick-ass job.''
</P>
<P>
   Echoing previous testimony from the president, Craig suggested
Clinton could have used a White House job to buy Lewinsky's
silence, but chose not to.
</P>
<P>
   However, White House chief of staff Erskine Bowles told the
grand jury that Clinton had approached him in the ``summer or
fall'' of 1997, after Lewinsky has been transferred to the
Pentagon, and asked him to try to find her a new job at the White
House.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan's testified that his efforts on Lewinsky's behalf came in
response to a request from Currie, not the president. And Currie
said of her efforts to help Lewinsky, ``I was doing it on my own.''
</P>
<P>
   Currie's testimony also provided a portrait of a worried Clinton
at the White House on the night of Jan. 18, after learning that The
Washington Post would report the next morning that Starr was
investigating Tripp's allegations of his affair with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Currie, who often acted as a go-between for the president and
Lewinsky, told the grand jury that she was awakened late that night
by a telephone call from the president telling her that ``something
would be in The Washington Post'' and ``it wasn't good.'' Currie
said Clinton asked her to contact Lewinsky and ``see what's
happening.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House secretary paged Lewinsky, using the code name
``K'' that they had previously established. But Lewinsky did not
return the call until the next morning, and then told Currie, ``I
can't talk to you.'' Clinton interpreted that response as advice
the young woman had received from her lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky told prosecutors of having acknowledged to Currie her
relationship with the president. But Currie, in her testimony,
refused to confirm that Lewinsky had told her, ``As long as no one
saw us _ and no one did _ then nothing happened.'' But after being
reminded that she was under oath, Currie said, ``If that was said,
I would have said, 'Stop, stop, I don't want to hear anymore.'''
Lewinsky concluded her testimony to the grand jury with the
observation: ``I hate Linda Tripp.'' And Friday's evidence showed
how their friendship ended so bitterly.
</P>
<P>
   Tripp, at Starr's urging, wore a hidden recording device during
a Jan. 13 lunch with Lewinsky. Playing the role of a sympathetic
counselor, Tripp suggested that Jordan's job-hunting efforts were
in ``his buddy's best interests,'' not Lewisnky's. She also
questioned Lewinsky about the whereabouts of a dress stained during
one of her sexual encounters with the president. And she pressed
Lewinsky about ``the definition of sex.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Intercourse,'' replied Lewinsky, who had denied having a
sexual relationship with the president in a sworn affidavit in the
Jones lawsuit, which accused the president of sexual harassment
when he was governor of Arkansas. ``I never had intercourse. I did
not have a sexual relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   In his deposition in the Paula Jones lawsuit, Clinton also
relied on such a narrow definition of sex in denying a sexual
relationship with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky told Tripp that she could not ``get him (Clinton) out
of my heart'' and expressed ``fear of my life'' if she were to
disclose her secret relationship with him.
</P>
<P>
   During the lunch with Tripp, Lewinsky said she was being urged
to be untruthful in the Jones lawsuit and offered money to Tripp if
she would also lie. ``I would be indebted to you for life,'' she
told her friend. Documents released Friday also included grand jury
testimony by White House adviser Sidney Blumenthal, who was
compelled to recount his private talk with the president about
Lewinsky after the court dismissed his claims of executive
privilege.
</P>
<P>
   Blumenthal quoted Clinton as telling him that Lewinsky had
``threatened'' him, after making ``a sexual demand on me'' which
was ``rebuffed.'' Blumenthal said Clinton had told him ``she would
tell people they'd had an affair, that she was known as the stalker
among her peers and that she hated it and if she had an affair or
said she had an affair then she wouldn't be the stalker any more.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the testimony, that conversation took place on the
evening of Jan. 21 _ the same day the president had issued his
initial false public denials in the breaking scandal and some hours
after the first lady had told Blumenthal privately that ``the
president ministers to troubled people all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Lindsey, another Clinton confidant, characterized himself
as a frequent ``confidential intermediary between the president and
his private attorneys.'' He refused in all of his appearances
before the grand jury, including a fourth encounter on Aug. 28,
``to discuss my conversations with the president,'' citing
``attorney-client privilege.''
</P>
<P>
   During its current term, the Supreme Court is due to rule on
White House appeals from lower court decisions that struck all
privilege claims and compelled Lindsey to testify.

BIG SWISS BANK IS SHAKEN UP BY HEDGE FUND 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ALAN COWELL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ As more fallout from the near-collapse of Long-Term
Capital Management LP cascaded over Europe on Friday, the chairman
and three high-ranking officers of UBS AG of Switzerland resigned _
the most visible casualties to date of dealings with the American
hedge fund.
</P>
<P>
   The departure of Mathis Cabiallavetta and the senior officers
was designed to restore some confidence in UBS, which became
Europe's biggest bank after the merger of Union Bank of Switzerland
and Swiss Bank Corp. in June.
</P>
<P>
   But the announcement at an early morning news conference in
Zurich did little to reverse a weeklong slide in bank stocks.
Shares of UBS closed at 285 Swiss francs _ up 10 francs from their
close Thursday but less than half their high of 657 Swiss francs in
July. At one point, the shares dipped to 258 francs.
</P>
<P>
   Falling bank shares have led a sharp decline in European stocks
in general that continued Friday as investors sensed they were no
longer immune to roiling markets from Asia to Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   Even the Bank of Italy, Italy's central bank, acknowledged
Thursday that it had invested $250 million in Long-Term Capital _
an extraordinary investment for a central bank, particularly
because some of Long-Term Capital's arcane trading was based on the
likely behavior of Italian government bonds. Questions about the
Bank of Italy's investment multiplied when Reuters quoted a Bank of
Italy foreign-exchange official, Pierantonio Ciampicali, as saying
the central bank had been unaware Long-Term Capital was a hedge
fund when it had first invested in the risky American firm.
</P>
<P>
   European banks, including Dresdner Bank, Germany's second
biggest, have so far acknowledged about $1.1 billion in losses from
the Long-Term Capital debacle _ the most at UBS _ at a time when
Europe's banking industry seems headed for a sobering downturn.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ING Barings, the investment and corporate banking division of
ING Groep in the Netherlands, said Thursday, for instance, that it
was cutting 1,200 of 9,000 jobs.
</P>
<P>
   In London, J.P. Morgan analysts downgraded three European banks,
including Dresdner and UBS, on Thursday, warning ``there may be
further negative surprises for the market as we peer deeper into a
number of the black holes which have emerged recently.''
</P>
<P>
   At UBS, Alex Krauer, who has temporarily replaced Cabiallavetta,
53, told reporters Friday that the bank's problem ``is not a
financial crisis, rather a crisis of confidence.'' He said the
bank's exposure to Long-Term Capital arose from poor judgment and
``an improper assessment of the situation'' rather than negligence.
</P>
<P>
   Pressed to say whether any of the departed executives had held
personal stakes in Long-Term Capital, UBS officials said that there
was no evidence of this but that an internal audit was still under
way.
</P>
<P>
   UBS announced last week that it would write off $685 million
because of losses connected to Long-Term Capital.
</P>
<P>
   The resignations were a surprise partly because they came so
soon after the the merger of Union Bank and Swiss Bank created UBS
in late June. The combination had been trumpeted as a milestone in
Swiss banking history, but the alliance has been dogged by
pressures from American Jewish and political organizations in the
so-called Nazi gold affair, falling markets and what now seems a
remarkable gap in the bank's internal ability to calculate the risk
of its investments.
</P>
<P>
   UBS chief executive Marcel Ospel said at the news conference in
Zurich on Friday that as late as August the bank's most senior
managers were aware of losses totaling only $50 million from
dealings with Long-Term Capital because of the way the transactions
had been recorded.
</P>
<P>
   As markets began to collapse in July, he said, ``we were talking
about a large accrued position with major risks spread over
different books.''
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, UBS said: ``The evaluation and the ongoing
management of risk positions were not carried out to the standards
expected.''
</P>
<P>
   Apart from Cabiallavetta, the responsibility fell on three other
bank officers: Felix Fischer, chief risk officer; Werner Bonadurer,
the joint chief operating officer at the Warburg Dillon Read
investment banking arm, and Andrew Siciliano, the head of rates at
Warburg Dillon.
</P>
<P>
   ``The conviction that I am doing the right thing for my bank has
prompted me to take this step,'' Cabiallavetta said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   The bank's inability to detect the risks has left many in
Switzerland openly questioning its professionalism, to the extent
that Ospel was pressed to acknowledge Friday that the bank was
considering bringing in foreign directors with greater market
expertise to bolster its all-Swiss board.
</P>
<P>
   Swiss regulators have also opened an inquiry into the bank's
losses. ``We will have to ask ourselves how a bank can enter such a
huge engagement with a single hedge fund,'' Daniel Zuberbuehler,
head of the Federal Banking Commission, said in a published
interview this week. ``We also need to know why there was no red
light coming on earlier.''
</P>
<P>
   UBS is one of the institutions that helped assemble a $3.6
billion rescue package for Long-Term Capital in return for a 90
percent stake in the hedge fund, clearly hoping to recover some
losses while averting far broader market chaos. Chastened by the
experience, UBS forswore further ventures into high-risk
investment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given the developments in the international financial markets,
in the future UBS will _ within the framework of its defined
strategies _ focus even more intensively on those areas of business
likely to generate sustainable earnings with a justifiable level of
risk,'' the company said.

PAULINE JULIEN, 70, CHANTEUSE WHO INSPIRED QUEBECOIS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ANTHONY DePALMA   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ Pauline Julien, who sang songs of passion and of
tender love, died Sept. 30 in Montreal. The chanteuse, who was 70,
was most strongly identified with the songs she sang in the cause
of a separate and independent Quebec.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Julien took her own life at her home after leaving a note
saying she did not want to be revived, said her sister, Fabienne
Julien. She said the singer suffered from aphasia, a condition that
severely limits the power to use or understand words, and had grown
despondent as the disease progressed.
</P>
<P>
   In a singing career that spanned more than 35 years and two
continents, Ms. Julien became a beloved figure to French-speaking
audiences who were touched by her stirring performances and
forceful style. She recorded 22 albums containing more than 200
songs, including about 30 that she composed.
</P>
<P>
   She popularized homespun Quebecois music in France and helped
revive the popularity of sophisticated French music in Quebec. She
interpreted the music of Kurt Weill and the Quebec composer Gilles
Vigneault. One of her most popular songs was called ``Tonight I
Feel Tender,'' a ballad that became a theme that she performed at
many performances.
</P>
<P>
   But from the time she first returned to Quebec from Paris in the
late 1950's she formed part of the inspirational soul of the
separatist movement in Quebec. She fell in love with the Quebecois
poet and journalist Gerald Godin, a staunch separatist, and fought
with him for Quebec separatism.
</P>
<P>
   During a crisis in Quebec in 1970 when Canadian Prime Minister
Pierre Trudeau sent the Canadian army into the streets of Montreal
in response to separatist violence, Ms. Julien and Godin were among
a number of Quebecers who were swept off the streets and briefly
jailed.
</P>
<P>
   After Godin was elected to the province's assembly in 1976, the
year the separatist party won control of the provincial government,
she appeared regularly at major separatist rallies, leading huge
crowds in song and fiery speeches.
</P>
<P>
   She played a major role in fighting for women's rights and in
obtaining the right to abortion in predominately Catholic Quebec.
</P>
<P>
   ``Madame Julien lived intensely,'' said Lucien Bouchard, premier
of Quebec. ``Her voice, the words of her songs _ above all on the
question of love, friendship and her country _ her charisma and her
passionate character are deeply etched in our collective memory.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Julien was born in Trois-Rivieres, Quebec, in 1928. She
studied drama in Paris in the 1950s and began singing there in
bistros and bohemian clubs.
</P>
<P>
   Jean Paul Goay, Ms. Julien's brother-in-law, said that on the
night before she died she insisted on being taken to a show in
Montreal where an old friend, the French comedian Raymond Davos,
was performing. ``She told him then that they would never see each
other again, but he didn't understand exactly what it signified,''
Goay said.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1990s, after 30 years of a common-law marriage, Ms.
Julien and Godin were formally married. He died of a brain tumor in
1994.
</P>
<P>
   In her later years Ms. Julien retired from active performing and
traveled to Africa to work with the poor in Burkina Faso and other
French-speaking countries.
</P>
<P>
   She is survived by two children, Pascale and Nicolas, both of
Montreal, from her first marriage to Jacques Galipeau, which ended
in divorce.

GENE AUTRY, 91; ORIGINAL SINGING COWBOY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOSEPH P. KAHN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Broadcasting, baseball, and show business lost a legend Friday
when Gene Autry, the genial singing cowboy who climbed down from
his saddle and onto the perennial list of America's wealthiest men,
died at his home near Los Angeles. Mr. Autry was 91 and reportedly
had been in ill health for some time.
</P>
<P>
   His death came only weeks after that of cowboy singer Roy Rogers
and a few days after Mr. Autry's Anaheim Angels lost their bid for
a playoff spot.
</P>
<P>
   His passing ended a colorful, multifaceted career that spanned
seven decades and many media. For anyone who grew up in the 1930s,
'40s, or '50s, Mr. Autry was the living embodiment of the American
West _ a star so transcendent that Hollywood's Walk of Fame needed
five stars to represent his accomplishments, from radio to rodeo.
</P>
<P>
   Like Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa battling for the home run
season record this year, Mr. Autry and Rogers once dueled in
spirited but friendly fashion for the title of King of the Movie
Cowboys. Mr. Autry, who got there first, appeared in more than 90
films between 1934 and 1956, when he retired from performing. In
1940, theater exhibitors voted Mr. Autry the fourth-biggest box
office draw in the country, trailing only Mickey Rooney, Clark
Gable, and Spencer Tracy. His horse Champion was almost as popular
a figure as Mr. Autry.
</P>
<P>
   Serving with the US Army Air Corps in World War II, Mr. Autry
lost some of his star power to Rogers, who filled in for Mr. Autry
at Republic Studios. While Rogers and his wife, Dale Evans,
galloped to stardom, they never seriously challenged Mr. Autry's
supremacy as an all-around entertainer and shrewd businessman. Mr.
Autry's cowboy image lingered indelibly after he took off his chaps
and put on a business suit.
</P>
<P>
   Johnny Cash, the venerable country singer, once said in tribute:
``When I saw my first Gene Autry movie as a child, I was filled
with awe and wonder for the handsome man with the white hat riding
a beautiful horse. He confirmed the hope instilled in me by my
parents, that good can triumph over evil.''
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Autry was born in Tioga, Texas, and grew up in Ravia, Okla.,
20 miles east of the town now known as Gene Autry, Okla. Earning
spending money singing in local nightspots, he bought a $5
mail-order guitar and taught himself some chords. Later, working as
a railroad telegrapher, Mr. Autry met Will Rogers, who encouraged
him to take a shot at radio.
</P>
<P>
   A radio and recording star by the time he found fame on the big
screen, Mr. Autry made 635 recordings and sold 60 million records
during an enormously successful singing career, putting his
songwriter's pen and mellow voice to such hit tunes as ``Mexicali
Rose,'' ``Back in the Saddle Again,'' even ``Rudolph the Red-nosed
Reindeer.'' ``Here Comes Santa Claus'' and ``Peter Cottontail'' are
other holiday-themed hits that have woven Mr. Autry's music into
the fabric of American family life.
</P>
<P>
   In 1950, Mr. Autry made yet another enterprising transition,
this time from films to television. He produced and starred in many
popular offerings of the early '50s, including ``The Gene Autry
Show,'' ``Annie Oakley,'' and ``The Adventures of Champion.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1961, he indulged his love for baseball _ Mr. Autry had once
passed up a chance to play minor league baseball _ by starting the
California Angels franchise in the American League. The Angels
never won a pennant. The closest they came was in 1986, when they
were a Dave Henderson ninth-inning home run away from beating the
Red Sox and advancing to the World Series. Yet in the often
fractious world of big-league baseball, Mr. Autry was as beloved
and respected a figure as he had once been crooning ``Under Western
Stars.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Like all Americans, I grew up with him, and when I became an
adult I learned he was a brilliant entrepreneur,'' said TV producer
Dick Clark Friday. ``I'll always harbor this secret feeling that he
gave up when the Angels didn't make it this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Autry, who retained a stake in the club when he sold
operating control of the Angels to the Walt Disney Co. in 1995,
made several fortunes in and out of baeball and show business. His
real estate holdings included the Gene Autry Hotel in Palm Springs,
Calif., and Los Angeles TV station KTLA, which he sold in 1982 for
$245 million.
</P>
<P>
   A major collector of Western art and memorabilia, Mr. Autry
founded the Gene Autry Western Heritage Museum in 1988, located in
Griffith Park in Los Angeles. The museum's $54 million collection
includes guns owned by Annie Oakley and Wyatt Earp. In 1995, Forbes
magazine pegged Autry's net worth at $320 million.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Autry is survived by his wife, Jackie, and a sister, Veda,
along with several nieces and nephews. Funeral services at Forest
Lawn Cemetery will be private.
</P>
<P>
   Eulogies for Mr. Autry will surely make reference to the cowboy
code by which he lived. As Mr. Autry saw it: ``The cowboy must
never shoot first, hit a smaller man, or take unfair advantage. He
must be gentle with children, the elderly, and animals. He must not
advocate or possess racially or religiously intolerant ideas. He
must respect women, parents, and his nation's laws. The cowboy is a
patriot.''
</P>
<P>
   To the end, Gene Autry was a cowboy.

<P>
   It has been just shy of a year since stocks in companies that
serve the oil drilling industry began a long, grueling selloff that
has left even bearish energy analysts surprised by its severity.
</P>
<P>
   Those who bought last fall, when these stocks peaked, have
watched as the Standard &AMP; Poor's Oil and Gas Equipment Index has
fallen 56 percent from its high on Nov. 5.
</P>
<P>
   The culprits: last winter's mild weather; expanding oil
production, which tends to drive these stocks down as oil prices
drop, and, most of all, the financial crisis in Asia, which has
slaked the once unquenchable thirst for oil there.
</P>
<P>
   The price of West Texas intermediate crude oil, which in October
1997 had hovered at $22 a barrel, fell to just more than $12 last
June.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a brutal group,'' said Daniel R. Pickering, an
analyst who follows the industry for Simmons &AMP; Company
International in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Since June, however, crude has staged a modest rebound, rising
to $15.64 on Friday; major oil-producing countries are making the
production cuts they promised earlier this year, and inventories
are dropping.
</P>
<P>
   The trends, though still tenuous, have generated enough optimism
to breathe a spark of life into the battered stocks of some oil
service companies. For example, Schlumberger Ltd., which hit a
52-week low of $43.75 in August, closed on Friday at $48.5625.
</P>
<P>
   So is it time for investors to jump back in? Are these still
bargain-basement prices?
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts think so, and are adding oil service companies to
their ``buy'' lists. Money managers have been purchasing shares.
And executives and directors in oil service companies including
Baker Hughes, Schlumberger and Global Marine, are buying their
companies' shares.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's encouraging to see them buying their own stock,'' said
Frank Ponticello, who follows insider buying trends for Prudential
Securities.
</P>
<P>
   Stock prices in this industry are often tied closely to those of
crude oil. Some stocks have begun to move up with oil prices, even
while the companies post declining earnings and keep their charges
low to drillers.
</P>
<P>
   Among the buyers are Howard F. Ward, manager of the Gabelli
Growth fund. He has increased his holdings of Schlumberger, Baker
Hughes and Halliburton.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have gone from being Wall Street's darlings to being put
in the penalty box,'' Ward said. ``That's generally when stocks of
high-quality companies should be bought _ when they are way out of
favor.''
</P>
<P>
   By jumping in now, investors risk short-term weakness in oil
prices. But if they wait, they might miss the sudden jumps that
such stocks often make when a preponderance of evidence begins
pointing toward higher oil prices.
</P>
<P>
   In the near term, earnings of these companies may well fail to
meet expectations. Shares of Baker Hughes, for example, plummeted
by almost 10 percent on Sept. 24, when it announced that it would
earn about half of the 36 cents a share that analysts had
predicted.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're kind of in the trough here,'' said Pickering, the
analyst. ``We just have to get past a period when it's going to be
a rocky road.''
</P>
<P>
   Pickering says oil is in a long-term trend toward higher prices,
giving investors and oil companies reason for optimism, yet it will
take some time for that to translate into better earnings for the
companies that provide the gear used in the oilfields.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, it may take as long as six months for higher prices to
lead to increases in drilling activity, and rates charged for rigs
will remain low in the interim.
</P>
<P>
   The number of rigs operating last week was 754, compared with
1,001 in the corresponding week last year. The count dropped to a
record low of 596 in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Arvind S. Sanger, oil service analyst for Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP;
Jenrette, said that if crude remained in its current price range,
big oil service companies would likely continue buying smaller
ones. And the offers often cause sharp price run-ups.
</P>
<P>
   Already, Baker Hughes has acquired Western Atlas. When the offer
was announced on May 11, shares of Western Atlas rose to $92.875, a
14 percent increase.
</P>
<P>
   Halliburton announced on Feb. 26 that it would buy Dresser
Industries, valuing its offer at $46.50 a share, which was 20
percent above Dresser's closing price the day before.
</P>
<P>
   EVI &UR;  &LR; agreed on March 4 to buy Weatherford Enterra for $46.23 a
share, 49 percent above the price the previous day.
</P>
<P>
   Over all, however, Sanger recommends big, lower-risk stocks like
Halliburton, now trading at $28.25; he predicts that it will reach
$48 a share by the end of next year. He also favors the new
Weatherford International, now trading at $20.25 (1999 projection:
$55) and J. Ray McDermott, now at $29.9375 (1999 projection: $53).
</P>
<P>
   Sanger said that both Halliburton and Weatherford should achieve
big savings through their mergers and that J. Ray McDermott is rich
in cash.
</P>
<P>
   Sam Z. Albright, an oil service analyst at Jeffries &AMP; Co. in
Houston, recommends Noble Drilling, which closed at $14.1875 on
Friday; Santa Fe International, $14.875; and Transocean Offshore,
$30.3125. All have large backlogs of work for their rigs and have
strong balance sheets.
</P>
<P>
   Generally, they are involved with deep-water drilling programs.
These long-term projects require huge amounts of capital, and the
oil companies that run them are reluctant to pull out. In a
September report, Jeffries &AMP; Co., set 12-month target prices for
Noble at $23, Santa Fe at $26 and Transocean at $47 a share.

PHILIPPINE AIRLINES' UNIONS APPROVE RECOVERY PLAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MARK LANDLER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG _ A week after it closed with an outpouring of tears
and sentimental songs, Philippine Airlines gained a new lease on
life Friday, as its employees resoundingly approved a recovery
plan.
</P>
<P>
   The airline, the flag carrier of the Philippines and the oldest
airline in Asia, said it would resume domestic flights Wednesday,
though its international service was still ``being reviewed.''
Philippine Airlines shut down at midnight Sept. 23, after its
unions rejected the same proposal they ratified Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of the plan, which was approved by a nearly
two-thirds margin, the employees will give up a
collective-bargaining agreement for 10 years in return for a 20
percent stake in the airline and three seats on the board.
</P>
<P>
   If Philippine Airlines takes to the skies again, it will be a
deep relief for the 76 million people of the Philippines, who
depend on air travel to hop from island to island in that sprawling
archipelago.
</P>
<P>
   It would also be a victory for the nation's president, Joseph
Estrada, who made it a mission to save the airline without having
the government take it over. When he failed to prevent the
shutdown, Estrada persuaded union leaders to take the recovery plan
back to their members for another vote.
</P>
<P>
   But several industry experts cautioned that Friday's vote was
not the last hurdle for the airline, which has racked up $338
million in losses over four years and is staggering under $2.1
billion in debt. The U.S. Export-Import Bank, which lent the
carrier $400 million, has seized two of its 747s, while other
creditors are clamoring for much of the rest of its fleet.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is still a lot of water to go under the bridge before
this is resolved,'' said Jim Eckes, an aviation consultant at
Indoswiss Ltd. in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   He said that in addition to keeping its creditors at bay,
Philippine Airlines would have to win back the public's confidence.
</P>
<P>
   That may be possible in its home market, where it had a monopoly
on many of its routes. But on international routes, rivals like
Cathay Pacific Airways and Singapore Airlines had already been
nibbling at its franchise, Eckes said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``It's going to be hard, and the only way they're going to be
able to do it is to come out with a very extensive marketing
campaign,'' he said. ``To put an airline out of business
voluntarily and then reopen it is extremely rare.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, the management of Philippine Airlines is more focused
on survival than on repairing its image. The airline's billionaire
owner, Lucio Tan, was in Europe this week trying to stave off the
repossession of his planes by creditors. Tan is also trying to lure
new investors and has asked for the resignations of all the top
managers of Philippine Airlines to make the company more attractive
to a prospective outside investor.
</P>
<P>
   Cathay Pacific has emerged as the prime candidate to buy part or
all of the carrier. Cathay, which is based in Hong Kong, has
dispatched a team of 25 executives to Manila to explore a deal.
Since Monday, it has been offering charter service between Manila
and two cities, Cebu and Davao, as part of a government-led effort
to reassemble the nation's domestic route network.
</P>
<P>
   Quince Chong, a spokeswoman for Cathay Pacific, confirmed that
the airline was interested in a broader deal. ``We are looking at
ways in which we can take part in the Philippine operation,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Dragonair, a Hong Kong-based airline that is 25 percent-owned by
Cathay, also signed an agreement with the Philippines on Tuesday to
offer service to destinations too small to handle Cathay's
wide-bodied jets.
</P>
<P>
   For any new owner of Philippine Airlines, however, the next few
years would be trying. Analysts estimate that before it closed, the
carrier was losing $1 million to $1.5 million a day. While Friday's
agreement would bring the airline close to break even on an
operating basis, it would do nothing to erase its debt or reduce
its costs, which are much higher than at rivals like Singapore
Airlines.
</P>
<P>
   ``The unions didn't break the back of Philippine Airlines,''
said Nick Cashmore, an analyst at ABN Amro in Manila. ``The real
problem was that it had far too much staff and far too much
leverage.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Cashmore and other analysts agreed that it would make
more sense to salvage the airline than carve it up. Because
bankruptcy law is less developed in the Philippines than in other
countries, creditors could face a protracted and messy fight to get
even a portion of their claims.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the good of the Philippines, getting Philippine Airlines
back in the air, with an abbreviated route structure, would be the
best step,'' Eckes said. ``They're probably worth more alive than
dead.''

   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa _ Nine days after South Africa's
disastrous invasion of tiny, mountainous Lesotho, the kingdom's
government and its opposition parties finally sat down at the
negotiating table Friday and agreed that new elections would be
held within 18 months.
</P>
<P>
   But South African Deputy President Thabo Mbeki, making an
unusual television appearance to announce the agreement, generated
new controversy tonight when he added that the present government
would remain in control until the elections.
</P>
<P>
   Within minutes, opposition party officials in Lesotho denounced
Mbeki, saying he had misrepresented the status of the talks. South
Africa was one of the outside mediators of the talks. ``He must
have had a speech written in the morning and he tried to push us
towards that, but it didn't happen,'' said Mamelo Morrison, the
spokeswoman for the opposition coalition.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Morrison said that while there was a ``tentative agreement''
on holding new elections, there was no agreement to allow the
present government to rule until then. She added that there were
many other important unresolved issues, including how long foreign
troops would stay in Lesotho and whether the country's electoral
system needed to be overhauled.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have many, many things to discuss still,'' Ms. Morrison
said. Another opposition official, the leader of the small Sefate
Democratic Union, Bofihla Nkoebe, told the South African Press
Association that he would call for a withdrawal from the
negotiations because of Mbeki's speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not true that we have an agreement,'' Nkoebe said. ``We
have not actually even started talking about what the way forward
should be, particularly what should be happening before
re-election.''
</P>
<P>
   South African troops rolled into Lesotho last week expecting to
quickly put an end to weeks of political turmoil that had paralyzed
the government of its neighbor.
</P>
<P>
   But the troops met fierce resistance from Lesotho's mutinous
army and in the end more than 60 people, including dozens of
civilians were killed. The troop movements also led to looting and
burning that reduced to rubble most of the capital, Maseru.
</P>
<P>
   South African officials said they had come at the invitation of
Prime Minister Pakalitha Mosisili _ who said the impoverished
kingdom, which is about the size of Maryland and completely
surrounded by South Africa _ was on the verge of a coup. Certainly,
the prime minister had lost control of the army after weeks of
protest by the opposition parties, who asserted that elections held
in May had been rigged.
</P>
<P>
   In the elections, Mosisili's party won 79 of the 80 Parliament
seats. A special commission looking into the elections found some
fraud, but did not call for new elections. South Africa had
attempted to mediate between the government and the protesters
before intervening last week.
</P>
<P>
   South African officials said they had moved into Lesotho under
the auspices of the Southern African Development Community, a
regional organization with joint economic and military agreements.
Botswana has also sent a small number of troops.
</P>
<P>
   This week, with calm finally returned to the streets, many
Lesotho citizens tried to pick up their lives. But when many people
reported to work, they found only burned-out shells where business
had been. Some experts have estimated that nearly $150 million
worth of damage was done to property in Lesotho, a figure that
approaches the government's yearly budget.
</P>
<P>
   Still, many citizens tried to salvage what they could. At the
former Lewis Furniture shop, on Kingsway, the showroom floor _ once
filled with sofas, coffee tables and recliners, was a sea of
charcoaled debris, except for blackened but still intact
wrought-iron pieces.
</P>
<P>
   In the back, however, the manager, Pheelo Khoase, was at work
breaking into a small fireproof room that contained the huge record
books used to keep track of layaway plans. Even without a store,
the business of collecting payments would have to continue, he
said, and so, therefore, might his salary.
</P>
<P>
   Khoase, like many others, said he believed that the South
Africans were wrong to invade.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody is worried,'' he said, wiping the soot from his
hands. ``A lot of companies are going now for good.'' Most of
Lesotho's businesses are South African-owned.
</P>
<P>
   Across the street, Unice Abdulla, the owner of Fahida's Cash and
Carry, was sitting weakly near the front of what was once his
thriving wholesale business, watching workers remove wheelbarrows
full of ash and debris. ``I'm just not feeling well,'' Abdulla
said. ``I have lost everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Already, he said, the workers had taken away 100 truckloads. In
some of the aisles, other workers were trying to wash the goods
that could be salvaged. But the task was complicated because the
building had no water or electricity. And some of the computerized
cashier stations Abdulla had once been so proud of were melted.
</P>
<P>
   Abdulla did not want to hear much about the political turmoil.
``Never mind the politicians,'' he said. ``They must start thinking
about us. They must think about how to develop our country again.''

 By DAVID COLMAN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For a roundup of this fall's most directional
clothing, look no further than the catalog for Red Kap Industries,
a maker of industrial uniforms. There on the low-gloss pages is a
compendium of some of the trendiest motifs that have been coming
down high-fashion runways.
</P>
<P>
   There are pearl-gray Touchtex shirts with reflective orange
stripes suggestive of Helmut Lang's detailing; flameproof
laboratory coats like suits from Jil Sander and Prada (one even
comes in ``visual green,'' the pistachio color of the walls in
Prada boutiques); leather belts with Velcro closures like
Alessandro Dell'Acqua's leather jackets, and a hooded white
jumpsuit for a dust-free ``clean room,'' reminiscent of the
head-to-toe white offered by everyone from John Bartlett to Ralph
Lauren.
</P>
<P>
   Though the death of minimalism has long been predicted, many
designers have simply gone one step further on the same road,
toward an austere, superclean laboratory esthetic. White sweaters,
white pants, white parkas, white scarves, white shoes and white
bags, for men and women, are now appearing in stores and fashion
magazines everywhere. From the padded, protective dresses by Jil
Sander, to hospital-orderly-esque shoes by Prada, there is a
penchant for sterility, safety and calm.
</P>
<P>
   If any film seems to have inspired the moment, it is ``The
Andromeda Strain,'' the 1970 thriller in which germ-free,
white-clad scientists race to contain a deadly virus from space in
an underground lab.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about being on the right side of the needle,'' said Dr.
Valerie Steele, a professor at the Fashion Institute of Technology.
``The Armani coat has signified power for 20 years; the lab coat is
completely different. This is a more visceral power. It's about
being physically and totally in control.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the superlatives applied to '90s fashion has been
``clean,'' and you can't get much cleaner than a lab coat. With
anxieties over exotic diseases like the hantavirus, prenatal
genetic tinkering and computer-aided invasion of privacy, the clean
room, where computer chips are made by technicians in protective
bunny suits, is an archetypal image _ a bomb shelter for today.
</P>
<P>
   And the impulse is not confined to clothing. Makers of products
like hand soap and body lotions have sought to increase sales by
putting ``antibacterial'' on the label. At old furniture stores,
medical cabinets are big sellers. One of London's trendiest
restaurants is Pharmacy, where waiters dress in surgeons' coats and
the decor includes medicine cabinets stuffed with pills. Clairol
has introduced a line of hair-care products called Daily Defense,
which are promoted as combating ultraviolet rays and pollution.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Helmut Lang's fall and winter collection, a virtual
whiteout, made its debut on the Internet, germ-free.
</P>
<P>
   Designers have been trying to tap into high-tech culture for
several seasons. One fanciful attempt was a cat suit that could
actually plug its wearer into the Internet. Now, with the
laboratory-chic look, they have found a much easier way to suggest
high technology, offering a vision of order and safety. If some
collections look as if the designers suffer from repetitive strain
injury, well, customers can relate.
</P>
<P>
   The minimalist moment in the early and mid-'90s, Dr. Steele
said, put architects like John Pawson and artists like Donald Judd
and Dan Flavin on pedestals. The sterile look is a logical
progression. ``There's an overlap with the architects, in the
knowledge of the very technical,'' Dr. Steele said. ``It's a
combination of the minimal and the medical, with a sort of creepy
sadomasochistic edge to it, and it plays into our fears about
technology and biotechnology. You're choosing to look as though you
were the one who has the power over life and death.''
</P>
<P>
   Or at least the power over how long you'll have to wait for your
lab results.
</P>
<P>
   Some designers are quite consciously working this niche.
Wearmart, a small store on Elizabeth Street, sells clothes that
look as if they have been purloined from a hospital laundry.
Clothes from World Wide Web, a label of the Sportswear Company, a
trendy Italian fashion house, are made of high-tech, sometimes
uncomfortable fabrics in industrial colors like light gray and
orange. The authentic articles from Red Kap Industries can be found
at OK Uniform, which until recently was in SoHo, the heart of
fashion territory, but is now at 368 Broadway, between Franklin and
White Streets.
</P>
<P>
   The design of the World Wide Web label, according to its Web
site, ``is assigned to Lorenzino Piazzi, who, for a long time,
studied and researched the comparative systems of apparel
development in civil, industrial and military areas.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever that may mean, it does sound properly technical, like
something on ``The X-Files.'' Indeed, Special Agent Dana Scully _ a
medical doctor and today's answer to Spock _ seems to be this
fashion moment's rightful muse, thanks to her cool beauty and
relentlessly scientific mind.
</P>
<P>
   But Agent Scully would no doubt point out that, logically, there
is no proof that consumers consciously seek antibacterial
properties in fashion (even though the latest perfume by Comme des
Garcons, Odeur 53, comes in hermetically sealed packaging). She
might explain that the lab look is merely the latest in a line of
'90s trends _ from monastic to thrift-shop chic _ that denote a
distaste for greed and excessive materialism. Laboratory denizens
are usually perceived as motivated by purely intellectual
challenges, not money-grubbing impulses.
</P>
<P>
   Lang, who says his main influences are traditional tailoring and
the spirit of punk rock, insisted that science was not part of the
equation in his recent collections. ``We just started with an old
classic Burberry-style coat that we've translated to our shape,''
he said. ``But I can see how it reminds people of a lab coat. When
you have a completely white outfit, people do associate it with
that. But the clothes have no scientific appeal for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Hmm. His denial would probably arouse the excitable suspicions
of Scully's colleague Agent Fox Mulder. Could there be a Clorox
conspiracy behind this lab look? Bleach sales are known to rise
through the summer, peaking in August. But think what a moneymaker
bleach would be if everyone wore white year round. Not to mention
the corrosive effect of bleach on fabric, which would mean a
shorter life span for clothes, leading to a rise in clothing sales.
</P>
<P>
   Like-minded theorists might want to consider the film ``The Man
in the White Suit,'' from 1951, in which a bumbling scientist
played by Alec Guinness concocts a revolutionary white fabric that
won't stain, tear or wear out. It threatens the entire fashion
industry, inspiring a rare agreement between garment workers and
manufacturers, who all desire the destruction of the formula and
its creator.
</P>
<P>
   As this farce makes clear, fashion doesn't need any more
conspiracy theories than it already has. They would only be
redundant. Styles will inevitably change. Everyone will have to
replace wardrobes anyway.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is out there. It's in Milan.

DOCUMENTS PORTRAY A WORRIED PRESIDENT, LOVESICK LEWINSKY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN MCGRORY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ On the eve of a congressional inquiry, the House
Judiciary Committee flooded the capital with thousands of pages of
investigative documents Friday _ transcripts that portray a worried
president staving off public scandal as a lovesick former intern
clings to the remnants of their dying relationship.
</P>
<P>
   In her secretly recorded conversations with colleague Linda R.
Tripp, Monica S. Lewinsky alternately appears ebullient over her
romantic prospects with President Clinton and tearful because of
his inattention. At one point she claims to love him and even
offers Tripp money to tailor her potential testimony in the Paula
Jones sexual harassment lawsuit to protect him. Another time, she
refers to Clinton as ``the creep.''
</P>
<P>
   Within the inner sanctums of the White House, Clinton appears,
in the transcripts, to be a man consumed by fear that publicity
over his adulterous relationship with Lewinsky would wreak havoc on
his presidency. When he summons his personal secretary, Betty
Currie, back to the West Wing on a Sunday afternoon to discuss his
Jones deposition, she finds him standing on the putting green in
the chill of a January dusk, putting golf balls in the company of
his Labrador retriever, Buddy.
</P>
<P>
   Late that night, Clinton would telephone Currie at home,
advising her to get out of bed, turn on her computer and read a
gossip item on the ``Drudge Report'' providing the first details of
Clinton's relationship with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `Have you read the Drudge Report?' &UR;  &LR; '' Betty Currie
testified on Jan. 27 before the federal grand jury. ``Nope. He
said, `Do you have a computer? You can pull it out of the
Internet.' '' Clinton later told Currie: ``Apparently, the story is
breaking with Monica and Linda Tripp.''
</P>
<P>
   The 4,600 pages of documents, void of any startling revelations,
were released as the House Judiciary Committee prepares to meet
Monday and take an almost certain vote in favor of opening an
impeachment inquiry into Clinton. The full House could vote on the
matter by Oct. 9, and hearings are expected to follow after the
Nov. 3 elections.
</P>
<P>
   House Democrats Friday proposed a narrow and expedited
impeachment investigation that would end by Thanksgiving Day and
leave open an explicit option to censure Clinton rather than
impeach him. Republicans immediately criticized the offer, in a
prelude to its certain defeat.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Democrat's alternative resolution is certainly
made-to-order for the White House, but not for the American
people,'' said Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry Hyde, a
Republican from Illinois. ``We are committed to an expeditious
search for the truth. But spending a month studying the law of
impeachment in the abstract, while brushing aside documented
allegations of serious crimes by the president does nothing to
further that goal.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House Friday accused independent counsel Kenneth W.
Starr of ``evidentiary manipulation and misdirection,'' saying
Starr purposely failed to include favorable testimony about Clinton
in his report to Congress and often paraphrased testimony to
obscure its meaning.
</P>
<P>
   Foremost in their argument was Currie's testimony about how she
helped Lewinsky find a new job, despite Starr's assertions that
Clinton masterminded Lewinsky's job search as a way to win her
favor and maintain her silence. ``I was doing it on my own,''
Currie testified.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's document drop marked the last massive release of grand
jury testimony and evidence from Starr's investigation and included
hundreds of pages of transcipts from such crucial witnesses as
Currie, Clinton ally Vernon E. Jordan Jr., White House aides
ranging from Navy stewards to the chief of staff, as well as Secret
Service agents. It also included transcipts of some 20 hours of
secret tape recordings between Tripp and Lewinsky, of which
portions had previously been published in excerpts over the last
eight months.
</P>
<P>
   All the documents represented supporting evidence for the report
that Starr shipped to Capitol Hill on Sept. 9, outlining 11
possible grounds for Clinton's impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Most notable in the testimony was the vivid and omnipresent role
of Currie, who is posted outside the Oval Office and often served
as the conduit between Clinton and Lewinsky in their 16-month
sexual affair. Throughout her testimony, Currie appeared to be a
reluctant witness who often claimed an inability to recall. But
time and again, under prosecutorial direction, she provided damning
statements about the president.
</P>
<P>
   In the taped telephone conversations, Tripp often appears to be
a sympathetic but leading presence, occasionally coaching Lewinsky
on how to handle the failing relationship with Clinton and the
legal fallout.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, Tripp tells Lewinsky, ``You have got to get out of
town, big time.'' At other times, she heaps praise and sympathy on
her young colleague, even comparing her to a ``Marilyn Monroe
vixen.''
</P>
<P>
   When Tripp, wearing an FBI body wire, meets with Lewinsky last
January at the Ritz-Carlton Hotel at Pentagon City, she excitedly
dramatizes Lewinsky's situation by telling her, ``I feel like we're
in the middle of a John Grisham book, frankly.''
</P>
<P>
   In those tapes, Lewinsky professes a fear for her life. She
advises Tripp to tell Jones' lawyers that ``I don't recall'' key
details of her encounter with Kathleen Willey, who accused the
president of groping her. She describes Clinton as ``gorgeous'' and
``delicious'' when she is not railing against him for refusing to
meet with her.
</P>
<P>
   Among other witnesses, Clinton adviser Dick Morris testified
that the president told him in January, after stories were first
published about the affair, ``I may have done enough so that I
don't know if I can prove my innocence.''
</P>
<P>
   Secret Service agent Larry Cockell, the head of Clinton's
security detail, testified that he had no prior knowledge of
Clinton's affair with Lewinsky before the story appeared in the
Washington Post on Jan. 21.
</P>
<P>
   Facing intense questioning from prosecutors, White House steward
Bayani Nelvis denied any knowledge of a relationship or of Clinton
and Lewinsky ever being alone together. Nelvis said he and Lewinsky
had a close relationship of their own. She gave him ties, he gave
her candy, and they had dinner and drinks together on several
occasions.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan, who helped Lewinsky secure a lawyer and find a private
sector job in New York City, testified that he informed Clinton
when the former intern signed an affidavit in the Jones case
denying any sexual relationship with the president. He said he
spoke with Clinton several times about the job search, but only in
passing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt some responsibility to tell him what was going on. So I
did that,'' Jordan testified.
</P>
<P>
   In one wry passage from the Tripp tapes, Lewinsky was watching
television news coverage last year of the release of videotapes of
White House coffee klatches between Clinton and major campaign
donors, and she expressed fear that there may have been a hidden
camera in Clinton's private study that recorded the pair involved
in oral sex.

   CONCORD, N.C. _ Night races at Charlotte Motor Speedway in May
and Texas Motor Speedway in June will bracket the 83rd Indianapolis
500 on the 1999 Pep Boys Indy Racing League schedule.

   On Thursday, TMS officials announced that the 1999 season finale
has been moved from Las Vegas Motor Speedway to Fort Worth on
Sunday afternoon, Oct. 17. TMS also is scheduled to play host to
its annual Saturday night race on June 12. Yesterday, league and
Charlotte Motor Speedway officials confirmed that the night race at
CMS had been moved from its late July slot to Saturday, May 1,
under the lights.
</P>
<P>
   The VisionAire 500K at CMS will be the third race of the season
and serve as a tuneup for the Indy 500 on May 30.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a real test for Indy, particularly aerodynamically,
because the speeds here and at Indy are the same,'' said H.A.
``Humpy'' Wheeler, president and general manager of CMS. ``This is
a wind tunnel down here at these speeds.
</P>
<P>
   ``And there's a lot of young drivers in the IRL, which means
there's a lot of drivers sitting on the hot seat as to whether
they're going to keep their ride or not. The musical chairs up
there in the month of May is pretty wild. They're going to find out
a lot about these young race car drivers down here.'' &QL;

TO LEWINSKY, TRIPP PLAYED THE VICTIM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In the last act of her betrayal, Linda R. Tripp
responded to Monica S. Lewinsky's pleas for help by portraying
herself as the anguished victim of the former White House intern's
secret affair with President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm scared out of my mind,'' Tripp told Lewinsky last January
as they sipped coffee from china cups and sat before a crackling
fireplace in the piano bar of the Ritz-Carlton Hotel in suburban
Washington. ``I'm at a loss, a total loss. ... I live in terror. It
eats my guts out.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Tripp had little to fear. Equipped with a hidden
recording device and surrounded by plainclothes federal agents,
Tripp, 49, was a voluntary informant, angling against a friend she
once had nurtured, then abandoned out of anger at President
Clinton's allies and fear for her government job.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of heeding Lewinsky's appeal to keep the affair secret,
Tripp was playing a key role in revealing it. Soon afterward, the
tape recording from this conversation became a pivotal piece of
evidence that launched the investigation into Clinton's liaison
with the former White House intern.
</P>
<P>
   The incident underscores the duplicitous nature of the
friendship of Tripp and Lewinsky, in which both women grew
increasingly manipulative and deceptive as they tried to protect
their personal interests in the final weeks before allegations
about the Clinton-Lewinsky affair became public.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of pages of the newly released documents from the
investigation of Clinton by the independent counsel, Kenneth W.
Starr, provide a richer picture of the tangled friendship of
Lewinsky, 24, and the woman who became a close _ and dangerous _
confidante.
</P>
<P>
   The material includes transcripts of the Ritz-Carlton encounter
and many of Tripp's secretly recorded telephone conversations with
Lewinsky. There are copies of computer messages between the two
women, and the contents of stenographer's notebook in which Tripp
documented Lewinsky's account of her liaisons with Clinton near the
Oval Office.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, there was nothing Lewinsky, a millionaire's
daughter, could do to reverse Tripp's resolve to expose the illicit
affair.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would be indebted to you for life,'' Lewinsky pleaded with
Tripp in the Ritz bar. ``I would do anything'' if Tripp didn't
disclose Lewinsky's relationship with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   But Lewinsky's offers of money and a condominium in Australia
failed, as did her pleas for mercy and her hints of possible
retribution.
</P>
<P>
   Starr's deputies detained Lewinsky several days after the
Ritz-Carlton episode, touching off a monumental problem for Clinton
and formally severing the bond between Tripp and Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   The women had met in April 1996, when they both worked at the
Pentagon after each had been transferred there from the White
House. Within several months, Lewinsky had confided in Tripp about
her relationship with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tripp became a sort of surrogate mother to Lewinsky,'' stated
one of dozens of FBI reports on Tripp in the newly released
documents. After Tripp turned against Lewinsky, she appeared before
the grand jury nine times and was interviewed by Starr's
investigators 23 times.
</P>
<P>
   But earlier, Tripp had frequently comforted Lewinsky when she
was despondent over Clinton's lack of attention to her. Tripp had
edited Lewinsky's notes to Clinton for grammatical errors. And she
had endured Lewinsky's unrelenting e-mails about her passion for
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky referred to herself to Tripp as her ``loyal freak'' and
ended many of her e-mails to Tripp with affection: ``xoxoxo.''
</P>
<P>
   For her part, Tripp freely dispensed advice to Lewinsky on
matters ranging from the ties she bought for Clinton (``positively
gorgeous...a total hit'') to the pain Lewinsky felt over not
hearing from Clinton (``the big creep.'')
</P>
<P>
   But Lewinsky's patter apparently began to grate on Tripp. ``From
now on, leave me alone,'' Tripp wrote to Lewinsky in a computer
message last October. ``Don't bother me with all your ranting and
raving and analyzing of this situation...Share this sick situation
with one of your other friends because, frankly, I'm past nauseated
about the whole thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Ten minutes later, Lewinsky responded by e-mail: ``I will
respect that. I would only like to ask that I have your assurance
everything I have shared with you remains between us.''
</P>
<P>
   It was not to be. Tripp finally turned against Lewinsky when it
became apparent late last year that both women would be called as
witnesses in Paula Jones's now-dismissed sexual-harassment suit
against Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   After she alerted Starr's office to the affair through an
anonymous telephone tip, Tripp told investigators she came forward
because she feared the president's lawyers would try to destroy her
reputation. She said she also worried about losing her job at the
Pentagon because she was a holdover political appointee from the
administration of President Bush.
</P>
<P>
   In their final get-together, at the Ritz, Tripp complained that
she was just ``a working stiff'' with none of Lewinsky's Beverly
Hills cache or resources for high-priced lawyers. ``I'm so down the
food chain,'' Tripp said.
</P>
<P>
   But Lewinsky sensed her own vulnerability as well. ``Do you
think I'm under someone's wing?'' she asked. ``I'm under God's
wing, and that's it.''

TCU CORNERS SET FOR VANDY BARRAGE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By TERRANCE HARRIS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ TCU first-year starting cornerbacks Andre
Bruce and Greg Walls understand they will be picked on because of
their inexperience.
</P>
<P>
   It's something they've come to expect.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every team across the country watches film so they know we are
young and don't have much experience,'' said Walls, a sophomore.
``But when it's time to play, it time to play. You have to grow up
quick and step out there on the island.''
</P>
<P>
   And after mixed results against the first three run-oriented
opponents this season, the tandem faces its greatest passing
challenge to date when Vanderbilt (0-3) and its duo of experienced
receivers come into Amon Carter Stadium tonight. The Commodores'
offense, which features receivers Tavarus Hogans and Elliot Carson,
will give the Frogs their closest test to what they will see
against upcoming Western Athletic Conference opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Hogans, who possesses 4.4-second speed in the 40-yard dash, is
averaging 12.1 yards per catch and Carson has 10 receptions. The
Commodores will likely put the ball in the air between 30 and 45
times, though freshman quarterback David Wallace has been
intercepted six times and has only one touchdown pass in the first
three games.
</P>
<P>
   TCU (2-1), which runs a five-member secondary scheme with three
safeties, is second in the WAC against the pass, allowing an
average of 161.3 yards per game and five touchdowns vs. six
interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The receivers from Vandy will be by far the best we've faced
this season,'' cornerbacks coach Chris Thurmond said. ``The key for
our guys is they have to play great technique and they have to stay
focused on every play, because when you play corner you can play
good for 90 plays and play bad on one and everybody sees it.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Bruce and Walls have become well aware of that. Each has
made significant plays in coverage during the first three games,
but both have also been victimized for big gains.
</P>
<P>
   Playing the ball aggressively, Bruce was beaten last week for a
37-yard touchdown in the second quarter and then for a 40-yard
reception late in the first half that helped Air Force set up a
tying touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a whole I think we've played pretty good,'' said Bruce, a
senior. ``But personally, I have yet to play my best game. I have
not been satisfied by far with these first three games. I know I
have to improve.''
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot, 184-pound Walls appeared to come a long way in
gaining confidence last week. Two weeks after the momentum-shifting
21-yard touchdown pass was caught over him against Oklahoma, Walls
came through for the Frogs in the waning moments to thwart a
Falcons' rally.
</P>
<P>
   Of the three final passes Air Force attempted from its 45, Walls
was on the deflecting end of two of those passes. Sophomore
Kendrick Patterson broke up the other.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what you live for right there,'' Walls said. ``If you
are a competitor and you have the want to, then you dream about
stuff like that.''
</P>
<P>
   TCU coach Dennis Franchione was certainly pleased for Walls,
though he counseled his player after the touchdown two weeks
earlier and he explained to him that things like that happen. He
also warned Walls to beware the next week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Greg knew they were going to come and he answered every
challenge,'' Franchione said. ``That is a real tribute to Greg
coming back like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Both players agree that having three safeties to help in
coverage helps, but they also realize that in certain blitz
packages they have to come through in single coverage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time you play cornerback, no matter how many safeties you
have on the field, you are always going to be asked to step up and
make plays,'' said Bruce, who was converted from tailback two years
ago. ``We have to be able to make plays.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's just the nature of the game.'' &QL; 
BRIEFLY &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sophomore Shane Ladewig will start in place of Jeff Garner, who
sprained his right ankle last week in his first start of the
season. Ladewig was the starter in the previous two outings. Senior
Greg Davis, who was the No. 1 center coming out of spring practice,
also took some reps this week at center. ... The Horned Frogs' next
three opponents, including Vanderbilt, are a combined 0-10 heading
into today. ... Vanderbilt has moved senior Alphonso Harvey from
defensive end to defensive tackle in an effort to shut down the
Frogs' rushing attack. ... The Commodores, who have lost 21
consecutive SEC games, have not had a winning season since 1982.

ENTERING THE FLUORIDE FRAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By EILEEN McNAMARA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   We no longer train schoolchildren to duck under their desks at
the sound of an air raid siren. We no longer build bomb shelters in
our backyards. But one remnant of the Cold War remains: Many of us
apparently still suspect that fluoridation is a sinister plot to
contaminate the American water supply.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to trace the origins of our stubborn misconceptions
about a mineral that occurs naturally in soil and water, but it is
certain that this dated debate about fluoride is a triumph of scare
tactics over scientific evidence.
</P>
<P>
   For more than 50 years, medical research has confirmed that
adding small doses of fluoride to municipal water supplies
dramatically reduces the incidence of tooth decay by strengthening
the enamel of teeth. The results are especially significant for
children _ a 40 percent improvement, in some cases _ but adults,
too, reap the preventive benefits of fluoride.
</P>
<P>
   In the same period, researchers have found no credible link
between water fluoridation and the increased risk of serious
illness suggested by alarmists. All those accumulated years of
accumulated evidence explain why more than 70 medical
organizations, including the American Dental Association, the
American Medical Association, the World Health Organization, the
federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the
Massachusetts Department of Public Health are encouraging
communities to fluoridate their water by the turn of the century.
</P>
<P>
   But in Wayland, Mass., this fall, it might as well be 1948 as
1998. The leafy western suburb is only the most recent
Massachusetts community to rehash what must be the single most
studied public health issue in the United States. Last year, it was
Natick and Methuen; before that it was Burlington, Springfield,
Worcester, and Rowley. Fewer than half of the cities and towns in
the state with municipal water supplies add fluoride. Fully
one-third of all communities in the United States do not fluoridate
their water, scared off by suggestions that fluoride is a dangerous
toxin.
</P>
<P>
   Can fluoride be toxic if ingested in large amounts? Of course it
can. So can salt. But study after study has proven that the amount
of fluoride added to municipal water supplies presents no health
risks.
</P>
<P>
   In Natick, the issue went to court last year, pitting the town's
Board of Selectmen against its Board of Health. The selectmen
argued that it would infringe on individual liberty to force
townspeople to drink fluoridated water. Health officials rejected
the report of a local citizens group that linked fluoride to
everything from brittle bones to cancer as ``a flawed document
containing opinions and conclusions not regarded as scientifically
accurate.''
</P>
<P>
   The courts ruled in favor of fluoridation in Natick, but its
ruling had no impact on the debate in the town next door. In
Wayland these days, the Pure Water Committee is squaring off
against Citizens for Better Oral Health. Each group is trying to
influence the results of a referendum on fluoride that will appear
on the Nov. 3 ballot. If turnout for the general election is as
sparse as it was for the September primary, the odds favor the
opponents of fluoridation. Human nature too often demonstrates that
we are more apt to vote when we are mobilized against something
rather than for it.
</P>
<P>
   Such an outcome would be an economic error, as well as a public
health mistake. The average annual cost of water fluoridation is 51
cents per person. Every dollar spent on fluoridation saves an
estimated $80 in dental costs. Given the rising price of dental
care, adding fluoride to our water supplies simply makes good
economic sense. To argue that parents can purchase fluoride drops
or rely on surface treatments applied by their dentist is to
suggest that only those who can afford it are entitled to the best
oral health.
</P>
<P>
   We have learned a lot in 50 years. Schoolchildren crawled out
from under their desks; parents restocked their pantries with the
canned goods retrieved from their fallout shelters; pediatric
dentists stopped rewarding their well-behaved patients with
lollipops. Isn't it also time we acknowledged that willful
ignorance is a greater public menace than any imagined Communist
conspiracy?

CLINTON PROPOSES TO LET IMF ACT SOONER TO AID COUNTRIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By DAVID E. SANGER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton on Friday proposed changing the
International Monetary Fund's strategy so it can act earlier to
help countries ward off economic crisis, rather than waiting until
disaster strikes and when bailouts are more expensive and painful.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's proposal came after a week of turmoil in world
financial markets and growing fears that the IMF's severe shortage
of money is paralyzing its ability to calm investors, who are
pulling billions of dollars out of emerging market countries.
</P>
<P>
   However, the plan would only work if all member nations provide
their full donation to the IMF, starting with the United States.
Congress has not approved the $18 billion U.S. share. The plan does
not call for new money to the IMF; rather, it would allow the IMF
to spend some of that money differently.
</P>
<P>
   The move is motivated, Clinton said, by mounting evidence that
this financial turmoil is threatening the United States.
</P>
<P>
   But details of the plan were left deliberately vague Friday,
largely so that Europe and Japan can debate and perhaps alter it at
a meeting Saturday of finance ministers and central bankers from
the world's largest industrial economies. Their meeting will
immediately precede a far larger annual meeting of the IMF and the
World Bank, sessions that this year are focused on how to stop the
global economic turmoil that many fear could trigger a worldwide
recession.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton announced the plan Friday morning in a statement he read
just before heading off to two fund-raisers, a hasty presentation
that suggested the idea had been cobbled together quickly. Clinton
said the U.S. proposal would ``provide contingent finance to help
countries ward off global financial contagion.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Later in the day, Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, who developed
the plan over the past week with Federal Reserve Chairman Alan
Greenspan, described the idea as a line of credit that the IMF
could offer to countries that are basically economically sound but
still vulnerable to investor panic. Though Rubin would not name any
specific countries, the plan might apply to nations like Brazil,
which despite taking bold measures to reform its economy has still
been shaken by nervous investors pulling out their cash because
they fear it could be the next victim of economic turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   The hope, U.S. officials said, is that the mere presence of the
``standby credit,'' akin to a guarantee from a rich relative that a
newcomer to town will be able to pay the rent, will calm investors.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``The idea is to create a precautionary credit line that
wouldn't be dispersed unless it is really needed,'' said a senior
Treasury official.
</P>
<P>
   Experts in international finance generally applauded the plan
because it appears aimed at solving one of the IMF's greatest
shortcomings: Right now it provides major aid to countries only
after they are deep in trouble, and then usually with conditions _
chiefly austerity and high interest rates to bolster their currency
_ that can trigger unemployment, recession and political backlash.
</P>
<P>
   But politically, the proposal may run into several problems.
</P>
<P>
   The plan would bring no new money into the IMF, whose coffers
are badly depleted. It would only change the way the fund spends
the money given by its 182 member nations. And right now, Clinton's
commitment to provide $18 billion in new funding to the IMF is
still stuck in Congress, after being overwhelmingly approved in the
Senate and overwhelmingly rejected in the House. A conference
committee is expected to decide in the next 10 days or so, but
other countries will not contribute their shares, for a total of
$90 to $100 billion in new money, until the United States acts.
</P>
<P>
   This puts Rubin in a precarious position at the meeting
Saturday. He must press a plan that is bound to be met with some
suspicion by Europe and Japan, at a time that the United States is
not providing its share of the financing.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton alluded to this quandary Friday during his brief speech
on the South Lawn, just two hours before the House Judiciary
Committee released thousands of pages of grand jury testimony and
other evidence in the Monica Lewinsky matter. The president said
that ``in the few working days it has left this year, the most
important thing Congress can do to protect our farmers, our
ranchers, our businesses and our workers, is to secure full funding
for the International Monetary Fund.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the third time in two weeks that Clinton has spoken at
length on the global financial crisis, after months of
near-silence. His political aides say that it is time for the
president to show a strong U.S. commitment to calming the chaos _
and, they add, it may well be good politics by focusing on the
economy while the Congress seems consumed by its investigations.
</P>
<P>
   The administration refused to set any amount for this new line
of credit for countries in economic danger, saying that will be
part of the discussions over the next several days.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of its size, new plan may help the White House sell
IMF funding on Capitol Hill by arguing that it would make the Fund
more agile and more sensitive to countries' domestic problems. But
a fierce critic of the IMF funding on Capitol Hill, House Majority
Leader Dick Armey, said he was unimpressed. ``We need to recognize
that it was the Clinton administration's own policies that
accelerated the financial collapse overseas that is threatening the
U.S. economy today,'' he said in a statement Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the president will not _ or, as yet another consequence of
his diminished leadership, cannot _ bring about real changes in
international financial institutions, then Congress must supply
leadership in his place,'' he said, insisting that all IMF loans
should have a one-year limit and the Fund be prevented from
imposing multi-year economic reform plans.
</P>
<P>
   The theory behind the new approach is that the IMF can do more
to contain economic contagion, and do it less expensively, if its
acts well in advance of a crisis. But announcing the goal and
designing the instrument are very different. Rubin noted in a press
conference Friday that investors might feel more confident if they
see that a country had resources to fall back on if they got in
trouble, diminishing the likelihood of defaulting on its debt.
</P>
<P>
   That, of course, was the theory behind the first bailout of
South Korea late last fall. The money proved insufficient, however,
and a second infusion was required. It was also the theory behind
providing $40 billion in commitments, including $3 billion in U.S.
backup financing, to Indonesia. But the political chaos in Jakarta
was so great that no amount of money from the IMF could stem the
flight of capital from the country.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the U.S. proposal could help emerging market countries
that have essentially sound economies and have enacted real
economic reforms but are still caught up in what Rubin on Friday
called the ``herd mentality'' that has led investors to pull their
money out.

PRECARIOUS ROLE OF CLINTON'S PERSONAL SECRETARY SURFACES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANN SCALES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When an Internet gossip columnist broke the story
in January of an affair between President Clinton and a former
White House intern, a desperate call went out from the White House.
The president wanted to speak with Betty Currie.
</P>
<P>
   The call rustled the president's personal secretary out of bed.
And in those first few groggy moments Clinton conveyed two
portentous messages: Currie's name had surfaced. And this was
trouble.
</P>
<P>
   At that late hour, the president also had a request: Get hold of
Monica S. Lewinsky and ``see what's happening,'' according to
Currie's grand jury testimony released Friday.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  Over many hours, Currie would try in vain to reach Lewinsky,
leaving what she described as ``a flurry of messages'' on her
pager, even going so far as to leave one that said, ``Please call.
Family emergency,'' hoping Lewinsky, who had shown concern for
Currie's family, would call.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; ``At some point in the morning _ of course, the days are all
running together now _ she called and said, `I can't talk to you,'
and hung up,'' Currie told the grand jury in her appearance as the
first witness in independent counsel Kenneth W. Starr's
investigation of the president.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; When Currie got to work at the White House, she told Clinton
what had happened with Lewinsky, and he told Currie that Lewinsky
was probably ordered by her lawyers not to talk to her.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; The episode illustrates Currie's precarious role in the
scandal, the dutiful employee who took her cues from the commander
in chief, no questions asked. But other parts of her testimony
suggest that Currie suspected something was brewing between Clinton
and Lewinsky but chose to look the other way.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; As the investigation progressed, her memory seemed to fade
along with it. In her January testimony, she spoke of the
post-midnight call about the Drudge Report. But by May, she
testified that the call from Clinton came after the Washington Post
ran its story, which was several days after Drudge.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Such gaps would persist even as she became a more fiesty and
combative witness in her subsequent grand jury appearances. But, in
sum, her testimony provides insight into Clinton's efforts to
solicit her help from the time he left his lawyers' office after
his Jan. 17 deposition in the Paula Jones case and in the days
after the scandal became front-page news.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; It has been widely reported that Clinton summoned Currie to
the White House the day after his deposition and asked her
questions such as ``I was never alone with Monica, right?'' But
Currie's testimony reveals the depth of the president's
determination, through Currie, to make contact with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Asked by prosecutors what she was supposed to talk to Lewinsky
about, Currie said: ``I don't remember. I could only think that if
she had been contacted, does she know anything, what's happening,
just _ is she okay?''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Currie said she and Lewinsky became friends, had a drink once,
and though there were rumors at the White House that Lewinsky was a
stalker, she did not believe them. She testified that she thought
Lewinsky had a crush on Clinton, and was persistent and
overbearing, but was not a bad person.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Currie resisted the idea that she served as a sort of enabler
of Clinton's relationship with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; The grand jurors, even more than the prosecutors, pressed
Currie on what she thought Lewinsky was doing during her visits
with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Currie replied: ``My own personal opinion? I didn't think
highly of it but I didn't question it either.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Juror: ``You didn't question it because you really didn't want
to know the nature of the relationship?''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Currie: ``Ultimately, that was true.''

STRAWBERRY ON YANKEES' MINDS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SIMON GONZALEZ 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Yankees outfielder Darryl Strawberry,
diagnosed with colon cancer on Thursday, delivered a brief,
videotaped message to his teammates yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said he was fine,'' manager Joe Torre said. ``He told us to
get going and beat 'em. He pointed at us and said, get 'em. The
guys got a chuckle out of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry's message came at the end of an interview he did with
NBC.
</P>
<P>
   Torre said his team was ready to play Game 3, despite the
sadness over Strawberry's condition.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think if we'd had to play \RThursday\S we would have been
able to do it,'' Torre said. ``It's just something you have to do.
You have to deal with it. We have enough veterans who understand
what our job is.''
</P>
<P>
   Game 3 pitcher David Cone, also a teammate of Strawberry's when
they were with the New York Mets in the late 1980s, was obviously
upset when he heard the news Thursday. But Torre had no qualms
about starting him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really don't even want to talk to him about it,'' Torre
said. ``David's been around long enough and he's had to deal with
so much of his own stress over the last two years \Ran aneurysm in
his right arm\S, I don't know that it's really necessary. If it was
a young pitcher, maybe. But in David Cone's case I think he'll be
ready to pitch.''
</P>
<P>
   Torre said getting to play a game might be the best tonic for
taking the Yankees' minds off their stricken teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Selfishly speaking, it gives you some place to hide and takes
your mind off the sadness,'' Torre said.
Missing bat
While the Yankees clearly missed Strawberry's presence, there also
was the possibility they might miss his bat. Strawberry was tied
for third on the team with 24 homers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to be less one weapon,'' Torre said. ``Darryl
helps you in a number of ways. He's an impact guy. If he's in the
lineup batting sixth or seventh, not only does he improve that
position but he improves the position in front of him.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps more important, he wasn't available as a left-handed
hitter on the bench. He hit two pinch-hit grand slams this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``You will pitch around him, you will use your bullpen
accordingly,'' Torre said. ``There's no question if I'm on the
other side I'm managing to keep him out of the game.''
Third best
</P>
<P>
   Todd Zeile was playing third base last night because of Torre.
</P>
<P>
   Zeile was a catcher until 1991, when Torre, then the Cardinals'
manager, asked him to move to third.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't like that when I mentioned it,'' Torre said.
</P>
<P>
   Torre made the move because he had Tom Pagnozzi to put behind
the plate and because he thought Zeile would hit better without the
wear and tear of catching.
</P>
<P>
   ``He felt that it diminished his value,'' Torre said. ``He
didn't like it at first, but in the long run he's happy he did
it.''
Come back, Shane
</P>
<P>
   Game 2 hero Shane Spencer was in the lineup again for Game 3.
The rookie outfielder homered, singled and scored twice in the
Yankees' 3-1 victory to earn a second start in left field.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Raines replaced Chili Davis as the designated hitter, making
his first start of the Division Series.
Production wanted
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees won the first two games despite a lack of production
from the top two-thirds of the batting order, but Torre didn't
count on them doing it again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I definitely need them,'' he said. ``We're fortunate, even
though we pitched very well, to be where we are. It would make like
a lot easier if we started hitting the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   The 1-6 hitters were a combined 5-for-40 in the first two games.
Going dark
</P>
<P>
   Several power interruptions darkened The Ballpark in Arlington
before the game. During the first, around 5 p.m., Torre was
addressing the media in the interview room.
</P>
<P>
   After a moment of silence, Torre continued answering his
question then told this story:
</P>
<P>
   During a game in the 1970s in Montreal, he was at bat when the
lights went out. Unfortunately for him, the pitcher had just
started his wind-up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I took a huge step out of there,'' he said with a laugh.

   Following are excerpts from conversations between Linda Tripp, a
Pentagon aide, and Monica Lewinsky, a former White House intern,
and maybe others. The conversations were secretly recorded by Mrs.
Tripp between Oct. 3, 1997, and Jan. 13, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   A Letter to the President
</P>
<P>
   Oct. 6, 1997. Ms. Lewinsky decides to write a letter to the
president asking for a job in New York by Dec. 1, 1997, and asks
Mrs. Tripp for her help with the text.
</P>
<P>
   MS. LEWINSKY: Well, I typed it up.
</P>
<P>
   MRS. TRIPP: Okay.
</P>
<P>
   MS. LEWINSKY: So, I don't know. Okay. ``It has been made clear
to me that there is no way I'm going to be able to come back to the
White House. The reasons are too lengthy to get into in a letter,
and I can explain them to you in person. ``I want you to know that
it has always been and remains to be more important to me to have
you in my life than to come back. Having said that, I am extremely
underchallenged and unhappy in my current position.''
</P>
<P>
   MRS. TRIPP: Hmm.
</P>
<P>
   MS. LEWINSKY: It's too choppy. ``Can you please secure a
position for me at the U.N. as a GS-12 or 13 beginning 1 December.
I would like to give my two-weeks' notice as soon as possible and
have some time to get myself together. ``My roommate, a k a my mom,
has recently taken an apartment in New York, and we are in the
process of looking for something else in D.C. It doesn't look like
I can stay here. I need to be _ if I need something before we make
any more commitments here.''
</P>
<P>
   MRS. TRIPP: Mm-hmm.
</P>
<P>
   MS. LEWINSKY: Before we make any commitments ... ``Handsome: You
have been distant the past few months and shut me out. I don't know
why. Is it that you don't like me anymore or are you scared? Please
let me come see you this evening or Thursday night. I want to hear
it, I want to hear it from you. No one else. I don't think it is
asking too much after all that has happened to ask to have this
discussion in person.''
</P>
<P>
   MRS. TRIPP: Brilliant, except for the one part.
</P>
<P>
   MS. LEWINSKY: Which one part?
</P>
<P>
   MRS. TRIPP: If you put a 12 or 13 there, I am going to throw up.
</P>
<P>
   MS. LEWINSKY: Okay. Well, I don't have to put it? What do you
mean?
</P>
<P>
   MRS. TRIPP: Oh, Monica, Monica, Monica. For people who are not
even in any situation, they can do better.
</P>
<P>
   MS. LEWINSKY: Oh, Linda, please don't start with me on that.
</P>
<P>
   MRS. TRIPP: He would want to do better, so don't limit him is
what I'm saying.
</P>
<P>
   MS. LEWINSKY: Okay. You know what I'll do. Okay, this is what
I'll do. I will bring all my little paperwork that I had made up to
have my meeting ... and show him there and say, ``This is what I am
making. This is what I should be making. This is what I'd like to
make.''
</P>
<P>
   MRS. TRIPP: (Sigh)
</P>
<P>
   MS. LEWINSKY: Okay, look, Linda _
</P>
<P>
   MRS. TRIPP: Look. In New York _
</P>
<P>
   MS. LEWINSKY: _ you know, this isn't just one way.
</P>
<P>
   MRS. TRIPP: Let me just say this _ no, no, no. New York, the
cost of living is even higher than here.
</P>
<P>
   MS. LEWINSKY: I know it is, but you'll also get a cost of living
adjustment.
</P>
<P>
   MRS. TRIPP: No, it's not significant.
</P>
<P>
   MS. LEWINSKY: No, but let me tell you something. Okay? I just
want you to look at this from his position for a minute. Okay?
</P>
<P>
   MRS. TRIPP: Mm-hmm.
</P>
<P>
   MS. LEWINSKY: He's thinking to himself, ``I'm going to take this
girl and I'm moving her. And the reason I'm moving her and the
reason all this is happening is because she was my girlfriend. And
I'm going to make her go from making $30,000 a year to $90,000 a
year.''
</P>
<P>
   MRS. TRIPP: No, no. But what I'm saying is this is done
routinely.
</P>
<P>
   MS. LEWINSKY: But _ I know. But the reason it's done is not
routine. I think that's going to scare the ... out of him.
</P>
<P>
   MRS. TRIPP: Well, no, because actually, he doesn't have to
establish the grade. That's, that's out of his hands. What he can
do _
</P>
<P>
   MS. LEWINSKY: Okay. Well, look, I'll take it out of the letter.
</P>
<P>
   MRS. TRIPP: Okay.
</P>
<P>
   MS. LEWINSKY: I'll take it out of the letter.
</P>
<P>
   MRS. TRIPP: I would just say let's not limit yourself.

   A Talk With Jordan
</P>
<P>
   Oct. 16, 1997. Ms. Lewinsky tells Mrs. Tripp of a conversation
with Vernon Jordan, a friend of President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   MRS. TRIPP: So you talked to him this morning?
</P>
<P>
   MS. LEWINSKY: So I talked to him around _ it was around 3:00, I
think.
</P>
<P>
   MRS. TRIPP: Okay.
</P>
<P>
   MS. LEWINSKY: And, uh, his general attitude was, you know, ``As
long as you have a job that you're going to, I _ you know, I want
you to be happy, so whatever you want to do.''
</P>
<P>
   MRS. TRIPP: Uh. So he wasn't suspicious.
</P>
<P>
   MS. LEWINSKY: Of course he was suspicious.
</P>
<P>
   MRS. TRIPP: He was?
</P>
<P>
   MS. LEWINSKY: You know, he asked me point blank if I, you know,
had a thing with him.
</P>
<P>
   MRS. TRIPP: He asked you point blank. No, he didn't.
</P>
<P>
   MS. LEWINSKY: Yes, he did.
</P>
<P>
   MRS. TRIPP: What did he say?
</P>
<P>
   MS. LEWINSKY: He said, ``Did you have an affair with him?''
</P>
<P>
   MRS. TRIPP: He said, ``Did you have an affair with the
President?'' You're kidding.
</P>
<P>
   MS. LEWINSKY: Not ``the P,'' but with him. I mean, obviously
that's what he meant, he just didn't say the name.
</P>
<P>
   MRS. TRIPP: Really?
</P>
<P>
   MS. LEWINSKY: And I said no. I mean, I said, ``But to tell you
the truth, if I had, I would say no still.''
</P>
<P>
   MRS. TRIPP: You said that?
</P>
<P>
   MS. LEWINSKY: Uh-huh.
</P>
<P>
   MRS. TRIPP: And what did he say?
</P>
<P>
   MS. LEWINSKY: Nothing.
</P>
<P>
   MRS. TRIPP: (Laughter.) So I wonder if he wonders.
</P>
<P>
   MS. LEWINSKY: I'm sure he wonders. I'm sure he _
</P>
<P>
   MRS. TRIPP: Did you tell him he was helping you?
</P>
<P>
   MS. LEWINSKY: Mm-hmm.
</P>
<P>
   MRS. TRIPP: Did he question that?
</P>
<P>
   MS. LEWINSKY: No.
</P>
<P>
   MRS. TRIPP: See, that was the part I thought he would question.
</P>
<P>
   MS. LEWINSKY: No, because I _ I didn't really _ it was _ it came
out fine. It was, you know _ oh ((WORDS DELETED)) hold on.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, my God. Uh _ okay. I told that, you know _ see I knew this
would work with him. I knew that bringing in _ just the whole idea
that, like, I had conversations with him. Do you know what I mean?
</P>
<P>
   MRS. TRIPP: Really?
</P>
<P>
   MS. LEWINSKY: Just that whole idea makes everything almost okay.
</P>
<P>
   MRS. TRIPP: Really?
</P>
<P>
   MS. LEWINSKY: Yeah. I mean, this is like _ you know, he's like a
normal person.
</P>
<P>
   MRS. TRIPP: Yeah.
</P>
<P>
   MS. LEWINSKY: You know what I mean? Like, you know, we're jaded,
we're very jaded.
</P>
<P>
   MRS. TRIPP: So having a conversation with the big creep is no
big deal to us.
</P>
<P>
   MS. LEWINSKY: Right.
</P>
<P>
   MRS. TRIPP: But it is to _ yeah.
</P>
<P>
   MS. LEWINSKY: You know, so he _ he was very cool. So, you know,
I _ I explained, I said, uh, you know, this, that (coughing). So he
said, you know, ``That's what happens.''
</P>
<P>
   I was really upset in general. I called you when I got _ I went
out this morning, and I came home, and I was so upset, Linda.
</P>
<P>
   MRS. TRIPP: Why?
</P>
<P>
   MS. LEWINSKY: I was just _ I was so angry, and I just _ I was
disgusted, like nauseous.
</P>
<P>
   MRS. TRIPP: About?
</P>
<P>
   MS. LEWINSKY: About what's happened. Like the fact that I'm not
going back there, just nauseous about it.
</P>
<P>
   MRS. TRIPP: I know. I keep going back and forth with the same
thing.
</P>
<P>
   MS. LEWINSKY: You know, but _ (sigh). They _ they were never
gonna to do it, you know, so _ because, look, the truth is is that
_ plus they had had three weeks and there was still nothing. All
they had to do was ((words deleted)) create something.
</P>
<P>
   MRS. TRIPP: Or at least give you an update.
</P>
<P>
   MS. LEWINSKY: Right, you know.
</P>
<P>
   MRS. TRIPP: ``It looks like this,'' or, ``It looks like that.''
But you got nothing.
</P>
<P>
   MS. LEWINSKY: Nothing, you know.
</P>
<P>
   MRS. TRIPP: Which _ you know, then I wonder if you had pushed,
would that have ever come to anything. But I don't know.
</P>
<P>
   MS. LEWINSKY: I don't think so. I don't think so, you know.
</P>
<P>
   MRS. TRIPP: (Sigh.) Well, I _ I have such mixed feelings about
the whole thing.
</P>
<P>
   MS. LEWINSKY: I mean, I _ don't you think the telling part of it
was how quickly there was movement on this?
</P>
<P>
   MRS. TRIPP: As soon as you said New York.
</P>
<P>
   MS. LEWINSKY: Mm-hmm.
</P>
<P>
   MRS. TRIPP: Mm-hmm. Well, It's _ It's _ without a doubt, easier
for them to do this. Do I think it was impossible the other way?
No. I just don't know _ I don't know whether I trust them to do
what they say they were going to do.

   White House Involvement
</P>
<P>
   Oct. 16, 1997. The women discuss whether Erskine Bowles, the
White House chief of staff, should be involved in finding Ms.
Lewinsky a job.
</P>
<P>
   MRS. TRIPP: If he _ if he is at all involved, this is right up
his alley, too. He's got more connections in industry and every
other thing than you can imagine.
</P>
<P>
   MS. LEWINSKY: Along with the ((WORDS DELETED)) too.
</P>
<P>
   MRS. TRIPP: Well ((WORD DELETED)) he's amazing. So between the
two of them, he can _
</P>
<P>
   MS. LEWINSKY: Well, see, I don't really think _ I'm going to
tell him that I don't think Erskine should have anything to do with
this. I don't think anybody who works there should.
</P>
<P>
   MRS. TRIPP: I don't see how that's _ how that's a problem.
</P>
<P>
   MS. LEWINSKY: Because look at what happened with Webb Hubbell.
I'm just saying _
</P>
<P>
   MRS. TRIPP: Oh, please.
</P>
<P>
   MS. LEWINSKY: I'm just saying _

<P>
   MRS. TRIPP. (Sigh)
</P>
<P>
   MS. LEWINSKY: You know?
</P>
<P>
   MRS. TRIPP: Yeah, but this isn't _ are you _ are you telling me
that you think Erskine doesn't place people every day of the week?
I mean, come on. That's how networking works.
</P>
<P>
   MS. LEWINSKY: But not people _
</P>
<P>
   MRS. TRIPP: He has no connection _
</P>
<P>
   MS. LEWINSKY: _ who worked _
</P>
<P>
   MRS. TRIPP: He has no connection with you.
</P>
<P>
   MS. LEWINSKY: I don't know. I just think Vernon is a lot safer.

<P>
   MRS. TRIPP: Well, I don't remember during the Webb Hubbell
thing, was Vernon mentioned?
</P>
<P>
   MS. LEWINSKY: Yeah, but there's a big difference. I think
somebody could construe, okay? Somebody could construe or say,
``Well, they gave her a job to shut her up. They made her happy.''
</P>
<P>
   MRS. TRIPP: Hmpf.
</P>
<P>
   MS. LEWINSKY: ``And he works for the government and shouldn't
have done that.'' And with the other one you can't say that.
</P>
<P>
   MRS. TRIPP: Well, that's true.
</P>
<P>
   MS. LEWINSKY: That's why I think it's not bright. ...
</P>
<P>
   In the same conversation, Ms. Lewinsky speaks of visiting the
president and of a recommendation from John Hilley, the White House
director of legislative affairs, the office in which she had
worked.
</P>
<P>
   MS. LEWINSKY: Okay. Huh. Betty came back to get me, okay? We
were in the back office. We start _ the three of us start to walk
out. He's got one arm around Betty and one arm around me.
</P>
<P>
   MRS. TRIPP: Aw.
</P>
<P>
   MS. LEWINSKY: Okay? He kisses me on the head _
</P>
<P>
   MRS. TRIPP: Hmpf.
</P>
<P>
   MS. LEWINSKY: _ and then we _ we kind of start and he _ and then
he kind of grabs my arm and he said, ``Oh, one more thing I have to
tell you.'' And so Betty kind of walked out, she walked outside.
And he _ then he told me.
</P>
<P>
   MRS. TRIPP: And how did he say it?
</P>
<P>
   MS. LEWINSKY: He said that _ he said, ``Oh, one other thing that
I talked to Erskine about was trying to get John Hilley to give you
either a written recommendation or a verbal, you know,
recommendation so that, you know, you _ you feel you have a _ you
know, you _ he'll give you a good recommendation for your work
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Concern for Lewinsky
</P>
<P>
   Nov. 20, 1997. Ms. Lewinsky discusses Paula Jones, and Mrs.
Tripp expresses concern for Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   MRS. TRIPP: You're in a horrible predicament right now.
</P>
<P>
   MS. LEWINSKY: I know.
</P>
<P>
   MRS. TRIPP: You're in a horrible predicament right now. And you
know what they say, the best offense is a good deep _ the best
defense is a good offense? Um, my big fear has been all along that
because of your repeated messages over there and phone calls and
things, messengers and all this stuff, my big fear has been that
instead of waiting for the off chance that you might do something,
that's been my big fear.
</P>
<P>
   MS. LEWINSKY: Then they do something. Linda, then that's what
they'll do. I'm not _ I would rather let them say something bad
about me than get into a whole thing because you know what? I have
zero respect. I have zero respect.
</P>
<P>
   And this has nothing to do with him. It has to do with the fact
that this person is doing a good job for this country. I have zero
respect for Paula Jones because of that.
</P>
<P>
   MRS. TRIPP: I know.
</P>
<P>
   MS. LEWINSKY: Because she is causing trouble for this country.
</P>
<P>
   MRS. TRIPP: Mm-hmm.
</P>
<P>
   MS. LEWINSKY: Kathleen, I have zero respect for that. I have
zero respect for people like that, and I would never do it. I don't
care if they get out of there and say I'm a crazy person who is
chasing him. I don't care.
</P>
<P>
   MRS. TRIPP: That is what they would say.
</P>
<P>
   MS. LEWINSKY: Well, then that's what they'll say. And anybody
who says anything to the contrary, be it my friend or not my
friend, I will deny it.
</P>
<P>
   MRS. TRIPP: I know.
</P>
<P>
   MS. LEWINSKY: Because that's not the kind of person I am. I
think it's disgusting. I think what they're doing is disgusting, if
that's what they do, you know.
</P>
<P>
   I don't think so. I don't _ I don't think that's their fear.
Because if they were really afraid _ as I said to you today, if
they were really afraid that I would do something, they would have
brought me back.
</P>
<P>
   MRS. TRIPP: Yeah.
</P>
<P>
   MS. LEWINSKY: They're more afraid of what other people would
say.
</P>
<P>
   MRS. TRIPP: Yeah, you're right.
</P>
<P>
   MS. LEWINSKY: So _
</P>
<P>
   MRS. TRIPP: So it would have been easier to just put you right
back there where you would be happy and not, you know _ you're
right.
</P>
<P>
   MRS. TRIPP: So I just _ it doesn't matter. I don't they're gonna
do that, and I think that's the being paranoid thinking it. So _
</P>
<P>
   MRS. TRIPP: (Sighing) Well, I'm happy your mother's coming home
tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   MS. LEWINSKY: Me, too.
</P>
<P>
   MRS. TRIPP: Because this is _ this is beyond belief.
</P>
<P>
   You said before that you'll hang up on him when he calls and
then you don't. So don't chastise yourself if you don't.
</P>
<P>
   MS. LEWINSKY: Well, I don't want to talk to him. I mean, there's
nothing to say. There is nothing to say.
</P>
<P>
   MRS. TRIPP: Well, let me put it to you this way. By hanging up
and saying you're telling your parents and then hanging up the
phone, you're saying a whole hell of a lot more than you could ever
do in a 20-minute conversation.
</P>
<P>
   MS. LEWINSKY: I know. (tape skip) (inaudible) my mom will kill
me if I don't tell him _ make it clear at some point that I'm not
going to hurt him, because _ see my mom's big fear is that he's
going to send somebody out to kill me.
</P>
<P>
   MRS. TRIPP: Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
</P>
<P>
   MS. LEWINSKY: So _
</P>
<P>
   MRS. TRIPP: Shut up.
</P>
<P>
   MS. LEWINSKY: Well, that's what she thinks.
</P>
<P>
   MRS. TRIPP: Oh, my God. Don't even say such an asinine thing.
He's not that stupid. He's an arrogant ((word deleted)) but he's
not that stupid.
</P>
<P>
   MS. LEWINSKY: Well, you know, accidents happen.
</P>
<P>
   MRS. TRIPP: Oh, please, Don't even say that. Someone will walk
over my grave when you say things like that. (Sighing.)
</P>
<P>
   I believe he knows that you're not going to hurt him. If you
have to say it, say it. Look, all you have to say is, ``You have
nothing to worry about from me.''

CLINTON LEGAL TEAM CHASTISES COMMITTEE ON IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY
PREPARATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By ALISON MITCHELL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton's lawyers on Friday accused the
House Judiciary Committee of rushing toward a ``dangerous,
standless inquiry'' on impeachment and argued that under historical
precedent none of the evidence put forward by Kenneth Starr, the
Whitewater independent counsel, ``is remotely sufficient to warrant
an impeachment inquiry.''
</P>
<P>
   The legal team, made up of both Clinton's private attorneys and
the White House counsel's office, presented their arguments in a
30-page memorandum on impeachment sent to the committee as it
prepared to vote Monday to recommend the first formal impeachment
inquiry into a president since Richard Nixon. They contended that
history showed that neither private sexual misconduct nor perjury
met the constitutional standard.
</P>
<P>
   Echoing some of the arguments of House Democrats, Clinton's
lawyers chastised the committee for being prepared to open an
inquiry without seeking to define a standard for impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   The members of the committee, they said, ``will be asked to
judge whether the evidence before them (untested by the usual
adversarial process) provides any reason to believe that the
president has violated a standard of conduct that they have made no
effort to define.''
</P>
<P>
   The president's legal team asserted that precedent argued
against impeachment. They cited the findings of the 1974 staff
report of the impeachment inquiry into Nixon that an impeachable
offense involves ``injury to the state.''
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers also pointed to a congressional decision more than
200 years ago not to impeach Treasury Secretary Alexander Hamilton
for secret payments to a convicted securities swindler to cover up
Hamilton's affair with the swindler's wife.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is apparent from the Hamilton case that the framers did not
regard private sexual misconduct as creating an impeachable
offense,'' the lawyers argued. ``It is also apparent that efforts
to cover up such private behavior, including even paying hush money
to induce someone to destroy documents, did not meet the
standard.''
</P>
<P>
   The memorandum was sent to the Capitol on a day when the House
released a final 4,600 pages of evidence sent by Kenneth Starr. The
final release of documents by the House Judiciary Committee set the
stage for the committee on Monday to forward to the full House a
recommendation that it approve the first formal impeachment inquiry
into a president since 1974.
</P>
<P>
   In advance of the Monday meeting both parties sparred for
advantage. The Republican chairman of the House Judiciary Committee
on Friday accused Democrats of seeking a ``hasty conclusion rather
than the right conclusion'' to the investigation into Clinton as
Democrats proposed a limited impeachment inquiry that would end by
late November.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans, who have a 21-16 edge on the committee, plan to
recommend that the House use the same phrasing it did in the
Watergate inquiry into Richard Nixon and vote to investigate
``fully and completely'' whether grounds exist to impeach Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Conceding that they will be unable to stop the
Republican-controlled House from opening a formal inquiry,
Democrats unveiled their own counterproposal Friday. The intent,
Democrats said, was to allow party members to cast a vote before
the mid-term elections for further investigation of the president,
but keep them from supporting the Republicans' motion for an
open-ended inquiry.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The plan had something for almost everyone in the fractious
Democratic caucus. It calls for further study of the president's
actions, but leaves open the possibility that a full blown
impeachment inquiry could be avoided. It wraps up proceedings
before Thanksgiving. It limits the investigation to the matters
surrounding Clinton's relationship with Monica Lewinsky. And it
does not rule out censure as a possible punishment for the
president.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the fair way to proceed,'' said Rep. Jerrold Nadler,
D-New York. ``Not only fair to the president but fair the American
people.''
</P>
<P>
   In his own report to Congress, Starr cited 11 actions by the
president that could constitute grounds for impeachment: instances
of lying under oath about his affair with Ms. Lewinsky, obstruction
of justice and abuse of power in concealing the relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Just like Clinton's lawyers, the Democrats on Friday also put a
heavy emphasis on defining an impeachable offense.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Democratic plan an impeachment inquiry would be
conducted in two phases. The first phase, which would begin Oct.
12, would focus on setting a standard defining conduct that should
lead to impeachment. Then the committee would hold hearings to
determine if any of the evidence and charges submitted by Starr
rose to that standard.
</P>
<P>
   If the committee found they did not, it could ``consider the
propriety of alternative sanctions,'' meaning some kind of censure
or fine. But if it did find sufficient evidence for further
proceedings the committee could vote for a second phase of
hearings, amounting to a formal inquiry, that would last until Nov.
17.
</P>
<P>
   The committee could then recommend to the full House
impeachment, no action or ``alternative sanctions'' such as censure
of the president.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Henry Hyde, the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee,
called the Democrats' proposal ``made to order for the White House
but not for the American people.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are committed to an expeditious search for the truth,'' he
said. ``But spending a month studying the law of impeachment in the
abstract, while brushing aside documented allegations of serious
crimes by the president does nothing to further that goal.''
</P>
<P>
   He said time limits on an inquiry, censure options and efforts
to limit the scope of the inquiry, as well as efforts to define an
impeachable offense before beginning an investigation have ``no
historical or constitutional basis in any previous impeachment
inquiry.''
</P>
<P>
   He noted that it was the Democrats who had initially called for
the committee to follow the same procedures that the House
Judiciary Committee used during the Watergate hearings. He said
that he had agreed to that request, and would provide shared
investigatory and subpoena powers with the Democrats and allow the
president's lawyers access to committee proceedings even when the
committee is meeting is in closed session. ``These are highly
unusual accommodations,'' he noted.
</P>
<P>
   While the Democratic alternative is not expected to pass, it was
designed to give uneasy Democrats a way to support an inquiry while
voting against the Republican proposal. Democrats do not want the
House vote to appear bipartisan.
</P>
<P>
   House Democrats said they were still worried that anywhere from
35 to 70 Democrats facing tough re-election campaigns could yet
defect from the party position when the House ends its session next
week with the vote on opening an impeachment inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side of the Capitol, Sen. Orrin Hatch, the chairman
of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said that if members of Congress
consider ``the totality of evidence'' against Clinton it will meet
the standard for impeachment of ``high crimes and misdemeanors.''
But he said that Congress must also weigh what is in the best
interest of the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe in redemption,'' Hatch said of Clinton at a
breakfast with reporters. ``I believe people can overcome their
faults. Naturally my heart would like to see him make it through
this.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``in totality there's room to impeach here,'' but he
predicted the Senate would ultimately lack the votes to convict
Clinton. Conviction requires a two-thirds majority.

 &HT;    Albanian student finds shelter with Ohio couple
 &HT;    By Cathy Mong
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Genti Sulaj, an 18-year-old senior foreign
exchange student on his way home to war-torn Albania, stepped off a
plane in greater Cincinnati on May 22 and boarded a Greyhound to
Dayton in search of fast cars and political asylum.
</P>
<P>
   Through a series of events some see as divine intervention,
Sulaj has found shelter here with a Miamisburg couple; he has
petitioned the U.S. Department of Immigration and Naturalization
and is awaiting an interview that will determine if it is too
dangerous for him to return to Tirana, the capital of Albania.
</P>
<P>
   Miamisburg resident Frances Holloway has opened her home to the
teen. ``The Lord led him to me,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Holloway was introduced to Sulaj at The Other Place daytime
shelter after she inquired about finding someone to help her with
some hourly work. She and her husband, Charles, immediately took to
Sulaj and were moved by his plight.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's taught me so many things,'' Holloway said, emotion
working her face. ``That he wants away from the hardships, the
killing. Our children take too much for granted.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I told her, 'if something happens, even if I die, don't send
my body home,''' Sulaj said.
</P>
<P>
   Sulaj's detour to Dayton was a case of mistaken identity after
thinking the map said ``Daytona'' and referred to the Florida
speedway. ``Fortunately,'' he said, ``I also love fast airplanes''
and he discovered the Air Force Museum.
</P>
<P>
   On May 22, Sulaj left Idaho where he had spent the last half of
his senior year of high school as part of a foreign exchange
program, Council for Educational Travel U.S.A. When his flight
stopped in Cincinnati, Sulaj's luggage continued on _ without him.
He called immigration and was told not to expect asylum in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   After a sleepless night in a bus station, he headed to Dayton.
</P>
<P>
   With 2 weeks of legal student status remaining, $200 in his
wallet, no place to call home and all his worldly belongings
stuffed in a duffle bag, he stepped into the unknown rather than
risk possible death because of his parents' political standing.
</P>
<P>
   His mother, Hennerietta Sulaj, is a high school mathematics
teacher who, in 1989, was suspected of tearing up a photo of former
dictator Enver Hoxha. His father, Xhevdet Sulaj, spent 24 years in
the former government's military, specializing in artillery. Both
are regarded as enemies of the present government, Sulaj said. His
father now works a few hours a day at a flea market.
</P>
<P>
   Sulaj, fluent in four languages and also gifted in mathematics,
hopes to be able to attend college here and study mathematics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's just have a life,'' he said. ``No fancy home. As long as
I have normal life.''
</P>
<P>
   He wants to have a family some day, and bring his family, his
parents and 16-year-old sister, Aelsa, to the states.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Sulaj studied a long letter he received from Aelsa.
``She says, 'How is Dayton? Beautiful?'''
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything here is very beautiful,'' he said. ``Over there,
it's a different world.''

COLON CANCER RARE FOR SOMEONE OF STRAWBERRY'S AGE, 36 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By LAWRENCE K. ALTMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The colon cancer for which the Yankee outfielder
Darryl Strawberry will undergo surgery Saturday afternoon is common
among people over 50 but is rare for someone his age, 36.
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry is one of an estimated 800 American men in the 35-39
age group who will be diagnosed with colon and rectal cancer this
year, according to figures provided by the American Cancer Society.
The figure represents 1.2 percent of the estimated 64,000 American
men who will develop colon cancer in 1998. About 77,000 American
women of all ages will also develop colon and rectal cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Yankees officials and Strawberry's wife, Charisse, have said
that doctors have offered him a good prognosis on the basis of
preliminary tests and are confident that he will be able to play
next season.
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry said he has suffered abdominal cramping in recent
weeks. The complaints led to a CAT scan X-ray that was performed
Wednesday and other tests that detected what team officials said
was a walnut-sized mass in his colon.
</P>
<P>
   The operation is expected to be performed by Dr. George Todd at
Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center in Manhattan. Charisse
Strawberry said her husband would not need a colostomy, the
creation of a new opening through the abdomen to eliminate wastes
from the bowel.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors and Yankee officials have provided few specific details
about Strawberry's case, but Yankees team physician Stuart Hershon
said Friday that Strawberry's cancer was in a favorable location
for removal from his colon.
</P>
<P>
   Crucial information will come during the operation when Todd is
expected to remove the cancer and the segment of normal colon to
either side of it. As is usual in such operations, Todd will also
feel Strawberry's entire intestines, liver and other tissues for
evidence of spread of the cancer. Also, pathologists will look
through a microscope at the tissues removed in the operation. They
include the cancer, adjacent segment of colon, and lymph nodes.
</P>
<P>
   Information from the surgical and pathological examinations will
be used to classify, or stage, the cancer. There are several
staging systems, and the category in Strawberry's case will depend
on which one the Columbia doctors use.
</P>
<P>
   The staging information and pathology report will help determine
what anti-cancer therapy Strawberry will need after he recuperates
from the operation.
</P>
<P>
   If the cancer is at a relatively early stage, as described, the
five-year survival rate is 92 percent, according to American Cancer
Society statistics. But if the cancer has spread to nearby organs
or lymph nodes, the five-year survival drops to 64 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The incidence of colon and rectal cancer rises sharply after age
50.
</P>
<P>
   Over all, colon cancer is second to lung cancer as the most
common fatal cancer in the United States. Colon and rectal cancers
are expected to account for 11 percent of new cases of cancer in
this country this year. The 47,700 estimated deaths from colon
cancer will account for about 10 percent of all the cancer deaths,
cancer society statistics show.

NOW IT'S UP TO SCHOUREK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN SHAUGHNESSY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Into the breach ... Pete Schourek. Alongside the ghosts
of Denny Galehouse, Jim Burton, and Bobby Sprowl.
</P>
<P>
   It has come down to sudden death. The Red Sox must beat the
Indians Saturday or their season is over. Mo Vaughn's Red Sox
career might be over. And there'll be no Athens-Sparta seven-game
war between the Red Sox and the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   Pedro Martinez, the Sox' $75 million reigning Cy Young winner _
who is 3-0 with a 1.97 ERA against the Tribe this year _ is ready
to pitch. Pedro has asked for the ball. But unless there's a change
of philosophy, he won't get the ball Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked for it and I was denied,'' said Pedro.
</P>
<P>
   That's right, sports fans. With the season hanging in the
balance and Pedro begging for the baseball, Red Sox Nation will
turn its lonley eyes to lefthander Pete Schourek, who is 1-3 with a
4.30 ERA since coming over from the Astros Aug. 6.
</P>
<P>
   Call me obsessed, but Peter Schourek is an anagram for RUTH KEEP
SCORE. Go ahead. Do it yourself.
</P>
<P>
   Schourek, Boston's Cosmo Kramer look-alike, might spin a beauty
this afternoon and make Jimy Williams and Joe Kerrigan look like
genuises. But the flip side is ugly. If the Sox lose because of a
poor outing by their starter, they will have been eliminated from
the best-of-five American League Division Series in four games with
their $75 million ace _ who wants to pitch _ hurling only once. And
if that happens, then Schourek joins Galehouse (1948 playoff bomb),
Burton (1975 World Series hard luck), and Sprowl (1978 Boston
Massacre) in the Red Sox' Hall of Pain. And Jimy Williams becomes a
stubborn lunkhead alongside Joe McCarthy, Darrell Johnson, and Don
Zimmer.
</P>
<P>
   The controversy started immediately after Cleveland beat Boston
in Game 2. Williams and Kerrigan were adamant about keeping the
rotation in turn and dismissed all suggestions of change. They
thought the questions were premature. After all, it was still 1-1
and not yet 2-1. They said any talk of moving Pedro up would be a
sign of panic.
</P>
<P>
   Kerrigan would not budge Thursday. He said he caught Pedro on
the side Thursday and that Martinez could not be effective on three
days' rest in Game 4. He said Pedro was weary from this year and
had pitched on three days' rest only twice in his career.
</P>
<P>
   After Thursday's 4-3 loss, one in which Williams certainly will
be critiqued for employing Dennis Eckersley in the ninth (akin to
Al Nipper in Game 7 of the '86 World Series), the Boston manager
stuck to his game plan.
</P>
<P>
   Williams said, ``Pete Schourek is going to pitch tomorrow. Yes,
he is.''
</P>
<P>
   Question: Why not pitch Martinez in Game 4?
</P>
<P>
   Williams: ``Because of Schourek.''
</P>
<P>
   Question: Are you tempted to use Pedro?
</P>
<P>
   Williams: ``Good question. Tempted? Yes. Come to my senses? No.
That's my opinion. I'll live with it. That's the right decision for
our ball club.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Sox locker room, Martinez dressed quietly and repeatedly
pointed toward Williams's office when he was asked about the
decision to go with Schourek.
</P>
<P>
   When first approached, Pedro said, ``I don't have anything to
say. Whatever Jimy says, I will do.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he started to warm up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to, of course. I'd like to pitch every day. I'm
available if he decides to change his mind. I'm able to. I already
asked.''
</P>
<P>
   He asked for the ball.
</P>
<P>
   Scary. If the Sox go down Saturday, they do so knowing that the
ace asked for the ball and was denied.
</P>
<P>
   Pedro was respectful toward his manager but made no mistake
about his desire to pitch the big game. He said he listened to
Williams's logic about needing another starter for Game 5 if the
Sox win Game 4. He said he appreciated the brass looking out for
his long-term health. Then, sounding like a true Red Sox fan, he
said, ``But this is the reason they have us here.''
</P>
<P>
   Amen. The reason you have a stopper is for a game like
Saturday's. And the Sox are taking a huge gamble by micromanaging
this series into the ground. Their best pitcher says he can pitch.
He wants the ball. And they won't give it to him because they are
worried about his health and about having him ready for Game 5.
</P>
<P>
   But we all know there won't be a Game 5 without a victory in
Game 4.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel great,'' said Martinez. ``I threw on the side and I
feel like I could pitch. I asked Joe as soon as we got in
Saturday.''
</P>
<P>
   Kerrigan was in no mood to discuss the controversy after hearing
of Pedro's remarks.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a dead issue,'' said the pitching coach.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the manager's office was closed.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the Sox brass will bow to the wishes of Pedro and the
fandom and reverse this decision by game time. Or maybe they'll
stick with the plan and look good, winning back-to-back on the
strength of Pete and Pedro.
</P>
<P>
   But the omens are not good. Thursday's loss came on the 20th
anniversary of the Bucky Dent playoff game. Tomorrow is the 50th
anniversary of McCarthy's inexplicable decision to pitch Galehouse
instead of Mel Parnell in the 1948 playoff loss to the Cleveland
Indians. And then we have Peter Schourek _ RUTH KEEP SCORE.
</P>
<P>
   The '48 loss is part of Sox folklore. Galehouse, who got the
nod, was routed by the Tribe and pitched only two innings in the
big leagues after starting the most important game of the season.
There were rumors that Parnell and Ellis Kinder did not want the
ball. Both denied the story.
</P>
<P>
   There will be no mistaking anyone's feelings this time. Pedro
Martinez is on record. He wants the ball for the biggest game of
the year. And Jimy Williams is taking a monstrous gamble by going
with Pete Schourek.

MEDICARE DEADLINE NEARING FOR HMO INDUSTRY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BEN SULLIVAN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Few local seniors will be affected by this week's
deadline for HMOs to commit to or pull out of Medicare coverage,
managed-care officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Of the big local players, only Prudential HealthCare is exiting
the Southern California market, where it covers an estimated 6,500
Medicare patients scattered from San Diego to Ventura counties.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have not been successful at growing our (Medicare)
membership in California and thought the prospect for that was
limited moving forward,'' said Prudential spokesman Kevin Heine.
</P>
<P>
   But other managed-care giants such as Aetna, Blue Shield, Cigna,
Foundation Health Systems and PacifiCare are staying put, even as
some of them exit other markets in California and nationally.
</P>
<P>
   That's in part because managed-care companies are still
reimbursed at a disproportionately high level for their urban
patients, compared with what they're paid for Medicare patients in
rural counties. The Health Care Financing Administration, which
funds Medicare, will for example pay $500 a month or more for the
care of elderly patients in a city like Los Angeles, while paying
as little as $200 a month for patients in some isolated California
towns.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot tolerate unprofitable Medicare business,''
Foundation Health Systems Chief Executive Jay Gellert said in
August, explaining the company's withdrawal from five counties in
the Northeast and 10 rural Northern California counties.
</P>
<P>
   Many managed-care companies had originally been drawn to
Medicare in the mid-1980s for the then-generous payments they
received from the federal government. The plans often saw annual
pay increases of up to 10 percent, making it a largely
inflation-free line of business. But subsequent belt-tightening
under the Clinton administration cut those increases in most parts
of the country to about 2 percent annually, a level some HMOs say
makes it unattractive to provide care.
</P>
<P>
   The managed-care industry had lobbied the HCFA for either rate
increases or permission to charge seniors more for the benefits
they receive, but those requests fell on deaf ears. Nancy-Ann Min
DeParle, who runs Medicare, said this week she is confident that
current reimbursement rates are adequate, and noted that even as
some HMOs pull out of markets, others are moving in.

LEWINSKY WAS KNOWN AMONG SECRET SERVICE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARY LEONARD  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ By most, if not all, accounts, the American public
was the last to know.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the White House and among Monica S. Lewinsky's family and
friends, it was either well-known, highly suspected, or widely
rumored that the onetime intern was having an affair with President
Clinton between between 1995 and 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Documents released Friday by the House Judiciary Committee
provide not only transcripts of Linda R. Tripp's tape recordings of
Lewinsky, but also a fat stack of grand jury testimony and
depositions taken by the independent counsel's office from bit
players in the drama who has large recollections and observations
about Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   One thing stands out: For a lowly intern, Lewinsky had a big
reputation.
</P>
<P>
   Among many Secret Service personnel, particularly those who
guarded the White House gates and access to the Oval Office area,
rumors ran rampant. Steven Pape, a uniformed Secret Service officer
at the Southeast gate, testified that he heard Lewinsky had been
caught in the White House family theater alone with Clinton, and he
thought he advised Secret Service trainees to be ``careful around
Lewinsky, since she was the president's mistress.''
</P>
<P>
   Secret Service officers said under oath that they clocked the
time it took for Lewinsky to enter the White House and the
president to meet her in the Oval Office. On subsequent visits by
Lewinsky, the officers would place bets on how fast the pair would
rendezvous. Pape said he bet it would take 10 minutes. He won when
the president arrived at the Oval Office in 9 minutes, 50 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   At one point in 1997, Secret Service officer Greg LaDow
testified, the rumors about Lewinsky were ``getting so out of
hand'' that he went to his boss and said it was their duty to do
something to protect the president's reputation as well as his
life. No action was taken, LaDow said.
</P>
<P>
   Curiously, Larry Cockell, the head of the president's Secret
Service detail, testified that he heard and saw nothing inside the
White House about the president's relationship with Lewinsky. He
told the grand jury it was his policy to discourage rumor-mongering
in his agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I would be the last person that agents would come to
and bring these rumors to because I specifically discouraged that,
because there were so many erroneous reports going around that it
was counterproductive for us to focus on what the rumors said,''
Cockrell told the grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   But some officers feared there would be a price to pay for not
being in the know. Once, the president reprimanded a guard who told
Lewinsky she had to ``wait in line'' to visit the Oval Office. Gary
Byrne, a West Wing guard, testified that Timothy Keating, a special
assistant to the president, once grabbed his elbow and demanded to
know why Byrne hadn't told him about Lewinsky. ``Now my butt's in a
ringer,'' an angry Keating said, according to Byrne.
</P>
<P>
   There was a minor staff panic during a 1997 holiday reception at
the White House when Lewinsky, persona non grata and transferred to
the Pentagon, showed up on the guest list. According to testimony
by Jamie Beth Schwartz, an assistant in the social secretary's
office, a Secret Service agent demanded to know where Lewinsky was,
and who had invited her.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to find her before Mrs. Clinton sees her,'' Schwartz
said, quoting Lieutenant Bryant Withrow, a Secret Service agent.
Withrow testified that he didn't remember that conversation with
Schwartz, and he said he was ``positive'' that he hadn't told
Schwartz the rumor about the president and Lewinsky being caught in
a ``compromising situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Joceyln Jolley, who worked in the White House Office of
Legislative Affairs, testified that she believes she was fired on
the same day Lewinsky was transferred to the Pentagon so the reason
for Lewinsky's departure wouldn't be so obvious. Jolley said a
Secret Service guard advised her to ``watch your back. Someone saw
the president and Monica smooching.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky's best friends, Ashley Raines and Catherine Allday
Davis, testified that Lewinsky shared many details of her intimate
relationship with the president. Marcia Lewis, Lewinsky's mother,
told the grand jury she knew her daughter was having a relationship
with the president and ``thought she was in love with him.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky had also confided to her aunt, Debra Finerman, but only
described one sexual encounter. Finerman said in a deposition that
her reaction to it was ``yuck.''
</P>
<P>
   Finerman said Lewinsky told her that Bayani Nelvis, the White
House steward, knew about her physical relationship with the
president, though Nelvis vehemently denied any knowledge of it
before the grand jury. Finerman testified that it was she who first
told Marcia Lewis about her daughter's affair with the president.

CLINTONS SAID BILL `MINISTERED' TO INTERN, AIDE TESTIFIES 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By NEIL A. LEWIS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sidney Blumenthal, a senior White House adviser,
told a grand jury in June that President Clinton and his wife,
Hillary, had suggested to him in separate conversations that
Clinton was simply ``ministering'' to Monica Lewinsky in a
spiritual fashion.
</P>
<P>
   Under questioning from prosecutors, Blumenthal testified about a
meeting he had with the president in January, a few days after the
first news reports of a possible sexual liaison between Clinton and
Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Blumenthal said he was working on the State of the Union address
when he found himself summoned to the Oval Office by President
Clinton. He said he told the president that he had met earlier that
day with Mrs. Clinton .
</P>
<P>
   ``I related to the president my conversation with the first
lady,'' Blumenthal testified, ``and the conversation was as
follows:
</P>
<P>
   ``The first lady said that she was distressed that the president
was being attacked, in her view, for political motives, for his
ministry of a troubled person.''
</P>
<P>
   He continued: ``The first lady said he had done this dozens if
not hundreds of times with people. The president had come from a
broken home, and this was very hard to prevent him from trying to
minister to these troubled people.''
</P>
<P>
   Blumenthal then testified that he had told the president he was
aware of his efforts to help people and admired those efforts. He
said he even knew of a woman in Arkansas who would have committed
suicide but for Clinton's help.
</P>
<P>
   But Blumenthal told the grand jury that he then cautioned the
president that people who needed ministering were by their nature
unstable and added, ``You're president and these troubled people
can get you into incredible messes.'' He said he urged the
president to cut himself off from people like Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   He said that Clinton replied: ``It's difficult for me to do
that, given how I am. I want to help people.''

TRULY TWISTED `STRANGELAND' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM SULLIVAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
DEE SNIDER'S STRANGELAND 
Starring: Dee Snider, Kevin Gage, Brett Harrelson, Elizabeth Pena
and Robert Englund 
Written by: Dee Snider 
Directed by: John Pieplow 
At: Copley Square and suburbs. Rated R. (Violence, nudity,
language) 
 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dee Snider's name rides above the title ``StrangeLand,'' putting
him in the recent company of John Grisham, Bram Stoker, and William
Shakespeare. Who, you might wonder, is Dee Snider?
</P>
<P>
   Snider was the garish singer-frontman for the heavy metal band
Twisted Sister and he re-emerges as the writer and bad-dude killer
of ``StrangeLand,'' a horror flick not bereft of brains.
</P>
<P>
   Snider plays Carleton Hendricks, a.k.a. Captain Howdy. The
Captain is a multiply pierced and tattooed one-man freak show whose
reason to live is body modification. He haunts teen chat rooms on
the Internet where he sets his ``wanna-party?'' traps. Having lured
girls into his lair, he ties them up for all sorts of merry fun,
and sews their lips together, babbling about pain as a rite of
passage. One of his victims is Genevieve Gage (Linda Cardellini),
daughter of detective Mike Gage (Kevin Gage). Bad move. Now the
detective's on the case, as outraged father and good cop.
</P>
<P>
   Howdy gets caught early on, setting the stage for the liberal
courts to declare him ``insane,'' institutionalize him, and
proclaim him cured. The new Hendricks is free of tattoos and
piercings; his long hair is pulled back neatly. Being a tad stupid,
he moves back into the same old house, where a hostile crowd awaits
him. You know where we're headed here _ especially when ol' Freddy
himself, Robert Englund, shows up, playing a drunken vigilante. And
whatever does not kill our Captain makes him stronger.
</P>
<P>
   ``StrangeLand'' is no edge-of-the-seat shocker. But it punches
enough modern horror buttons (fear of strangers lurking on the
Internet, scarification) to keep you amused for 90 minutes, and it
doesn't resort to ``Scream''-like in-jokiness.

RELIGION COLUMN: DAVID AND BATHSHEBA, AND THEIR RELEVANCE TO
TODAY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ga.)   (bl)  
 By PETER STEINFELS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Whether or not anyone has cited the story of David and Bathsheba
either to defend or denounce President Clinton on Sunday morning
television, plenty of people have done so in the Sunday morning
pulpits. Quite a few of them have even called Walter Brueggemann,
professor of Old Testament at Columbia Theological Seminary in
Decatur, Ga., for advice.
</P>
<P>
   Brueggemann is the author of a commentary for preaching on I and
II Samuel, the two books in the Hebrew Scriptures that tell the
story of ancient Israel's transformation from a constellation of
tribes to a centralized monarchy under Saul and David. It is also
where the story of David and Bathsheba appears.
</P>
<P>
   He has also written on the parallel account of David in the
First Book of Chronicles, where _ shades of cover-up! _ the
Bathsheba Affair goes unmentioned, and on Psalm 51, traditionally
considered David's cry of repentance for his wrongdoing. Clinton's
remarks to religious leaders at the breakfast Sept. 11 were filled
with allusions to Psalm 51, clearly modeling his repentance on
David's.
</P>
<P>
   The story of David and Bathsheba is so embedded in our cultural
consciousness that ``it is one of the first things you think of,''
Brueggemann said in a telephone conversation Wednesday. But those
who remember the story only from Sunday School or literary
retelling ought to blow the dust off a Bible and go directly to
Chapters 11 and 12 in II Samuel.
</P>
<P>
   As Chapter 11 opens, Israel's forces have gone out to battle.
Like the ominous thread of movie music signaling approaching
danger, a line at the end of the first verse hints that something
is amiss: ``But David remained at Jerusalem.''
</P>
<P>
   In his commentary, ``First and Second Samuel'' (John Knox Press,
1990), Brueggemann imagines ``a powerful silence back in
Jerusalem.'' The king is so sure of himself that he ``now relies on
agents to do his work.''
</P>
<P>
   David, in his leisure, spots the beautiful Bathsheba, and now,
Brueggemann observes, ``the action is quick. The verbs rush as the
passion of David rushed. He sent; he took; he lay.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no indication of conversation, caring, affection, love.
``At the end of the encounter,'' Brueggemann notes, ``she is only
`the woman.''' Her first reported words come later, and the message
is devastating: ``I am pregnant.''
</P>
<P>
   The plot shifts into a higher, more deadly gear: David furloughs
Uriah, Bathsheba's husband, and tries to wheedle him into her bed
so the royal paternity will be unknown. When that plan collapses
because Uriah is, in fact, a loyal, disciplined soldier, David
takes his cover-up a desperate step further. He uses his trusty
aide Joab to make sure that Uriah is killed in battle. David can
marry Bathsheba and things appear fine to everyone's eyes. Except
God's.
</P>
<P>
   This story is so swift and spare that everyone, from rabbinical
sages of long ago to today's feminist exegetes, have filled in
details and speculated on motives. Who was this silent, passive
Bathsheba? (She would come into her own later, as mother of King
Solomon.) Was Uriah really so innocent or a potential blackmailer?
And Joab, was he a man who simply followed orders blindly or a
knowing hatchet man who connived without leaving a paper trail?
</P>
<P>
   In any case, for David and Israel, ``we are at a moment of no
return,'' Brueggemann writes. A spasm of lust, a ruthless cover-up,
and ``innocence is never to be retrieved.''
</P>
<P>
   Chapter 12, of course, recounts the dramatic confrontation
(``You are the man'') between David and Nathan the prophet, who
traps the king into confessing his guilt. God had blessed David,
now God will punish him and his household with endless troubles.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a sin that cuts so deeply into the life of David and
Israel that it rivals in power the sin of Adam and Eve,''
Brueggemann says. ``Both result in a future under a curse.''
</P>
<P>
   And yet. David may never be the same, but he is forgiven
nonetheless. ``I have sinned against the Lord,'' he exclaims to
Nathan _ not even a four-minute speech but two Hebrew words
(hata'ti lyhwh). ``The Lord has put away your sin,'' Nathan
immediately replies.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his sin, and all the suffering it unloosed, David will
remain the model of the Messianic king. And from his marriage with
Bathsheba, begun under the shadow of adultery and murder, will come
the glorious King Solomon.
</P>
<P>
   Was David sincere in his repentance? The narrator of II Samuel
clearly wants us to think so, Brueggemann said Wednesday, but the
professor's own skepticism was not disguised by his friendly drawl.
The David of Samuel, he explained, ``is just an incredible
wheeler-dealer, and endlessly duplicitous.''
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, he said, ``there is nothing of that in Psalm 51,''
which he described as ``the voice of someone profoundly alienated
from God and come to the point that he or she simply can't go on
that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Brueggemann said Clinton's use of the psalm was highly
appropriate, but he did not try to read Clinton's heart. ``Either
it was deeply felt or a great ploy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Brueggemann immediately pointed out that the president had not
done anything that we know about that compared to King David's
facilitating of a husband's death.
</P>
<P>
   But in any case Brueggemann always warns against ``making a
one-on-one connection with anything in the Bible.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Bible doesn't work that way,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is suggestive and provides us with a way to think,'' he
said. Or as he pointed out in his commentary, the writer of the
Book of Samuel ``has cut very, very deep into the strange web of
foolishness, fear and fidelity that comprises the human map.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This narrative,'' he said, ``is more than we want to know
about David and more than we can bear to understand about
ourselves.'' Suggestive, indeed.

TRIPP COACHED, ENCOURAGED LEWINSKY WHILE TAPING CONVERSATIONS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BENNETT ROTH 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ On one level it is just two girlfriends chatting
for hours about about jobs, men, hair and food.
</P>
<P>
   But tapes of phone conversations between Monica Lewinsky and
Linda Tripp triggered the independent counsel's investigation of
whether Clinton committed impeachable offenses in trying to conceal
his affair with the former intern.
</P>
<P>
   Edited transcripts of the tapes, released Friday, showed that
Tripp was hardly a bystander in the saga that threatens to bring
down a president.
</P>
<P>
   She is heard actively coaching and encouraging Lewinsky as she
plotted to force Clinton and his aides to get her a job in New York
when it appeared the president was no longer interested in
continuing the affair.
</P>
<P>
   And Tripp, 49, coaxed her younger colleague not to send the
infamous semen-stained blue dress to the cleaners so she could wear
it on Thanksgiving.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would rather that you have this in your possession if you
need it years from now,'' said Tripp. The dress was later obtained
by Starr as evidence of the president's affair.
</P>
<P>
   Their conversations also underscored Lewinsky's insecurity about
her relationship with the president, as the young woman repeatedly
complained that Clinton was no longer interested in her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm meshuga. I'm nuts,'' Lewinsky, 24, tells Tripp in one
conversation, using the Yiddish word for ``crazy'' to describe her
obsession with the president.
</P>
<P>
   The phone chats also had a lighter side, as the two women
giggled over Lewinsky's plan to send a tape with provocative
messages to the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're so good at it. No wonder he likes phone sex with you.
You're just like a little Marilyn Monroe vixen,'' Tripp says to
Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   But the older woman also prodded Lewinsky to leave Washington
and get away from the man who was causing her so much heartache.
</P>
<P>
   At one point Tripp helped Lewinsky draft a letter to Clinton
seeking his help in securing a job at the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   When the former intern protested that she might be overreaching
by asking for too much pay. Tripp argued that ``this is done
routinely.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Favors like that are done every day,'' Tripp said.
</P>
<P>
   Later Lewinsky also said she was worried about how it would look
if White House Chief of Staff Erskine Bowles secured her a job.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think somebody could construe or say: Well they gave her a
job to shut her up. They made her happy,'' Lewinsky said.
</P>
<P>
   But Tripp responded that it would not be unusual for someone
like Bowles to procure her a job, arguing that Clinton's top aide
did it all the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's how networking works,'' said Tripp, who never shied
away giving advice to her younger colleague at the Defense
Department.
</P>
<P>
   At one point when Lewinsky expressed frustration at not being
able to see the president, Tripp ordered her to get in touch with
Clinton's secretary Betty Currie.
</P>
<P>
   ``Page Betty and tell her to tell him to call you tonight
because you are upset,'' Tripp told her.
</P>
<P>
   After the women received subpoenas from Jones lawyers to testify
in the sexual harassment case, they became increasingly nervous
about their options.
</P>
<P>
   Tripp tells Lewinsky she cannot lie in the deposition, but asks
Lewinsky if she and the president can come up with other options.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe the two of you can come up with something short of
having me killed,'' Tripp said.
</P>
<P>
   But Lewinsky said she would have no problems lying about her
affair.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would lie on the stand for my family. This is how I was
raised. ... I have lied my entire life,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky told Tripp her mother was more nervous about the what
the White House would do to her.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mom's big fear is that he is going to send somebody out to
kill me,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky never indicates suspicion that Tripp was betraying her
confidences. But she briefly noticed once that something was
different about the phone talks, which Tripp was secretly taping.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know what's really weird? I keep hearing these double
clicks,'' Lewinsky said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's my gum,'' responded Tripp.
</P>
<P>
   After Tripp turned over her tapes to Starr's office, she agreed
to be wired for a lunch meeting with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   As the the FBI listened the two talked about the Jones
deposition and Lewinsky's new job in New York as they sipped coffee
with artificial sweeteners.
</P>
<P>
   While Tripp again said she could not lie about the affair,
Lewinsky pleaded with her to do so.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would be indebted to you for life; I would do anything, I
would write you a check, '' said Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky also told Tripp that she signed an affidavit saying she
did not have sex with the president.
</P>
<P>
   When Tripp asked Lewinsky what her definition of sex was
Lewinsky responded, ``Intercourse. I never had intercourse.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky later testified before Starr's Grand Jury that she had
oral sex with the president.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky said she had several reasons for denying she had sexual
affair with the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would not cross these people for fear of my life,'' she
said. But Lewinsky also made it clear she did not want to hurt the
president.
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter how he has wronged me, no matter how many
girlfriends he had, no matter how many people he abused, no matter
how many _ it was my choice,'' she said. &QL;

PITCHING DID RED SOX IN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Sometimes in baseball, seeing is not quite believing.
</P>
<P>
   Friday Red Sox starter Bret Saberhagen gave up 1,186 feet worth
of hits to the Cleveland Indians. Tied together, the resulting
three home runs would have reached the breakdown lane on the Mass.
Turnpike _ and that's where the Sox may be headed after the Indians
converted all that yardage into a 4-3 win in the best-of-five
American League Division Series at Fenway Park, taking a 2-1
advantage into today's game.
</P>
<P>
   According to Saberhagen's manager, his pitcher pitched well.
Well ...? Well as compared to what? A tee-ball stand?
</P>
<P>
   ``Normally, you give up three home runs, the fourth home run
you're out of the game,'' said Jimy Williams. ``But Bret, he
competed. He really gave a good performance. He kept us in the
ballgame.''
</P>
<P>
   He did?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe from the perspective of a good baseball man like Williams,
Saberhagen kept his team in the ballgame. But from the perspective
of about a million good baseball fans from Portland to Providence,
he threw up three gopher balls in back-to-back-to-back innings,
losing a 1-0 lead two pitches after Nomar Garciaparra had given it
to him and then teeing it up for Kenny Lofton, of all people, and
Manny Ramirez in the next two innings before leaving with a 3-1
deficit.
</P>
<P>
   In all fairness, Saberhagen did pitch a no-hitter for four
innings, a one-hitter for five, a two-hitter for six, and a
four-hitter for seven. Unfortunately, by then, he had shown a
penchant for putting one too many pitches in a place he didn't want
them to be. Beyond the fences.
</P>
<P>
   ``I needed to be a ground-ball pitcher today and I was a
fly-ball pitcher,'' Saberhagen said. ``That's the story of the
game.''
</P>
<P>
   That and the fact those fly balls all ended up on the wrong side
of the fences at Fenway. The way Charles Nagy was pitching for the
Indians, it was obvious to Saberhagen and everyone else in the
ballpark that the Red Sox' margin for error would be minimal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Knowing that Nagy had thrown good games against us this year
and in his career, I couldn't give up a bunch of runs,'' Saberhagen
said. ``Unfortunately, giving up the long ball today really hurt
us. The bottom line is I pitched all right but not good enough to
win with the way Nagy was throwing.''
</P>
<P>
   The way Nagy pitched was to throw 62 strikes in 88 pitches while
allowing just one run and four hits in eight innings. That being
the case, Saberhagen didn't have to make many mistakes to be in
trouble, and he made more than enough, considering the situation.
But it was the first one that seemed to bother him most.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of my pet peeves is after the team has scored runs to get
us back in the dugout as soon as possible,'' Saberhagen said.
``After we scored the run in the fourth inning, I went out there
and gave up the home run to (Jim) Thome to tie the game. That was
frustrating.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a 1-0 changeup. Not a bad pitch, but you'd like to
throw the changeup down, just a little bit lower than that. But
with the way the count was, you don't want to fall behind, 2-0.''
</P>
<P>
   So instead, the Sox fell into a tie, 1-1, after which
Saberhagen's homer-per-inning pace kicked into full effect.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pitch to Lofton came over the middle part of the plate a
little bit,'' Saberhagen said of the Indians leadoff hitter's
394-foot shot to right-center in the sixth. ``After giving up the
home run to Lofton, my mind said, `This is all they can get. I have
to keep our team in the game.'''
</P>
<P>
   He did that well in Williams's eyes, excluding the first batter
of the seventh inning. Had it not been for Ramirez's 388-foot home
run, Saberhagen would have done just what he set out to do. But he
didn't, as Ramirez seemed to notice even if Williams didn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``He gave me a good pitch to hit,'' Ramirez said. ``And I hit
it. Out.''
</P>
<P>
   Other than that, of course, Bret Saberhagen pitched well. Just
ask Manny Ramirez, Kenny Lofton, and Jim Thome.

   (italics)``When we examine banks, we expect them to have systems
in place that take account of outsized market moves.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, in
congressional testimony on Thursday(end italics) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ever play blackjack at your local casino?
</P>
<P>
   Then the name Edward O. Thorp might be familiar. Thorp
introduced blackjack fans to counting cards in his 1962 best seller
``Beat the Dealer,'' which gave gamblers an invaluable tool for
trying to beat the house.
</P>
<P>
   Ever wonder where hedge funds come from?
</P>
<P>
   An accomplished mathematician, Thorp started one of the first
and most successful hedge funds, now called Edward O. Thorp &AMP;
Associates, in 1969. And he has few kind words for the Wall Street
professionals and Nobel laureates who helped bring Long-Term
Capital Management, the giant hedge fund in Greenwich, Conn., to
its knees.
</P>
<P>
   Thorp said he was invited to invest in Long-Term Capital when it
was started in 1994, but he declined.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want to have anything to do with it because I knew
these guys were just dice-rollers,'' he said. ``I didn't really see
where these guys had an advantage they could exploit.''
</P>
<P>
   Many people on Wall Street clearly thought otherwise. Over the
last four years, Long-Term Capital attracted money from some of the
world's savviest investors, and made a lot of money for them during
most of that period _ the salad days of the 1990s bull market.
</P>
<P>
   But hedge funds are supposed to perform well even when markets
hit rough patches, as they have lately. And it is not clear whether
the firm's fans had ever scrutinized Long-Term Capital's investment
strategy with hard times in mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just a mutual admiration society at Long-Term,'' Thorp
said, ``and nobody was focusing clearly enough on the model.''
</P>
<P>
   Aha. The model.
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere, except perhaps within the walls of the Pentagon, the
White House's Situation Room or the National Weather Service, does
``the model'' hold as much sway as it does on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the most profitable trading on Wall Street, especially
within hedge funds, involves complex, innovative products known as
derivatives. Derivatives are financial hybrids born in the guts of
a computer and intended to protect users from disadvantageous
economic shifts like currency devaluations or interest-rate
increases.
</P>
<P>
   In short, each derivative, its value ``derived'' from an
underlying asset like a stock, bond or currency, is a little model.
</P>
<P>
   And financial models are only as good as their makers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue of relying on computer models to do risk analysis is
something we need to look at seriously,'' said Charles Peabody, a
banking analyst with Mitchell Securities Inc. in New York. ``They
only model for whatever humans put into them. Are people putting in
data that reflect the possibility of the financial equivalent of a
nuclear meltdown? Usually not. And then they rely on computer
models as if they're the word of God.''
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street's fascination with computer models began in the
1960s, when Thorp and others set up the first hedge funds. Such
funds, open only to wealthy investors, used computer-aided research
to uncover price discrepancies between related securities.
</P>
<P>
   Those discrepancies could be profitably exploited in such a way
that investors had protection, or a hedge, against big losses.
</P>
<P>
   In 1973, when three gifted researchers _ Fischer Black, Myron S.
Scholes and Robert C. Merton _ introduced the first formula for
accurately pricing options, the heady quantitative world of finance
took another big step forward. By correlating interest rates,
prices, volatility and time, the Nobel Prize-winning Black-Scholes
model tried, as would an insurance policy, to put a price tag on
uncertainty. Models had arrived.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The advent of the personal computer in the 1980s gave rise to
Wall Street's young ``rocket scientists,'' schooled and confident
in the predictive capacities of computer models. Next to investment
banking, trading through computer models became the hippest and
most lucrative thing to do on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   Large commercial and investment banks like Bankers Trust,
Citicorp, Chase Manhattan, Goldman, Sachs, J.P. Morgan, Merrill
Lynch and Salomon Smith Barney are among the world's most avid
devotees of derivatives, and maintain in-house systems for modeling
risk.
</P>
<P>
   But those models have often proven flawed. For example,
Switzerland's UBS, Europe's largest bank, on Friday attributed its
$696 million loss in Long-Term in part to ``shortcomings in risk
management processes.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, a series of unexpected financial shocks _ the interest
rate increases of 1994, the devaluation of the Thai baht in 1997
and the Russian ruble this year and the odd movement of bond prices
over the last month _ have shown that models endow their users with
only a modicum of control over their financial destiny.
</P>
<P>
   ``We keep preaching how important stress-testing is,'' said
Leslie Rahl, a principal with Capital Markets Risk Advisers, a New
York consulting firm that specializes in derivatives. ``The kinds
of financial problems we have had are in very subtle areas, and
people aren't looking for these kinds of unusual events when they
stress-test.''
</P>
<P>
   Long-Term Capital's reputation for savvy was considerably
enhanced by the presence of Scholes and Merton, who are partners in
the firm. But bankers who have belatedly examined its risk models
said they were outmoded, compared with others now in vogue on Wall
Street.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Long-Term Capital's model certainly did not take into
account the unprecedented recent movements in the bond market.
</P>
<P>
   With bond losses mounting, Long-Term Capital's partners
apparently hoped to recover by speculating on takeover plays in the
stock market. Of course, what Wall Street calls speculating, the
rest of the world calls gambling, and most gamblers end up ruined.
Still, Long-Term Capital was able to borrow mightily to make its
wagers.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts and some investors said the collapse of Long-Term
Capital should focus attention on the shortcomings of computer
forecasting _ and the quality of unregulated, privately negotiated
contracts _ that lie at the heart of the brave new world of modern
finance.
</P>
<P>
   ``The banking and regulatory authorities were not paying
attention to the amount of leverage these guys were taking on, and
they should have been,'' Thorp said.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Long-Term Capital's brush with ruin has provoked so
much hand-wringing because the global financial system is built on
a framework of mathematical models.
</P>
<P>
   As such, the system is fated to tremble from the strains of ever
faster and more immense movements of money directed by the inexact
intuitions of gamblers _ just the kinds of random stresses that the
models cannot predict.
</P>
<P>
   When, instead of just trembling, the financial system threatens
to come unglued, model or no model, mere worries turn to migraines.
And fast action is demanded: monetary policy shifts, IMF bailouts,
or in the latest case, the Federal Reserve's roping of Wall
Street's biggest houses into engineering the rescue of Long-Term
Capital. Then the models can settle down again, ripe for a
blindsiding by the next bolt from the blue.

   She's Not Even Pushy, So Break Out the Brandy &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A good woman is hard to find, members of the exclusive, all-male
chief executive's club known as the Business Council will tell you.
But when the 65-year-old group convenes its semiannual meeting in
Williamsburg, Va., on Thursday, there will at last be a woman among
its 100 active members: Crandall Close Bowles, 50, who became chief
executive of Springs Industries, the textile giant founded by her
great-grandfather, on Jan. 1, will join such macho members of the
corporate elite as John F. Welch Jr. of General Electric, Louis V.
Gerstner Jr. of IBM and Walter V. Shipley of Chase Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   The Business Council's meetings are legendary for their
deal-making opportunities as well as for the presidents and
economic policy makers from around the world who come to speak.
Just how it chooses members is secret.
</P>
<P>
   But according to one person privy to the membership committee's
deliberations, Ms. Bowles, who is married to Erskine B. Bowles, the
White House chief of staff, jumped over several much-discussed
candidates who never seemed quite right. They include Warnaco's
chief, Linda J. Wachner (too abrasive, some say); the chief of
Sotheby's, Diana D. Brooks (wrong kind of business), and the head
of Mattel, Jill E. Barad (poor attendance at corporate meetings).
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Bowles has her own baggage: Spouses attend the meetings and
some members, most of whom are Republicans who despise President
Clinton, wondered about having Bowles on the scene. Then again,
Bowles, an investment banker by trade, has been trying to leave
Washington for more than a year.

   A big piece of the entertainment business just moved from the
West Coast to the East Coast. Rupert Murdoch, 67, the media giant
whose interests span the worlds of sports, newspapers and
entertainment, has relocated his base of operations from Los
Angeles to downtown Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   With his lavish home in Beverly Hills still on the market for
$19.5 million, Murdoch has moved into the trendy Mercer Hotel in
SoHo. He has been dating Wendy Deng, 31, a vice president in Hong
Kong of Star TV, Murdoch's Asian satellite-TV service. Ms. Deng,
Chinese-born and Yale-educated, has been in New York the last few
weeks.
</P>

American Airlines, he was the most brilliant and feared executive
in the airline industry, known for his predawn staff meetings and
profanity-laden rebukes. But even the chain-smoking Crandall, who
once likened airline competition to war, had to put his pants on
one leg at a time. And when he opened his closet in the morning, he
faced a rack of more than a dozen nearly identical gray suits.
</P>
<P>
   How could he be sure that his trousers matched his jacket?
</P>
<P>
   Now that he has safely retired, Crandall's secret can be told.
His wife, Jan, carefully sewed a number into each of her husband's
jackets and trousers. With a quick peek, he could always be sure
that he was not heading to the battlefield wearing the pants from
Suit 2 with the jacket from Suit 5.

   Lutz is now a consultant to Eller Industries, which bought the

 &HT;    King family sues man allegedly involved in assassination
 &HT;    By Arthur Brice
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- The family of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. filed
suit Friday in Memphis against a former restaurant owner who has
said publicly he was paid a large sum of money to hire an assassin.
</P>
<P>
   The civil suit against Loyd Jowers and ``other unknown
conspirators'' alleges that he was part of a plot in which a
now-dead Memphis produce dealer named Frank Liberto paid him to
find someone to kill King on April 4, 1968. The Kings are demanding
a jury trial and seeking damages.
</P>
<P>
   King's younger son, Dexter Scott King, said Friday evening that
the family filed suit ``as a way to get evidence on the record.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Most civil suits are for damages,'' King said. ``Ours is just
to get the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kings expressed their belief last year that James Earl Ray,
who pleaded guilty to the killing in 1969 but recanted within days,
had been set up by a smuggler he knew as ``Raul.'' The family tried
unsuccessfully to get a trial for Ray, who died in April while
serving a 99-year sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Jowers' attorney, Lewis Garrison, said Friday his client
expected the suit.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not happy about it, but he's not surprised,'' Garrison
said, adding that he will wage a spirited defense.
</P>
<P>
   Jowers, 70 and in ill-health, met with Dexter King twice within
the past year and detailed what he maintains was his role in the
assassination. One of those meetings included former U.N.
ambassador and Martin Luther King colleague Andrew Young.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department opened a limited investigation in August
into Jowers' allegations and into some papers that a former FBI
agent said he removed from Ray's abandoned car in Atlanta 30 years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Dexter King said he hopes the family's suit will help that
probe.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt this would help to provide evidence under oath,'' King
said. ``If they decide to use this as part of the investigation,
they will have it as evidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department spokesman Myron Marlin declined to comment
Friday night on what effect the suit could have on the
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Memphis attorney Wayne Chastain, who filed the suit, also
declined to comment, referring all questions to lead attorney
William Pepper. Pepper, who lives in London, is traveling and could
not be reached.
</P>
<P>
   In 1968, Jowers owned Jim's Grill, on the ground floor of the
rooming house from which officials say Ray fired the fatal shot
from a rear second-floor bathroom window. King was stricken at 6:01
p.m. as he stood on the balcony of the Lorraine Motel, across the
street from the rear of the rooming house.
</P>
<P>
   The King family and others have contended that the shot actually
came from a dense bushy area behind Jim's Grill.
</P>
<P>
   According to the suit:
</P>
<P>
   On the day of the murder, the mysterious ``Raul'' brought Jowers
the rifle. Jowers then gave the weapon to a third man. About 6
p.m., Jowers went out the restaurant's back door as instructed and
heard a shot. Within seconds, the man to whom he had given the
weapon handed him the still-smoking rifle. Jowers hid the rifle in
Jim's Grill and returned it to ``Raul'' the next morning.
</P>
<P>
   The alleged shooter is not named in the suit, but Ray's lawyers
have identified him privately as Earl Clark, a then-Memphis police
officer who died several years ago.

NAGY DOES IT TO RED SOX _ AGAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALLEN LESSELS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Indians manager Mike Hargrove called it a layup. Could
have called it a slamdunk. A tap-in putt. A gimmee field goal.
</P>
<P>
   First question in his post-game press conference and Hargrove
fielded it cleanly: How do you think Charlie Nagy pitched today?
Hargrove chuckled. ``Very good,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At the least.
</P>
<P>
   Nagy says he has nothing against the Red Sox. Don't believe it.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, the righthander out of Fairfield, Conn. and UConn
was immense against the Sox. Shut them down on four hits over eight
innings and left with a 4-1 lead that Mike Jackson nearly
squandered. He struck out three Red Sox, walked not a one.
</P>
<P>
   All day, it seemed, he was ahead in the count.
</P>
<P>
   This is pitch efficiency: he threw 88 pitches in eight innings
and 62 of them were for strikes.
</P>
<P>
   ``He threw a lot of strikes and kept the ball down,'' Hargrove
said. ``He had an outing in here the first part of the year and he
faced Pedro and he took a 2-0 lead into the ninth inning so it was
a very similar outing. I thought he was outstanding.''
</P>
<P>
   The Indians ended up losing that April game when the Red Sox
came back to tie and then take it in the 10th.
</P>
<P>
   Nagy rarely loses to the Sox. He is 4-0 in Fenway Park. He has
no elaborate reasons for his success against the Red Sox, or in
Fenway, he said Friday and reiterated that after the game.
</P>
<P>
   Just go out and do it.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have your stuff and you know what you have that day,''
Nagy said. ``You have to trust your stuff and go with it. I had a
good sinker and a good split finger going. The only thing in this
ballpark is, you know on a righty you have to come inside and to a
lefty you know you have to keep it down.''
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland general manager John Hart was no better at explaining
Nagy's success at Fenway than the pitcher, or Hargrove.
</P>
<P>
   ``But there's no doubt Charlie comes to Fenway Park and is very
confident here,'' Hart said.
</P>
<P>
   Here, there, anywhere, Hart said, Nagy epitomizes the Indian way
when it comes to pitching.
</P>
<P>
   This is a team built around hitting, no two ways about it. There
is no Martinez. No Clemens. No Johnson. No Atlanta staff.
</P>
<P>
   There are guys like Nagy, solid, not necessarily spectacular.
This year he was 15-10 with a 5.22 earned run average in the
regular season.
</P>
<P>
   ``With a guy like Charlie, he's prepared to pitch,'' Hart said.
``You look at the end of the season and you've got to be happy he's
on your team. It's hard to find guys who pitch 200 to 220 innings
and average 15 wins a year. Our entire staff will be overlooked
because we don't have a dominating guy, a dominant No. 1. But we
have a staff that knows how to pitch and can get you into the
postseason and win.''
</P>
<P>
   And this day, Nagy was dominating, besides.
</P>
<P>
   He put down the first nine Red Sox he faced before Darren Lewis
reached on an infield hit to start the fourth. After John Valentin
flew out, Mo Vaughn singled up the middle and Lewis went to third.
Nomar Garciaparra scorched a grounder down the third base line that
Travis Fryman made a great play on to get Vaughn at second, while
Lewis scored.
</P>
<P>
   Nagy struck out Mike Stanley to end the inning, but now the Red
Sox were up 1-0 and Bret Saberhagen had not yet allowed a hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was not too concerned,'' Nagy said. ``I know our hitters and
I know what they are capable of doing.''
</P>
<P>
   The next batter, Indian first baseman Jim Thome, tied it with a
home run to center field off Bret Saberhagen. Kenny Lofton had a
solo home run in the sixth, Manny Ramirez one in the seventh and
the Indians were up 3-1.
</P>
<P>
   And Nagy was not letting up.
</P>
<P>
   He got nine of the next ten Red Sox _ a John Valentin single was
the only blemish _ and was into the eighth. Trot Nixon led off with
a single to right field. But Nagy got Scott Hatteberg to fly out,
Midre Cummings grounded to first and Darren Lewis hit into a
shortstop-to-first force and was done for the night.
</P>
<P>
   Hargrove had seen one get away in April and wasn't taking any
chances this time.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, Charlie did a good job getting us through eight innings,''
Hargrove said when asked if he considered letting Nagy try to
finish. ``He took a 2-0 lead into the ninth inning last time he
pitched here and we wound up losing that one, so I did not want to
see a repeat of that.''
</P>
<P>
   He didn't.

 &HT;    Perot pushing petition to remove Clinton from office
 &HT;    By Ken Herman
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN _ Returning soon to a neighborhood or supermarket near
you: New petitions pushed by followers of political saddle burr
Ross Perot.
</P>
<P>
   Perot has spoken. Bill Clinton must go.
</P>
<P>
   ``My goal is to get 50,000 to 75,000 signatures in Texas,'' Paul
Truax of Dallas, chairman of the Reform Party of Texas, said Friday
as he organized the petition drive. ``The message from Texas is the
president should resign. He is holding an office in disgrace.''
</P>
<P>
   The latest petition drive was ignited Wednesday night when
Perot, speaking on ``Larry King Live,'' called for an effort to
produce truckloads of signatures to be delivered to Washington for
a ``dignified petition turning-in ceremony.''
</P>
<P>
   He wants several truck convoys' worth of signatures, with one
coming from his home state.
</P>
<P>
   ``My point being, we have got erratic behavior by the
president,'' Perot told King. ``All right, either he's got mental
troubles, or he does something like take drugs to spin him out from
time to time.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's conduct with Monica Lewinsky disqualifies him from
office, according to Perot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's totally disgusting that you'd take advantage of a
vulnerable young woman and just manipulate her and use her like a
toy,'' he said. ``And that's exactly what he did.''
</P>
<P>
   The petitions, addressed to Clinton, say, ``The undersigned call
on you to resign now for the good of the country, for the sake of
our children.''
</P>
<P>
   Perot and his band of petitioners are headed for disappointment,
according to Garry Mauro, the Democrats' gubernatorial candidate
and state chairman for Clinton's two presidential campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's clear that's not the vast majority of Texans' view,'' he
said of Perot's call for Clinton's resignation. ``They want this
thing behind us. They don't want impeachment hearings. They don't
want resignation. They want the president and the Congress to work
on problems that effect their family.''
</P>
<P>
   Perot is ``out of touch with ordinary Texans,'' according to
Mauro.
</P>
<P>
   Despite polls showing popular opinion turning against calls for
Clinton's resignation, Perot, who said he would not run for
president in 2000 if Clinton quits, said it's a must.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the leader of our country, one of the most powerful men
in the world, does absolutely improper sexual things and lies about
it, that sends a message to young people that the finest parents in
the world will have to scramble for months or even years to
correct,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Truax said he expects Reform Party volunteers to have an easy
time rounding up signatures in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe there is a lot of outrage,'' he said. ``I think
people need a catalyst to express that outrage. When Perot came on
Larry King Live, that became the catalyst for the outrage.''
</P>
<P>
   Perot called on veterans, senior citizens, ministers,
small-business owners, community leaders and others to start
collecting signatures.
</P>
<P>
   For now, Linda Curtis is heading up the petition drive in
Austin. Curtis, a veteran critic of high-dollar politics, said she
thought it was time for Clinton to go even pre-Lewinsky. She
believes both parties have engaged in ``gross violations'' of
campaign finance laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have had problems with Clinton that have to do with things
not being discussed,'' Curtis said.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton resignation petitions, she said, should start
turning up around Austin soon.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its experience in street-corner politics, the Reform
Party of Texas failed this year in its attempts to gather
signatures to put its candidates on the statewide ballot. Under
state law, the party had to collect signatures from 45,000 people
who did not vote in a March primary. Truax, noting that it takes
about 90,000 signatures to make sure you have 45,000 good ones,
said the party collected only about 20,000 names.
</P>
<P>
   The only Reform Party candidate on a ballot in Texas this year
is Louise Banner Welch, who is running for county judge in Hunt
County in Northeast Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Houston accountant Randy Sims was going to be the Reform Party
gubernatorial candidate if the petition drive had succeeded. Party
members voted not to endorse anyone in the race for governor.
</P>
<P>
   Truax said Perot's call for Clinton's resignation probably won't
tilt Reform Party members away from voting for Mauro, a longtime
friend of Clinton.

 By RICHARD L. BERKE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   DURHAM, N.C. _ In other election years, Reps. David Price and
Julia Carson would have had little in common other than that they
were Democrats with relatively safe seats.
</P>
<P>
   Price is a centrist who has represented this high-tech district
in North Carolina for all but 2 of the last 12 years, a political
scientist who has taught at Duke and Yale. Mrs. Carson, fairly
liberal, is a House freshman who worked her way up in politics from
the grass roots, having been reared in poverty.
</P>
<P>
   But party officials who opened this election year with high
hopes of recapturing the House are beginning to worry that
Democratic incumbents like Price and Mrs. Carson share something
else: greater-than-expected peril on Election Day. As in many
congressional races, the biggest variable is the White House
scandal, which has injected fear and uncertainty into campaigns
around the country.
</P>
<P>
   Other Democratic incumbents who Republican officials cite as
locked in contests that are more competitive than expected include
Reps. Corrine Brown of Florida, Vic Snyder of Arkansas, Lois Capps
and Ellen Tauscher of California, Martin Frost of Texas, Melvin
Watt of North Carolina, John LaFalce of New York and Sander Levin
of Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   Here in North Carolina's 4th Congressional District, Price,
acknowledging that his own polls showed him in a tight race, said:
``This is a swing district that is sensitive to any tide or trend.
It's something you think about a lot in connection with the
president's troubles.''
</P>
<P>
   The efforts of Price and Mrs. Carson to contain the Lewinsky
debacle _ and their opponents' attempts to capitalize on it _ offer
important clues suggesting how Clinton's problems are influencing
the conduct of races around the country.
</P>
<P>
   Many Democrats are straddling a line that seems to shift a bit
with every new scandal-related disclosure: they do not want to
appear close to a president whose conduct embarrasses them, and
yet, sensing the possibility of a public backlash against
Republicans, they are weighing their words carefully and are wary
of hopping on any impeachment bandwagon.
</P>
<P>
   And while publicly these Democrats express confidence that the
scandal will have little impact on them, their campaigns are
preparing for the worst by placing greater emphasis than ever on
behind-the-efforts to prod their core constituencies to vote.
</P>
<P>
   In a reflection of the uncertainty that the Clinton scandal has
cast even among Republicans, the challengers in the Price and
Carson districts _ both are political novices seeking office for
the first time _ have differing strategies:
</P>
<P>
   Tom Roberg, a computer executive in Raleigh who is taking on
Price, has broadcast a television commercial exploiting the
scandal. ``Tom Roberg has called for Bill Clinton's resignation,''
the narrator says. ``This is not the time to be silent, Price.
Where do you stand?''
</P>
<P>
   But in Indianapolis, Gary Hofmeister, a conservative jeweler
challenging Mrs. Carson in Indiana's 10th Congressional District,
is taking a more subtle approach: rather than mention the scandal
directly, he notes as often as he can that ``Julia votes with
Clinton almost 100 percent of the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked why he was not much raising the scandal directly,
Hofmeister said: ``Don't murder somebody when they're in the
process of committing suicide. There would be a danger if we went
overboard.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The best evidence of the discomfort of both Price and Mrs.
Carson is that when asked in separate interviews whether they would
want Clinton to campaign in their districts, both said it would be
impossible at this late date for the White House to schedule a
visit. What if there was a sudden schedule change? Both paused,
squirmed a bit and mustered answers that were hardly affirmative.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given the president's popularity, I doubt it will hurt me,''
Mrs. Carson said. And Price? ``I don't think that would be such a
good idea,'' he said. ``I've never had a president campaign here,
and I wouldn't want to start this time'' although he is eagerly
welcoming Erskine Bowles, the president's chief of staff and a
popular native son in North Carolina, to stump with him here this
Sunday.)
</P>
<P>
   Making strategy for the stump is further complicated by
anecdotal evidence that runs counter to Democratic fears and
Republican hopes. In three days of campaign stops here in North
Carolina and in Indianapolis, the scandal was rarely raised by any
voter being courted by the candidates of either party. When a
reporter asked about it, many voters said that as appalled as they
were at Clinton's behavior, they had a hard time relating it to
their decision on which way to vote in the congressional elections
in five weeks.
</P>
<P>
   As Hofmeister walked through the parking lot outside a gun and
knife show at the Indiana National Guard Armory in Indianapolis
last Sunday, Billy Derringer, a 57-year-old machinist who is
retired on disability, called him over to express outrage about the
millions of dollars that had been spent to investigate Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pathetic to spend all of our money,'' said Derringer, who
identified himself as an independent. ``It shouldn't have gotten
this far.''
</P>
<P>
   Hofmeister tried his best to make the Republicans' case. ``There
has to be rule of law,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Carson said she hoped that Democrats and swing voters alike
would become so fed up with the Lewinsky inquiry that the issue
might even help her. To that end, she proudly informs audiences
that she voted against making public the report delivered to the
House by Kenneth Starr, the Whitewater independent counsel.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was one of 63 members of Congress who voted against putting
all that filth on the Internet,'' she said, adding that Starr's
inquiry had been ``a cruel hoax in terms of fiscal responsibility
and accountability.''
</P>
<P>
   The Carson campaign is counting on voters like Timothy Daly, a
38-year-old real estate executive who voted for a Republican two
years ago but now favors Mrs. Carson.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm pulling the Democratic ticket because I'm tired of it: the
right side of the Republican Party is playing politics,'' Daly
said. ``We'd like to see them go on with the people's business.''
</P>
<P>
   Back here in the 4th District, Price has some reasons to be
worried. He was first elected to the House in 1986 but, as a
four-term incumbent, was ousted in the Republican sweep of 1994
(only to win his seat back two years later). In addition, the
district was redrawn last year to include a large Durham section
where voters do not know him well. Determined not to be a midterm
casualty of Clinton once again, Price says he is waging the most
vigorous get-out-the-vote ground campaign of his career.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than engage Roberg over the Clinton scandal, Price has
begun broadcasting a television commercial that emphasizes his
central issue: education. The congressman's advisers say they
intentionally produced an advertisement that appears decidedly
nonpolitical _ it features school children in a play _ in an effort
to break through the television clutter about the scandal.
</P>
<P>
   But the Price campaign also has a weapon it is holding in
reserve, in the event Roberg appears to be riding the Clinton
scandal to advantage: the incumbent's advisers say they would not
be timid about running commercials underscoring that he earned a
divinity degree before getting his doctorate in political science.
</P>
<P>
   At a coffee with voters in a wealthy enclave of Raleigh the
other night, Roberg opened his remarks by asserting that Clinton
had ``lost the moral authority to lead.'' Yet none of those
assembled asked him about the scandal; they were more concerned
about the state's plans to build a highway near their neighborhood.

RED SOX BATS ALMOST SILENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN PAUL DUPONT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Ground outs, pop outs, strikeouts. Put them together
and they spelled wipeout once again for the Red Sox' Nos. 5, 6, 7,
8, and 9 hitters in Friday's 4-3 playoff loss to the Indians.
</P>
<P>
   It's lonely down there in the bottom half of Boston's alleged
batting order. Mike Stanley, Troy O'Leary, Trot Nixon, Scott
Hatteberg, Mike Benjamin, and pinch hitter Midre Cummings combined
to go 1 for 17 (.059) against Charles Nagy and Mike Jackson in a
4-3 loss that dropped the Sox into a 2-1 hole in their best-of-five
American League Division Series.
</P>
<P>
   The only one to reach base all day was Nixon, who poked a
leadoff single to right in the eighth, only to die in scoring
position when Hatteberg popped to left, Cummings rolled to first,
and Darren Lewis grounded to shortstop.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom of the order bottomed out. Once more.
</P>
<P>
   ``Averages in a short series like this are totally irrelevant,
if you ask me,'' said Hatteberg, who rolled out twice before he
popped to left in the eighth. ``I mean, you go out in the next game
and get a couple of hits and everyone's averages go way up. But
right now we just aren't getting any hits, and there's nothing you
can really point to. I don't think we're pressing.''
</P>
<P>
   Typically, it's a balanced offensive attack that makes for a
successful summer and a prolonged postseason. Dead spots in a
lineup get exploited, become the pararaphs of a postmortem. The Sox
slashed their way to the AL wild-card spot this year with strong,
consistent offensive contributions up and down the order. Big
hitters and light hitters alike made the Sox a viable contender.
</P>
<P>
   After the Game 3 silence of the whams, Boston's 5-9 hitters are
now scuffling along at .158 (9 for 57) for the series, with one
extra-base hit, two runs scored, and one RBI.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to take what he gives you,'' said Hatteberg,
referring to the assorted frustrating offerings of Nagy, who threw
an assortment of offspeed pitches while allowing four hits in eight
innings. ``You'll get a lot of grounders against him. He keeps the
ball down, throws the changeup. I think we're an aggressive team at
the plate. But you have to take what he gives you _ you have to be
patient.''
</P>
<P>
   Red Sox Nation has waited 80 years for another World Series
title. Patience is more than a virture in the Back Bay, it's a
birthright. More than 30,000 patience-perfect fans will stream into
the ballpark this afternoon, politely sitting on their hands,
waiting for the big, bad dead spot at the bottom of the order to
pick up sticks and belt some hits. If there is no wake-up call,
chances are the Sox' season will be over.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we're pressing,'' said Nixon, who replaced
Darren Bragg in right field following Bragg's 1-for-8 effort in the
first two games. ``Everybody wants to do something. Everybody wants
to be a hero. Nagy's a great pitcher. You can't take that away from
him. He changed speeds, threw the slider, and had the split-finger
(fastball) working for him.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He gets all his pitches over the plate for strikes,'' added
third baseman John Valentin, who touched up Nagy for a single to
center in the sixth but was unable to advance when Mo Vaughn's
grounder ended the inning. ``He's a ground-ball pitcher and he got
some ground balls. He did the job.''

SURPRISE HOMER BY LOFTON HELPED DEFEAT RED SOX 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Those who follow the Cleveland Indians every day were
asked this puzzler after Friday's second homer in the American
League Division Series by a most unlikely slugger: ``Can you
remember a big home run that Kenny Lofton has ever hit?''
</P>
<P>
   It was as if these Clevelanders were being asked the last noble
deed ever performed by Art Modell. Brows furrowed. Heads were
scratched. The silence was prolonged. ``No,'' came the chorus.
</P>
<P>
   Next, the man who should know, especially at contract time,
Indians general manager John Hart, was asked the same stumper. Hart
didn't scratch his head, but his brow furrowed, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ummmm ... let me think ... ummm,'' Hart replied before finally
conceding, ``I don't know ... No ... It's hard to remember one.''
</P>
<P>
   Hart then said what all say about Lofton _ ``What I most
remember about Kenny are his exploits on the bases and his great
plays in the outfield'' _ but few, if any, scouting reports on
Lofton ever say, ``Can beat you deep.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not saying that Kenny doesn't hit homers (actually, Lofton
has hit 56 in 976 career games), because he does,'' said Hart.
``He's had a couple of years with 15. But you know, I brought this
guy back to the club (after a year of exile in Atlanta) for a lot
of reasons, primarily because he's a hell of a leadoff hitter. I
certainly didn't bring him back for his power.''
</P>
<P>
   And now to the thumper himself, Kenny Lofton, the man who hit
the key home run in the sixth inning off Bret Saberhagen, the homer
that gave Cleveland a 2-1 lead the Indians never relinquished in
Friday's 4-3 victory over the Red Sox. Until this week, Lofton
never had a playoff homer; now he has two, equaling his total in
264 career at-bats against the Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I don't remember,'' Lofton replied when asked about his
previous biggies. ``I don't worry about no home runs, so I don't
know which were big ones or not.''
</P>
<P>
   Lofton had homered off Pedro Martinez in the sixth inning of
Game 1, but that game was already nearing garbage time. Friday's
homer twisted the game on its head for the Indians.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just trying to lay back,'' said Lofton. ``Then
(Saberhagen) ended up coming back inside with pitches that he'd
thrown me earlier in the game, on my first and second at-bat. And I
was saying, `If he throws me the same pitch, don't let it go by
like you did before.'''
</P>
<P>
   Lofton knew he had hit the ball well, ``but you know the wind
here in Fenway, and I hit the ball in that gap (near the triangle
in right-center) and I was thinking it might curl back toward that
little gap out there. I was thinking, `Well, I don't know,' so I
just decided to take off and run.''
</P>
<P>
   Right fielder Trot Nixon leaped for the ball at the barrier in
front of the Red Sox bullpen. Lofton has been in Fenway Park more
than enough times to see many an outfielder take many a ball out of
the bullpens. ``I saw their guy leap,'' said Lofton, ``and I didn't
know if he came down with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Surprised? Is he surprised when he sees balls he hits leave the
yard?
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, I've done it before,'' Lofton said. ``I'm not
surprised because I've hit homers before. You're only surprised
when you do something that you haven't done much before. So it was
not unusual.''
</P>
<P>
   Just hard to remember ... until Kenny Lofton met the Boston Red
Sox in 1998 playoffs.

AUTRY WAS AN OWNER WORTH CHEERING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ If you want to know what made Gene Autry the last
of his kind among baseball club owners, go back to April 1 in
Anaheim and the Angels founder's final on-the-field public
appearance.
</P>
<P>
   It was opening night at renovated Edison Field, and for a
pre-game ceremony, Autry was driven to mid-diamond in a golf cart.
</P>
<P>
   He looked happy, looked splendid in his singing-cowboy suit and
hat. But he was 90 years old, and he was caught off-guard when an
emcee shoved a microphone in his face and asked if he'd like to say
anything to the people.
</P>
<P>
   Autry mumbled for a second. Then he roared, ``I'm back in the
saddle again!''
</P>
<P>
   Forty-thousand fans stood and cheered. Behind Autry, former
Angels applauded. On the dugout steps, current Angels joined the
ovation.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the same ceremony, Disney chairman Michael Eisner,
whose corporation bought control of the Angels from Autry in 1996
and paid for the glorious new ballpark, was introduced to the crowd
_ and was booed.
</P>
<P>
   Gene Autry was an owner you could cheer, an institution you
could love, a rich man with whom you could sympathize after his
team's many tantalizing failures.
</P>
<P>
   And when he died Friday morning in Studio City a few days past
his 91st birthday, moving on to a place where the angels never let
you down, a breed of baseball owners vanished from the earth.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Eisner and Rupert Murdoch couldn't shine his boots.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wasn't just an owner,'' Gene Mauch, twice manager of
Autry's Angels, said from his home in Rancho Mirage. ``He was such
a great fan.... That was the attraction, he was so real.''
</P>
<P>
   Mauch would sit for hours with Autry and trade baseball stories.
Mauch, the baseball man, would do most of the listening. Mauch
remembers that Autry, well past middle age at the time, loved how
his stature in the game allowed him to hang out with Mickey Mantle
and Joe DiMaggio.
</P>
<P>
   ``As big as he was _ and he was the Babe Ruth of country music,
the Babe Ruth of cowboy movies before he ever got into baseball _
he was the most unassuming person I've ever met,'' Mauch said.
</P>
<P>
   Autry was a businessman, to be sure, parlaying his acting and
singing into television and radio station ownership. He was merely
trying to secure a baseball broadcasting contract for one of his
radio stations when he attended the 1960 major-league owners'
meetings and wound up with the Los Angeles Angels expansion
franchise.
</P>
<P>
   But the Angels didn't exist to provide programming for Autry's
media outlets, as the Dodgers seem to do for Fox. The Angels became
his life.
</P>
<P>
   He was a rare sports owner, a sportsman at heart. His bottom
line was the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Gene, in his best efforts, always wanted to win, and
the players wanted the same,'' former Angels third baseman Doug
DeCinces said, offering a partial explanation for Autry's
popularity in the trenches.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I remember is his ability to come through the clubhouse
and have an open smile, and how he truly enjoyed the relationship
with his players. I think because he was an entertainer himself, he
understood what it took to go out there (on the field).''
</P>
<P>
   His stardom gave him an ``in'' with the roughest bunch of
skeptics an owner could encounter _ the fans. If they'd booed Gene
Autry, they'd be booing Santa Claus, Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer
and Peter Cottontail. He'd sung about them all.
</P>
<P>
   ``Back in the Saddle'' was his theme song.
</P>
<P>
   What's Jerry Reinsdorf's theme song?
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone could identify with him,'' said Richard Brown,
president of Autry's Angels from 1990 to '96. ``(Young) people
identified with him because they went to his movies and heard his
songs growing up. Older people identified with him as somebody who
came from their era.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was just a !ital!good person!off!. A lot of people knew
he'd volunteered for World War II, he wouldn't accept a commission,
he was a pilot.... He was Americana. I think that's why people
loved him so much.''
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, people wanted the Angels to win one for the Cowboy,
and they never could, though Autry retained the title of ``owner''
to the end.
</P>
<P>
   Players and managers choked away 1982, '85, '86 and '95. General
managers frittered away the millions Autry was eager to spend on
free agents.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if it was his biggest disappointment,'' Mauch
said Friday, ``but it was probably the biggest disappointment of my
life, not being able to give him those championships.''
</P>
<P>
   Mauch recalled Autry's good humor after the Angels blew a
September lead to the Kansas City Royals in '85. That winter,
manager and owner shared the microphone at a dinner.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we don't win again next year, are you still going to love
me?'' Mauch asked Autry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' Autry replied. ``And I'm going to miss you.''
</P>
<P>
   If they'd known Autry would live this long, his Angels might
have been more patient, built the roster from the minor leagues up
as Disney is doing, and won a World Series after all.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, the TV showed a clip from about a decade ago, from the
last of his record-setting five Hollywood Walk of Fame ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's only one day that will be bigger than this one for
me,'' Autry said then, ``and that's the day we win the World
Series.''
</P>
<P>
   Made you want to cry, hearing that.
</P>
<P>
   Ever shed a tear for a corporation? &QL;

 By FRANCIS X. CLINES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The House Judiciary Committee on Friday released
the final mass of evidence in its consideration of impeachment
charges against President Clinton, offering a pungent store of
furtive tapes and grand jury delvings into Clinton's intimate
relationship with a White House intern.
</P>
<P>
   The release of the 4,600 pages of heavily redacted testimony and
transcripts featured Linda Tripp's 20 hours of secret voice
recordings of the intern, Monica Lewinsky _ the seedbed tapes of
the extraordinary criminal investigation into the presidential
misbehavior with Ms. Lewinsky that Clinton denied before the nation
for seven months.
</P>
<P>
   The White House, braced for an all-out impeachment struggle with
the Republican-controlled Congress, immediately denounced this
third release of evidence by Kenneth Starr, the independent
counsel, as ``the clearest indication that this is a partisan
process designed for partisan gain'' and one far afield from the
constitutional requirement for impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   To make that point, the president's lawyers submitted an
argument for the House's consideration that reached back 200 years
into the history of sex and politics and cited as precedent the
Congress' early refusal to impeach Alexander Hamilton after he paid
off a blackmailer who threatened to disclose Hamilton's sexual
peccadilloes. The 105th Congress should be no less tolerant in the
case of Clinton's behavior, the 30-page brief argued.
</P>
<P>
   The document release ranged from the tiniest details _ even
their sighs _ in the Tripp-Lewinsky confidences, to hard bouts of
lawyerly combat in the grand jury room between prosecutors and the
dozens of Clinton supporters subpoenaed as the president found
himself targeted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tell the grand jury all the conversations you had with the
president of the United States about Monica Lewinsky since January,
12, 1998. How's that?'' one prosecutor demanded testily of Bruce
Lindsay, deputy White House counsel. Lindsay, the president's
closest, most tight-lipped confidante, stolidly refused to answer.
</P>
<P>
   While devoid of major new disclosures, the new material details
the wide net thrown by the Whitewater independent counsel, Starr,
in trying to make the case to Congress that the president should be
impeached because he allegedly committed perjury and tampered with
witnesses in his attempt to keep the Lewinsky affair private.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, on a fund-raising visit to Cleveland, observed that
everyone has to live with the consequences of mistakes in life.
``Most of us don't have to live with it in quite such a public
way,'' he said as donors laughed in amusement and the new
disclosures flooded the nation.
</P>
<P>
   The densely packed three-volume release, including the testimony
of dozens of the president's staff and political associates, was
laced with second-hand accountings of the president's personal life
and glimpses of the White House's extensive attempts to foil Starr
in his mission. The material was the prelude to the committee's
public meeting next Monday, when the Republican majority is widely
expected to recommend a formal House impeachment inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   The new evidence hardly settled the impeachment question as
Clinton's critics and defenders each claimed material supporting
their contentions. But the voluminous material confirmed the White
House scandal as a heated farrago of personal, legal and political
clashes that has put Clinton's incumbency at risk. The welter of
documentation includes:
</P>
<P>
   _ The repeated attempts of Ms. Tripp, Ms. Lewinsky's erstwhile
friend, to use her mentoring role to coach the younger woman _ even
using the collective `we'' in strategizing at some points. ``I
think you should say, `Well, I really need to speak to the big
creep,' '' Ms. Tripp advised in one taped exchange, referring to
the Ms. Lewinsky's nickname for the president.
</P>
<P>
   _ The possibility of gleaning the Tripp-Lewinsky tapes for
exculpatory material as much as indicting comments. In the one
tape-recording Ms. Tripp made secretly for Starr last January, she
asked Ms. Lewinsky a key question in the prosecutors' attempt to
discover evidence of presidential perjury: ``What is the definition
of sex?'' On the tape, Ms. Lewinsky replied, ``Intercourse.'' She
added, echoing Clinton's later defense to the grand jury and the
nation, ``I never had intercourse. I did not have a sexual
relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   _ The repeated grand jury questionings in which the
recollections of Betty Currie, the president's secretary who
facilitated Ms. Lewinsky's Oval Office visits, grew less and less
distinct. ``My memory is a little better _ but not much,'' she told
the jury after a consultation with her lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   _ The urgent dawning in the White House last Jan. 17, after the
president was deposed in the Paula Corbin Jones sexual misconduct
civil suit, that Starr was hotly pursuing Ms. Lewinsky as a witness
in some larger criminal inquiry directed against the president.
``Do you think you can reach Monica, see what's happening?''
Clinton asked Mrs. Currie after his deposition. Upon tracking down
Ms. Lewinsky, the secretary said the normally loquacious intern
hung up the phone after declaring, ``I can't talk to you.''
</P>
<P>
   _ The combativeness of the president's loyalists in the face of
Starr prosecutors. ``I'm just not going to answer that,'' Vernon E.
Jordan Jr., the president's close friend snapped when asked whether
he was misled by the president's distinctions about sexual conduct.
``You seem to have the problem with oral sex,'' he told the
prosecutor. ``I don't.''
</P>
<P>
   Already split along partisans lines even before voting on its
own inquiry, the committee now has a wealth of submissions from
Starr, including Ms. Lewinsky's testimony admitting to oral sex
with the president, and Clinton's own four hours of grand jury
testimony broadcast to the nation last month. In that, he
criticized Starr's inquiry as little more than a politically driven
``parsing of the definition of sex.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton maintains that because his behavior with Ms. Lewinsky
involved oral sex and not full intercourse, he did not commit
perjury in his Jones lawsuit deposition last January when he denied
a sexual relationship with Ms. Lewinsky. After confirming a
relationship before the grand jury, the president also finally told
the nation on Aug. 17, contending his earlier denials were legally
accurate though generally misleading.
</P>
<P>
   The document release revealed the grand jury testimony of a
panoply of witnesses, from some of the highest presidential
counsels to Secret Service agents who guard the president's life.
There were exceptions, notably the testimony of Kathleen Willey, a
White House volunteer who charged that the president once sexually
groped her. Starr has previously said his office was continuing to
look into possible obstruction of justice in the reaction to her
charge by unnamed Clinton defenders.

SPORTS COLUMN: CONE TAKES HIS FRIENDS WITH HIM 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By GEORGE VECSEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ David Cone is reeling, and he does not mind
admitting it. His eyes are hollow-looking from the death of Dan
Quisenberry and the revelation that Darryl Strawberry has colon
cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, Cone went out and pitched the third game of this league
division series Friday night, with the New York Yankees leading the
Texas Rangers, two games to none.
</P>
<P>
   When asked if he could get on the mound 24 hours after hearing
the ugly news about Strawberry, Cone said: ``Yes, very much.
Probably wearing Darryl's number on the back of my hat. I don't
mean this as some sort of cheap way for motivation.''
</P>
<P>
   He planned to ink Strawberry's No. 39 on his cap, not the first
time he had paid homage to a man he admired. When Keith Hernandez
left the New York Mets, Cone briefly wore uniform No. 17, in honor
of the intense first baseman who had taught him so much about
baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Cone also made a point of talking about Quisenberry, who died of
a brain tumor Wednesday. They overlapped one year in Kansas City,
in 1986, when Cone pitched 11 games as a kid with a live arm, and
Quisenberry was nearing the end of his career as a superlative
relief pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quiz shook me up,'' Cone said Thursday. ``I knew he was in bad
shape, but you're never ready for this. He was such a great guy. He
never big-timed me. He'd just take you aside and tell you how major
leaguers do things.''
</P>
<P>
   The younger player observed how Quisenberry and Hernandez
approached their careers _ Quisenberry with a wry sense of humor,
Hernandez with a manic perfectionism. Taking his cue from them,
Cone has become perhaps the most accessible and interesting New
York athlete of this decade.
</P>
<P>
   When his brain went into vapor lock over an umpire's call and he
lost sight of a runner steaming home, he delivered his mea culpa
after the game. When he suffered a dangerous aneurysm in his
pitching arm, he talked about it. This time it was the death of one
friend and the health scare of another.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it strikes this close to home, it shakes you up, it
really does,'' Cone said Thursday. ``It's a big slap in the face.
Reality sets in, and you realize what's really important.''
</P>
<P>
   Cone is not a member of the Yankee contingent that conducts
Christian worship at the ball park, but he does understand the
spiritual U-turn Strawberry has made.
</P>
<P>
   ``He gets his life together, now this,'' Cone said with a
recognition that life does not pretend to be fair.
</P>
<P>
   Cone has had more than his share of injuries, tearing up a knee
in the minor leagues and sitting out the 1983 season, breaking a
finger while bunting to end his first year with the Mets in 1987.
In the 1995 divisional loss to Seattle, he pitched long and
valiantly, and he needed an operation for the aneurysm in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``Darryl is in great hands over at Columbia Presbyterian,'' Cone
said Thursday. ``I know from a first-hand basis that it is a great
place to be, they're great doctors.''
</P>
<P>
   He also remembered what a jolt it was to be told he needed an
operation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't understand what was happening to me,'' Cone said. ``I
needed to be educated. I didn't know if it was life or death or if
my career was over, but those sort of life-and-death situations
supersede baseball in every way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure Darryl is going through the same fears I was, and
that he doesn't know what's going on. He probably doesn't
understand all the medical jargon that's being thrown his way. It's
an extremely difficult situation, and it can be very confusing and
very scary.''
</P>
<P>
   Cone came back from that operation, but last October he needed
more shoulder surgery. He surprised everybody by being able to
pitch when the season opened, but when he started poorly, his
morbid side told him his career might be over.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he tinkered with his delivery, survived being bitten on
the index finger by his mother's dog, and wound up with 20
victories and 9 losses and a 3.55 earned run average with 209
strikeouts.
</P>
<P>
   ``David has been around,'' said his manager, Joe Torre. ``He's
had to deal with his own stress. If it was a kid, I'd say
something, maybe, but David Cone will be able to pitch.''
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, Cone's suggestion inspired Yankee management
to have No. 39 embroidered on the backs of all their caps in time
for Friday night's game. Some of the Rangers inked No. 39 on their
caps, too. Then David Cone, his eyes still red, did what he knows
best. He went out to pitch.

<P>
   It has been just shy of a year since stocks in companies that
serve the oil drilling industry began a long, grueling selloff that
has left even bearish energy analysts surprised by its severity.
</P>
<P>
   Those who bought last fall, when these stocks peaked, have
watched as the Standard &AMP; Poor's Oil and Gas Equipment Index has
fallen 56 percent from its high on Nov. 5.
</P>
<P>
   The culprits: last winter's mild weather; expanding oil
production, which tends to drive these stocks down as oil prices
drop, and, most of all, the financial crisis in Asia, which has
slaked the once unquenchable thirst for oil there.
</P>
<P>
   The price of West Texas intermediate crude oil, which in October
1997 had hovered at $22 a barrel, fell to just more than $12 last
June.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a brutal group,'' said Daniel R. Pickering, an
analyst who follows the industry for Simmons &AMP; Company
International in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Since June, however, crude has staged a modest rebound, rising
to $15.64 on Friday; major oil-producing countries are making the
production cuts they promised earlier this year, and inventories
are dropping.
</P>
<P>
   The trends, though still tenuous, have generated enough optimism
to breathe a spark of life into the battered stocks of some oil
service companies. For example, Schlumberger Ltd., which hit a
52-week low of $43.75 in August, closed on Friday at $48.5625.
</P>
<P>
   So is it time for investors to jump back in? Are these still
bargain-basement prices?
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts think so, and are adding oil service companies to
their ``buy'' lists. Money managers have been purchasing shares.
And executives and directors in oil service companies including
Baker Hughes, Schlumberger and Global Marine, are buying their
companies' shares.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's encouraging to see them buying their own stock,'' said
Frank Ponticello, who follows insider buying trends for Prudential
Securities.
</P>
<P>
   Stock prices in this industry are often tied closely to those of
crude oil. Some stocks have begun to move up with oil prices, even
while the companies post declining earnings and keep their charges
low to drillers.
</P>
<P>
   Among the buyers are Howard F. Ward, manager of the Gabelli
Growth fund. He has increased his holdings of Schlumberger, Baker
Hughes and Halliburton.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have gone from being Wall Street's darlings to being put
in the penalty box,'' Ward said. ``That's generally when stocks of
high-quality companies should be bought _ when they are way out of
favor.''
</P>
<P>
   By jumping in now, investors risk short-term weakness in oil
prices. But if they wait, they might miss the sudden jumps that
such stocks often make when a preponderance of evidence begins
pointing toward higher oil prices.
</P>
<P>
   In the near term, earnings of these companies may well fail to
meet expectations. Shares of Baker Hughes, for example, plummeted
by almost 10 percent on Sept. 24, when it announced that it would
earn about half of the 36 cents a share that analysts had
predicted.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're kind of in the trough here,'' said Pickering, the
analyst. ``We just have to get past a period when it's going to be
a rocky road.''
</P>
<P>
   Pickering says oil is in a long-term trend toward higher prices,
giving investors and oil companies reason for optimism, yet it will
take some time for that to translate into better earnings for the
companies that provide the gear used in the oilfields.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, it may take as long as six months for higher prices to
lead to increases in drilling activity, and rates charged for rigs
will remain low in the interim.
</P>
<P>
   The number of rigs operating last week was 754, compared with
1,001 in the corresponding week last year. The count dropped to a
record low of 596 in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Arvind S. Sanger, oil service analyst for Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP;
Jenrette, said that if crude remained in its current price range,
big oil service companies would likely continue buying smaller
ones. And the offers often cause sharp price run-ups.
</P>
<P>
   Already, Baker Hughes has acquired Western Atlas. When the offer
was announced on May 11, shares of Western Atlas rose to $92.875, a
14 percent increase.
</P>
<P>
   Halliburton announced on Feb. 26 that it would buy Dresser
Industries, valuing its offer at $46.50 a share, which was 20
percent above Dresser's closing price the day before.
</P>
<P>
   EVI &UR;  &LR; agreed on March 4 to buy Weatherford Enterra for $46.23 a
share, 49 percent above the price the previous day.
</P>
<P>
   Over all, however, Sanger recommends big, lower-risk stocks like
Halliburton, now trading at $28.25; he predicts that it will reach
$48 a share by the end of next year. He also favors the new
Weatherford International, now trading at $20.25 (1999 projection:
$55) and J. Ray McDermott, now at $29.9375 (1999 projection: $53).
</P>
<P>
   Sanger said that both Halliburton and Weatherford should achieve
big savings through their mergers and that J. Ray McDermott is rich
in cash.
</P>
<P>
   Sam Z. Albright, an oil service analyst at Jeffries &AMP; Co. in
Houston, recommends Noble Drilling, which closed at $14.1875 on
Friday; Santa Fe International, $14.875; and Transocean Offshore,
$30.3125. All have large backlogs of work for their rigs and have
strong balance sheets.
</P>
<P>
   Generally, they are involved with deep-water drilling programs.
These long-term projects require huge amounts of capital, and the
oil companies that run them are reluctant to pull out. In a
September report, Jeffries &AMP; Co., set 12-month target prices for
Noble at $23, Santa Fe at $26 and Transocean at $47 a share.

BERMAN, KNIGHT HAVE RIGHT PITCH ON RED SOX LOSS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HOWARD MANLY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Chris Berman got the story line right: Friday's Red
Sox-Indians game was a battle between pitchers Charles Nagy and
Bret Saberhagen.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the season, the two put up simliar numbers. Both won
15 games and their teams won 19 games in which they started.
</P>
<P>
   But it was Berman's partner, analyst Ray Knight, who provided
the details of why Nagy remained unbeaten in Fenway Park.
</P>
<P>
   The major problem, Knight said, was that Red Sox hitters were
not patient, often swinging at the first pitch in Friday's 4-3
playoff loss. ``Nagy is not the kind of pitcher who makes mistakes
unless you make him work,'' Knight said. ``The Red Sox batters are
overanxious.''
</P>
<P>
   With eight innings behind him, Nagy had thrown only 88 pitches.
He was still throwing 88-mile-per-hour fastballs when Red Sox
reliever Dennis Eckersley (73 m.p.h.) entered the game in the
ninth.
</P>
<P>
   Berman and Knight also gave Saberhagen a lot of respect. But the
numbers didn't lie. One of ESPN's graphics demonstrated how
Saberhagen gave up more hits in later innings. Opponents hit .215
during their first at-bats against Saberhagen, .288 on their
second, and .304 on their third.
</P>
<P>
   But not even the Swami could have predicted that the first three
hits Saberhagen surrendered would be home runs.
</P>
<P>
   One of those was a towering shot by first baseman Jim Thome in
the fifth inning. The ball crashed into the ESPN camera of Deena
Sheldon. She said she didn't see the ball coming but heard the
impact. ``I was scared to death,'' she said. A Boston police
officer retrieved the ball and Sheldon perched it atop her camera.
</P>
<P>
   ESPN's camera work was excellent. Case in point: Kenny Lofton's
home run over the outstretched arms of right fielder Trot Nixon.
ESPN had a camera in place to show viewers Nixon, the fence in
front of the Red Sox bullpen, and the stretch of grass behind the
fence. Viewers saw Nixon time his jump and barely miss the ball.
ESPN also showed Lofton looking, looking ... until finally he
raised his fists in the air.
</P>
<P>
   Berman really couldn't see the home run from his eprch high
above home plate. His home run call, ususally peppered with ``back,
back, back'' punctuation, reflected as much.
</P>
<P>
   His patented ``gone'' was also a little weak. When Knight
tweaked him a bit about it, Berman snapped, ``Lofton didn't have a
convincing enough fist in the air.''
</P>
<P>
   Give Berman credit, though. He did have his fingers on the Red
Sox' zeitgeist shortly after Lofton's home run gave the Indians the
lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's only 2-1, but you can hear a pin drop at Fenway,'' Berman
said. ``It's not a negative. I'll use the word pessimistic to
describe how the New England folks regard the Red Sox. They are
incredibly fatalistic here.''
</P>
<P>
   Sure enough, in the bottom of the sixth inning, ESPN showed
clips of Bucky Dent hitting a home run in the 1978 playoff game at
Fenway in which the Yankees beat the Red Sox. ESPN even trained Its
cameras on hitting coach Jim Rice and Eckersley, both members of
that 1978 Red Sox team.
</P>
<P>
   Berman and Knight gave Eckersley a pass Friday, never calling
into question manager Williams's decision to use the Eck instead of
Tom Gordon in the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   Even on the pitch that led to the Indians' fourth home run,
Berman and Knight were soft. ``It was a good pitch,'' Knight said.
</P>
<P>
   Manny Ramirez thought so, too. He crashed Eckersley's offering
down the left-field line for the decising run. The shot was so
quick, Berman could only get out ``Back, back ... gone.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a two-backer,'' Berman quipped.
</P>
<P>
   That is fun and all, but where were the questions about why the
Eck was even in the game?
</P>
<P>
   Eck's next pitch came in at a blazing 73 miles per hour.
</P>
<P>
   By the seventh inning, Berman and Knight were already discussing
the issue _ whether Williams should start Pedro Martinez Saturday.
Berman didn't have an opinion, but Knight argued, unconvincingly,
that ``it wouldn't be the best thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It would signal to Pete Schourek that he couldn't win a
game,'' Knight said. ``It also might hurt Martinez to pitch after
only three days' rest.''
</P>
<P>
   Knight isn't from around these parts. There is no tomorrow
unless Pedro pitches.
</P>
<P>
   Knight knows that, and said as much at the start of the game.
``At the beginning of the season, I didn't know if the Red Sox had
a good enough ptiching staff,'' Knight said. ``I knew they had
Pedro, but after that was questionable. You didn't know what (Tim)
Wakefield would do. You had (Robinson) Checo, (Steve) Avery, then
(Butch) Henry went down. Golly, they don't have enough pitching to
survive.''
</P>
<P>
   Knight went on to praise Saberhagen for doing a ``yeoman's job''
and being the key to the Red Sox making the playoffs.

NAGY OUTDUELS SABERHAGEN IN 4-3 CLEVELAND WIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Bret Saberhagen would have preferred to be the one to
hit the high notes, not his wife and the Cleveland Indians, in that
order.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Eckersley would have preferred Boston's last (?) memory
of him to be something other than balls flying out of Fenway Park.
</P>
<P>
   Pedro Martinez would have preferred that Jimy Williams give in
to his pleas to pitch this afternoon instead of risking the
possibility that the Sox will reach the end of their road with
aspiring NASCAR driver Pete Schourek on the mound.
</P>
<P>
   There was disappointment aplenty to go around on Yawkey Way
Friday afternoon. The Indians, behind two home runs by that paragon
of hustle, Manny Ramirez, and one apiece by Kenny Lofton and Jim
Thome, withstood a ninth-inning two-run homer by Nomar Garciaparra
to beat the Red Sox, 4-3, and take a 2-1 lead in their best-of-five
American League Division Series.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox, who have yet to show the capacity to score a run in
this series unless Mo Vaughn and Garciaparra are in the mix, face
elimination this afternoon with Williams adamantly sticking to his
decision to pitch Schourek, whose tenure with Boston is so brief,
he's still living in a hotel here.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really hope Jimy decides to throw Schourek tomorrow,'' said
Saberhagen, expressing a view decidedly different from the one
Williams heard from the fans who yelled, ``Please, Jimy, please
pitch Pedro,'' as he made his way back to the clubhouse from the
postgame interview room.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pete has thrown well the last weeks of the season,''
Saberhagen added, ``and I'd like to have Pedro going into Jacobs
Field for the final game.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is we've got to win two games and Pedro can't
win them both.''
</P>
<P>
   Saberhagen, with a World Series MVP on his resume by the age of
21, could have halved that requirement by beating the Indians
Friday. Instead, he was outdueled by Indians righthander Charles
Nagy, who generated almost as many home runs (34) this season as
Garciaparra (35) but Friday had the Red Sox beating the ball into
the dirt while Saberhagen was victimized by the long fly.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox scored a run in the fourth on singles by Darren
Lewis and Vaughn and a fielder's choice by Garciaparra. But they
advanced only one other runner as far as second base against Nagy,
who threw only 88 pitches in eight innings and recorded 15
ground-ball outs to maintain his Rocky Marciano record in Fenway
Park _ undefeated (4-0).
</P>
<P>
   Saberhagen, meanwhile, took a 1-0 lead and a no-hitter into the
fifth but gave up a leadoff home run to Thome, the Indians'
lefthanded-hitting strongman who launched a changeup into the TV
camera well in dead center field.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was throwing the ball well,'' Saberhagen said, ``but giving
up a run right after we scored a run is a momentum change. You
always want to be on the other end of it.''
</P>
<P>
   An inning later, Lofton cleared the leap of rookie Trot Nixon
with a home run into the Red Sox bullpen, the second of the series
by the Indians leadoff man, and Ramirez led off the seventh with a
drive into the left-field screen.
</P>
<P>
   ``They hit more over the fence than we did,'' said Saberhagen,
who, when asked about his wife, Lynn, singing the national anthem,
said, ``She did a lot better than I did.
</P>
<P>
   ``They weren't terrible pitches, but of course, I'd love to have
those pitches back. But unfortunately, there are no mulligans in
this game.''
</P>
<P>
   There can be nasty flashbacks, however, as Ramirez demonstrated
in the ninth against Eckersley, who had faced the Indians right
fielder once before _ three years ago when the Eck was still
closing for the A's and gave up a game-winning grand slam.
</P>
<P>
   Eckersley, who turns 44 Saturday and has given up home runs in
each of his last three appearances at Fenway, watched Ramirez turn
on a pitch that was supposed to be down and in and park it in the
screen.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the first two games in Cleveland, when he was surprised
twice as balls he hit did not leave the premises, Ramirez, who now
has 11 postseason home runs to go along with the 45 he hit during
the regular season, did not begin his home run trot until he was
approaching second base.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm surprised he kept it fair,'' Eckersley said. ``I thought
he would hook that ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's pretty amazing. Everything he hits is hard. I think even
he thinks that everything he he hits is going out. That's why he's
always styling.''
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox' style was limited to desperation against Indians
closer Mike Jackson. John Valentin lined out hard to third before
Vaughn singled and Garciaparra hit his second home run of the
series, giving him 10 RBIs in three games. But Jackson retired Mike
Stanley and Troy O'Leary on ground balls as the Nos. 5-9 hitters
went 1 for 17 Friday and are just 9 for 57 in the series.
</P>
<P>
   So now the burden falls on Schourek, despite Martinez's appeal
to pitching coach Joe Kerrigan that he be given the ball. ``I'm
available if he decides to change his mind,'' Martinez said. ``I
asked but I can't argue with him. He's the boss. I'm only an
employee.''

A GOOD DAY FOR MARQUES HAYNES FANS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; SPRINGFIELD, Mass. _ You had to see it up close, Gary Holmes
tells you. You had to see how the man, seemingly ageless, used to
dribble the basketball. He dribbled soundlessly. You know how there
are certain cars that run so smoothly that you have to tap the gas
pedal to make sure the engine is clicking? Marques Haynes's
dribbling was that.
</P>
<P>
   ``He used to come to my house,'' Holmes said, taking a break
from a game of billiards to tell his story. ``He would start
dribbling and you wouldn't even hear it. It didn't even look like
the ball was moving. So one time I got a piece of paper and put it
under the ball. That was the only way I knew Mr. Haynes was
dribbling.''
</P>
<P>
   Holmes is the son of Harold ``One Shot'' Holmes, one of the men
who played with Haynes during his career with the Globetrotters,
Magicians, and Wizards. Thousands of people know Haynes because he
bounced the ball in ways you'd never imagine. He could make shots
from halfcourt. He could make you laugh, too. But those who took
the time to know Haynes away from the court found something else,
something they could not and cannot always describe. Holmes, a
grown man himself, still refers to Haynes as ``Mr. Haynes.'' And
when Holmes goes to his Springfield home, he sees his 11-year-old
son, Marques. ``Same spelling and everything,'' Holmes said.
</P>
<P>
   Friday was a good day for fans of Marques Haynes. After 50 years
of taking basketball across the world, Haynes was invited here to
be immortalized. He is a Hall of Famer now, something he never
thought of years and years ago in Oklahoma when he learned to
dribble by watching his older brother. We say many years because
Haynes will not reveal his age.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm 37 1/2 and holding,'' he said before his induction. He sat
on a bench in a place called Mad Maggie's, one room away from
Holmes and his pool-playing friends. You know Haynes is not 37. In
fact, there have been whispers that he is in his 80s. You would
never know that. He is a svelte man with a graying crown. His
schedule can still be busy. And if you want to see how to dribble a
ball, you can still come to him.
</P>
<P>
   Fans of Haynes were thrilled to see him get his due among the
greats. Star after star walked through the lobby of the downtown
Marriott early Friday. Wilt Chamberlain walked in with Ahmad
Rashad. George Gervin slid through a revolving door. Big Bob Lanier
made his way through a line of autograph-seekers. And Haynes walked
through, too, looking for a quiet place where he could sit for a
few minutes in peace. When you are a Hall of Famer, people want
lots of your time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never thought I would play basketball for money,'' Haynes
said. ``And I never thought I would play and become famous for it.
I still remember Pop Gates (his presenter last night) receiving
something like $350 to $700 a month for playing ball. Now this was
in the late 1930s or early '40s. I thought that might be something
I'd look into after I graduated college.''
</P>
<P>
   After graduation. That was the key phrase. Haynes majored in
industrial education at Langston College (Haynes smiles and nods
his head when it is pointed out that the Prairie View A&AMP;M football
team beat Langston earlier this year to end a losing streak that
began in 1989 _ with a loss to Langston).
</P>
<P>
   ``That was my security blanket,'' he said of his degree.
``People may have been able to take the basketball away from me _
it didn't happen often, but it could have happened _ but they were
never going to take my education. Never. I ain't nobody's fool.''
</P>
<P>
   Not off the court. And certainly not on it, where the dribbling
was impeccable. Haynes looks at today's dribblers, ones who carry
and palm the ball on nearly every possession. He doesn't blame them
for what they do. He blames audiences without high standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``I listen to some of these TV announcers talking about the game
sometimes. You see two guys going down the court, one is dribbling
and the other is guarding. There is contact, maybe one guy knocks
the other down, and there is no whistle. And what does the
announcer say? `That was a good no-call.' What the hell is a good
no-call? Something happened there.''
</P>
<P>
   Haynes began to walk away after he said that. He said he
remembers when you fouled out after three fouls and had the option
of shooting or taking the ball out on the side. He remembers the
early days, days that weren't far removed from the era of
basketball founder Dr. James Naismith. And now Haynes will be a
permanent member in Naismith's home _ and basketball's sacred Hall.

 NAGY MASTERFUL AS INDIANS DEFEAT RED SOX
IN GAME 3 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) By DAVID A.
MARKIEWICZ c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; P &QR; BOSTON Q The last time Charles Nagy pitched a playoff game in
Boston, he
ran into a talkative cabbie on his way to Fenway Park. The gist of
the unwitting hackUs message: The Red Sox had the game in the bag Q
this guy pitching for Cleveland was a stiff.  &QL; P &QR; Nagy went out,
pitched brilliantly and won that night, Game 3 of the 1995
Division Series, helping propel the Indians toward their first
World Series appearance in 41 years.  &QL; P &QR; The inconsistent
right-hander tried a different path here yesterday
afternoon.  &QL; P &QR; RI took the bus today,S Nagy said, no doubt kidding.
 &QL; P &QR; Whatever his mode of transportation, the veteran got to where he
wanted.
His eight innings of one-run, four-hit, no-walk ball carried the
Indians to a 4-3 victory in Game 3, giving Cleveland a 2-1 series
advantage heading into Game 4 this afternoon in Boston.  &QL; P &QR; The
performance continued NagyUs mastery against the Red Sox. He is now
8-1
against Boston lifetime.  &QL; P &QR; RThis is a game of
what-have-you-done-for-me-lately,S Nagy said after his
masterpiece, a reference to the criticism he has received in
Cleveland in recent years despite having won 15 or more games for
four consecutive seasons.  &QL; P &QR; RIUve always had confidence in my
ability,S said Nagy, who has been
assailed for having self-doubts about his talent, and for nibbling
too much on the mound. RBut this doesnUt vindicate anything.S
 &QL; P &QR; Nagy generally is effective when his pitches sink, and yesterday
they were
dropping through the strike zone.  &QL; P &QR; RI had a good sinker and a
good split-finger [fastball] going,S Nagy said.
RIn this ballpark, you have to come inside to a righty, and to a
lefty you have to make sure you keep it down.S  &QL; P &QR; Nagy kept the
ball down and in the strike zone. Of his 88 pitches, 62 were
strikes.  &QL; P &QR; Nagy outdueled resurgent Red Sox veteran Bret
Saberhagen, who cruised
through his seven innings Q except for allowing solo home runs in
consecutive innings to Jim Thome, Kenny Lofton and Manny Ramirez.
 &QL; P &QR; ThomeUs shot in the top of the fifth inning tied the game 1-1
and, as
Indians manager Mike Hargrove put it, RIt was the first sign we had
that we might be able to get to Saberhagen.S  &QL; P &QR; Cleveland took a
2-1 lead on another home run, by Kenny Lofton, who drove a
pitch over the wall in center field in the sixth inning.  &QL; P &QR; RI felt
very good going into the game,S Saberhagen said. RProbably the best
IUve felt all year. But I needed to be a ground ball pitcher today,
and I was a fly ball pitcher.S  &QL; P &QR; Ramirez was the biggest fly ball
hitter for Cleveland. Besides his
seventh-inning shot into the net atop the Green Monster, which

 By CHRISTOPHER S. WREN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When this city awoke to its first heroin epidemic
just after World War I, the city Health Department lured addicts
into treatment with the promise of free heroin.
</P>
<P>
   The nearly 8,000 addicts who responded were detoxified with
diminishing doses of heroin. After they were pronounced cured, 9
out of 10 resumed chasing heroin. Health officials threw up their
hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``They decided there was no point in treatment,'' said Dr. David
Musto, a Yale University psychiatrist and medical historian.
</P>
<P>
   Eighty years later, methadone, which blocks heroin craving, is
the preferred treatment for heroin addiction, though the notion of
fighting one drug with another is still being debated. In New York
City, 36,000 people take methadone, whose effectiveness in stopping
heroin use has been endorsed by no less than the National
Institutes of Health.
</P>
<P>
   But as the White House drug policy director, Gen. Barry
McCaffrey, spoke this week of making methadone more available,
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani continued to insist that abstinence, not
methadone, is the only solution for heroin addicts. Saying he wants
to abolish the city's methadone clinics, the mayor derides
methadone as no better than heroin.
</P>
<P>
   Medical specialists on both sides of the issue agree that
methadone offers a limited solution to the intractability of
addiction. Methadone, they say, has helped thousands of heroin
addicts recover their lives, but it alone cannot transform them
into productive citizens.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're debating whether it's all bad or all good,'' said Dr.
Mitchell Rosenthal, the president of Phoenix House, a drug
treatment network based in Manhattan that eschews methadone. The
reality, he said, is more complex.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Robert Newman, the president of Continuum Health Partners, a
hospital consortium that includes Beth Israel Medical Center and
St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center, said, ``What we see, not just
in New York City, is the application of expectations regarding the
treatment of addiction that would be unthinkable in the treatment
of any other disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it comes to treating heroin addiction,'' Newman said,
``people demand that the treatment resolve all the other problems
the heroin addict has.''
</P>
<P>
   Methadone's origins go back to World War II, when German
scientists synthesized it as a painkiller for casualties. In 1964,
two medical researchers at what is now Rockefeller University, Dr.
Vincent Dole and Dr. Marie Nyswander, started testing methadone on
heroin addicts who had relapsed after other treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was developed in New York, and the impetus to develop it
was New York's heroin problem,'' said Dr. Mary Jeanne Kreek, the
head of the Laboratory of the Biology of Addictive Diseases at
Rockefeller University.
</P>
<P>
   Kreek assisted Drs. Dole and Nyswander in dispensing methadone
to addicted felons. The researchers found that 100 milligrams of
methadone blocked the effect of 200 milligrams _ equivalent to
several highs _ of heroin. ``We found craving began to go away,''
Dr. Kreek recalled. ``Many wanted to go back to school, to work or
back to their families.''
</P>
<P>
   Methadone has several advantages. It affects the brain's
receptors for 24 hours, blocking heroin's three-minute euphoric
rush. Methadone can be taken orally and is medically nontoxic. Its
slow onset, in dramatic contrast to heroin's spiky highs,
eliminates mood swings, making an addict feel normal again.
</P>
<P>
   But methadone also creates a physical dependence that can be as
strong as heroin addiction. While addicts say they get no kick from
methadone, it can cause some euphoria in someone unaccustomed to
opiates. Such potential risks have made methadone the most tightly
controlled medication in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Drs. Dole and Nyswander never considered methadone a ``silver
bullet'' for curing heroin addicts. ``We agreed that clearly they
need behavioral treatment and counseling, but time and again these
have been shown to have limited effectiveness,'' Dr. Kreek said.
</P>
<P>
   By 1970, the Nixon administration was promoting methadone to
reduce crime, which dropped when addicts no longer had to finance a
$200-a-day heroin habit. A simple dose of methadone costs $13
today.
</P>
<P>
   Confronted with a new heroin epidemic in New York, Mayor John V.
Lindsay's health services administrator, Gordon Chase, recruited
Newman in 1970 to open methadone programs throughout the city.
</P>
<P>
   Within a year, the city had 40 methadone clinics treating 12,000
addicts.
</P>
<P>
   During this period, the lower Manhattan detention center called
the Tombs was overflowing with inmates, half of whom were addicted
to heroin. Addicts crammed into cells on the prison's ninth floor
were sometimes sprayed with water to ease their writhing through
the nausea and muscle spasms of withdrawal, which last for several
days.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were given two aspirins and a hose,'' recalled a former
city official who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   A violent riot in 1970 and a spate of suicides in 1971
attributed to heroin problems led the Department of Correction to
ask Dole to detoxify the addicts. Over nine months, 22,000 inmates
in city prisons were detoxified with methadone, and the prisons
calmed down.
</P>
<P>
   ``A sympathetic response to the needs of human beings locked in
cells can make the difference between a quiet prison and a riot,''
Dole wrote a year later, recounting his work in The Journal of the
American Medical Association.
</P>
<P>
   Musto said that methadone became available at the very time that
society was seeking a new approach to drug addiction. ``We were
undergoing a change of attitude from seeing it as a criminal
problem to seeing it as a medical problem,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Drs. Dole and Dr. Nyswander also found that within two years
after quitting methadone, 70 to 80 percent of the addicts they
treated were using illicit opiates again. ``The goal was always
methadone to abstinence,'' Dr. Kreek said, ``but we found relapse
occurred.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   They introduced methadone maintenance as a longer-term solution.
By April 1972, more than 16,000 heroin addicts were enrolled in
methadone maintenance programs in the city. By 1975, the number had
grown to 35,000.
</P>
<P>
   The Nixon administration's support of methadone as a
crime-reducer led to suspicions among some black New Yorkers that
the medication was a plot to render them docile.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. James Curtis, the chief psychiatrist at Harlem Hospital
Center, said: ``Before the drug epidemic hit, Harlem was a secure,
thriving community. When you added drugs on top of gangs, these
neighborhoods became absolute wastelands of danger.''
</P>
<P>
   When methadone was proposed, Curtis said, ``it seemed to me a
very poor idea.'' Still, he had watched other drug treatment
programs fail because their patients had relapsed. ``By the end of
the year, you were lucky if you had 5 percent of those who came,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Curtis found that one-third of those who joined methadone
maintenance programs in Harlem stayed and turned their lives
around. ``I was willing to conclude that 35 percent was a whole lot
better than 5 percent,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Today, barely one-third of methadone patients around New York
City have found regular jobs. The failure of methadone programs to
move addicts in treatment off welfare and into jobs is said to be
one reason Mayor Giuliani declared war on methadone.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't give a socially dysfunctional addict methadone and
think he's going to develop table manners and develop social
skills,'' Rosenthal said.
</P>
<P>
   Reports that methadone was being diverted at some clinics,
sometimes to addicts who could not get into treatment, led to
stringent controls that force most patients to appear daily and
drink their medication on the spot.
</P>
<P>
   ``You had addicts coming out and selling their doses to
undercover cops,'' said Robert Silbering, former special narcotics
prosecutor for the city. ``They saw it as a way of getting money to
buy drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Edwin Salsitz, who runs a pilot methadone prescription
program at Beth Israel Medical Center, said that methadone
maintenance gets a bad name because of the chronic destitution of
addicts. Changing patterns of drug abuse have highlighted
methadone's limitations. Ninety percent of heroin addicts on the
street also use cocaine, which methadone cannot block, though Dr.
Kreek said the stability of the methadone regimen helps to
discourage cocaine use. Rosenthal said that only 19 percent of
admissions to Phoenix House primarily involve heroin.
</P>
<P>
   And the purity of heroin sold on the street has more than
doubled since methadone was introduced, raising the methadone dose
required to override it. Heroin's unprecedented purity has
emboldened more affluent, younger users to snort it, making them
future candidates for methadone treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the criticism of methadone, few outside City Hall can
envision New York City without it. ``The fact is that if you take
30,000 methadone patients and you stop their treatment, virtually
all of them will be back on the streets shooting heroin,'' Newman
said. ``And they'll be mugging and stealing to support their
habit.''

NAGY MASTERFUL AS INDIANS DEFEAT RED SOX IN GAME 3
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVID A. MARKIEWICZ 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The last time Charles Nagy pitched a playoff game in
Boston, he ran into a talkative cabbie on his way to Fenway Park.
The gist of the unwitting hack's message: The Red Sox had the game
in the bag _ this guy pitching for Cleveland was a stiff.
</P>
<P>
   Nagy went out, pitched brilliantly and won that night, Game 3 of
the 1995 Division Series, helping propel the Indians toward their
first World Series appearance in 41 years.
</P>
<P>
   The inconsistent right-hander tried a different path here
yesterday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I took the bus today,'' Nagy said, no doubt kidding.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever his mode of transportation, the veteran got to where he
wanted. His eight innings of one-run, four-hit, no-walk ball
carried the Indians to a 4-3 victory in Game 3, giving Cleveland a
2-1 series advantage heading into Game 4 this afternoon in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   The performance continued Nagy's mastery against the Red Sox. He
is now 8-1 against Boston lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a game of what-have-you-done-for-me-lately,'' Nagy
said after his masterpiece, a reference to the criticism he has
received in Cleveland in recent years despite having won 15 or more
games for four consecutive seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always had confidence in my ability,'' said Nagy, who has
been assailed for having self-doubts about his talent, and for
nibbling too much on the mound. ``But this doesn't vindicate
anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Nagy generally is effective when his pitches sink, and yesterday
they were dropping through the strike zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a good sinker and a good split-finger \Rfastball\S
going,'' Nagy said. ``In this ballpark, you have to come inside to
a righty, and to a lefty you have to make sure you keep it down.''
</P>
<P>
   Nagy kept the ball down and in the strike zone. Of his 88
pitches, 62 were strikes.
</P>
<P>
   Nagy outdueled resurgent Red Sox veteran Bret Saberhagen, who
cruised through his seven innings _ except for allowing solo home
runs in consecutive innings to Jim Thome, Kenny Lofton and Manny
Ramirez.
</P>
<P>
   Thome's shot in the top of the fifth inning tied the game 1-1
and, as Indians manager Mike Hargrove put it, ``It was the first
sign we had that we might be able to get to Saberhagen.''
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland took a 2-1 lead on another home run, by Kenny Lofton,
who drove a pitch over the wall in center field in the sixth
inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt very good going into the game,'' Saberhagen said.
``Probably the best I've felt all year. But I needed to be a ground
ball pitcher today, and I was a fly ball pitcher.''
</P>
<P>
   Ramirez was the biggest fly ball hitter for Cleveland. Besides
his seventh-inning shot into the net atop the Green Monster, which
padded the Indians lead to 3-1, he homered off reliever Dennis
Eckersley in the top of the ninth. That gave Ramirez 11 career
postseason home runs and the Indians a 4-1 edge.
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, they would need every bit of that lead.
</P>
<P>
   All the Red Sox's offense came from what's become a common power
supply in Boston, shortstop Nomar Garciaparra. He drove in the
first run of the game in the fourth on a groundout. Garciaparra
then hit a two-run home run with one out in the bottom of the ninth
off Cleveland closer Mike Jackson, narrowing the gap to one run and
sending Red Sox fans into a frenzy on a chilly day.
</P>
<P>
   Garciaparra has 10 runs batted in during the three games.
</P>
<P>
   But Jackson got the final two outs easily, and now Cleveland
will attempt to close out the best-of-five series in Boston today.
If Game 5 is necessary, it would be played at Jacobs Field
tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody's pumped up. Everybody's happy,'' Ramirez said.
``But we have to come out tomorrow and play the same way.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ They talked on and on, about haircuts, diets, sex
and more sex. But the tapes of the phone chats between Monica
Lewinsky and Linda Tripp show less a real friendship than a
temporary alliance between two women obsessed by Bill Clinton who
often don't even seem to like each other very much.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Tripp, who made the tapes, comes off in the conversations
she arranged as unable to resist making her feelings of moral and
intellectual superiority clear to the younger woman. She corrects
Ms. Lewinsky's grammar, sighs at her romantic yearnings, edits her
love notes, ridicules her girlish handwriting and needles her with
such zingers as ``He's never been attracted to you because you use
big words.''
</P>
<P>
   When Ms. Lewinsky admits with some embarrassment that she has
sent the president her thoughts on education reform, Mrs. Tripp
responds, ``Oh, you mean an actual idea.''
</P>
<P>
   At every opportunity, she prods Ms. Lewinsky to push the
president harder to get her a job, and not just any job. She tries
to persuade Ms. Lewinsky that she's thinking too small, settling
for too little and going too easy on Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   In Ms. Lewinsky's grand jury testimony, the former White House
intern presented herself as an operator who aggressively lobbied
the president to find her a well-paying, low-stress job. But these
tapes show the extent to which Ms. Lewinsky was in turn influenced
by Mrs. Tripp. Word by word, she helped Ms. Lewinsky write the
letter demanding that the president help her get a big job.
</P>
<P>
   When the two women discuss their own relationship, they pledge a
certain devotion but acknowledge some problems. Ms. Lewinsky asks
Mrs. Tripp if she's ever noticed how they make each other angry.
And Mrs. Tripp, at another point, says: ``The problem I have with
you, frankly, is I feel entirely too maternal towards you. And it's
almost like when I'm yelling at my kids, not that that ever has any
effect. When I yell at you, it's out of love.''
</P>
<P>
   The tapes released Friday fill in the blanks of a relationship
perhaps more mysterious than that between a younger woman and an
older man. Ms. Lewinsky, a recent college graduate in her first
professional job, and Mrs. Tripp, who is about twice her age,
became close at the Pentagon, where both had been reassigned from
the Clinton White House.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike Ms. Lewinsky, who was transferred against her will
for having a crush on the president, Mrs. Tripp had come to dislike
the Clintons intensely and felt she was shoved out for opposite
reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Tripp seems to become so involved in the relationship
between Ms. Lewinsky and the president that she even appears to try
managing the sex itself. After hearing a breathy holiday message
Ms. Lewinsky has recorded for the president, Mrs. Tripp says, `No
wonder he likes to have phone sex with you _ you're just like a
little Marilyn Monroe vixen,'' and then encourages her to rerecord
it to make it a little tartier.
</P>
<P>
   For her part, Ms. Lewinsky, who seems to feel more comfortable
with older men and women than with people her own age, leans
heavily on Mrs. Tripp but clearly resents her attitude, frequently
answering her putdowns with ``Thank you very much.'' Still, she
does not seem to be able to stop confiding in her, perhaps because
Mrs. Tripp shows an unusual willingness to listen to a replay of
endless detail of the presidential affair.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, it is the everydayness of their hours and hours of
conversation _ the ``Hang on a minute,'' ``Don't go anywhere, my
dinner's heating, I'm starving,'' and ``Cleo, get off that couch''
_ that makes the conversations taped by the one friend unbeknownst
to the other so ugly.
</P>
<P>
   One friend is losing her way, calling herself a crazy person and
wondering how she can live without her wonderful, awful, married
lover, the president. The other is jabbering about her bad haircut
and quietly collecting evidence.
</P>
<P>
   In her grand jury testimony, Mrs. Tripp defended her decision to
make the tapes of their conversations.
</P>
<P>
   ``My idea was never to manufacture evidence. In fact, I had
never even thought about the independent counsel in my wildest
dreams. My idea was, I'm going to arm myself with records so when
I'm in a position to speak under oath I can do so truthfully, not
to be set up in a perjury trap, and say, `Fine, you think I'm
committing perjury _ here, have a look.'
</P>
<P>
   ``At no time did I make a conscious effort to catalog or
document or even date the conversations. It was just my way of
having my backup so that when I had the fear of losing everything
that I had worked for my entire life, and my children, that I would
have some way of proving that I was not lying under oath.''
</P>
<P>
   In the conversations she recorded, there are a few funny
moments, as when Ms. Lewinsky says, ``Linda, if I ever want to have
an affair with a married man again _ especially if he's president _
please shoot me.'' (Mrs. Tripp laughs and promises to follow
through.)
</P>
<P>
   But mostly the tapes are a depressing record of a brand of
betrayal that some single women might consider more devastating
than that of an unfaithful man.
</P>
<P>
   At least obliquely, Mrs. Tripp repeatedly signals Ms. Lewinsky
that for her own good, she will hurt her to make sure she gets out
of the relationship. ``I know you're going to hate me, Monica,''
she tells her at one point, when the two are discussing how hard
the president is really trying to help her. ``I want you the ...
out of there. I want you with a life.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   There are many other moments when Mrs. Tripp overtly encourages
Ms. Lewinsky in her belief that there is hope for her with the
president, telling her that the president clearly does care for her
but can't be with her, because of the possible consequences: ``I
don't think he has it in him to say, ``I meant it _ I wanted you
back _ I want you in my life, but I can't do it.''
</P>
<P>
   In an e-mail to Mrs. Tripp, Ms. Lewinsky says, ``I will also be
checking my messages in the hopes that the creep will call and say:
`Thank you for my love note. I love you. Will you run away with
me?'' What do you think the likelihood of that happening is?''
</P>
<P>
   And Mrs. Tripp blatantly eggs her on, ``Ah, but that has already
transpired, says my omnipotent crystal ball,'' and ``You will come
home to an opportunity to get together with the creep, I am
positive.''
</P>
<P>
   There does not seem to be a huge maturity gap between the two
women. When Ms. Lewinsky says she may also be falling for Vernon
Jordan, the president's friend, who has been dispatched to help her
find work, Mrs. Tripp's only response is that yes, Jordan is
attractive, or as she says, ``very crushable.''
</P>
<P>
   And her advice to her young colleague is pretty uniformly bad.
Her thought for a good job option for Ms. Lewinsky in New York, for
example, is to check with Susan Thomases, Hillary Rodham Clinton's
good friend.
</P>
<P>
   When Mrs. Tripp testified before the grand jury, she said her
disillusionment with the Clinton administration dated to the first
days after Clinton took office. She was appalled by how the new
administration dismissed many senior civil servants to fulfill a
campaign promise to cut White House staff by 25 percent, and then
replaced them with political appointees.
</P>
<P>
   She saw Gary Aldrich, a former Secret Service agent who wrote a
tell-all book about the Clintons, as a ``professional, decent,
honorable'' man who was ``slimed'' by the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a vast font of knowledge and exposure to things that
went on in this White House that I found appalling, and I had made
a decision in 1996 to go forward with revelations about what I had
seen, but fear drove me away from what would have been a product
that would have certainly lost me my job.''
</P>
<P>
   When Mrs. Tripp speaks with Ms. Lewinsky about the president, it
is with considerable, though usually modulated, anger. She tells
her: ``Most people going through what you've gone through would
have said, ``Hey ... you and the horse you rode in on, and let me
call the National Enquirer. You know? He has no business yelling at
you and saying, `If I had known what kind of person you were in the
beginning, I wouldn't have gotten involved with you.'''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Tripp also makes it clear that she believes Clinton has
abused Ms. Lewinsky, and only fleetingly gets Ms. Lewinsky to
agree. ``You protect him, every inch of the way,'' Mrs. Tripp says
in frustration.
</P>
<P>
   But she still seems to want to be in on every aspect of the
relationship between the president and his former intern. When Ms.
Lewinsky worries that Clinton must think she's an idiot because her
notes have not always been well-written, Mrs. Tripp sighs and says,
``I think most of the things that I've seen are well done. Of
course, you've let a few slip that I haven't seen.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky gives Mrs. Tripp presents, and showers her with
affection and gratitude in a way that Mrs. Tripp obviously enjoys.
But like her involvement with the president, the relationship is
way off-kilter and in the end, one-sided.
</P>
<P>
   When Ms. Lewinsky thanks her friend for helping her tape the
sexy message to the president, she gushes, ``Here you are, sitting
on the phone, going over all this stupid ... with me, listening to
the tapes.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Tripp responds, ``It's because I care about you, and I _
you know, in my heart of hearts.''

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Bilingual education in California was supposed to
be in a grave by now, essentially killed when residents voted last
spring to end it.
</P>
<P>
   The ballot initiative, supported by 61 percent of the voters,
sought to replace 30 years of using Spanish and other foreign
languages to help immigrant children in the state learn to read,
write and speak English with a method that uses ``nearly all''
English instruction.
</P>
<P>
   But more than a month into the current school term, bilingual
education is clearly still breathing. The reasons are a subject of
hot debate.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the initiative, Proposition 227, assert that
school districts and the education bureaucracy are resisting the
will of the voters, taking advantage of loopholes to preserve a
rejected method of teaching.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the proposition see the bumpy transition as a result
of confusion, reluctance on the part of some parents and teachers
to push children into instruction they are not ready for, and even
basic logistical issues like the lack of textbooks.
</P>
<P>
   What is clear is that the fight over Proposition 227 is not over
yet.
</P>
<P>
   Doug Stone, a spokesman for the state Education Department, said
he had heard of no open defiance of the law and ``when push came to
shove, virtually all of the districts are complying.''
</P>
<P>
   Some do not agree with that assessment.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people are trying to loosely interpret and undermine
this law,'' said Sean Walsh, a spokesman for Gov. Pete Wilson, a
Republican and a critic of bilingual education. ``The law says
`nearly all' should be taught in English. But many districts are
using 40 percent Spanish and 60 percent English.''
</P>
<P>
   The law does not define what ``nearly all'' means, so there is
much disagreement over what constitutes compliance.
</P>
<P>
   Elena Soto-Chapa, the statewide education director for the
Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, which has gone
to court seeking to block the initiative, said that how the
hundreds of school districts across the state defined ``nearly
all'' was ``just all over the spectrum.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Soto-Chapa said some districts were using a 60-40
English-foreign language formula while others were using 70-30 or
80-20. ''There's a lot of confusion,'' she said. ``It's a very
political, murky environment right now.''
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles United School District, with 681,505 students
the second largest in the country behind New York City, offers two
programs for pupils with limited English ability: Model A and Model
B. In Model A, the classes are taught virtually all in English. In
Model B, 65 percent to 70 percent of the classes are taught in
English.
</P>
<P>
   Alice Callaghan, one of the leading proponents of Proposition
227, said ``L.A. is absolutely out of compliance.''
</P>
<P>
   The state Education Department has set up a study group to help
districts implement the law.
</P>
<P>
   ``We realized that before June 2 and after June 2 there would be
more questions than answers,'' Stone said, referring to the day the
initiative was approved. ``But that isn't a sign from heaven that
school districts can thwart the law.''
</P>
<P>
   Out of the 5.5 million public school pupils in California, about
1.4 million have a limited understanding of English, but only 30
percent of them were enrolled in bilingual education programs last
year. The rest were in classes in which teachers used nearly all
English. There were not enough qualified teachers for bilingual
classes.
</P>
<P>
   Under Proposition 227, some parents are eligible to request that
their children be retained in a bilingual program, and such waivers
can be be granted by a school district under three circumstances:
The child has a physical or psychological need to be in bilingual
education, the child is over 10 years old or the child speaks
English.
</P>
<P>
   But the question of waivers is also the subject of intense and
varied interpretation and debate. Before a waiver can be granted, a
child must spend the first 30 days of school in a class taught
primarily in English. That period has now expired for about 25,000
Los Angeles pupils with limited English skills who started the new
year in late summer. Although many expected a wave of request for
waivers, only about 1,300 have been sought so far, said Forrest
Ross, director of language acquisition for the Los Angeles
district.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Soto-Chapa said, ``I think a lot of parents are taking a
wait and see approach,''
</P>
<P>
   At the Logan Street School in Los Angeles, a few blocks from
Dodger Stadium, parents of 250 of the 360 pupils eligible have
asked for and received waivers. Those children are now in bilingual
classes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not trying to circumvent the law,'' said Logan Street's
principal, May Arakaki. ``We're just giving the parents the options
they and their children deserve and are entitled to.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Arakaki and her staff have had to do some fancy juggling.
Mrs. Arakaki had to move three children whose parents signed
waivers into Helen Trevino's second-grade class, which is primarily
bilingual, and move three others into an English-immersion class.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Ms. Trevino has a class of nine bilingual pupils and six
who are taught primarily in English, forcing her to go from table
to table and tongue to tongue. Ideally, the class would be either
all bilingual or virtually all English.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm for bilingual education,'' Ms. Trevino said. ``But the new
law has passed and we have to deal with it.''

DOCUMENTS CAST HARD LIGHT ON LEWINSKY, TRIPP 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN C. HENRY 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Another mound of documents released Friday from
Kenneth Starr's investigation casts a harsh light on Monica
Lewinsky and Linda Tripp while providing fresh details embarrassing
to President Clinton but of little help to Congress in deciding
whether he should be impeached.
</P>
<P>
   Published by the Republican-dominated House, the new material
includes transcripts from 20 hours of secretly recorded telephone
conversations in which Tripp and Lewinsky breathlessly discuss her
affair with Clinton, how to seek White House help finding a job and
whether to lie to keep the president out of legal trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Also among the documents is grand jury testimony from almost 100
witnesses, including one Secret Service agent who told of rumors
among the president's bodyguards that Clinton had White House
sexual encounters with at least six women.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the newly released information includes evidence
that the White House says refutes allegations that Clinton enlisted
others to illegally cover-up his sexual encounters with the former
White House intern.
</P>
<P>
   Contained in three brown-clad volumes, the latest batch of tape
transcripts, grand jury testimony, e-mail, diaries and notes
contain no new bombshells but are brimming with details certain to
become part of the debate over Clinton's fitness to remain in
office.
</P>
<P>
   The documents were released by the House Judiciary Committee,
which on Monday begins debating whether to begin the first formal
presidential impeachment inquiry since Watergate, which ended in
1974 with the resignation of President Nixon.
</P>
<P>
   In his Sept. 11 report to Congress of impeachable offenses,
Starr alleges that Clinton committed perjury, obstructed justice,
tampered with witnesses and abused the power of his office trying
to cover up his affair with Lewinsky during the Paula Jones sexual
harassment lawsuit and, later, during Starr's grand jury
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Late Friday, White House special counsel Gregory Craig promised
a lengthy response to the charges, based on the newly released
material, would be delivered to the House Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``We intend to submit a complete accounting of the pattern of
evidentiary manipulation and misdirection employed by the
independent counsel,'' Craig said. ``We also intend to ask the
committee to examine more fully the troubling role this new
material suggests was played by Linda Tripp.''
</P>
<P>
   Starr later disputed Craig's claims that significant evidence
was left out of his Sept. 11 referral and cited the pages on which
the information could be found.
</P>
<P>
   ``Significantly, the White House today did not question Ms.
Lewinsky's credibility, or the factual underpinnings of nine of the
eleven possible grounds for impeachment _ including the president's
perjury in his civil deposition and before the grand jury,'' Starr
said.
</P>
<P>
   The documents released Friday totalled 4,610 pages, edited down
from about 65,000 pages provided by Starr. Large segments were
deleted, including the names of the six women mentioned by the
Secret Service agent as rumored paramours of the president.
</P>
<P>
   The evidence also portrays Tripp as Starr's eager informant,
coaching Lewinsky about her relationship with Clinton and coaxing
details from her friend about her White House trysts with the
president and their late-night telephone sex.
</P>
<P>
   When their conversations, which Tripp was secretly recording,
wandered toward talk about pets, food or clothes, Tripp steered
Lewinsky back to her affair with ``Handsome'' or ``Boo Boo'' or
``Creep'' or ``The Big He,'' as Lewinsky variously called Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   One of the tapes indicates that Tripp first introduced the idea
of Lewinsky seeking help from Vernon Jordan, a Washington
power-broker and Clinton confidant, to find a job in New York. In
another conversation, Tripp advises Lewinsky to hold out for a
higher-paying job. ``You have got to get out of town, big time,''
Tripp tells Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   During one call, Lewinsky told Tripp that she had been ordered
to lie about the affair and urged Tripp to do the same. ``What he
has told me is there is no way to get caught in perjury in a
situation like this,'' Lewinsky said without identifying who ``he''
is. Both Lewinsky and Clinton testified to the grand jury that he
never told Lewinsky to lie.
</P>
<P>
   Refusing to go along with Lewinsky's plea to join in the
deception, Tripp tells her friend: ``I feel like I'm sticking a
knife in your back.''
</P>
<P>
   While much of the focus was on the Tripp-Lewinsky tapes which
touched off Starr's investigation, other evidence included grand
jury testimony from Jordan, Clinton secretary Betty Currie, aide
and longtime friend Bruce Lindsey, and various Secret Service
agents.
</P>
<P>
   During one of her five grand jury appearances, Currie testified
that the night before the scandal erupted in January, the president
woke her up with a telephone call after midnight. He said
``something would be in The Washington Post'' and ``it was not
good,'' Currie recalled.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you think you can reach Monica, see what's happening?'' the
president asked her.
</P>
<P>
   Currie said she paged Lewinsky asking her to call ``K'', the
code-name they used when leaving each other messages. Currie
testified that she didn't hear from the young woman until the next
morning, Jan. 19, when Lewinsky, who by then had been approached by
FBI agents, said only, ``I can't talk to you'' and hung up.
</P>
<P>
   Currie also testified that Lewinsky and not the president caused
subpoenaed gifts to be retrieved and hidden under Mrs. Currie's
bed. Currie also told the grand jury that she, not the president,
first asked Jordan to help find a job for Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was doing it on my own,'' Currie testified. Starr alleges
the job search was evidence that Clinton sought to buy Lewinsky's
silence, a charge the former intern also denies in documents
released Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Included in the grand jury transcripts was the testimony from 31
Secret Service agents and officers who, after a lengthy legal
battle, were compelled to testify about Clinton's contacts with
Lewinsky and their suspicions about other presidential paramours.
</P>
<P>
   The habit of rumor-mongering among the bodyguards was so
prevalent that one officer, Greg LaDow, notified his supervisor and
suggested limiting Lewinsky's access to the president and her
movement around the White House. LaDow said his supervisor
responded that it is ``none of our business who the president
sees.'' &QL;

 LOS ANGELES: with it.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In one twist, 39 of the nearly 1,000 schools districts in
California _ including Los Angeles, San Diego, Fresno and Oakland _
have requested waivers of some kind to teaching all classes
primarily in English_ whether for individual schools or for entire
districts.
</P>
<P>
   But in August, the state Board of Education, whose 11 members
are appointed by the governor, refused to consider the waiver
requests, saying it did not have the authority to grant them to
districts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The initiative was very clear about waivers,'' said Bill
Lucia, executive director of the state school board. ``And it
doesn't say anything about districtwide waivers.''
</P>
<P>
   After the board refused to hear the requests, the districts of
Oakland, Hayward and Berkeley took the board to court, demanding
that it be forced to do so.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel that bilingual education works and we feel that our
community believes in bilingual education,'' said Sue Piper, a
spokeswoman for the 53,000-pupil Oakland Unified School District.
``That's not to say it's perfect. But our test scores show that the
children who graduate from bilingual education do very well.''
</P>
<P>
   Alameda County Superior Court Judge Henry Needham ruled last
month that the board had to hear the districts' waiter requests.
The board appealed the decision and voted to postpone action on the
requests pending the outcome of the appeal. That could be months,
and in the meantime the districts are required to implement the
proposition.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson had urged the board to appeal Needham's decision, saying
his decision ``could potentially eviscerate Proposition 227.''
</P>
<P>
   Lucia said that some of the board members were also concerned
that they might be sued by proponents of the proposition if they
ruled on the waivers before the issue of the board's authority had
been determined in the appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could require individual board members to get lawyers,'' he
said. ``It's a serious matter. It's a question of losing your
house.''
</P>
<P>
   The initiative says that teachers and administrators who
implement the law improperly can be held liable.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to be suing soon,'' said Ms. Callaghan, a leading
supporter of the proposition. ``We won't let this go on much
longer.''
</P>
<P>
   The threat of lawsuits has also had a chilling effect on
teachers. Hundreds of teachers in Los Angeles signed a petition
last spring pledging open rebellion if Proposition 227 passed. The
teachers vowed to risk being sued and dismissed by continuing to
use bilingual education methods in their classrooms. But so far,
the rebellion has not materialized _ at least not openly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Open defiance would be dismissal, and that was made very clear
to us,'' said Steve Zimmer a member of On Campus, the teachers'
group that organized the pledge of resistance. ``But you certainly
still have defiance. It's just being done behind closed doors.''
</P>
<P>
   Zimmer said that some teachers were simply teaching how they had
always taught immigrant children, using bilingual methods, while
others who otherwise comply with the law were still using a lot of
bilingual methods because they did not yet have the books and other
materials necessary to put the proposition into effect.
</P>
<P>
   ``There aren't enough books,'' he said. ``There are stories
about fourth graders using kindergarten books.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Zimmer said, the majority of teachers are doing their
best to comply with the law.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though we did the pledge,'' he said, ``I can't in good
conscience tell a teacher to let this fail so we can get rid of it.
The efforts of teachers not to damage children is what is making
this work at all.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Callaghan said she received almost daily reports of
widespread non-compliance by teachers and districts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Name me a district that is not defying the law,'' she said.
``There will be less Spanish spoken, but that doesn't mean they
will teach English immersion. The law required that bilingual
education be replaced, not mended. It's going to be a very
unfortunate year.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet at individual schools like Logan Street in Los Angeles, it
is more a year of improvisation, of trying to accommodate and
educate at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   Gloria Rodriguez has two children at Logan, a daughter,
Christina, 8, a third grader, and a son, Gabriel, 9, a fourth
grader. Her daughter began school in bilingual classes but tested
high enough to move into classes taught in English before
Proposition 227 became the law.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Rodriguez signed a waiver for her son. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not ready yet,'' she said. ``My daughter is doing very
well, and I think it is because of bilingual education. When she
goes to college, she wants to learn Japanese and French. That will
be four languages she will know how to speak and write. Employers
will love her.''

ROBERT LEWIS TAYLOR, 88, NOVELIST AND BIOGRAPHER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill., Conn., Mo.)   (bl)  
 By BARBARA STEWART   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Robert Lewis Taylor, a prolific and witty writer of a Pulitzer
Prize-winning novel, a respected biography of W.C. Fields and New
Yorker articles that a magazine colleague and memoirist called
``some of the funniest profiles we ever published,'' died Sept. 30
at his home in Southbury, Conn. He was 88.
</P>
<P>
   He received a Pulitzer Prize in 1959 for ``The Travels of Jaimie
McPheeters,'' a novel about a 14-year-old boy and his father
trekking West during the 1849 gold rush. Calling it authentic and
``tremendously exciting,'' a review in The New York Times said that
`` Taylor takes an entire train of diverse human beings all the way
from Independence, Mo., to California'' with incidents that ``will
curl the hair of many a reader.''
</P>
<P>
   For The New Yorker, Taylor wrote profiles on characters as
diverse as the city fire chief and the conductor Artie Shaw to
Gargantua, a circus ape nearly as famous as King Kong, and Charles
Atlas, the muscleman pictured in the back of comic books. He zeroed
in on any little oddities or curious characteristics and in a few
breezy sentences pinned them down with often wicked precision.
</P>
<P>
   In a piece on Larry MacPhail, general manager of the Brooklyn
Dodgers in the late 1930s, he wrote: ``His habitual expression
seems to be a silent appeal for Bromo Seltzer.''
</P>
<P>
   Taylor, who grew up in Carbondale, Ill., and graduated from the
University of Illinois, began his career as a reporter for The
Carbondale Herald. After a year, he quit and rode a steamer to
Tahiti, stayed until he was broke and returned to work on The St.
Louis Post Dispatch.
</P>
<P>
   In 1939 Harold Ross, editor of The New Yorker, hired him. He
remained there until 1961. Like many of the magazine's other
writers and editors, began to accumulate a stock of personal
legends along with his published stories. From them, he emerges as
tall and good-looking, a brilliant comic writer and sharply _ some
say caustically _ witty.
</P>
<P>
   But when the jabs were aimed at him, he became ``infuriated,''
said Philip Hamburger, who has written for The New Yorker for more
than 50 years. ``He was deeply eccentric: he could be your best
friend one day, and didn't know you the next,'' Hamburger said.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1975 memoir ``Here at The New Yorker,'' Brendan Gill
wrote of an exchange between Taylor and William Shawn, who
succeeded Ross as the magazine's editor. On his rare vacations,
Shawn went on working at home. When he returned to the office after
one of these vacations, Taylor congratulated him: ``Bill! You must
have had a marvelous time!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, very nice, thank you.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Played a lot of golf?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, no, not golf, exactly.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Tennis, then?''
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I don't play tennis.''
</P>
<P>
   And so on, Gill wrote, sport to sport, with ``Shawn remaining
invincible in his politeness, Taylor ruthless in his persistence.''
</P>
<P>
   In New Yorker anecdotes, Taylor was also described as extremely
conservative. While Elizabeth Peek, his daughter, said he was very
respectful and nearly in awe of Shawn, Hamburger said Taylor had a
heated argument with the editor in an office corridor, ``Which,''
he said, ``nobody ever did.'' It was about atomic bombs, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Around that time, 1960 or so, Taylor ``drifted away from the
magazine into wealth and a querulous political recidivism,''
reported the Gill memoir. As a supporter of Barry Goldwater, he
could have come to feel uncomfortable with the urban liberals at
The New Yorker.
</P>
<P>
   His most popular biography was ``W.C. Fields: His Follies and
Fortunes,'' the story of the comedian's journey from vagrancy and
flea-circus juggling to Hollywood. Other books included ``Center
Ring: The People of the Circus'' and several novels, ``Adrift in a
Boneyard,'' a tale of survivors of an atomiclike cataclysm, and ``A
Journey to Matecumbe,'' an adventure set in the South during the
Reconstruction.
</P>
<P>
   His wife, Judith Martin, died a few years ago. In addition to
his daughter, he is survived by a son, Martin, of Camden, Me., and
five grandchildren.

NOW, USC HAS SERIOUS PRESSURE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The pain from losing to Florida State has receded,
tempered by the knowledge USC was really only expected to survive
the Seminoles, not conquer them.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the Trojans have something to really worry about _ a
winnable game.
</P>
<P>
   They face Arizona State today at the Coliseum in one of those
unpredictable toss-ups that really prove what differences have been
made in the USC football program the past 10 months.
</P>
<P>
   A victory over Arizona State could allow USC to be 6-1 entering
their Oct. 24 encounter at Oregon, with a strong chance to win
eight or nine games. A loss to the Sun Devils, and the Trojans face
the possibility of another 6-6 or 7-5 season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to face the facts now. The next seven-week stretch
will make or break this season. Every one counts toward the true
prize, the Rose Bowl,'' USC coach Paul Hackett said.
</P>
<P>
   But even as Hackett talks big, he also is quick to point out
that this is all part of a slow rebuilding process.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, we're a .500 football team now,'' he said. ``That's
the way we've been for the last couple years and I assume that's
the way we'll be for a couple more.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the players' aspirations remain focused on the Rose
Bowl, they might be concentrating more on their recent history with
the Sun Devils. USC (3-1 overall, 1-0 in the Pacific-10) has lost
two straight to Arizona State (2-2, 1-1), including an embarrassing
35-7 drubbing in Tempe last season that signaled the end of the
John Robinson era.
</P>
<P>
   If nothing else, the Trojans should be properly motivated.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't beaten them yet,'' wide receiver R. Jay Soward said.
``We were dominated by them. Now, we have to go out and totally
dominate them.''
</P>
<P>
   This is a game that has changed much in the past month. The Sun
Devils were picked to win the conference and were considered
darkhorse candidates to win the national championship. But opening
losses to Washington and Brigham Young exposed their defense as
less-than-championship caliber.
</P>
<P>
   That might be something to buoy Trojan hopes, as long as the
offense's top two, or perhaps only two, weapons are healthy.
Tailback Chad Morton re-strained his back against Florida State and
did not practice this week. His status will be determined before
the game, but he is expected to play.
</P>
<P>
   Soward took a day off to rest a sore ankle and strained thigh
muscle, but will also play.
</P>
<P>
   Without them, USC's offense might struggle against every team
the way the Trojans did against Florida State.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got our work cut out for us,'' Hackett said. ``We've
been through a tough go, but we have to learn to respond to tough
situations. Much of it is if we can continue to improve.''
</P>
<P>
   Arizona State is in a virtually identical situation, trying to
prevent its season from unraveling barely four games into the
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We started off just terrible,'' Arizona State coach Bruce
Snyder said. ``We've climbed out of our hole to some degree. We're
somewhat back on track.''
</P>
<P>
   After today, only one of these teams will believe that.
</P>
<P>
   Notes: A crowd of about 50,000 is expected today.... Unlike past
years, Arizona State coach Bruce Snyder decided to leave Friday
night for Los Angeles and practice in Tempe on Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've found it very difficult to get to the Coliseum because of
traffic,'' Snyder said. ``And it seems every time we go over there,
someone is painting the field, and we can't get on when they've
told us we could.''

   STOCKS PARTLY RECOVER FOLLOWING TWO-DAY PLUNGE
</P>
<P>
   Stocks rallied Friday after two days of heavy losses that helped
push the Dow Jones industrial average down more than 18 percent
from its mid-July peak. The rebound was attributed partly to
expectations of further rate cuts by the Federal Reserve, which
reduced rates Tuesday to counter an economic slowdown caused by the
financial crises abroad.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average rose 152.16 points, or 1.99
percent, partly erasing a 448-point fall over Wednesday and
Thursday. The blue-chip index still ended the week 244.08 points
lower at 7,784.69. Broader market indexes also gained Friday but
posted weekly losses, while long-term Treasury yields fell to 4.84
percent, another 31-year low.

   PRE-EMPTIVE IMF AID PROPOSED
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton announced a proposal to change the strategy of
the International Monetary Fund and allow it to use billions of
dollars to help countries ward off economic crises early, rather
than waiting until disaster strikes, when bailouts are more
expensive and painful. Clinton's proposal came after a week of
intense turmoil on financial markets and growing fears that the
IMF's shortage of funds is paralyzing its ability to calm
investors.

 WASHINGTON: Clinton defenders.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Armies of lawyers and media personnel gleaned the latest
disclosures into the weekend, setting the stage for the Judiciary
Committee's opening hearing Monday. In particular, they studied the
president's initial handling of the crisis as it broke last
January, the Democrats' insistence that the evidence is more
exculpatory than indicting, and, above all, the interplay between
Ms. Tripp and Ms. Lewinsky _ with the intern remaining clueless
until the end about her friend's duplicity. ``You are a wise, savvy
woman, and I truly value your opinions,'' she told Ms. Tripp in a
birthday note last November.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan, the president's golfing buddy who helped look for a job
for Ms. Lewinsky when she was being subpoenaed in the Jones
lawsuit, testified that two days after his deposition Clinton was
in an ``incredulous state'' about the internet-circulated Drudge
Report _ the cyber gossip's first public hint of Starr's
lightning-quick entry into Clinton's personal affairs as he pursued
evidence of obstruction of justice.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not true,'' the president declared, according to Jordan,
who said he once more observed that the president should have
settled the Jones suit earlier. With the new threat emerging,
Jordan had lunch with Lindsay. ``It was clear that there was a
problem, and what to do about the problem we did not get into,''
Jordan testified.
</P>
<P>
   The president, meanwhile, had already been talking to Mrs.
Currie soon after his return from the deposition and asking a
series of questions that prosecutors consider witness-coaching but
that the president insists was innocent. Before that point, even as
the president was being deposed on Jan. 17, John Podesta, the
president's deputy chief of staff, had heard the first rumors of
Starr's possible entry into the affair _ ``linking for the first
time, in my mind, Monica Lewinsky to the Paula Jones matter,''
Podesta testified.
</P>
<P>
   As the sense of crisis grew, Vernon pursued Ms. Lewinsky, whom
he got to know while helping her with job-hunting. Summarizing the
young woman for the grand jury, Jordan recalled, ``I was listening
to a bobby-soxer who was mesmerized by Frank Sinatra.''
</P>
<P>
   The president telephoned Jordan in the early morning of January
21, when the first newspaper disclosures were breaking about
Starr's new branch of inquiry. ``There's a story out,'' the
president said, according to Jordan. ``I'm concerned about it. And
the story is about Monica Lewinsky and myself.'' Clinton ``just
sort of emoted about his circumstances,'' Jordan said. In turn, he
testified, he advised the president: ``Not to worry about it. Tell
the first lady. Deal with it later in the morning.''
</P>
<P>
   The president's lawyers said the latest release of documents
bolster their charges that Starr twisted the evidence he gained in
his investigation to build an impeachment referral to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Gregory Craig, the special counsel to the president, said a
close reading of the thousands of fresh pages show that Starr
engaged in ``a pattern of evidentiary manipulation and
misdirection'' in his report to the Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Craig, who was recently added to the White House staff to direct
Clinton's response to the impeachment inquiry, said that Starr
purposely failed to discuss evidence favorable to the president
``and intentionally omitted direct exculpatory testimony,
paraphrased unambiguous statements to obscure their plain meaning,
and systematically resolved conflicting testimony in its favor.''
</P>
<P>
   The principal evidence of that, Craig said, was Starr's initial
``narrative'' _ a list of detailed charges presented to Congress _
did not contain some of the information that was finally released
Friday, well after the initial sensation over Starr's impeachment
recommendation last month. The president's lawyers cited Currie's
testimony that it was she and not Clinton who was responsible for
trying to get Ms. Lewinsky a job.
</P>
<P>
   And the White House once more underlined Ms. Lewinsky's own
testimony in contradiction of the suborning perjury argument: ``No
one ever asked me to lie and I was never promised a job for my
silence.'`
</P>
<P>
   The president's lawyers sent a letter today to Rep. Henry Hyde,
chairman of the Judiciary Committee, outlining their objections and
arguing as well that neither private sexual conduct nor the perjury
alleged by the president's critics met the constitutional test of
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   The White House's various protests and references to the new
material pointed once more toward building a defense that Linda
Tripp acted as an agent provocateur for the president's political
opponents in her conversations and tapings of Ms. Lewinsky.

 WASHINGTON: Ms. Lewinsky.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The release of the text, but not the sound, of the taped
conversations, presents considerable excerpts from the long and
winding feat of eavesdropping carried out by Ms. Tripp on Ms.
Lewinsky as she railed about her affair with Clinton. ``I don't
think there's a detail she left out,'' Ms. Tripp testified to the
grand jury, as if from exhaustion.
</P>
<P>
   The tapes present Ms. Tripp's behavior ranging the gamut. ``I
hate what he has done to you,'' she said in denouncing the
president at one point. But at another moment, her mission in
endlessly hearing about Ms. Lewinsky's version of her life and
times clearly exasperated Ms. Tripp.
</P>
<P>
   In an e-mail message last Oct. 27, she complained to Ms.
Lewinsky about her constant ``ranting and raving'' over the affair.
``Share this sick situation with one of your friends, because,
frankly, I'm past nauseated about the whole thing,'' Ms. Tripp
snapped. (She obviously reconsidered, for she taped on into the New
Year, and finally for Starr.)
</P>
<P>
   To the rebuff, Ms. Lewinsky replied, ``That's fine,'' while
urging that none of their confidences ever be broken.
</P>
<P>
   In her own grand jury testimony, Ms. Tripp denied playing secret
agent for Starr and other Republican critics of the president. ``My
idea was never to manufacture evidence,'' she declared. ``In fact,
I had never even thought about the independent counsel in my
wildest dreams. My idea was I'm going to arm myself with records so
when I'm in a position to speak under oath I can do so
truthfully.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Tripp testified that in July of 1997 ``it was completely
frightening to me to learn that Monica had had a topic of
discussion solely about me with the president of the United
States.'' She feared the president's fabled political attack
specialists. ``I knew I had to arm myself with records,'' she
testified, ``Because no one would believe it. And I still didn't
make the decision to arm myself with records until October.''
</P>
<P>
   At one point, the interchanges of the two women echo
Pirandello's play within the play when Ms. Lewinsky was creating
her own taped holiday greeting for the president last December and
Ms. Lewinsky taped the taping. It was a playful message beginning,
``Hi, Handsome,'' and proposing she once again meet personally with
the president. ``You can't refuse me, because I'm too cute and
adorable,'' said Ms. Lewinsky whose talk on the tapes ranges from
old salt vulgarity to pajama party girlishness.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Tripp is heard, on her own secret recording of Ms.
Lewinsky's tape-making, speaking in praise of the former intern for
ever thinking of a tape as a gift. ``You know me with tapes,'' said
Ms. Tripp, her microphone hidden. ``I'm thinking (sighing), `The
voice is always more believable.' ''
</P>
<P>
   For her part, Ms. Lewinsky often sounds self-absorbed and
frustrated. ``I think people call me the stalker.'' she lamented.
``I think that's what they say. Oh my God, that gets me so mad. I
hate that,'' she said, as Ms. Tripp quietly taped the tale of the
president and the intern.

WHITE HOUSE LAWYER REFUSED TO ANSWER SOME QUESTIONS

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Bruce Lindsey, the deputy White House counsel,
asserted lawyer-client privilege and refused to answer grand jury
questions even after a federal appeals court held that he was not
entitled to such a claim, according to transcripts of his
testimony.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 28, a prosecutor asked Lindsey, a longtime Arkansas
friend and confidant of President Clinton, whether Clinton had told
him that his relationship with Monica Lewinsky was not sexual. That
led to this exchange before the grand jury:
</P>
<P>
   A. I'm not going to discuss my conversations with the president.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Why not?
</P>
<P>
   A. Attorney-client privilege.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Are you saying that in your discussions with the president,
you were receiving this information, this factual information, from
the president for what purpose?
</P>
<P>
   A. Well, I believe that in my role as White House counsel or
deputy White House counsel that I was receiving this information in
that role in connection with ongoing matters that would affect the
presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Lindsey went before the grand jury four times, three of them in
February and March. Transcripts of the testimony were among the
documents made public Friday by the House Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   On July 27, a three-judge panel of the District of Columbia U.S.
Court of Appeals ruled, 2-1, that Lindsey was not protected by the
privilege he claimed. ``When an executive-branch attorney is called
before a federal grand jury to give evidence about alleged crimes
within the executive branch, reason and experience, duty and
tradition dictate that the attorney shall provide that evidence,''
the court declared.
</P>
<P>
   The White House has appealed to the Supreme Court, but that
court has not announced whether it will consider the case.
</P>
<P>
   In his first three appearances before the grand jury, Lindsey
also made extensive claims of executive privilege, the doctrine
that presidential assistants cannot be made to testify about their
confidential advice and deliberations.
</P>
<P>
   Lindsey even used this privilege on Feb. 19 to refuse to answer
questions about conversations he had with Clinton's friend Vernon
Jordan, who is not on the government payroll. ``He is an adviser in
the sense that the president seeks his advice,'' Lindsey said.
</P>
<P>
   Other White House assistants, including Sidney Blumenthal, a
communications adviser, and Nancy Hernreich, an administrative
assistant, also asserted executive privilege under orders from the
president.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Starr, the Whitewater independent counsel, told Congress
that the invocation of executive privilege ``to conceal evidence of
his personal misconduct from the grand jury'' could be considered
an impeachable offense.
</P>
<P>
   On June 1, however, the White House dropped the claim of
executive privilege.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In his August testimony, Lindsey testified about a discussion he
had with Jordan in which Jordan said he was urging the president to
settle the Paula Jones lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Lindsey also described a staff meeting he had refused to testify
about earlier at which aides prepared the president for press
interviews on the day news about the Lewinsky case broke. The
advisers, Lindsey said, told the president he should give cursory
answers to questions about the Lewinsky case and try to focus the
interviews on his State of the Union message.
</P>
<P>
   On June 4, Blumenthal responded to a question he had refused to
answer in February about what Clinton told him about Ms. Lewinsky.
Blumenthal said that Clinton told him that Ms. Lewinsky had made
sexual advances to him and that he had rebuffed them.

McLEMORE MAKES SURE DEDICATED FAN SEES GAME 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Jerry Grant has spent the summer fighting
cancer. But what almost happened yesterday might have been worse.
</P>
<P>
   They almost had a playoff game at The Ballpark in Arlington
without her.
</P>
<P>
   That could have been a disaster, but Mark McLemore came riding
to the rescue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was standing outside where the players come in,'' Grant
said. ``I didn't have a ticket, I just wanted to come down and wish
them well tonight. Mark came by to stop and sign some autographs
and he saw me standing there. He said, `Hold on everybody I need to
talk to this lady in private.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Next thing she knew, Grant had a ticket behind home plate.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's such a nice lady,'' McLemore said. ``She's always nice
and fresh and friendly. It would be shame to have her standing
outside now.''
</P>
<P>
   Especially after what Grant, 59, had to go through this season.
She and her husband Sidney (a former Air Force man) are both
retired and have been Rangers season-ticket holders since The
Ballpark opened. Usually she shows up for batting practice, which
she watches while standing behind the Rangers dugout.
</P>
<P>
   But her season was cut short when she was diagnosed with stomach
cancer on May 22. So far, she hasn't needed an operation, but
between the chemotherapy and the brutal summer heat, she wasn't
able to make many games. She also wasn't sure she'd be able to
attend the playoff games, so she didn't re-order her tickets.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I did make every \RDr Pepper\S Rangers luncheon,'' she
said proudly. ``I'm doing much better. At the end of the
chemotherapy, there's a chance they may have to do surgery. But the
cancer is shrinking and the second biopsy was benign.''
</P>
<P>
   Ballpark regulars know her by sight and the Rangers missed
having her around.
</P>
<P>
   ``They called me up and said, `Since you can't sit out in the
sun, how would you like to watch a game from a suite in
air-conditioning?' '' Grant said. ``I said, `Oh yeah.' ''
</P>
<P>
   So, thanks to player relations director Taunee Paur, Grant
watched the Rangers beat the Anaheim Angels on Sept. 16 from the
Fort Worth suite in left field.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's such a neat lady,'' Rangers president Tom Schieffer
said. ``Every great ballpark has great characters who make great
fans, and Jerry and her husband Sidney are just enamored with
baseball. They like to follow these kids from \Rminor-league\S A
ball to the majors and she's a member of the Rangers Wives Club.
</P>
<P>
   ``She means a lot to us.''
</P>
<P>
   Now things are going so well, she and her husband are planning a
trip to the Arizona Fall League to check out the Rangers' top
prospects. That's important because her health kept them from
making more than two trips to watch the Triple-A Oklahoma RedHawks
play this season.
</P>
<P>
   That's normally how she spends her time when the Rangers are on
the road.
</P>
<P>
   The lady loves baseball, and if you ever sit near her at The
Ballpark, be careful what you say about her guys.
</P>
<P>
   ``I almost got in a fight one time,'' Grant said. ``Cecil
Fielder hit a ground ball that got under Mark McLemore's glove.
Some guy stood up and said, `If you can't do better than that, go
back to Japan.' I thought he was talking about Mac even though I
knew Mac never played in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   ``So I got up, turned around and yelled, `If you think you can
do better, get a uniform and get a glove.' Next time Fielder came
up, he said, `Fielder, go back to Japan.' Then I realized he was
talking about Fielder, but at first I thought he was talking about
Mac.''
</P>
<P>
   Warned Grant: ``Don't talk about my guys.''
</P>
<P>
   That probably includes all of the Rangers players, but be
forewarned, McLemore and Will Clark are her favorites.
</P>
<P>
   Message to Tom Hicks: ``They will sign Will. They will.''
</P>
<P>
   Message to Doug Melvin: ``I hate it when they trade anyone or
lose anyone or somebody retires. Like Mickey Tettleton, I bawled
when he retired. Or Dean Palmer, I met his folks in spring training
and got to know them. I was real upset and hurt when they traded
him,''
</P>
<P>
   Message to everybody holding playoff tickets. ``I'll be here
tomorrow. I'll be here next week. Absolutely. I wouldn't be that
worried. We can do it. Don't give me that `no we can't' stuff.
Nobody thought we could beat the Angels five straight but we did.
The Yankees aren't infallible.''
</P>
<P>
   She said that before last night's game.

<P>
   CAIRO, Egypt _ In a nation whose modern history has provided
little cause for celebration, there is always October.
</P>
<P>
   It was in October 1973 that the Egyptians and their fellow
Arabs, so roundly defeated in every previous war with Israel,
gained what they insist was a victory. And as the 25th anniversary
approaches, it is clearly a memory that Egypt does not want a new
generation to forget.
</P>
<P>
   A four-day ``silver jubilee'' that began Friday will feature a
military parade, the first in 17 years. On Oct. 6, the anniversary
of the day the war began, radio stations are to rebroadcast
Communique No. 1, announcing that Egyptian troops had stormed
across the Suez Canal.
</P>
<P>
   And to kick off the festivities, the government staged a mass
wedding of 250 couples Friday night in the shadow of the Great
Pyramids, and broadcast it on television, in the clear
determination that October might be remembered for years to come.
</P>
<P>
   The blend of war and romance has made for a passionate mix.
</P>

   ``I am very proud that the happiest day of my life, which is my
wedding, is the same day of the Israeli defeat, shame and
sadness,'' said Iglal Adley, a 22-year-old law school graduate who
was one of the brides taking part in the pageant.
</P>
<P>
   Less than a month ago Egypt allowed another anniversary to pass
without notice, choosing not to commemorate the date 20 years ago
when it agreed to the Camp David pact and became the first Arab
nation to make peace with Israel. The slight was noticed in Israel,
which has long bridled at the coldness of the peace. But in Egypt,
the Camp David accords still evoke mixed feelings at best, and with
little else in the recent past to cheer about, particularly on the
Arab-Israeli front, the government is trying to stir renewed pride
on what is being remembered as a ``war for peace.''
</P>
<P>
   ``History is the memory of the nation,'' the government
newspaper Al Akhbar wrote in an editorial the other day, ``and the
youth who did not live in the time of this great victory should
know how Egypt defeated a foe that claimed it was unbeatable.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the outcome was equivocal enough that Israel also calls
it a victory, after it rebounded from the initial Arab attack,
which came as Israel marked Yom Kippur. But no one disputes that
the war was a turning point in the Arab-Israeli conflict.
</P>
<P>
   After the humiliations of 1948, 1956 and 1967, Egypt and its
allies managed, for a short time, to regain the upper hand with a
sudden thrust across the Suez that military historians have
described as a masterpiece of planning and strategic surprise.
</P>
<P>
   In the first days of battle, Egypt on the south and Syria on the
north advanced into Sinai and the Golan Heights, the territory that
Israel had captured from them six years before. And while Israel
regained control of those territories by the time of cease-fire,
the war did prompt the first real consideration of the concept of
land for peace.
</P>
<P>
   It was not until after Camp David that Egypt officially regained
Sinai, but Egyptians have long been taught that it was what
happened in October 1973 that restored the country's ``glory and
self-confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   In Egypt's recent history, only the 1952 revolt that toppled the
monarchy and the 1956 nationalization of the Suez Canal are
remembered with nearly as much zeal.
</P>
<P>
   A satellite city outside Cairo and a bridge that spans the Nile
both bear the name 6 October, while in the capital itself, the
first three days of battle (but, conveniently, not the ones that
followed) are re-enacted in miniature at the October panorama.
</P>
<P>
   But some of the glow has faded with time. It was at a parade in
honor of the anniversary in 1981 that Islamic militants
assassinated President Anwar Sadat, and in the years since, Egypt's
main preoccupation has been with internal problems.
</P>
<P>
   And so officials planning the 25th-anniversary celebration said
they wanted to reach out to those too young to remember the war
itself.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the tradition of an annual parade, they seized on a
wedding at the Pyramids, designed to include in particular those
born in 1973 _ in order, as Hosni Ghazi, deputy director of the
Youth Authority put it, ``to remind the young generation of their
glorious past.''
</P>
<P>
   Dazzled by their free wedding dresses, flowers and the lavish
entertainment _ all laid on by the Youth Authority and business
sponsors _ many of the couples said that without this help that
might not otherwise have been able to marry.
</P>
<P>
   That has become a common woe in Egypt, where ordinary incomes
are often inadequate to meet the soaring costs of a suitable
apartment and a fitting celebration, and a typical engagement now
stretches on for bittersweet, frustrating years.
</P>
<P>
   In rural villages, mass weddings have long been embraced, and
the government has seemed to encourage the idea, even staging a
1992 wedding of 200 couples at Cairo Stadium, until Friday night
the largest that anyone could remember.
</P>
<P>
   But the fervor Friday night often seemed less personal than
political.
</P>
<P>
   Oula Mahmoud Sultan, 25, the bride who cut the cake, pronounced
herself proud to be having ``such a big wedding at a time when all
of Egypt is celebrating such a big victory.'' Because her father
was killed in the war, she and her new husband, Ahmed Abdel Mohsen,
28, were granted a one-month honeymoon in Germany, a particular
luxury, they said, because they still cannot afford an apartment of
their own.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not want Egypt to ever fight again,'' Ms. Sultan said
before the ceremony. ``But if it happens, I would be the first to
fight.''

   TV-EXECUTIVE-SMITH (Undated) _ Who is the most powerful
television executive in America? It may be David Smith, who runs
the country's biggest station group, Sinclair Broadcasting, a
collection of local channels _ 61, or 63, he is not sure _
variously affiliated with all six broadcast networks that he and
his brothers run from a disheveled office at their flagship

   MEDICARE-HMO (Undated) _ John Regan, a retired Bell Atlantic
employee, wanted to join a health maintenance organization near his
home in Centerville, Mass. on Cape Cod but the HMO said, no _ he
lived in the wrong zip code. ``The health care field today is a
very confusing one,'' Regan allows. For people in Medicare, that is
an understatement. Congress decided last year to make over the
government insurance plan for 38 million elderly and disabled
Americans. As part of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, private
insurance companies, hospitals and groups of doctors were invited
to offer an array of new types of taxpayer-financed health plans.
The new program, called Medicare Plus Choice, was supposed to start
taking shape this fall. But with only a tiny handful of exceptions,
no new Medicare options are being offered. In fact, existing
Medicare HMOs are actually backing out of more than 100 counties
around the country, forcing 165,000 older people to seek new
arrangements. By Milt Freudenheim. (Moved).

   BIZ-SENIORITY (Undated) _ Elton Pasea is a mutual fund
salesman's worst nightmare. Pasea, 76, a native of Trinidad, lives
quite nicely in Nederland, Texas, on $1,200 a month: $700 from
Social Security and $500 from a union pension. He has never owned
stocks, bonds or mutual funds. His life savings of $33,000 are
invested in certificates of deposit. He apparently has never
considered that, according to projections by mutual fund companies,
he should be eating cat food. He doesn't have a million-dollar nest
egg, and his income isn't at least 70 percent of his pre-retirement
figure. That's what the projections say he needs. The reality is
that the Elton Paseas of this world are living proof that many such
estimations of retirement needs are self-serving claptrap from an
industry that has a vested interest in convincing people to save as
much as possible _ in its mutual funds, of course. By Fred Brock.

<P>
   ABOUT-CARS-LEXUS-TOYOTA (Undated) _ Did conspicuous consumption
disappear with the 1980s? Not where large, expensive sport
utilities are concerned. Indeed, it seems, the bigger and more
expensive the luxury sport utility, the better it sells. Consider
the case of the Lexus LX 470 and its virtually identical cousin,
the Toyota Land Cruiser. Both full-sized sport utilities, priced
between $46,500 and $57,000, were redesigned and introduced in
April. Toyota had predicted the less expensive Land Cruiser would
outsell the LX 470. Instead, sales of the pricier LX 470 has
exceeded sales of the Land Cruiser in some months this year. By
Michelle Krebs. (Moved).

   Following are excerpts of a conversation between Linda Tripp and
Monica Lewinsky on Jan. 13, when Ms. Tripp wore a body wire so that
federal agents working for Kenneth Starr, the independent counsel,
could listen in. This conversation occurred after both had been
subpoenaed as witnesses in the Paula Jones sexual misconduct
lawsuit, and just a few days before Ms. Tripp lured Ms. Lewinsky to
a meeting where Starr's prosecutors tried to get her to cooperate
in an investigation into the president's conduct.
</P>
<P>
   MRS. TRIPP: So what's going on with the job?
</P>
<P>
   MS. LEWINSKY: (Sigh)
</P>
<P>
   MRS. TRIPP: I mean, do we have a job here?

uh _ uh _ she's not gonna give me cream. So _ _
</P>
<P>
   MRS. TRIPP: Maybe she'll get you cream.
</P>
<P>
   MS. LEWINSKY: I finally got in touch with the woman, you know?

   MS. LEWINSKY: Right.

<P>
   MRS. TRIPP: Yeah, of course.
</P>
<P>
   MS. LEWINSKY:
</P>
<P>
   So, finally _ _
</P>
<P>
   MRS. TRIPP: You mean, you haven't been in touch?
</P>
<P>
   MS. LEWINSKY: No.
</P>
<P>
   MRS. TRIPP: All this time.
</P>
<P>
   MS. LEWINSKY: No, It's _ It's sort of like, you know _ _
</P>
<P>
   MRS. TRIPP: So, when do you get your present?

   MS. LEWINSKY: I don't know. I don't know.

<P>
   MRS. TRIPP: Have you asked him when you're going to get your__
</P>
<P>
   MS. LEWINSKY: No. Because you know what? I _ can I tell you
something? You know what? My mom doesn't even hardly believe it. I
am so _ I am so like pulled. . . .
</P>
<P>
   MRS. TRIPP: I _ so what do you mean, your mom doesn't _ _
</P>
<P>
   MS. LEWINSKY: I'so _ (sigh). I'm sure I'll get over it. I don't
want to talk to him. I don't want him _ I don't want to look at
him. I can't look at him on TV, can't anything.
</P>
<P>
   MRS. TRIPP: You're kidding.
</P>
<P>
   MS. LEWINSKY: No, I just _ I think it's _ MRS. TRIPP: This is
actually very good news.
</P>
<P>
   MS. LEWINSKY: I _ it's just everything. And you know what? You
know, it sort of started to kind of _ kept coming back and I had
pushed it away. And just a lot of things when you _ (sigh). That
whole Eleanor Mondale thing, I _ (inaudible). You know, I started
to think about it, you know? . . .
</P>
<P>
   MRS. TRIPP: You mean because she was in there.
</P>
<P>
   MS. LEWINSKY: Not because she was in there. OK Not because she
was in there, because two months _ he hasn't even had contact with
me in two months, and I was going through all of this because of
him for two months. For two months.
</P>

`ABOUT SARAH': REACHING FOR TISSUES, BUT SMILING 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Production notes are at end of review. Time, channel are for
New York area. Check local listings.) 
(lb) 
 By ANITA GATES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``About Sarah'' has been described as a story about priorities:
A young woman has to decide whether to go to medical school or stay
home and care for her mentally retarded mother. But that decision
is almost beside the point. This CBS film, a satisfying,
beautifully acted tear-jerker, is just as much about family secrets
and whether anyone ever did anyone else a favor by ``protecting''
them.
</P>
<P>
   This story could have gone sentimental enough to make
``Imitation of Life'' look hip, but an outstanding cast saves it.
Mary Steenburgen affects a soft little-girl voice as the mother,
Sarah, and then grabs the character's pure world view so surely
that she's completely believable as a woman who sleeps with a
stuffed animal and can't memorize her telephone number.
</P>
<P>
   And there couldn't have been better casting than Kellie Martin
as Mary Beth, the daughter who inherits guardianship of Sarah just
as the acceptance letter from Cornell arrives in the mail. Ms.
Martin has been projecting wisdom beyond her years and a quiet
take-charge ability since she starred as a teen-ager whose
boyfriend had AIDS in ABC's ``Life Goes On.''
</P>
<P>
   Marion Ross is strong and endearing as Sarah's mother, whose
death precipitates the crisis. Diane Baker is the sophisticated
city aunt, Lila, who steps in to take charge. There's more in her
interest than meets the eye.
</P>
<P>
   Two male characters add needed complexity to the mix. Johnny
(Nick Searcy), a florist's delivery man, is drawn to Sarah and
begins visiting her, over Lila's objections. He listens to Sarah's
stories about her Irish ancestor and namesake (``She was brave, and
so am I'') and is responsible for one of the script's unexpected
twists.
</P>
<P>
   Mike (Chad Christ), Mary Beth's boyfriend, finally learns why
she never lets him drive her all the way home. When he does meet
her mother, he doesn't handle it well, at first.
</P>
<P>
   With a hard-to-believe courtroom conversion and a little too
much teary smiling and forgiveness, ``About Sarah'' won't win any
prizes for toughness.
</P>
<P>
   But there's intelligence at the heart of it and a gorgeous
score, with ``Titanic''-esque turn-of-the-century Irish echoes.

PADRES TO START BROWN WHILE ASTROS REST JOHNSON 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ Judging by their choice of starting pitchers for
Saturday night, San Diego Padres manager Bruce Bochy and Houston
Astros manager Larry Dierker have differing views on the strategic
importance of Game 3 of their National League division series,
which is tied at one game apiece.
</P>
<P>
   Bochy is playing to win this three-of-five-game series at home,
which is why he is running his Game 1 starter, Kevin Brown, back
out on three days' rest. Brown struck out a playoff-record 16
batters Tuesday in a 2-1 San Diego victory in Houston. Bochy's
reasoning is that if Brown can win the game, the Padres will have a
good shot at clinching the series Sunday and avoid returning to
Houston for a deciding Game 5.
</P>
<P>
   Dierker, on the other hand, is saving his ace, Randy Johnson,
until the Astros face elimination _ and hoping that Houston never
does in this series, so that a thoroughly rested Johnson could
start Game 1 of the National League Championship Series on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, who was barely outdueled by Brown on Tuesday, would
have pitched here on Saturday had Houston lost Game 2. But the
Astros overcame a game-tying, two-out, full-count home run by Jim
Leyritz in the top of the ninth to score the winning run in the
bottom of the inning. That is why Mike Hampton is starting for the
Astros on Saturday night. If Hampton and the Astros defeat Brown,
Jose Lima would start Sunday against a former New York Yankee,
Sterling Hitchcock.
</P>
<P>
   Each strategy has a certain logic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a good strategy for him,'' Dierker said of
Bochy's decision to go to Brown. ``If we're not pitching Randy,
they have a chance to take the upper hand. What he's trying to do
is avoid going back to Houston. And I don't blame him. But it
doesn't bother me, looking at it from the other angle.'' Meaning,
Dierker said, that if Houston loses Game 3, he would pitch Johnson
on his usual four days' rest in Game 4, ``with a chance to get back
home.''
</P>
<P>
   Bochy said, ``This comes down to a best-of-three series, so
we're going to go with our best on the first day.''
</P>

<P>
   San Diego manager Bruce Bochy said Wally Joyner would not be in
Saturday night's lineup. Instead, Jim Leyritz will start at first
for the Padres against the Houston left-hander Mike Hampton.

STRAWBERRYS DISPLAY RAW EMOTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (also see STRAWBERRY-SURGERY, by Dr. Lawrence K. Altman)  
 (bl)  
 By JACK CURRY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Darryl Strawberry was resting Friday
afternoon when the telephone rang in his home in Fort Lee, N.J.
Charisse, his wife, would not disturb him. They were preparing for
the emotional journey to Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center in
Manhattan, where Strawberry will undergo surgery for colon cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's tired,'' she said. ``We're going to walk out the door
soon. Our faith has gotten us through a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Then she laughed, a nervous laugh from a nervous wife. Her
famous husband, one of the most popular and affable players on the
New York Yankees, is undergoing surgery Saturday to remove a
malignant tumor.
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry communicated to his teammates with an uplifting video
message that they viewed before batting practice. Every Yankee had
Strawberry's No. 39 on the back of his cap. But when the game ended
and Strawberry was alone, all that was left was tension.
</P>
<P>
   ``I probably will be very emotional going in tonight, laying in
the hospital,'' Strawberry said in a interview broadcast Friday
evening on ESPN. ``This is my biggest challenge that I have to
face. Right now, I'm probably not thinking about it because so many
things are happening so fast. But I know there's going to come a
point where I'm going to start thinking and I'm going to start
asking God: `What's going on? Where am I?' I'm not going to ask Him
why. But I know I'm going to have a lot of thoughts going through
me.''
</P>
<P>
   The Strawberrys sat on a couch during the television interview,
looking as composed as a couple could look after having cancer
thrust into their lives. The 36-year-old Strawberry has endured
marital problems, substance abuse and tax woes in his 15-year
career, but he pledged strength.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know everything is going to be OK,'' he said firmly. ``I
have a really strong feeling inside that is just another hill to
have to climb.''
</P>
<P>
   That is the same type of resolve Strawberry showed during the
45-second message that the Yankees viewed about two hours before
the first pitch. The team huddled around a big-screen television in
the clubhouse and listened to Strawberry say that he loved them and
that he was looking forward to the surgery. While pointing his
finger at the camera and smiling, Strawberry finished by saying:
``Go get 'em tonight, guys. Get 'em.''
</P>
<P>
   Joe Torre, who included Strawberry's name in the roster for
Friday night's lineup card, said, ``When he said that, everyone
broke up laughing.''
</P>
<P>
   After Strawberry made the Yankees chuckle, they sauntered into
the dugout like a long-forgotten band from the 1980s: Men Without
Hats. None of the Yankees wore caps during the pre-game workouts
because a tailor was embroidering 39s.
</P>
<P>
   Mostly, Strawberry disguised his emotions on television. But
there were a few moments when Strawberry wiped at tears, like when
his wife talked about the phone call she had received from an
unnamed friend.
</P>
<P>
   ``She said: `Don't let him get down. God has chosen him to reach
other people for this because of who he is,''' Charisse Strawberry
recalled.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, Strawberry stared up and said he did not know why
God had chosen him to be stricken with colon cancer. But he quickly
added that he was thankful to be alive and to be able to talk
candidly about overcoming adversity.
</P>
<P>
   Even though doctors have told Strawberry he should recover fully
and return to play next season, he said he would be content with
his career if he never swung a bat again.

REDMOND RUNS FOR THE FUN OF IT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STEVE IRVINE  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Trophies have never been important to J.R. Redmond.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started playing football at the age of 8 and it's always
been for pure fun,'' said Redmond. ``It was never for a big trophy
to put on my table at the end of the year.''
</P>
<P>
   The Arizona State junior _ who faces the Trojans today _ plays
college football, which offers up one of the more prestigious
awards in sports: the Heisman Trophy. Redmond knows that being in
the running for the trophy means a free trip to New York City and
the opportunity to strike the pose.
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not the trophy matters to Redmond, the versatile
player is on the relatively short Heisman candidate list. Could he
find a spot on his table for this award?
</P>
<P>
   ``Means nothing to me,'' Redmond insists. ``I never really think
about it until somebody brings it up. I went to a party (recently)
and all this one kid wanted to talk about was the Heisman. He kept
following me around talking about the Heisman. I had to make
something up to tell him.''
</P>
<P>
   When Redmond, a 1995 Carson High graduate, showed up at Arizona
State he carried a load of talent and plenty of versatility. But he
didn't bring with him a preferred position.
</P>
<P>
   The sturdy 6-foot, 215-pounder, who was clocked at 4.41 in the
40-yard dash, was a tailback with the hands to play receiver. He
played both positions in high school while piling up 2,469 yards,
23 touchdowns and a 1993 City 4-A championship.
</P>
<P>
   On defense, he was a safety with the coverage skills of a
cornerback. And he could break a game open at any time on a kickoff
or punt return.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can put J.R. out there anywhere,'' Arizona State receiver
Lenzie Jackson said. ``You put him at running back, cornerback,
safety or receiver, he's going to go out there and make plays.''
</P>
<P>
   Arizona State coach Bruce Snyder remembers the moment Redmond
became a tailback. It was about the time Redmond first touched the
football in Tempe.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can tell a runner pretty fast and it was after one run I
said, `He is going to stay there for a while,''' Snyder said.
``There was some staff-room bartering and negotiating going on
about where he should be. I said we were going to look at him at
tailback and it never changed from there.''
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, with 2,431 all-purpose yards, 12 touchdowns and
only one start on his collegiate resume, Redmond found himself
answering questions about the Heisman and the Jan. 4
national-championship Fiesta Bowl game.
</P>
<P>
   As it turns out, there are better teams than the Sun Devils.
Arizona State opened the season with a heartbreaking 42-38 loss to
visiting Washington and followed with an uninspired 26-6 setback at
Brigham Young University. Suddenly the lofty dreams had turned into
an 0-2 nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been a bit of a struggle,'' Snyder said. ``After the
BYU loss, which I hope is the low point for the season, we decided
as a staff to go back as if were training camp, rebuild the team
and get them focused in on every game we were to play.''
</P>
<P>
   Redmond, who had been sensational against Washington (254
all-purpose yards) and had been shut down against BYU (62 yards
all-purpose yards), accepted the new approach, as did his
teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're living week-by-week for the games and day-by-day at
practice,'' said Redmond, whose only defensive duty thus far has
been two snaps against BYU.
</P>
<P>
   The past two weeks haven't been perfect, but they have been more
pleasant. The Sun Devils beat North Texas 34-15 and knocked off
Oregon State 24-3. Redmond had 201 yards on 19 carries against
North Texas and played through the pain of an injured toe to gain
168 all-purpose yards in the victory over the Beavers.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not a better (offensive) player in the conference than
J.R. Redmond,'' USC coach Paul Hackett said.
</P>
<P>
   Redmond, who appears headed to the NFL when he chooses,
considered attending USC or UCLA. But he said the Bruins dropped
out of the running after he didn't obtain a qualifying score on the
SAT and USC stopped pursuing him after Redmond broke his clavicle
as a senior at Carson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Arizona State is the only school which stuck with me,'' said
Redmond, who spent a semester at Long Beach City College before
reaching a qualifying score on the SAT.
</P>
<P>
   He'll have plenty of supporters today. Redmond had to beg,
borrow and purchase tickets for more than 30 friends and family
members so they can see him fulfill a lifetime dream of playing in
the Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was a kid, I would daydream about playing for the
Raiders in the Coliseum,'' said Redmond, who regularly has about 15
family members travel to Tempe for Sun Devils home games.

WEIGHING IN WITH 16 BOXES OF EVIDENCE

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The materials released Friday by the House
Judiciary Committee come from the boxes of evidence that Kenneth
Starr sent to Congress four weeks ago to support the case for
impeaching President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 9, two vans drove up to the Capitol to deliver two
duplicate 18-box sets of evidence collected by Starr, the
Whitewater independent counsel. Two days later, before any
lawmakers had seen the evidence, the House voted to release the
material to the public by Sept. 28, and made available the first of
the 18 boxes, summarizing possible ``grounds for impeachment'':
perjury, obstruction of justice, witness tampering and abuse of
authority.
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 21, the committee released a second box of evidence,
including videotapes of Clinton's testimony before a federal grand
jury. On the same day, Congress issued the transcripts of grand
jury testimony by Monica Lewinsky, the former White House intern
with whom Clinton had an affair.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the committee released the remaining 16 boxes of the
evidence, including testimony by Secret Service agents, friends of
Ms. Lewinsky, friends of Clinton and White House officials.
</P>
<P>
   The new materials also include transcripts of telephone
conversations between Ms. Lewinsky and her former friend Linda
Tripp. The transcripts, like some of the other documents released
Friday, had been heavily edited by the committee to protect
personal privacy or national security, to eliminate explicit
``sexual descriptions'' and to delete certain ``expletives.''
</P>
<P>
   Many would-be readers found it difficult to use the documents in
the form disseminated on Friday. The Government Printing Office
issued the evidence in a three-volume set, but some volumes were
missing from some sets. Much of the grand jury testimony was
printed in type so tiny that it was difficult to read. The
transcripts were ``condensed'' so that four to six pages of
transcript would fit on one page of the book made available to the
public.

<P>
   &UR; SATURDAY'S KEY GAMES &LR;
</P>
<P>
   No. 25 Penn State 3-0
</P>
<P>
   No. 1 at Ohio State 3-0
</P>
<P>
   This Big Ten opener could decide the conference champion. Penn
State's good defense faces an offense that gained 531 yards last
Saturday against Missouri. As Coach Joe Paterno of Penn State said,
``We're playing one of the best football teams I've seen in 50
years, simple as that.''
</P>
<P>
   No. 18 Georgia 3-0
</P>
<P>
   No. 7 at Louisiana State 3-0
</P>
<P>
   Georgia has the tightest scoring defense in Division I-A,
allowing only 15 points in three games. Louisiana State is an
offensive powerhouse, as witness last week's rout of Idaho with 533
yards in total offense in less than 23 1/2 minutes of possession.
</P>
<P>
   No. 3 Tennessee 3-0
</P>
<P>
   No. 17 Auburn 1-2
</P>
<P>
   After Tennessee beat Houston last week with 589 yards in total
offense, Coach Kim Helton of Houston said, ``They're a lot tougher
than UCLA.'' Auburn, beaten by Louisiana State and Virginia, both
highly ranked, is the best losing team in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   No. 2 Nebraska 4-0
</P>
<P>
   No. 16 vs Oklahoma State 2-1
</P>
<P>
   at Kansas City, Mo.
</P>
<P>
   Both can move the ball, but Nebraska's running game (334 yards
against Washington last week) could make this a runaway.
</P>
<P>
   EAST
</P>
<P>
   No. 4 West Virginia (2-1) at Navy (1-2)
</P>
<P>
   West Virginia should cruise against Navy's shaky defense.
</P>
<P>
   Miami (2-1) at Rutgers (2-2)
</P>
<P>
   Rutgers, after upsetting Army, seems headed for another losing
streak.
</P>
<P>
   SOUTH
</P>
<P>
   No. 14 Florida (3-1) at Alabama (2-1)
</P>
<P>
   Florida, with rotating quarterbacks, rolled up 582 yards last
week in beating Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
   Army (1-2) at East Carolina (2-1)
</P>
<P>
   Army struggles even when it rolls up yards on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   MIDWEST
</P>
<P>
   Texas A&AMP;M (3-1) at Kansas (2-2)
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback Randy McCown takes over Texas A&AMP;M's anemic offense.
</P>
<P>
   Michigan (2-2) at Iowa (2-2)
</P>
<P>
   Michigan can get to 6-2 before facing Penn State, Wisconsin and
Ohio State.
</P>
<P>
   Stanford (1-3) at Notre Dame (2-1)
</P>
<P>
   Coach Bob Davie of Notre Dame said, ``Right now, we're not a
good team. We are plodding along.''
</P>
<P>
   SOUTHWEST
</P>
<P>
   No. 19 Kentucky (3-1) vs. No. 23 Arkansas (3-0)
</P>
<P>
   Kentucky, first in the nation in total offense (541.5 yards a
game) and first in passing (435.8), will need it all.
</P>
<P>
   No. 11 Colorado (4-0) at Oklahoma (2-1)
</P>
<P>
   A good test for Colorado, which got a scare from Baylor.
</P>
<P>
   Vanderbilt (0-3) at No. 13 Texas Christian (2-1)
</P>
<P>
   Vanderbilt, outscored by 104-13, must still face Georgia,
Florida, Kentucky and Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   FAR WEST
</P>
<P>
   No. 24 Arizona (4-0) at No. 20 Washington (2-1)
</P>
<P>
   Washington is better than it showed in a 55-7 beating from
Nebraska, but its offense has been dormant.
</P>
<P>
   Washington State (3-1) at No. 21 UCLA (2-0)
</P>
<P>
   Washington State's defense is good. UCLA's offense is better.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona State (2-2) at Southern California (3-1)
</P>
<P>
   Southern California has a good defense, but an insecure passing
game.
</P>
<P>
   MISMATCHES
</P>
<P>
   No. 6 Florida State (3-1) at Maryland (2-2)
</P>
<P>
   Florida State held Southern California to three pass
completions.
</P>
<P>
   San Jose State (2-2) at No. 10 Virginia (4-0)
</P>
<P>
   Virginia's defense collected eight turnovers against Duke.

ELAINE BENSON, 74, WRITER AND GALLERY OWNER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Pa.)   (bl)  
 By ROBERTA SMITH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Elaine Benson, whose gallery in Bridgehampton, N.Y., was a
fixture on the East End summer art scene for more than three
decades, died Sept. 28 at her home in Bridgehampton.
</P>
<P>
   She was 74 and died of non-Hodgkins lymphoma, her family said.
</P>
<P>
   Elaine Klebanoff was born in Philadelphia in 1924. She earned a
bachelor's degree in political science from the University of
Pennsylvania and in 1942 married Warren Goff, a law student who
became a lighting consultant.
</P>
<P>
   She worked as a reporter for The Philadelphia Inquirer and as
public relations director of the Philadelphia Museum College of
Art, now called the Philadelphia College of Art. There she met her
second husband, Emmanuel Benson, an art historian and educator.
They married in 1963 and in 1965 moved to Bridgehampton where they
opened an art gallery in their home, a Victorian gingerbread on
Route 27.
</P>
<P>
   The gallery, which ultimately expanded to include seven
interconnected barns and outbuildings on the property, was open
from May through September. For many on the East End, its annual
opening in early May represented the beginning of the summer
season.
</P>
<P>
   Exhibitions focused on the work of artists living full or part
time in the East End, a fairly impressive pool of candidates by any
standard. Among those who had solo shows at the gallery were Lee
Krasner, Jimmy Ernst, Sid Solomon, Larry Rivers, Bob Dash, Alfonso
Ossorio, James Brooks, Polly Kraft and Bill King.
</P>
<P>
   But in many ways the sprawling group show that juxtaposed the
work of artists young and old, famous and not, was more
representative of the gallery's character. A world traveler, Mrs.
Benson also had shows of wall-hangings from Pakistan, pre-Columbian
sculpture, African sculptures, Jain manuscripts and Indian thankas.
</P>
<P>
   To support the gallery, Mrs. Benson worked as director of
community relations at Southampton Hospital for 25 years. She
contributed articles to Craft Horizon and other publications and
beginning in 1966 wrote a weekly column for Dan's Papers, never
missing a week even when she was out of town.
</P>
<P>
   Her last column, which discussed her illness, was printed
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   In her spare time, she raised funds for several East End causes
and institutions, from the Animal Rescue Fund to the John Steinbeck
Writers' Room at the Southampton campus of Long Island University.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Benson died in 1971, and in 1974 Mrs. Benson married Joseph
Kaufman, a historian and bibliographer who died in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   She is survived by her brother, Steven Klebanoff of Rye, N.Y.;
two sons, William Goff of Kent, Conn. and Neal Goff of Manhattan;
two daughters, Ginny Goff Green of Loveladies, N.J., and Kimberly
Goff of Bridgehampton; a brother, Steven Klebanoff of Rye, and
three grandchildren.

   In 1991, Meriwether, then a top executive and a star bond trader
at Salomon Brothers, was ousted after a subordinate sought to
corner the market on sales of U.S. government bonds. Three years
later, he raised $1.5 billion from Wall Street colleagues and
founded Long-Term Capital, which became one of the world's most
aggressive and profitable hedge funds.
</P>
<P>
   The near-collapse of Long-Term Capital last month nearly wiped
out the stakes of Meriwether, his 16 partners and outside
investors, and made him synonymous with speculative excess. ``His
obituary has already been written,'' a long-time friend said. ``The
man who nearly broke the world.''
</P>
<P>
   But such judgments may be premature, others say. The consortium
of 14 financial firms that pumped $3.6 billion into Long-Term
Capital, rescuing it from certain bankruptcy, agreed to keep
Meriwether, his partners and his management team intact as a
condition of the deal. He and his partners still control 3.3
percent of the equity in the fund.
</P>
<P>
   And Wall Street executives involved in the bailout say that
Meriwether and his 180-member team will be paid 1 percent of assets
as a management fee and a 12.5 percent share of annual profits over
a hurdle level.
</P>
<P>
   If the banks and brokerage houses that rescued Long-Term Capital
are right, and its bets on world bond and equity markets eventually
pay off, Meriwether and company can quickly pocket tens of millions
of dollars under that incentive plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course people are angry at him; they blame him for this,''
said a brokerage firm executive involved in the bailout. ``But as
far as I know, no one suggested that he should go _ that you should
break up the partnership. Put it this way: If he does well, we all
do well.''
</P>
<P>
   The potential for Meriwether to make a comeback has already
begun to raise questions among critics of the Long-Term Capital
bailout, which was brokered by the Federal Reserve Bank of New
York. Some critics have questioned whether the effort to save the
fund was necessary, and whether it might send the wrong message to
other big speculative funds.
</P>
<P>
   At congressional hearings to discuss the Long-Term Capital
rescue Thursday, there were also questions raised as to why the
deal backed by the Federal Reserve was more favorable to Meriwether
than an alternative proposal put forward by private investors,
including Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   ``Perhaps the only smart deal of the month that Long-Term
Capital did was they played the Fed off against another party,''
said Rep. Jim Leach, R-Iowa, who is chairman of the House Banking
Committee, referring to Meriwether's rejection of the Goldman deal
and his acceptance of the terms offered by the bank consortium.
</P>
<P>
   Long-Term Capital is not certain to return to profitability, of
course. The continued sharp rise of the U.S. government bond market
is unfavorable to Long-Term Capital's positions, traders say, and
may be causing deeper losses for the fund now. There is no prospect
of returning to profits until the worldwide investor flight to
quality eases, relieving the stress on riskier securities that
Long-Term Capital owns.
</P>
<P>
   The Wall Street firms that now control the hedge fund have
installed six derivatives, bond and risk management experts at
Long-Term Capital responsible for looking over Meriwether's
shoulder each day _ and making the ultimate calls of key investment
and management decisions. The firms could also decide to liquidate
Long-Term Capital positions and essentially dismantle the fund,
leaving Meriwether and his colleagues with little.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, people who work for Long-Term Capital say that 3 or 4
of the 16 partners borrowed heavily from banks to finance their
equity stakes in the fund, and now face the prospect of personal
bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there are signs that the worst is over for Long-Term
Capital's principals. The fund's new investors have de-emphasized
their early goal of an ``orderly liquidation'' of Long-Term
Capital's positions. Most now talk of a three-year time frame for
managing the fund. Many bank executives familiar with Long-Term's
gambles also see them as fundamentally sound, if highly
overleveraged, and talk about making big profits when markets come
back.
</P>
<P>
   Most important, a consensus has emerged among the consortium
members that Meriwether should stay. For one, he is the person most
familiar with Long-Term Capital's complex derivatives positions.
And in his absence, the 14 consortium members, already prone to
disputes, might find it difficult to agree on a successor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be foolish for us to get rid of him and then try to
agree on someone else,'' said the Wall Street executive involved in
the bailout. ``Our best bet was to give him the incentives to do
well.''
</P>
<P>
   Long-Term Capital partners who face possible bankruptcy might
also get some relief. There are now attempts to negotiate
agreements with their creditors, which include Bear, Stearns and
Credit Lyonnais, that would prevent them from having to file for
personal bankruptcy. One alternative explored in recent days would
give creditors a claim on the future earnings of these hard-pressed
managing partners.
</P>
<P>
   Some people associated with the fund have also speculated that
some of the managing partners who are in better financial
circumstances may help others who now face bankruptcy as a way of
maintaining the Long-Term Capital team.

   As they go to class, America's schoolchildren are getting lots
of As _ as in advertisements. That's the conclusion of a study by
the University of Wisconsin at Milwaukee. After measuring the
frequency of references in many publications to business activities
in schools, it estimated that commercial messages delivered in
school settings had increased 154 percent from 1990 to 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The study found that corporate sponsorship of school activities
was the most common link, citing the Georgia high school where a
``Coke in Education Day'' was interrupted by a student who wore a
Pepsi shirt to a photo session at which students were forming the
word ``Coke.''
</P>
<P>
   The fastest-growing area in which schools and businesses overlap
is exclusive agreements, the study found. Many schools receive
signing bonuses and royalties from sales of shoes, soft drinks and
the like on their property, but they must agree not to have
competing products in their schools.

<P>
   Don't sweat the small stuff. Sure, but what about the big stuff?
If you lost your job, would you have enough savings to live on for
six months? Or say you had a medical emergency or your car had a
major breakdown? Do you have enough money to handle the expense
without borrowing?
</P>
<P>
   In a recent survey, the Education Foundation of the American
Bankers Association found that 57 percent of 892 adults polled were
uncertain that they could live without their incomes for six months
or were sure they could not. And 59 percent said the same about
paying for a major expense.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are feeling pretty good over all,'' said Keith J.
Leggett, a senior economist for the association, ``but there is
this undercurrent of unease out there.'' &QL;

</P>
<P>
   As a marketing ploy, it seems a bit cold at first, but
straightforward. Pay $7,500 for one shot at in vitro fertilization,
regardless of the outcome. Or try the money-back guarantee: Pay
$15,000 up front for up to three attempts, and if none are
successful, the full amount is refunded.
</P>
<P>
   A recent study by David Schmittlein, a professor at the Wharton
School of the University of Pennsylvania, and Donald Morrison, a
professor at the University of California at Los Angeles, found
that couples were usually better off choosing the money-back
guarantee. This is because the average success rate for each
attempt is only 20 percent, Schmittlein said.
</P>
<P>
   One quirk: If three tries fail, clinics often encourage couples
to use the $15,000 refund to try again. ``It becomes like going to
the casino and experiencing the `house money effect,' '' he said.
With money in their hands, he said, couples will think, ``Why
not?''

KENNELLY'S STAR-CROSSED CAMPAIGN SPURS SEARCH FOR REASONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MIKE ALLEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. _ For Barbara Kennelly, the Democratic
congresswoman trying to unseat Gov. John Rowland, the indignities
are becoming an almost everyday event.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, she held a noon rally in Hartford, her
hometown, and the audience consisted mostly of bored-looking
construction workers shepherded by union leaders from a nearby
site. Last week, she spoke to a group of 200 business people in
Danbury, and the audience had no questions. In the last week, two
of the groups that most dependably endorse Democrats, the
Connecticut Education Association and the Connecticut National
Abortion Rights Action League, decided not to make a choice in the
race.
</P>
<P>
   And Thursday, a new poll by Quinnipiac College showed her 44
percentage points behind the incumbent among likely voters.
</P>
<P>
   Things are so bad, in fact, that in Mrs. Kennelly's home
district, the poll showed the governor leading by 27 points. And
now, Mrs. Kennelly, the stately scion of a political family that
ruled the state for decades, faces the very real possibility that
her 23-year political career will end in a comedy of errors.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is beyond a landslide _ we're looking at blowout
proportions,'' said Douglas J. Schwartz, the poll's director.
``Every issue and every group is moving Rowland's way. It's a wind
that's catching everything and blowing it in his direction.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Kennelly, who gave up her House seat to run for governor,
professes to be mystified about the devastating trajectory of a
campaign that once looked so promising. Perhaps, because her name
recognition helped her in early polls, the campaign looked more
promising than it ever was. But certainly no one anticipated she
would be in this kind of trouble. Why not? To many experts, one
answer may lie in her political upbringing.
</P>
<P>
   Political operatives in the state say the campaign of Mrs.
Kennelly, 62, reflects that of an old-style politician who has
never embraced the tools and demands of a modern campaign. In fact,
they suggest, her approach to politics seems to reflect more the
attitudes of her father, John Bailey, a longtime state Democratic
chairman, who spent party conventions in the green room behind the
stage, where politicians would go to pay court. In addition, they
say, she has not had tough re-election races during her 16 years in
the House of Representatives, and she has thrived in the
deal-cutting culture of the Ways and Means Committee.
</P>
<P>
   These days, the tool kit of the successful challenger's campaign
includes a simple message repeated endlessly, an elbows-out style,
an agility with sound bites, a ferocious pace and a faith in the
potentially decisive impact of television advertising.
</P>
<P>
   By nature or necessity, Mrs. Kennelly appears to have gone forth
with a shortage or lack of each.
</P>
<P>
   ``She doesn't know how to excite this generation,'' said Peter
Breit, professor emeritus of government at the University of
Hartford. ``She's very much her father's daughter, but Connecticut
is no longer her father's state. People today see that era as arid
and nonresponsive.''
</P>
<P>
   But the biggest problem with her campaign may be her opponent.
Rowland has remained popular and well financed in a year when
incumbents everywhere are enjoying high approval ratings, largely
because of the strong economy. Take that environment, stir in a
lackluster campaign, and the consensus of a wide range of Democrats
and Republicans in the state boils down to: There was little she
could do, and she did not do it.
</P>
<P>
   Signs of trouble were evident from the beginning. Mrs. Kennelly
had been reluctant to enter the race, but Democratic leaders seized
on a poll _ conducted by the University of Connecticut in June 1997
_ that showed her four points ahead of Rowland, and they talked her
into running. She warmed slowly to the race and did not immediately
poke at what Democratic leaders considered Rowland's
vulnerabilities, which included his record on education and the
environment. He used last winter's session of the Legislature to
record achievements in both areas, and she was left to accuse him
of stealing her issues.

 HARTFORD, Conn.: her issues.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   An early brochure for Mrs. Kennelly featured an array of
snapshots of her with prominent politicians _ including the late
House Speaker Tip O'Neill _ an indication that she might be trying
to rely too much on reputation rather than ideas for the future.
Republicans called the flier ``The Dead Democrats.''
</P>
<P>
   A series of four debates that begins Monday gives Mrs. Kennelly
one more chance to make a case against Rowland. She has seemed to
take little advantage of recent joint appearances with Rowland,
however, declining to criticize him directly. Further, her pitch
does not always come across as well honed. Speaking to the business
audience last week, for example, Mrs. Kennelly said she planned to
enforce environmental laws more rigorously, but did not mention her
tax-cut plan.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Kennelly clearly does not relish the give-and-take of the
campaign trail. Most politicians are reluctant to leave the eye of
a television camera. But with reporters surrounding her after her
Danbury appearance, she saw the governor arrive and urged reporters
to go talk to him. Served a fat pitch by a reporter looking for a
quote about her new hope on the day she began her television
advertising, she replied: ``Fine. I feel just fine. How do YOU
feel?''
</P>
<P>
   William McEachern, a political economist at the University of
Connecticut, said: ``She just wasn't ready for prime time, the
rough-and-tumble of a statewide race. She's better speaking from
the well of the House than on the street, and she was trying to run
in good times with no memorable issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Republicans are agog at the decisiveness of her collapse.
``She has gone from coronation to catastrophe in just a year,''
said Kevin F. Rennie, a Hartford lawyer and a former state senator.
</P>
<P>
   In the Quinnipiac poll released Thursday, 61 percent of the
registered voters who were surveyed said they were for Rowland, 28
percent were for Mrs. Kennelly, and 8 percent were undecided.
Quinnipiac polled 1,070 registered voters between Sept. 23 and 28.
The margin of error was plus or minus 3 percentage points. Among
the respondents considered by the pollster to be the most likely to
vote, the gap was even wider, 69 percent to 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
   A comparison with Quinnipiac's previous Connecticut poll, taken
in June, showed that the more Mrs. Kennelly campaigned, the lower
her numbers fell. ``As the campaign has worn on, she has gone from
an overall positive evaluation to a mixed one,'' Schwartz, the
poll's director, said. When she finally began her television
advertising last week _ after a long delay because of a money
shortage _ the poll numbers stayed static. Mrs. Kennelly had hoped
to impress voters with her concern about education and health care,
but those who were polled said Rowland would do a better job in
both areas.
</P>
<P>
   After the poll results were released Thursday, Rowland had to
struggle to keep a straight face as he talked with reporters
outside his office. He said he respected Mrs. Kennelly's ``long and
distinguished career,'' and warned against complacency among
Republican voters, even though he said he was doing ``fairly
well.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Kennelly's campaign said the poll numbers do not
necessarily mean that her brand of politics is outmoded. ``Barbara
Kennelly is not about theater,'' said her spokesman, Kevin Lembo.
``Barbara Kennelly is about substance.''
</P>
<P>
   Eating lunch between campaign stops several weeks ago, Mrs.
Kennelly was recounting her glory days as a Hartford city
councilwoman. Remembering the crush of media attention that
followed her every pronouncement about her investigation into a
roof collapse, Mrs. Kennelly triumphantly turned to an aide and
said, ``THAT was when I was a good speaker.''

   AUSTIN, Texas _ Bill Clinton seems to have generated the most
petitions, calling for him to be impeached, to resign, to be left
alone. Thirteen people have signed one demanding a ban on tigers
and other exotic cats as pets. Eight favor the establishment of
areas in national parks for nudists. But a petition demanding
statehood for New York City attracted not a single signatory, not
one, not even Donald Trump.
</P>
<P>
   In that dark epoch between the discovery of fire and the
discovery of the World Wide Web, the Bolsheviks had to storm the
Winter Palace to get their point across.
</P>
<P>
   Now it can all be done with the gentle click of a mouse button.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got the idea when I was sitting at home in Austin watching a
city council debate on cable television,'' Alex Sheshunoff, 24,
said. ``The issue they were discussing was very important, but the
debate was really boring, enough to induce narcolepsy. I started
wondering: How can you get citizens involved in the democratic
process when they don't have time to spend three hours at a city
council meeting waiting to make a three-minute statement?''
</P>
<P>
   His answer: E-The People, which describes itself as ``America's
Interactive Town Hall'' and resides in cyberspace at
www.e-thepeople.com.
</P>
<P>
   Those who find their way to the Web site, either directly or
through one of the newspapers or nonprofit agencies that are
Sheshunoff's partners, are given the chance to sign a petition
already posted on the site, create a new petition or write a letter
to government officials about whatever is stuck in their craw.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been a lot of people talking recently about the
intersection of democracy and the Internet,'' Sheshunoff said,
``but not a lot of people sitting down and writing the code. That's
where we come in.''
</P>
<P>
   E-The People has been open since August but is still trying to
``stomp out the last of the bugs,'' Sheshunoff said, and should be
fully operational in a month or so.
</P>
<P>
   The Web site, which also bills itself as ``an Alex Sheshunoff
Initiative,'' is designed to connect citizens with their government
officials, local or national, and to turn a profit for Sheshunoff
and his investors.
</P>
<P>
   For example, a Houston resident interested in protesting about
the environment is led through a process of identifying whom he
should contact (a click calls up a list that includes the governor,
lieutenant governor, city council representative, 26 state
representatives, eight state senators and 20 agency officials with
specific responsibility for the environment).
</P>
<P>
   Then the resident can compose a message that is automatically
sent as e-mail to whichever officials are selected, or as a fax, if
the recipient has no e-mail address. It is all free for the
petitioners and letter writers. Advertisers and media partners pay
the freight.
</P>
<P>
   Messages can also be sent to the White House or to Congress,
Sheshunoff said, but the central intent is to address local issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president already received a half-million e-mails a month,
but for a city council member to receive 10 letters on a single
subject can have a real impact,'' he said. ``This is really about
local people solving local problems.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The letters are treated as private mail, Sheshunoff said. E-The
People takes no note of their content and promises it will sell
none of the demographic data that might be collected in the
process.
</P>
<P>
   Sheshunoff's initiative operates from an office on the 19th
floor of a tower in downtown Austin, part of a suite of offices
that are home to Alex Sheshunoff Management Services, the company
run by his father, a well-known banking consultant.
</P>
<P>
   The younger Sheshunoff prowled his small room recently, a thatch
of sandy hair brushing his forehead, occasionally grabbing for a
purring cellular telephone while a team of young programmers
hunched over keyboards frantically tapping in data. An American
flag dominated one wall while a map of the United States filled
another, showing the route of an 80-city transcontinental bus tour
that Sheshunoff has been running to spread the word.
</P>
<P>
   The bus, decorated to resemble a mailbox, left Austin on Aug. 1
and has made its way across the Southwest, up the Pacific Coast and
across the prairies into the Midwest, New England and New York. It
is heading south on its return to Texas.
</P>
<P>
   So far, 45 newspapers have agreed to go into partnership with
E-The People, meaning they will feature a link to the site on their
own Web pages and share with E-The People any advertising revenues
generated by surfers traversing that link. Among those signed up
are The San Antonio Express-News, The Oregonian in Portland and The
Daily News in New York. Sheshunoff is hoping for 100 media
partners.
</P>
<P>
   Sheshunoff once considered a career in network television. While
a student at Yale, he did some work for ABC News, as a production
assistant and then reading his own short, personal essays in the
wee hours. Then he read somewhere that the audience for network
television news had dropped 30 percent since 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Sheshunoff said he spent his senior year ``thinking about where
news was going.'' This led him, as it has hundreds of others in his
generation, to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   His first effort was an online magazine developed as a way of
allowing readers to pinpoint the restaurants and other venues
nearest their homes. ``We sold some of that underlying technology
to newspapers and others, for their Web pages,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A similar process is used in E-The People, he said, but it is
more sophisticated.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not as easy as it sounds,'' he said, ``to take somebody's
address and tell them who their elected officials are.''

RAMIREZ POWERS INDIANS INTO LEAD 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By CHRIS BROUSSARD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The Cleveland Indians' general manager, John Hart, and
manager, Mike Hargrove, had been stern about the subject. Their
players had been silly about it, kidding their teammate Manny
Ramirez, the club's young power hitter, about going into his home
run jog on balls that stayed in the park.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the approach, Ramirez got the message: no more posing
and sauntering up the first-base line while watching one of his
well-hit balls make its way toward the outfield bleachers.
</P>
<P>
   His lesson learned, Ramirez sprinted toward first every time he
made contact with a pitch Friday in Game 3 of the American League
division series against the Boston Red Sox _ even though he didn't
have to.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians' right fielder knocked two balls out of Fenway Park,
the second of which turned out to be the game winner, leading
Cleveland to a 4-3 victory and a 2-1 edge in this
three-of-five-games series that continues here with Game 4
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just trying to run hard,'' Ramirez said when he was
asked about his new base-running tactics. ``They bring a lot of
young guys up from Triple-A, and some of them look up to me. If
they see me jogging, they may want to do that too.''
</P>
<P>
   That revelation did not apparently hit Ramirez until Thursday,
because in Games 1 and 2 this week, he trotted and watched long
base hits that appeared to be heading out of Jacobs Field.
</P>
<P>
   But Friday's solo shots off Bret Saberhagen and Dennis Eckersley
left no doubt about their destination. In the seventh inning,
Ramirez tagged a Saberhagen fastball an estimated 388 feet over
Fenway's Green Monster, and in the ninth, off Eckersley, he drilled
a homer that looked as if it had been shot out of a cannon.
</P>
<P>
   The final shot, Ramirez's franchise-record 11th in the
postseason, gave Cleveland a 4-1 lead and the insurance it needed
after Boston scored two runs in their last at-bat against reliever
Mike Jackson. Hart, obviously pleased with the victory, was also
pleased that Ramirez had listened to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He made sure there was no doubt today, especially on that
second one,'' Hart said. ``He didn't have time to trot on that one;
it was out of the park before he was out of the batter's box.''
</P>
<P>
   Ramirez's homers were only two of Cleveland's four on the day,
the others being solo shots from Jim Thome in the fifth and Kenny
Lofton in the sixth. Thome's homer tied the score at 1-1 and was
Cleveland's first hit off of Saberhagen.
</P>
<P>
   The Boston right-hander pitched a solid seven innings, but three
of the four hits he allowed were home runs. Cleveland managed only
five hits in the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just a matter of a couple of pitches that got too much
of the plate,'' Saberhagen said. ``That's a little tough to
swallow.''
</P>
<P>
   Saberhagen waged a nice war, the first pitchers' duel of this
series, with Charles Nagy, who allowed just four hits and one run
in eight innings. The control Nagy exhibited over the Red Sox came
as no surprise as he improved his career record against Boston to
8-1, including 2-0 in the postseason.
</P>
<P>
   Nagy struck out just three batters, but he kept Boston's hitters
off balance with a sinker that seemingly disappeared inches in
front of the plate, a darting slider and a split-fingered fastball.
He had excellent control, throwing 62 strikes in 88 pitches, and
his ball movement forced hitters into 13 groundouts.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a pitcher's out there and gets all of his pitches over
the plate and throws strikes with his off-speed pitches, he's going
to be tough to hit,'' said Boston's John Valentin, who was 1-for-4
with two groundouts.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox are now facing elimination, and the fans and local
news media are clamoring for Red Sox Manager Jimy Williams to start
his star pitcher Pedro Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez has controlled the Indians all season and struck out
eight in his Game 1 victory. Williams, however, is determined to go
with the scheduled starter Pete Schourek (1-3, 4.30 earned run
average).

<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS, Nev. _ Mount Charleston rises high above Las Vegas,
just an hour's drive north of the gambling hothouses on the fabled
Strip, but a world apart in spirit. At 9,000 feet, a clear mountain
stream called Deer Creek tumbles between towering ponderosa pines
and aspens _ Las Vegas shimmering like a mirage in the dusty valley
below.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the two places are intimately tied together. The land on the
mountainside was saved from development in a deal that helped Las
Vegas grow. And that transaction put Deer Creek at the center of a
web of questions and accusations, culminating in September in the
release of a government audit that has caused a re-examination of
one of the West's most popular methods for preserving the
environment amid rapid growth.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1990s, the land at the headwaters of Deer Creek was
privately owned and had already begun to be developed into vacation
homes. That is when an environmental group, the American Land
Conservancy, offered to buy most of it in a complicated deal.
</P>
<P>
   The plan was for a land exchange. The conservancy would buy Deer
Creek, along with other environmentally sensitive land in Nevada,
and then give it to the United States Forest Service, saving it
from development.
</P>
<P>
   In return, the government would turn over federal property on
the outskirts of Las Vegas, which the conservancy would sell to
developers. Land at both ends of the deal would be used more
appropriately than it could have been before, and the conservancy,
after putting up the money for options and appraisals and acting as
the go-between, would be repaid and gain a margin of 10 percent or
so to cover its costs and help its operations.
</P>
<P>
   Deals like this one have become common in the West in the last
decade, impelled in part by the increasing unwillingness of
Congress to appropriate funds that would allow the government to
buy land outright for conservation. But Deer Creek showed what
could go wrong.
</P>
<P>
   The federal audit determined that the government had given up
land worth $5.9 million more than the value of what it got back.
Discrepancies were also found in other Nevada exchanges. The
supervisor of the largest national forest in the nation was accused
of taking gifts from participants in the Deer Creek deal and has
retired.
</P>
<P>
   And in the backlash, land exchanges around the country have been
slowed almost to a standstill as the Forest Service reviews
proposed deals and scrambles to overhaul its procedures and provide
better oversight.
</P>
<P>
   The agency will continue to work with third parties like the
American Land Conservancy, said James Lyons, under Secretary of
Agriculture for natural resources and the environment, but will
deal with them more carefully. ``They've been key partners,'' Lyons
said. ``We welcome the help and support, but just because an
organization has the label of a nonprofit doesn't mean they don't
have to be viewed in an arm's-length way.''
</P>
<P>
   Like many Western cities, Las Vegas is surrounded by federal
lands managed by either the Forest Service, which is in the
Department of Agriculture, or the Bureau of Land Management, a part
of the Department of the Interior. This land is usually waterless
or otherwise ill suited to agriculture and was never turned over to
settlers under the homestead acts of the last century.
</P>
<P>
   But now, as Western cities expand, there is growing pressure to
get much of it out of federal hands and free it for development. In
land exchanges, the government can give up land while getting
something of value for the public in return.
</P>
<P>
   Some environmentalists would surely argue that the intangible
quality of conservation is not easily measured against market
value. But to avoid unfair profiteering at the public's expense,
the government's mandate in land exchanges is to come out even in
purely financial terms. Land is to be exchanged for land of equal
value, as set by real estate appraisers.
</P>
<P>
   When the private parties in an exchange get more credit for land
than it is worth, as the auditors say happened with Deer Creek, the
public is the loser, said Charles Hancock, a retired chief
appraiser for the Bureau of Land Management in Nevada and a
persistent critic of land exchanges.
</P>
<P>
   ``You always have managers who believe the end justifies the
means,'' Hancock said. ``You have people who think, `This is the
most valuable piece of real estate in the world for our program,'
but the market doesn't support it.'' And as Hancock also says and
the history of Deer Creek shows, some players in these deals have
opportunities for personal profits as well.
</P>
<P>
   The Deer Creek exchange had its roots in northern Nevada, where
the American Land Conservancy, at the urging of environmentalists
and the state's congressional delegation, secured an option in 1993
to buy a 3,864-acre mountain property near Reno. Developers had
been planning to use it for ski runs, condominiums and a
casino-hotel.
</P>
<P>
   The conservancy proposed an exchange of the property, the Galena
Resort, for federal land near Las Vegas. But the Nevada
congressional delegation urged the conservancy's president, Harriet
Burgess, to add some other land to the deal to provide an
environmental benefit to southern Nevada, too.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Burgess sent Lauren Ward, a consultant and real estate agent
who worked with the conservancy, to Las Vegas to meet with Jan
Bernard, the president and one of 12 shareholders of Pine
Development, which owned Deer Creek.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Bernard was a real estate agent, and the conservancy was
also considering working with her on transactions involving the Las
Vegas properties it was about to acquire in the exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Pine Development had bought 524 acres at Deer Creek for $2
million and had subdivided 76 acres and sold 15 lots for a total of
$1.6 million. Ms. Bernard agreed to the idea of selling the
conservancy options on the remaining 448 acres. But a conflict soon
developed over price.
</P>
<P>
   A private appraiser who was also evaluating the Las Vegas land
valued the Deer Creek property at $12.5 million. Forest Service
appraisers rejected that as too high, and the Galena exchange went
forward in August 1994 without Deer Creek.
</P>
<P>
   By this time the exchange had grown, and it had also become
unbalanced. The federal government got Galena and several
properties around Nevada, valued at a total of $35 million. The
land conservancy got scattered parcels near Las Vegas worth $46
million.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   The lopsided amounts were permissible under the Federal Land
Exchange Facilitation Act of 1988, which allows an exchange
assembled from scattered parcels to be out of balance by up to 25
percent. But the imbalance must be corrected within three years,
and in this case the land conservancy had to find a way to make up
its $11 million deficit.
</P>
<P>
   Deer Creek quickly emerged as the favored solution to both that
problem and the congressional delegation's demand for conservation
land near Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   But negotiations faltered when government appraisers put the
value of Deer Creek at only $4.6 million and Ms. Bernard threatened
to withdraw Pine Development and develop the land.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Richard H. Bryan, a Democrat representing Nevada in
Washington, urged all the players to reach a deal.
</P>
<P>
   Federal appraisers were not at the table when Forest Service
officials agreed to value the property at $10.5 million, more than
double the government appraisal. Deer Creek changed hands in March
1996.
</P>
<P>
   The land conservancy had already sold the Las Vegas properties
it had acquired in the exchange to developers, in most cases making
up to a 16 percent markup.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to what she was paid as a shareholder in Pine
Development, Ms. Bernard made $1.3 million as a real estate agent
in those transactions, working with Ward, the land conservancy's
consultant. He was paid a similar amount: they split the
commissions, earning 3 percent each.
</P>
<P>
   That might have been the end of the matter. But Paul Tittman,
the chief appraiser for the Forest Service in Washington, soon
filed a complaint. He charged that the Deer Creek transaction had
``all the makings of either scandal or incompetence in managing the
public's resources'' and accused the service's Nevada staff of
``appraisal shopping in an effort to meet the expectations of the
property owners.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Their zeal to make a deal has undermined the entire exchange
program.'' Tittman wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The complaint set off the federal audit, which was conducted by
the office of the inspector general in the Department of
Agriculture. Besides determining that the government had lost
nearly $15 million in the Deer Creek exchange and three others, the
audit found that Jim Nelson, supervisor of the Humboldt-Toiyabe
National Forest and the highest-ranking Forest Service official in
Nevada, had received gifts from parties in the Deer Creek deal,
including a day's sailing on San Francisco Bay with Ms. Burgess and
a stay at a ski condominium owned by Ward. Nelson has now retired.
</P>
<P>
   The Inspector General identified ``a serious breakdown of
controls in all phases'' of land exchanges. The audit said the
Forest Service had allowed ``private parties (landowners and
third-party facilitators) to exert undue influence over the
direction and outcome of almost all large-value exchanges'' in the
national forest land near Las Vegas and had compromised the
independence of Forest Service appraisers by ``allowing private
parties to repeatedly challenge their valuations and by criticizing
the appraisers' work.''
</P>
<P>
   Nelson, who in a 34-year career acquired a reputation for
vigorously protecting public lands, defends his role in the land
exchanges. If he had not intervened, he said, not only Deer Creek
but also a number of other deals would not have happened, because
government appraisers had not personally liked them.
</P>
<P>
   At a meeting on one exchange, Nelson said, ``I was embarrassed
to sit there because of the hostility of our appraisers.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the sailing trip and other gifts, Nelson said, ``I did
this stuff with people that I had worked with and become very good
friends with over the years.'' He stressed the importance of the
results of his work. ``We've saved a lot of land for future
generations and for the public to enjoy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But an environmental group run by current and former Forest
Service employees expresses concern that deals like the one at Deer
Creek could undermine the cause of public stewardship.
</P>
<P>
   The group, Forest Service Employees for Environmental Ethics,
leaked a draft of the audit before its release. ``When you are a
federal employee and trusted with the management of billions of
dollars of public assets,'' Andy Stahl, president of the group,
said, ``your hands have to be scrupulously clean or the public will
lose trust in you and the agency.''
</P>
<P>
   Since reviewing the Deer Creek audit, the Agriculture Department
has ordered the Forest Service ``to put all third-party
transactions on hold,'' Lyons said, and land exchanges are now
being reviewed ``case by case.''
</P>
<P>
   The agency had been relying increasingly on third parties like
the land conservancy because its nationwide appraisal staff has
been cut from 160 to 60 people in the last decade, Lyons said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, meteoric growth in the West is increasing pressure to
complete land exchanges. The Forest Service now plans to hire more
appraisers and conduct training on how to work more cautiously with
organizations like the conservancy.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the messages we've sent is to recognize that they are
in the business of land transactions and we need to treat them as
businesses,'' Lyons said. ``We need to closely watch the bottom
line so the taxpayers and the public truly benefit.''

GLOBAL WARMING, OR HOT AIR? 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By WILLIAM K. STEVENS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A coalition of business, labor and farm groups called the Global
Climate Information Project has been sponsoring two television
commercials for the last month opposing an agreement reached in
Kyoto, Japan, last December to reduce emissions of industrial waste
gases believed to cause global warming. One commercial is a
30-second spot called ``In Common.''
</P>
<P>
   PRODUCER Goddard Claussen
</P>
<P>
   ON THE SCREEN A pair of scissors slices developing countries
like India, Algeria, Thailand, Mexico and Brazil out of the world
map. In a broader shot, the entire Third World dissolves to white.
</P>
<P>
   THE SCRIPT Female voice: ``The United Nations climate treaty
cuts 134 countries out of the picture. Together, these countries'
greenhouse gas emissions are growing five times faster than the
rest of the world's, and the U.N.'s treaty will allow them to
produce even more. So while America and a few other countries are
forced to drastically cut energy use, countries like China, India
and Mexico will continue to produce even more emissions. This U.N.
treaty isn't global, and it won't work.''
</P>
<P>
   ACCURACY All 175 countries that have ratified the 1992 U.N.
climate treaty are obligated, in general, to control emissions of
heat-trapping gases like carbon dioxide, which is produced by the
burning of fossil fuels like coal and oil. But 39 industrialized
nations including the United States, meeting in Kyoto, added a
provision to the treaty that requires them to make specific cuts in
emissions totaling about 5 percent below 1990 levels during the
next 10 to 14 years.
</P>
<P>
   These 39 countries now produce most of the world's greenhouse
emissions, even though poorer countries' emissions are growing and
may exceed those of the richer countries in a decade or two. The
poorer countries, arguing that the rich countries got wealthy by
burning fossil fuels, have long refused to bind themselves to
specific cuts until the richer countries lead the way.
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear that the Kyoto accord would require America to
cut energy use drastically; many experts believe that eliminating
energy waste by using fuel more efficiently would go far toward
achieving the cuts.
</P>
<P>
   SCORECARD Many of the commercial's sponsors fear that they would
be hurt by action to reduce emissions, and they are trying to
convince viewers that the Kyoto agreement would be unfair and
costly to Americans. The American Automobile Manufacturers
Association took the lead in organizing the campaign, according to
Karen Kerrigan, the sponsoring coalition's chairwoman.
</P>
<P>
   Among the reasons the spot is running now, she said, are these:
Delegates from around the world are to meet in Buenos Aires,
Argentina, in November to try to work out details of the Kyoto
accord. The Kyoto agreement must still be approved by the Senate.
(It has not yet been submitted by the White House.) And the Clinton
administration has recently been lobbying for urgent action to
control emissions in the face of rising global temperatures.

REPUBLICANS CRITICIZE CLINTON ON KOSOVO 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ind., Okla., N.M., Ore., Ariz., Ky., Del., Va.)   (bl)  
 By ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As NATO and the United States warned again of
impending military action against Serbia, several influential
Republican senators Friday criticized the Clinton administration's
approach toward ending the crisis in Kosovo.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The criticism came as the president's top national security
aides held a second day of confidential briefings on Capitol Hill
about how NATO will respond if Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic does not halt the violence against ethnic Albanian
civilians in the province. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic must agree to remove his special police forces from
Kosovo, to permit aid to 300,000 refugees and to begin serious
negotiations toward a political settlement, U.S. officials said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If he does not, lawmakers said the plan is for U.S.-dominated
NATO forces to fire cruise missiles at Serbian targets in Kosovo.
If that failed, NATO warplanes would wage sustained air strikes
against a wide range of targets in Serbia itself, senators said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Defense Secretary William Cohen said Friday that if NATO agreed
on air strikes, the attacks would begin within two weeks.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But many Senate Republicans were unimpressed with the briefing
they received Thursday from Cohen, Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright, National Security Adviser Samuel Berger and Gen. Joseph
Ralston, the vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``They have a lot of work to do if they're going to convince the
Congress,'' Sen. Don Nickles of Oklahoma, the Republican whip, said
on the Senate floor. Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M., who heads the
Budget Committee, said, ``They didn't have a very good plan.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind., a member of the Foreign Relations
Committee, said, ``This is an extremely complex issue, but it is
clear that the planning on the part of the administration is
inadequate.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the sentiment in Congress is more complicated. Several
Republicans, including Gordon Smith of Oregon, John McCain of
Arizona and Mitch McConell of Kentucky, as well as Democrats
including Minority Leader Tom Daschle and Joseph Biden of Delaware,
have expressed support for air strikes to end the killings.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John Warner, R-Va., a member of the Armed Services
Committee, said air strikes were futile unless ground forces _
composed of European troops _ followed up to protect the delivery
of aid and prevent renewed armed clashes.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But at the briefings, lawmakers said Clinton's aides pointedly
avoided discussing the possibility of ground forces. Sen. Dan
Coats, R-Ind., said Berger indicated that NATO would not send
ground troops until the warring parties negotiated a solution.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A series of widely publicized atrocities against ethnic
Albanians that have been attributed to Serbian forces have
increased pressure on the administration to follow through on its
threats of reprisal. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This week's briefings were the first of many contentious
consultations with the administration on the crisis in Kosovo.
``We're saying this to the administration so they'll shape up,''
said Lugar.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The president and his top aides continued to push for a
diplomatic settlement while threatening air strikes if talks fail.
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to be very, very strong here,'' President Clinton said
Friday. ``We need to stop this violence, get a negotiated
settlement, and work our way through this.''
</P>
<P>
   Cohen told reporters after briefing House members Friday, ``He
must accept the entire set of demands, otherwise he will face use
of force.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But Congress is demanding that the administration gain Congress'
blessing in advance for any military action. Many Republicans still
feel Clinton misled them on the scope, cost and duration of the
U.S.-led mission in Bosnia, and are wary of being drawn into the
same open-ended commitment in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's aides say they welcome congressional support but do
not require it.

<P>
   MIAMI _ ``I'm hanging around and checking out the city.'' That
was the first _ and possibly the most accurate _ explanation that
New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani gave when reporters asked what
exactly he was doing during a three-day trip to Miami, which he
announced at the last minute Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Although Giuliani met with Miami Mayor Joe Carollo and a
Cuban-American political group Thursday and spoke at a fund-raiser
for the Republican National Committee on Friday, he apparently
devoted most of the trip, paid for by the committee, to leisure.
</P>
<P>
   Not that the mayor would admit it. His aides brushed aside
questions about how he was spending his time, some pleading
ignorance and others saying nobody needed to know. At first, only
Carollo would confirm what everyone suspected: Rudy Giuliani, the
never-resting, uptight urban tough, was sneaking in some rounds of
golf.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani finally said Friday night that he had indeed been
golfing for two sunny, sweltering days, although he would not
reveal his handicap. He started playing last May, he said, because
his son, Andrew, was interested in the sport. ``I'm not going to
tell you where I played because you might go check my score,'' he
said after speaking to 125 people who had paid $500 to hear him
list his political accomplishments at the Westin Hotel in Fort
Lauderdale. ``I enjoy it.''
</P>
<P>
   A Reverent Tone to the Day
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani probably also enjoyed listening to the various people
he met in Miami and Fort Lauderdale, since they spoke of him in
terms best described as reverent.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great day when the City of Miami can host someone with
the courage, the integrity, the guts, if I may say, to have turned
so many things around in New York,'' Carollo, a fellow Republican,
said as he introduced Giuliani at a news conference on Thursday at
city offices. ``He has made New York an example to the rest of the
country, and indeed the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Jorge Mas Canosa, vice chairman of the Cuban American National
Foundation, was equally enthusiastic after Giuliani addressed
members of his group later that afternoon. In a brief speech, the
mayor denounced Fidel Castro and told his audience they represented
``the very, very best of the American spirit'' because they were
``trying to produce freedom and independence for people.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a man of principal, a man of courage and a man who helps
and assists those who fight for freedom,'' said Mas, who said his
group had urged Giuliani to come meet with them. ``He's a friend of
democracy and liberty.''
</P>
<P>
   Carollo, who met Giuliani for the first time over breakfast
Thursday, said the mayor was nothing like he had expected. Rudy
Giuliani was warm, he said, and kind. ``I found him just a very
warm, very average type of person,'' Carollo said. ``You feel good
with him. You would think that the mayor of the world's capital is
going to be a little more cold, some might think more arrogant. I
didn't find that in Giuliani.''
</P>
<P>
   A Chance to Boast
</P>
<P>
   As he has done in almost every other state where he has appeared
at a fund-raiser, Giuliani greeted the Republican donors at the
Westin Hotel in Fort Lauderdale on Friday evening with his
``Godfather'' imitation.
</P>
<P>
   He then spoke for 20 minutes about how the crime rate and
welfare rolls have dropped in New York City under his leadership.
Republican National Committee chairman Jim Nicholson stood by and
nodded approvingly as Giuliani spouted statistics and said that New
Yorkers were much better off than they were six years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Five or six years ago they were afraid to go out and about,''
Giuliani said. ``Five or six years ago they were afraid to go to
Broadway. They were afraid to go to the Waldorf-Astoria, much less
to the areas of the city that were considered to be more dangerous.
Today, New Yorkers feel free. They feel more independent.''
</P>
<P>
   Nicholson said all of the money raised at the fund-raiser would
go to Republican candidates running for office this fall, and
Giuliani did not mention any plans he might have for higher office.
But Ed Kone, a criminal-defense lawyer from Boca Raton who was in
the audience, appeared ready to join a Giuliani presidential
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Al Gore had better watch out, because it's going to be
a man against a boy if it's him against Giuliani,'' Kone, 36, said.
Asked if Giuliani might come across as too abrasive in some parts
of the country, Kone shook his head vigorously. ``No way,'' he
said. ``People totally love that.''
</P>
<P>
   A Tour of Hurricane Damage
</P>
<P>
   Lurking in the back of the room at the fund-raiser were Police
Commissioner Howard Safir and Jerome Hauer, the director of the
mayor's Office of Emergency Management, who will accompany Giuliani
on Saturday to the Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico, where they
will meet politicians and survey the damage caused by Hurricane
Georges.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani is scheduled to meet with President Leonel Fernandez in
the morning, then take a helicopter tour of hurricane-ravaged areas
before flying to San Juan in the late afternoon. He will probably
return to New York on Sunday morning, said Cristyne Lategano, his
director of communications.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're really going to be guided by them, what we can do to
help,'' said Giuliani, who has already sent several dozen city
police officers and firefighters to assist relief efforts in the
Dominican Republic.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor is not the first New York City politician to travel to
the hurricane-ravaged regions _ Manhattan Borough President C.
Virginia Fields and U.S. Rep. Charles Rangel, both Democrats, went
earlier this week. But the mayor, who rarely has kind words for
either Ms. Fields or Rangel, said he found nothing wrong with them
visiting, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those are not necessarily politicians I agree with
philosophically, but the fact that they're going is a good thing,''
he said. ``It means people who are more supportive of them are
going to pay more attention to the Dominican Republic.''

   Television coverage of the release of documents from the office
of Whitewater Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr on Friday was far
more restrained on every channel than either the day the original
Starr report was released or the day President Clinton's videotaped
testimony was made available.
</P>
<P>
   None of the major broadcast networks interrupted their usual
programs for live reports on the documents, and all three major
networks planned to devote much of the first segments of their
newscasts to coverage of the economy rather than news coming out of
the documents.
</P>
<P>
   No network planned any prime-time coverage, though ABC did
schedule it as the subject of its ``Nightline'' program.
</P>
<P>
   Three all-news cable channels devoted most of their afternoon
coverage to the documents. But in contrast to both other days when
the coverage was continuous, CNN used several of its regular
features, including a ``Show Biz Today'' report, and Fox News did
an interview concerning the health of Darryl Strawberry, the New
York Yankee outfielder who has colon cancer. Fox News did the
earliest report on the release of the document, obtaining copies a
few minutes earlier than other news organizations.
</P>
<P>
   An executive at one of the news channels said: ``The level of
intensity is way down. People have mostly made up their minds on
this story.''

ANGELS PAY TRIBUTE TO AUTRY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM -- The Angels retired uniform No. 26 in honor of owner
Gene Autry in 1982, symbolic of him being team's 26th player. It
was a fitting tribute to an owner that truly was part of the team.
</P>
<P>
   Autry, who died Friday at age 91, continued to attend Angels
games this season when he could. And whenever he did, he always
went into the clubhouse to visit with the players.
</P>
<P>
   Autry was a regular in the clubhouse during the club's early
years after he bought the team at the baseball winter meetings in
1960. He sold 25 percent and controlling interest in the team to
Disney on May 15, 1996, with the stipulation that his remaining 75
percent interest would be transferred to Disney upon his death.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes you just take for granted a person's going to be
around forever,'' said shortstop Gary DiSarcina, an Angel since
1989. ``Gene was one of those guys. Every time he came through the
clubhouse, he always had a smile on his face. It was one of the
highlights of the day for the guys on the team. I'm going to miss
the jokes and the laughing.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a player's owner. I've always heard since I've been
here, `Let's win one for the Cowboy.' I know the players present
and past meant it. He commanded attention and he commanded respect.
He'll be greatly missed.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very disappointed because I always enjoyed seeing him
around the ballpark,'' said pitcher Chuck Finley, an Angel since
1986. ``I know that whenever his named is mentioned, it brings a
smile to everyone's face. I have a lot of fond memories of all the
stories he'd always tell.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the Angels' battle cry through the years was ``Win one
for the Cowboy,'' they never did. Although the Angels won the
American League West Division in 1979, '82 and '86, they've never
reached the World Series. In 1986, the Angels were one strike away
from going to the World Series before eventually losing a
seven-game series to the Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   ``This team was one of the things that made him happy and I know
he was disappointed we didn't get to the World Series,'' Finley
said. ``But he'd always tell me `As long as you try your best and
work hard, then what happens, happens.' I'm sad we didn't get to
the World Series for him but I'm sure he'll be watching us from
above in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Baseball was Autry's passion, and he even tried out for the St.
Louis Cardinals at age 19. He was offered $100 a month, but turned
it down because he was making more than that as a telegrapher at
the railroad.
</P>
<P>
   He went on to fame and fortune as America's Singing Cowboy, and
though today's Angels players weren't yet born during his heyday,
they are well aware of his legacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gene Autry was always my dad's childhood hero and I've been
fortunate enough to be a member of his team,'' said outfielder Tim
Salmon, an Angel since 1992. ``What a privilege I've been given to
know him and to play for his ballclub. I feel so honored to have
had the opportunity to know him.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing I remember most was one year when we shot some
promotional commercials,'' said former second baseman Bobby Grich,
an Angel from 1977-86. ``Gene and I were in the runway and he
called me son and I called him dad. That experience remains dearest
to my heart. He is the person most responsible for me playing in
California and coming home.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing I remember is that after every road trip, he would
come down to the clubhouse at least once to see how each of us and
our families were doing. He was never aloof and he was the best
owner a ballplayer could work for.''

<P>
   Where's the Bottom? It May Not Be Here Yet &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For investors who hope the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index
won't revisit its Aug. 31 low, last week's 4.0 percent selloff
seemed to be the market's surly way of saying: ``Don't be so
sure.''
</P>
<P>
   And there are more bearish tidings on the technical front. One
recent negative is that the S&AMP;P 500, which has moved upward in a
narrow channel since the end of 1994, has pierced its lower trend
line, where the index in the past found the support that allowed it
to keep climbing.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, Mark D. Arbeter, chief technical analyst at Standard &AMP;
Poor's, says it is unlikely that the index can maintain the annual
gains of 24 percent that are needed to keep it in the bullish
channel.
</P>
<P>
   He called Friday's market upturn ``semi-positive,'' but added,
``We're not out of the woods yet.'' If two events occur _ an
increase in bearish sentiment among investment advisers from the
current 47.5 percent to around 55 percent and a contraction of new
lows on the New York Stock Exchange _ ``it will confirm we have had
a bottom, he said. He does not expect the market to move back to
its old highs until well into 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Chart makers aren't the only ones trying to call a market low.
Rao Chalasani, chief investment strategist of Everen Securities in
Chicago, puts ``the ultimate bottom'' in the 7,000-to-7,500 range
for the Dow Jones industrial average. Stocks may revisit the 7,400
level of Sept. 1, he said, and quite possibly go lower. The Dow
closed at 7,784.69 on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Edward Yardeni, chief economist at Deutsche Bank Securities,
said, ``While the recent bear market action has been very painful,
I think it is just a warm-up act for a much more serious and
protracted drop in stock prices in 1999,'' when global recession is
likely to spread.
</P>
<P>
   He thus recommends using any stock rally as a selling
opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   Jan M. Rosen &QL;

</P>
<P>
   FUNDS WATCH &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Now Is the Time the Bears Have Their Picnic &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When the market turns bearish, the bears are the winners. So,
given the market's recent mauling, it should come as no surprise
that the top performer of 8,160 American funds tracked by Bloomberg
Fund Performance in the third quarter was the Prudent Bear fund.
</P>
<P>
   Prudent Bear, which climbed 22.7 percent, is part of the only
group of stock funds that gained over the last three months _ those
that bet against the market by short-selling stocks, using futures
and options and buying bonds. The No. 2 fund in the survey was
Profunds Ultra Bear, up 18.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Over all, domestic stock funds fell 13.4 percent in the quarter,
erasing all their gains from the first half of the year, according
to researchers at Morningstar Inc. The last time funds did so
poorly was in the third quarter of 1990, when they fell an average
of 14.6 percent after Iraq invaded Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
   (Bloomberg News) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Solace for Managers Of Small-Company Funds &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   September, alas, brought no relief for investors in
small-company stocks. The Russell 2000 index, a barometer for such
stocks, fell 20.5 percent during the month, almost twice the 10.3
percent drop in the S&AMP;P 500 index. And the average ``small growth''
stock mutual fund declined 22.5 percent in the third quarter and is
down 16.8 percent for the year, according to Morningstar Inc.
</P>
<P>
   ``To say that they're ripe for a rally is such an
understatement,'' said Claudia E. Mott, director of small-cap
research for Prudential Securities. Fundamentals and profits have
been strong for months, she said, and valuations continue to make
the stocks look attractive. Yet betting on small caps now is
``risk-taking in a dicey market,'' Ms. Mott said. ``I don't think
people are going to be willing to take the risk'' until larger
stocks rebound.
</P>
<P>
   What to do? Well, the empathetic Ms. Mott wants to console
managers of small-cap funds, so she made up 1,000 bumper stickers
asking, ``Have you hugged your small-cap manager today?'' Customers
have scooped them up, and more are being printed.

ROBERT GILL, 87, COLLECTOR OF ANTIQUES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.J., Fla.)  (lb) 
 By ROBERTA SMITH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Robert Lee Gill, a longtime member of the New York
Stock Exchange and a prominent collector of American antiques, died
on Sept. 24 at his home in Manhattan. He was 87.
</P>
<P>
   Gill was born in South Orange, N.J., in 1911 and educated at
Choate. He joined Shields &AMP; Co. in 1932 and in the late 1940s
formed a company with three other members of the Stock Exchange,
but for most of his career he worked independently. During the
1930s and '40s he was a prominent member of cafe society whose
friends included Barbara Hutton and Howard Hughes.
</P>
<P>
   Gill's interest in Americana began at the Metropolitan Museum of
Art, where he was a weekly visitor to the American collection from
the time it opened, in 1927, until his death.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1930s he began collecting first-edition books and
Currier &AMP; Ives prints. He also made regular visits to the Upper
East Side gallery of Israel Sack, a dealer in Americana and
American antiques, eventually becoming part of the then small world
of serious collectors of American antiques that included Henry
Ford, Henry Francis du Pont and Ima Hogg.
</P>
<P>
   In 1942, Gill bought his first antique, a lowboy once owned by
John Hancock. Over the next few decades he formed an exceptional
collection of primarily 17th- and 18th-century Boston, federal and
Newport furniture. He was known for his eye and the beautiful
arrangement of the collection in his apartment, which also included
a widely admired kitchen that was lined floor to ceiling with 16th-
and 17th-century Dutch tile. In the late 1980s, Gill also began
collecting Chinese porcelain.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1970s, the U.S. government bought two pieces from his
collection _ a small painting of the White House under construction
and a late federal card table _ that are still on display in the
White House.
</P>
<P>
   Last year Gill endowed a research fellow scholarship at the
Henry Francis du Pont Winterthur Museum in Delaware.
</P>
<P>
   Gill's first wife, Caroline Townsend Chapman Gill, whom he
married in 1939, died in 1984. He is survived by his wife, Melanie;
a son from his first marriage, Peter Gill of Bronxville, and a
stepson, Jack Chapman of Fort Pierce, Fla.

10-02 -- After greeting voters the other day, Democratic Rep. Julia
Carson pauses to relax with Rep. Nick Rahall II of West Virginia,
left, and Mark Ledoux, an official of Federal Express. ``Given the

when asked whether she would want Clinton to campaign in their
districts. (Mary Ann Carter/New York Times Photo)

Republican only four years ago. ``This is a swing district that is
sensitive to any tide or trend,'' he says ``It's something you
think about a lot in connection with the president's troubles.''

10-02 -- Appearing last January as the first witness before the
grand jury investigating President Clinton and Monica Lewinsky,
Betty Currie, the president's private secretary, conceded that her
memory about important events ``was getting worse by the minute.''
In fact, as the months wore on and Mrs. Currie was recalled
repeatedly to the grand jury, her testimony grew increasingly
forgetful and confused. (Justin Lane/New York Times Photo)

10-02 -- Lauren Ward, left, and Jan Bernard on a road in Deer
Creek. The land here on the mountainside above Las Vegas was saved
from development in a deal that helped Vegas grow. But that
transaction put Deer Creek at the center of a web of questions and
accusations, culminating in a September release of a government
audit. (Jon Christensen/New York Times Photo)

   (NYT23) LAS VEGAS -- Oct. 02, 1998 -- LASVEGAS-LAND-DEAL-1,
10-02 -- Construction on land above Las Vegas that the federal
government traded to the American Land Conservancy, which then sold
it to developers as part of a land exchange. Deals like this one
have become common in the West in the last decade, impelled in part
by the increasing unwillingness of Congress to appropriate funds
that would allow the government to buy land outright for
conservation. (Jon Christensen/New York Times Photo) *LITE

-- In Helen Trevino's class at the Logan Street School in Los
Angeles there are nine bilingual pupils, six of which are taught
primarily in English. Bilingual education in California was
supposed to be in a grave by now, essentially killed when residents
voted last spring to end it. But more than a month into the current
school term, the program is clearly still breathing. (Monica

-- Mayor John Lindsay visiting a methadone clinic in Washington
Heights in 1970. Even as the White House drug policy director, Gen.
Barry McCaffrey, spoke this week of making methadone more
available, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani continued to insist that he wants

better than heroin. (Neal Boenzi/New York Times Photo)

TV-EXECUTIVE-SMITH-2, 10-02 -- David Smith, chief executive of the
Sinclair Broadcast Group, runs a group of TV stations that has
grown so fast he is unsure exactly how many he now controls. ``I
think it's either 61 or 63,'' he says; it's actually 64. ``I don't
think there are many other businesses where you can do a 50 percent
profit margin without manufacturing anything.'' (Marty Katz/New

committee members did agree Friday on one thing: The latest batch
of documents offered nothing conclusive as to whether the president
committed federal crimes. (New York Times Photo)

through its legislative business Friday, stalling for several hours

end to Republican hopes of presenting President Clinton with a full
set of appropriations bills. (Stephen Crowley/New York Times Photo)

NY-ENGLISHWOMEN, 10-02 -- Plum and Lucy Sykes, twins who are on the
staff of Vogue and Town &AMP; Country, respectively, are the latest
versions of a type: young, well-born Englishwomen who are blazing a
brilliant trail through New York society. ``I look at the Sykes
sisters and I think: OK, my ancestors were born to work in the

Singer, fashion editor at New York Magazine. (Miles Ladin/New York

losing their grip on status bags. Or so it seems, judging by the
logo-laden bags clenched by well-heeled businessmen around town.

NIGHTOUT-THICKE, 10-02 -- Alan Thicke after his Broadway
performance in ``Chicago.'' Thicke, 51, who gained fame as the
father of Kirk Cameron on the ABC sitcom ``Growing Pains,'' is
amused that everyone seems to be calling him a fresh face in New
York. ``At my age being a new face is pretty funny, especially in
this town, and especially without liposuction,'' he says. (Miles

ABOUT-CARS-LEXUS-TOYOTA-2, 10-02 -- The Lexus LX470 holds its own
among other luxury sport utility vehicles. The phenomenal growth of
the North American sport utility market shows no signs of slowing,
and the sub-segment of the large, expensive, gas-guzzling types is
demonstrating the most rapid rise in popularity. (New York Times

ABOUT-CARS-LEXUS-TOYOTA-1, 10-02 -- The 1999 Toyota Land Cruiser
competes well against other luxury sport utility vehicles. Did
conspicuous consumption disappear with the 1980s? It seems the
bigger and more expensive the luxury sport utility, the better it
sells. (New York Times Photo)

4 -- BIZ-PROFILE-HASSAN, 10-02 -- Fred Hassan was the heir apparent
at American Home Products. But instead of waiting for the top spot
there, he opted for the challenge of leading the overhaul of
Pharmacia &AMP; Upjohn. ``I don't have any regrets about leaving
American Home,'' he says. ``Coming to Pharmacia &AMP; Upjohn was a
chance to fix a broken company.'' (Peter Yates/New York Times

MEDICARE-HMO, 10-02 -- Many employers do not seem ready to deal

help their retirees through the Medicare maze with mailings, phone
lines and forums like this one last month in Troy, run by General
Motors. (Peter Yates/New York Times Photo)

 By BOB MORRIS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ They're twins. They're thin. They're attractively
employed, talented, a little vague about their past and, according
to one admirer, ``hugely in demand right now.'' Oh, and one other
thing: They're English.
</P>
<P>
   Meet Plum and Lucy Sykes, 29-year-old magazine darlings, and the
latest in the stream of non-celebrity somebodies who flood the
city's fashion ponds from one season to the next. They're not
identical, but they think alike on many subjects. They agree, for
instance, that it would be ``rather sad'' to be young and single
with a VCR in Manhattan. Why rent movies when life resembles
``Breakfast at Tiffany's'' and ``Absolutely Fabulous'' every day?
</P>
<P>
   ``I look at the Sykes sisters,'' said Sally Singer, the fashion
editor at New York Magazine, ``and I think: OK, my ancestors were
born to work in the fields, and theirs were born to walk into
parties.''
</P>
<P>
   The Oxford-educated Plum, the brunette one, spins out witty
articles as a staff writer for Vogue about the high-maintenance
beauty regimens of New Yorkers, like trying on stilettos and having
lingerie custom-made. Anna Wintour, her boss, said that Plum
``lives the ideal Vogue life,'' and that she's the ``quintessential
Vogue girl.''
</P>
<P>
   The quintessential Vogue girl? What does that entail? It means
owning dresses that Alexander McQueen made for you when he was too
poor to have a checking account. It means being an out-and-about
embodiment of quirky style, having Kate Moss-like hair and Versace
sunglasses that you got free from a runway show. If it also means
an inability to remember faces because you've met too many people,
or occasionally snubbing someone who seems less than interesting,
well, that comes with the position, too.
</P>
<P>
   Lucy, a brassy bottle-blonde, who attended acting school but
never went to college, is living a life that's almost as Town &AMP;
Country as her sister's life is Vogue. As the fashion editor of
Town &AMP; Country, she scouts for good-looking, accomplished people to
use as models, and after just a few years in New York, she is
ending up on benefit committees and in society columns with them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lucy's got great taste and wonderful energy,'' said Pamela
Fiori, editor in chief of Town &AMP; Country. ``Also, she's tall, blond
and charming, with the most adorable English accent. All New
Yorkers have a weakness for people with English accents.''
</P>
<P>
   Unless it's Madonna's, of course.
</P>
<P>
   The Sykes sisters are among the most visible on a list of
single, young Englishwomen working it in New York right now _
lionized in a small world, unknown to the general public. Violet
Fraser, Daisy Garnett, Zandy Forbes, Vicky Ward, Miranda Brooks _
the list is refreshed by the day, as it has been for years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody's being so nice to me,'' Plum Sykes said. ``I feel
welcome here wherever I go. It's probably just because of my job,
but I don't care.''
</P>
<P>
   It was Friday night at the end of September's Fashion Week, and
the Sykes sisters were giving dinners around the corner from each
other at two different restaurants in Greenwich Village.
</P>
<P>
   With its old brick low-rise neighborhoods, Greenwich Village has
become, of late, a sort of Little London for the crowd of
fashionable English people thriving in the democratic meritocracy
of Manhattan, where a title is nice to have but not as good as a
spokesmodel contract or a Conde Nast expense account. Streets that
were once home to writers and radicals have now become home to such
mercenary media luminaries as Ms. Wintour, Kate Moss, James Truman,
Rupert Everett, Stella Tennant, Hamish Bowles, Gabe Doppelt and, of
course, the Sykes sisters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm intimidated by high-rises,'' said Plum as she emerged from
Piadina, on West Tenth Street. ``But Greenwich Village is like the
mews of London.''
</P>
<P>
   She had been presiding over a table of 10 of her attractive,
successful English friends and was about to hail a cab when she
realized that the block and a half to Moomba wasn't too far to
walk, even in high-heeled, Sergio Rossi sandals. Minutes later, in
her tight, red velvet dress by Ghost with a cigarette burn in front
(``It's from Anna's party for Oprah at Balthazar,'' she said. ``All
my clothes get trashed.''), she paused at a velvet rope.
</P>
<P>
   ``How are you?'' was all it took from Ms. Sykes, who has modeled
for Prada, to melt the big Moomba-bouncer into the sidewalk.
</P>
<P>
   ``Come right in,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lucy's dinner was just breaking up. ``Hello, darling!'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   She was holding court downstairs at a table in the corner, and
now it was time to migrate to the private party room on the top
floor, where Gene Pressman, recently stripped of his title of
co-chief executive of Barneys, spotted Lucy and trotted over to pay
his respects.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hello, darling,'' she said in a shrill voice that might not be
so appealing if it were attached to an American accent. ``So nice
to see you!'' Lucy calls everyone darling. It's part of her shtick.
</P>
<P>
   ``I once dated a guy who said that going out with me was like
being in a Beatles movie,'' she said later. ``I didn't have to
think of anything clever to say. All I had to do to make him laugh
was say hello.
</P>
<P>
   She also speaks fluent fashionese: ``This is my new pony skin
bag by Fendi,'' she said to a friend between sips of a Kamikaze
cocktail. ``Pony skin is so soft! I used to have a puppy, but now I
have a Fendi bag. It's cheaper than a puppy because you don't have
to feed it every day.''
</P>
<P>
   After that, she busied herself making everyone feel welcome,
spraying the room with kisses and yelling ``Toss my salad!'' every
other minute. ``Toss my salad'' translates, roughly, as
``Cowabunga!''
</P>
<P>
   English friends, fashion victims, magazine writers, cute men _
it seemed the social equivalent of Spin Art. At one point, Clifford
Streit, the personal-manager-about-town, who works the same social
swamp as the Sykes sisters, introduced the handsome man at his
side. ``This is Brian Unger,'' Streit said. ``He's on `The Daily
Show.''' Lucy had no idea what that meant, so Streit explained to
her that it was a ``very hot'' show on Comedy Central.

 NEW YORK: Comedy Central.
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Comedy? I love comedy!'' she exclaimed. ``But I don't have
cable.''
</P>
<P>
   Unger seemed bamboozled by such a shrill, blond, ever-so-English
creature. ``You should have your own TV show,'' he said to her with
wide eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would be lovely,'' she said. ``Toss my salad, baby!''
</P>
<P>
   After she left him reeling, Unger turned to Streit. ``Toss my
salad,'' he said. Later, Streit said about the Sykes sisters,
``They're like getting hit by a truck, but a nice truck, and on the
wrong side of the road, of course.''
</P>
<P>
   Why is New York working so well for the English right now?
William Norwich, who writes about society for The New York
Observer, says that being English is an attribute here. ``The Sykes
sisters enhance a room,'' he said. ``They have the English wit and
the confidence of all those centuries behind them.''
</P>
<P>
   Gabe Doppelt, who is English, thinks leaving England behind is a
liberating experience for English women with spunk and drive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here, anything is possible and anything is accepted,'' said
Ms. Doppelt, the producer of the VH1 Fashion Awards. ``In England,
no matter how hip the scene is, the answer is always no; but here,
people are willing to try for you, at least.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it isn't always so hunky-dory. Sarah Giles, a
contributing editor of House &AMP; Garden, who sees a younger version
of herself in the Sykes twins, raised a cautionary flag. Her life
as a social golden girl disappeared as quickly as it was spun into
being.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're attractive, it can be incredibly welcoming here,''
said Ms. Giles, who is also English. ``As long as you have a great
job, you can have a lovely time. You have your Manolo Blahniks and
your fabulous parties and you feel you can't go wrong. But if you
happen not to be doing so well, you get a different view.''
</P>
<P>
   After Tina Brown came over to remake Vanity Fair in 1984, she
brought Ms. Giles along to be an editor at large. But when Ms.
Brown left Vanity Fair, Ms. Giles, who had led the high life, was
unceremoniously relieved of her job and its perks. She ended up
scrambling.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Sykes girls are lovely people,'' said Ms. Giles, who is
still looking for a full-time job, ``but they've had it easy so
far.''
</P>
<P>
   The sisters, however, like to say that they're from the
``broke'' side of the English aristocracy. They grew up in Kent, in
the fine home of their grandmother. (``Henry VIII stayed there,
supposedly,'' Lucy said.) But because there wasn't much money in
the family, their mother, Valerie Goad, worked at home as a dress
designer for shops in London.
</P>
<P>
   What the Sykes sisters don't like to talk about, but what was
well known around the aristocratic and social circles they
inhabited in London, was that their father, Marc Sykes, a
well-known black sheep of his family, took off when his daughters
were 18, leaving his family in financial straits.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was awful,'' Lucy said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In England, everybody knew about our father,'' Plum added.
``Here, nobody knows and nobody cares. It's such a relief.''
</P>
<P>
   It was late morning in Little London, the night after the Moomba
party. At Les Deux Gamins, a French bistro on Waverly Place, the
Sykes sisters were chain smoking and eating steak for breakfast.
``Our yoga teacher told us we needed more protein,'' Lucy said.
</P>
<P>
   Kate Moss was at a nearby table, gesturing excitedly over the
gossip pages of The New York Post to a scraggly guy in an Iron
Maiden T-shirt. ``It's funny to watch her reading the pages that
define her,'' said Plum, who had already paid her respects to Ms.
Moss earlier and had left it at that.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't hang out with supermodels,'' Lucy said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We like them, but we don't hang out with them,'' Plum added.
``They don't want to have to talk to journalists like us about
fashion.''
</P>
<P>
   It seemed an endearingly level-headed observation. At heart,
there is a hard-working, if not exactly down-to-earth quality about
both sisters, who by sheer will and wit have spun their existence
here into its current high voltage, as they did once before in
London.
</P>
<P>
   ``Americans see English people, and they think we're all snobs
who grew up in castles with butlers,'' Lucy said. ``But we've paid
our dues. We've worked at magazines for years to get here.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to work,'' Plum added. ``We have nothing to fall back
on apart from each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Having each other, of course, may be the greatest luxury in
their lives. ``Just one English girl in New York, that could be
depressing,'' Plum said. ``But two is good fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Breakfast steaks consumed, they rose from the table, put their
sunglasses on, picked up matching J.P. Todd bags and hit a nearby
street fair with lots of vintage clothes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Loving!'' Lucy exclaimed about one fur coat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Very Marc Jacobs,'' Plum said about another.
</P>
<P>
   With the same gusto with which they have attacked New York
society, they went plowing through the racks and stalls. They
spotted the ultra-cool James Truman, who is the editorial director
of Conde Nast magazines. ``For someone so powerful,'' Plum said
after he greeted them warmly and moved on, ``he's very nice.'' They
tried on things and rejected them. ``With shopping, you have to not
be able to live without it,'' said Lucy, who was in turquoise Maude
Frisson platforms, Gucci slacks and a pink thrift-shop cardigan.
``And it has to be better than the last thing you bought. That's
how you get a wardrobe that allows you to get dressed in 20 minutes
for a movie premiere.''
</P>
<P>
   Nothing of that quality was on hand at the street fair. But Lucy
did spot an exotic pillow cover that she wanted to buy. ``Plum, can
I have the $20 that you owe me?'' she said. Plum fished out a
twenty and Lucy handed it over to the vendor. ``There better not be
any tax,'' she said to him. There wasn't, but as he slowly counted
out her change, Lucy grew impatient. ``OK, OK,'' she said, holding
out her hand and snapping her fingers at him, ``four dollars,
please, quick, quick, quick!''
</P>
<P>
   Spoken as much like an entitled Englishwoman as a fabulously
harried New Yorker.
</P>
<P>
   After that, it was time to go home and prepare for the rigors of
what lay ahead _ another Saturday night for a couple of
hard-working Holly-Go-Lightlys in a city full of heavy hitters.

INVESTING WITH: WESLEY MCCAIN AND KATHY O'CONNORY OF THE ECLIPSE
GROWTH AND INCOME FUND

 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, OCT. 4)  
 (af)  
 By CAROLE GOULD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   With his neatly trimmed beard and his book-filled offices,
Wesley McCain, co-manager of the Eclipse Growth and Income fund,
looks every bit the academic. Indeed, he developed his
computer-driven investment strategy as an assistant professor of
finance at Columbia University's graduate business school.
</P>
<P>
   But McCain does not pine to return to the ivory tower soon. ``I
think I graduated from teacher to mentor,'' he said. ``I don't miss
institutionalized teaching at all.''
</P>
<P>
   His students may miss him, but their loss is investors' gain.
Since its inception in December 1994, McCain's fund has returned
21.9 percent a year, on average, through Sept. 25, compared with
16.2 percent for its peers in the mid-cap value category, according
to Morningstar Inc., the Chicago financial publisher.
</P>
<P>
   More impressive, the $103.9 million fund has nicely weathered
the treacherous markets of 1998. It has returned 2 percent so far
this year, compared with a loss of 9.8 percent for its category.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, 56, and his co-manager, Kathy O'Connor, 38, label
themselves ``quantitative fundamentalists.'' In quantitative
investing, managers rely on computer models to help them pick
stocks instead of, say, interviewing company executives or
listening to analysts' pitches.
</P>
<P>
   ``We visit data, not companies,'' as McCain puts it. Nor do the
managers rely on earnings estimates or other forecasts; they use
only historical and current data in their computer models.
</P>
<P>
   But both managers still call themselves value investors. ``We
look for stocks that are both good and cheap,'' Ms. O'Connor said.
</P>
<P>
   McCain founded Towneley Capital Management, sponsor of the four
no-load Eclipse funds, in 1971, and Ms. O'Connor joined in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   With the help of high-speed mini-computers, the two review reams
of information on more than 7,000 United States companies. Stocks
are ranked by more than 100 measures, most of them remarkably
simple _ ``all basic Finance 101,'' McCain said. The measures fall
into two basic categories: those that uncover improving operating
results and those that determine relative value.
</P>
<P>
   In the first group are basic measures like profit margin, cash
flow, leverage and returns on equity and assets. The co-managers
then add their insights to the mix, ferreting out improving results
that are not yet apparent to Wall Street analysts or even a
company's own management, McCain said.
</P>
<P>
   For example, a company's earnings before interest and taxes may
be declining; that is usually seen as a negative when it comes to
profitability. ``We might look at that company and say, `Margins
are collapsing, but asset turns are increasing, meaning that
management is selling off excess or slow-moving inventory,' '' he
said. ``Just because margins are decreasing doesn't mean a company
isn't interesting.''
</P>
<P>
   The second type of measures, for value, includes ratios like
price to sales, price to book and price to cash flow. Again, simple
stuff. The computer then compares a company's numbers over
different periods with those of rivals.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike many other managers, McCain and Ms. O'Connor set no
target prices for their holdings. Typically, they hold a stock for
four quarters, selling only for extraordinary reasons like fraud at
the company. Depending on its ranking in the model after four
quarters, a stock may be partly or wholly sold and replaced by a
stock with better scores.
</P>
<P>
   The fund, which owns 110 stocks, in May began buying shares of
Lyondell Chemical, a specialty chemical company, at $21 to $27 a
share. The operating results showed a sharp improvement. Yet by
McCain's standards Lyondell is very inexpensive: It sells for about
1.2 times its revenue per share for the previous four quarters,
less than seven times its earnings for the previous four quarters
and for just 2.5 times book value. It closed at $21.0625 on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   In early August, the managers bought class A shares in Food
Lion, the supermarket chain; among the numbers that suggested
improving profits were receivables, working capital and
inventories.
</P>
<P>
   The company sells for about 0.5 times its revenue for the
previous four quarters, while Safeway, another chain that the fund
bought earlier, sells for 0.9 times revenue. Eclipse started buying
Food Lion at $10 to $11 a share. It closed at $10 on Friday.

DESPITE DEAL, FAMILY OF MAN WHO DIED IN ARREST ASSAILS MAYOR 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By DAVID ROHDE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The family of Anthony Baez, who died in a
confrontation with a police officer in the Bronx in 1994, agreed
Friday to a record settlement in their lawsuit against the city,
but family members still accused the city of failing to grapple
with police brutality.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a pattern of abuse over and over, because nobody stands
up to it,'' Iris Baez, Baez's mother, said at a news conference
after the settlement was made formal.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement, in which the city will pay the family almost $3
million, ends almost a four-year legal battle that began with
Baez's death after a late-night touch football game with relatives
on Dec. 22, 1994. A ball struck a police car during the game,
prompting a confrontation in which police officials and prosecutors
said one officer, Francis X. Livoti, applied a choke hold to Baez,
who was 29.
</P>
<P>
   But while the settlement ended a swarm of suits in the case,
relatives of Baez continued to express bitterness Friday. ``No
apology is worth me standing in front of him,'' said Mrs. Baez,
when asked about whether she wanted an apology from Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani. ``He should have said that from day one.''
</P>
<P>
   The Baez family's lawyers said the settlement _ which included
no admission of wrongdoing by the city but was the largest ever
recovered in wrongful death resulting from police brutality _
should set a precedent for other police brutality claims. They said
they hoped the settlement would prompt other brutality victims to
come forward and would pressure the department to police its errant
officers more aggressively.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not an aberration,'' said Susan M. Karten, a lawyer
for the Baezes. ``Every other day we hear another incident.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Karten acknowledged that the family had hoped to force Louis
Anemone, the chief of department and highest-ranking uniformed
officer, to testify about why he turned down a request from a
subordinate to remove Livoti from patrol after he received nine
brutality complaints.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would've wanted the record to come out,'' Ms. Karten said.
``I don't think Anemone has ever answered for that.''
</P>
<P>
   Federal prosecutors also accused Livoti's fellow officers of
lying under oath to protect him, and an investigation into possible
perjury charges against the officers is continuing.
</P>
<P>
   The city still faces suits in some other highly publicized cases
involving police actions. A wrongful death suit filed by the family
of Nathaniel Levi Gaines Jr., an unarmed Navy veteran with no
criminal record who was shot in the back by a transit police
officer on July 4, 1996, as he fled down a deserted Bronx subway
platform, is still pending. And the case of Abner Louima, a Haitian
immigrant who said he was brutalized last summer in a Brooklyn
station house, is also pending.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But Eugene Borenstein, chief of the tort division of Corporation
Counsel's office, said the city settled the Baez case because the
time had come to move forward. ``I think this was a good time to
dispose of an unfortunate and tragic incident,'' he said. ``I think
all of the parties thought that it was the right time to settle the
case.''
</P>
<P>
   City officials have long distanced themselves from Livoti.
Giuliani, usually a vocal supporter of police officers, never
openly backed him. And Police Commissioner Howard Safir dismissed
Livoti from the force after a police trial found that he used an
illegal choke hold on Baez.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Cronin, Livoti's lawyer, said Friday that her client
continued to maintain his innocence. Convicted in June on federal
charges of violating Baez's civil rights, he will be sentenced next
week.

EDITORIAL: PATAKI'S FISCAL RECORD 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Saturday, Oct. 3:
</P>
<P>
   With the gubernatorial race in full throttle, New Yorkers might
soon wonder which of the states described by the candidates is the
one they live in. Gov. George Pataki boasts that he has cut taxes,
held down spending and presided over an economic renewal.
</P>
<P>
   His Democratic opponent, Peter Vallone, says the governor has a
poor fiscal record, saddling the state with more debt, budget
deficits and a dismal credit rating. Tom Golisano, an independent
candidate, is bombarding the airwaves with accusations that Pataki
has generated $20 billion in new debt and actually raised taxes.
Confused? In fact, these claims contain a blend of truth,
distortions and misplaced blame.
</P>
<P>
   Golisano's charges are the most questionable. Whatever can be
said about Pataki, he did lower taxes. The personal and business
tax reductions enacted under him _ mostly by lowering income tax
rates _ amount to $5.5 billion this year, or $300 for every person
in the state. State tax receipts did go up, but that was because of
the economic boom, particularly on Wall Street, not because tax
rates had been raised.
</P>
<P>
   Golisano's other claim, that Pataki has failed to curb the
growth of state debt, is more justified. More and more of the
state's capital projects are being paid for by borrowing, rather
than annual appropriations. Debt service as a percentage of the
budget is also rising.
</P>
<P>
   The governor likes to point out that the rate of growth of state
debt during his term has been half the rate incurred in the last
term of his predecessor, Mario Cuomo. But the rate under Pataki is
about the same as that under all 12 years of the Cuomo
administration, according to figures from the state comptroller's
office.
</P>
<P>
   Though one bond-rating agency has upgraded New York a notch, the
state still has one of the poorest credit standings in the nation.
The main cause is the state's tendency to enact spending and
tax-cut obligations that balloon in size in later years, without
identifying the means to pay for them, a longstanding practice that
Pataki has not changed.
</P>
<P>
   When Pataki entered office, he faced a deficit of $5 billion and
had to cut spending in his first two years. Though the budget is
balanced this year, and though he eliminated many budget gimmicks,
the state still faces a projected deficit of $5 billion in two
years.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki likes to boast that he has cut the rate of spending
growth considerably from the Cuomo years. That claim is both true
and false. Over all, spending has risen at an average rate of 3.7
percent in the last four years, compared with 5.7 percent in the
previous four. But in this election year, state spending has shot
up about 8 percent to pay for a campaign season giveaway for school
aid and other items.
</P>
<P>
   The voters have a right to ask whether Pataki the cutter or
Pataki the spender is the one seeking re-election, and also to
judge the accuracy of his opponents' charges. The governor ran four
years ago as a conservative determined to lower spending, debt and
taxes. He has succeeded more than his opponents concede, but not as
much as he maintains.

GE DENIES ANY PLANS TO SHAKE UP FINANCE UNIT 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By REED ABELSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   General Electric Co. said Friday that it had no plans to break
up its star financial services subsidiary, GE Capital, and assured
investors that it would report double-digit earnings growth in the
third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Speculation has been rampant that General Electric is planning a
shake-up at GE Capital, which had about $40 billion in revenue last
year. Such speculation, as well as the prospects for a
reorganization, was the subject of the Market Place column Friday
in The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   According to analysts and others who watch the subsidiary
closely, Gary Wendt, GE Capital's chief executive, is widely
expected to leave. In addition to naming new leadership at GE
Capital, there is also talk that General Electric might divide the
subsidiary into different units or fold some of the businesses into
the parent company.
</P>
<P>
   Although GE Capital has been a strong contributor to GE's
profits, investors are increasingly wary of financial service
companies and have been awarding them low price-earnings multiples.
While analysts say that GE Capital is not at risk from any
unpleasant surprises, a reorganization could help divert attention
from the subsidiary.
</P>
<P>
   In its statement, GE, which had previously declined to comment
on the speculation, said it had ``no plans to break up its
successful GE Capital Services unit or assign any GECS businesses
to GE's industrial units.'' GE's chairman, John Welch Jr., said the
company's current business model ``will continue to be the basis
for future growth.''
</P>
<P>
   GE stock fell as much as $4.9375, or 6.5 percent, Friday before
recovering to close down just 18.75 cents, at $75.375.
</P>
<P>
   While Nicholas Heymann, an analyst with Prudential Securities,
says he believes that there will be no formal corporate
restructuring, he says he still thinks that GE Capital's businesses
could be reclassified in some way to increase operating
efficiencies. None of the changes would be in response to problems
at the unit, he said.
</P>
<P>
   GE ``knows enough about managing people'' that any changes at GE
Capital will not hurt its strong performance, Heymann said.
</P>
<P>
   Speculation also continues that GE will announce executive
changes at GE Capital, following the expected departure of Wendt.
In Friday's statement, GE reiterated that it had a ``longstanding
practice of not commenting on speculation about its executives.''

COMMENTARY: `INVISIBLE' LIFE TAKES SHAPE AS A CITY CARES 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By DAVID GONZALEZ   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A lifeless floral wreath hangs over the doorway of
Jose Soriano's tenement in upper Manhattan. It is the only outward
sign of what befell his family inside: they held a desperate
overnight vigil when he failed to come home after his shift at a
Brooklyn clothing factory. He never returned because he was stabbed
to death doing something he loved: walking through Central Park.
</P>
<P>
   In the days after his killing on Sept. 19, there were few other
signs elsewhere in the city acknowledging the cruel end to a
Mexican immigrant's hard life. Soriano originally was described by
the police, incorrectly, as homeless, as if that would excuse the
absence of outrage. Inside his very real home, friends and family
felt forgotten. They suspected that people did not care about the
deaths of those who live north of the boundary of class and concern
otherwise known as East 96th Street.
</P>
<P>
   But something happened soon after his widow, Fausta, described
to this columnist the love her husband had for this city and her
sadness at the public's apathy over his murder. Scores of people
sought her out. Hundreds called and wrote to the Rev. Bruce
Lewandowski, who had lamented the uncomfortable reality that the
lives of invisible immigrants did not count.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Soriano and her three children are invisible no more. Nor
are the 136 New Yorkers who donated more than $20,000 to help the
family bury the dead and comfort the living. Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani, who has been known to visit tourists hurt in this town,
visited Mrs. Soriano twice, offering to help any way he could.
</P>
<P>
   Soriano used to say he wanted only friends, not enemies. He got
his wish.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all go to the same place to rest,'' Mrs. Soriano said.
``There, you see no difference in class. There, we are all poor.
The only difference is when the rich man dies, people fight over
the inheritance. A poor person goes to his rest with everyone's
help. Friends, family and even those who never knew him.''
</P>
<P>
   The letters and checks keep arriving for the Sorianos at St.
Cecilia's Church. They come from doctors, secretaries and teachers.
The residents of a homeless shelter collected $200 in nickels and
dimes. The notes are signed by Anonymous, or by A New Yorker Who
Cares. Some say nothing. Others speak volumes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm white, 55 years old, college-educated and have a
high-paying job with a major corporation, live in the Wall Street
area,'' wrote one person who sent $50. ``Not likely we would have
ever met. Even if we did, we wouldn't have had much to talk about.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's funny then that reading about him today I found myself
liking him. He was ambitious and moved to New York City to help
himself and his family, loved the city, liked to walk around in it,
worked hard and long hours, didn't ask the government for help,
took care of his family, liked baseball. We would have had much to
talk about after all.''
</P>
<P>
   Nelly Diaz, the church secretary, has been working nonstop since
last week opening letters and counting checks. On Wednesday alone,
$1,200 came in. ``It's a big city,'' she said. ``But we're all one
community. Their hearts go out.''
</P>
<P>
   Jose Soriano was buried in Mexico on Wednesday. His widow stayed
in New York, unwilling to leave until whoever killed him is found
and convicted. Only then would she leave the city that broke her
heart but ultimately healed her spirit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not know how I got the strength to withstand this pain,''
she said. ``I did it only because of the strength of my family,
friends and people I never met. My daughter, Grizelle, is little.
She has given me the most strength to stay on my feet and keep on
going. That force comes from a place I never even knew I could get
strength from.''
</P>
<P>
   Grizelle, almost 3, wakes up at night asking for her father,
wondering when he will come home with juice and candy, as he always
did. ``She waits for him,'' Mrs. Soriano said. ``I tell her he's
sleeping in a little box in God's house. She wants to go to Mexico
because Papi is in Mexico.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the girl asks if Papi doesn't love them anymore.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, no,'' Mrs. Soriano says. ``He wanted the best for us. He
just went ahead. She says, `OK Mami, OK' I tell her we care for him
a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   As do many of you, too. Though her husband is gone, he drew many
people to his family's side. Mrs. Soriano embraces all of them with
an abrazo that revives hope and gives life even to the cold ground
where Jose drew his last breath.

A WIDER STRIKE ZONE HELPS GOOD PITCHING 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ If good pitching beats good hitting and
anything can happen in a short series, how is someone to know which
bromide to follow in a three-of-five-game division series?
</P>
<P>
   No problem, Johnny Oates said. Good pitching is the ``anything''
that can happen in a short series.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a short series,'' the Texas manager said before his team
played do-or-die with the Yankees Friday night, ``good pitching
will win out. We might get fortunate one night and outslug the
Yankees, but to think we're going to outslug the Yankees the next
three nights to win, that's not going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   On the basis of the early returns, the results of the first two
games, Oates added, he expected the series to continue along the
same low-scoring lines. ``It's not going to be a slugfest,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, he conceded, there might be one game where ``somebody may
not have it and you're able to score six or seven runs, but it's
not going to be that way every night; there are too many good
pitchers.''
</P>
<P>
   Oates was talking about pitching because he was asked an obvious
question: If someone had told him his pitchers in the first two
games of the series at Yankee Stadium would hold the Yankees to a
total of five runs, would he have expected to have held a
two-games-to-none lead? ``You would,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Holding the Yankees to five runs was indeed a credit to his
starters, Todd Stottlemyre and Rick Helling. But the Yankees'
starters, David Wells and Andy Pettitte, permitted only one run.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the way playoff baseball is supposed to be,'' Oates
said. ``You have the two best offensive clubs in the American
League. On the flip side, you have the best pitching staff in the
American League.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees were No. 1 among American League pitching staffs.
Boston had the second-best staff, Cleveland was fifth and the
Rangers were all the way down the list as No. 12, their earned run
average registering as close to 5.00 as possible without being
5.00.
</P>
<P>
   Of the National League playoff teams, Atlanta, Houston and San
Diego were 1-2-3 in pitching, with the Chicago Cubs a distant 11th.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over a 162-game schedule, the best pitching staffs should be
in the playoffs,'' said Oates, a former major league catcher.
``There's a reason most of these teams are in the playoffs. Over
the course of a season, pitching will win a lot of ball games.''
</P>
<P>
   Pitching has won some playoff games besides the two games in New
York. Kevin Brown outpitched Randy Johnson in San Diego's 2-1
victory over Houston in the first game of that NL series.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Glavine and Kevin Tapani traded shutout innings until the
Cubs scored a run in the sixth, but then Tapani lost his shutout in
the ninth and the Cubs lost to the Braves in the 10th in Game 2 of
the other NL series.
</P>
<P>
   Only the Cleveland-Boston series has featured runs. ``When you
get to this time of year,'' Oates said, ``I believe the
high-scoring game is unusual.''
</P>
<P>
   Another manager had a different take on the low-scoring games.
He has watched some of the games on television, and he has noticed
another development that could be a factor in the scoring, or lack
thereof.
</P>
<P>
   ``You saw a game last night,'' the manager said, speaking on the
condition of anonymity for obvious reasons and referring to the
Tapani-Glavine game, ``where the strike zone was out there six or
eight inches and there were no runs. They virtually take the bats
out of the hitters' hands.''
</P>
<P>
   The manager referred, of course, to the home-plate umpire, who
in that game was Bill Hohn. But he also said, ``The Yankee game was
the same,'' meaning Game 2, when the plate umpire was Durwood
Merrill. ``Durwood had strikes four to six inches outside,'' the
manager said. ``When you see all those guys looking at the umpire,
you know there's something going on.''
</P>
<P>
   The manager was articulating a concern that many managers and
players have raised this year. The strike zone may have shrunk from
the top, but in the eyes of some umpires, it has become fatter,
adding space beyond the outside corner.
</P>
<P>
   Glavine and Greg Maddux have particularly taken advantage of the
growth. To hear some hitters and managers talk, Glavine and Maddux
live out there. The Braves, of course, have the starting rotation
against which all others are measured.
</P>
<P>
   ``Atlanta goes to the ball park every night knowing they're
going to win,'' Oates said. ``They know they're going to pitch well
enough so that if they scratch out three runs they're going to win.
Can you imagine every series you go into, you know you're going to
possibly face a 20-game winner every game?''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees had a 20-game winner this season, and he pitched
Friday night. David Cone's presence on the mound had to be
unsettling to the Rangers because they had to beat him to keep
playing. They might also have been unsettled by the presence of
John Hirschbeck behind the plate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh boy,'' the manager said, alluding to Hirschbeck and his
reputedly large strike zone.

ENCRYPTION SOFTWARE DEBATE KEEPS INTERNET IN POLITICAL ARENA  
 BY TOM ABATE 
</HEADLINE>
   c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
Washington 
On my last day in town, I glimpsed the future of politics on the
Internet when I visited Jonah Seiger and Shabbir Safdar, two of the
online world's more accomplished rabble rousers.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Seiger is a Palo Alto native who sports a goatee and an earring.
Safdar is a long-haired programmer. Together they organized the
``Black Thursday'' protest two years ago, when thousands of Web
pages went dark to protest the Communications Decency Act.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, they run MindShare, a Washington political consulting
firm that uses the Internet for political organizing.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, they just finished a $100,000 job for Americans
for Computer Privacy, an ad hoc group funded by Microsoft, Novell
and Sun Microsystems. These companies want Congress to allow
high-tech firms to sell strong encryption software at home and
abroad.
</P>
<P>
   The encryption debate isn't just about money. Civil libertarians
fear Congress will bow to the Federal Bureau of Investigation and
write laws mandating breakable codes to make it easier for the
bureau to bust digital bad guys.
</P>
<P>
   The point is, this would be a tough issue to explain in TV
commercials. So Seiger and Safdar placed banner ads on Web sites,
where more viewers would understand the debate.
</P>
<P>
   The ads read: ``If you support strong crypto, type your ZIP code
here.'' Entering a ZIP code took viewers to a page displaying the
telephone number of their representative and urging them to
call &UR;  &LR; in to support a specific bill.
</P>
<P>
   I raised an eyebrow at that. Why not e-mail? But Seiger said,
``Phone calls get noticed. E-mail is too easy to ignore.''
</P>
<P>
   Now Seiger and Safdar have a database of about 3,200 people they
can mobilize in the future.
</P>
<P>
   And though the numbers are small, the two said they have at
least one constituent in almost every congressional district who
can act like a ``citizen lobbyist'' whenever encryption bills come
to a vote.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Internet has revolutionized business practices, it
hasn't had much impact on politics yet. I asked whether candidates
for state or local office might be able to use similar, low-cost
tactics involving the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Safdar said a candidate could create a database of ardent
supporters. These could be friends, family, party activists or
people who responded to ads from any form of media.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet simply becomes the vehicle with which to contact
this core group and ask them to do small things that might add up
to victory. For instance, the candidate could post a flyer on a Web
site and ask supporters to download the document, print it out at
home and distribute it to neighbors _ a cheaper, more personal
alternative to direct mail.
</P>
<P>
   The trick is to use the Internet as a network for organizing
people, rather than as a mass medium for flashing &UR;  &LR; slogans before
their eyes.
</P>
<P>
   As the sign in their office says: The Internet Is Not
Television.
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; Web, White &AMP; Blue:  &LR; On Tuesday, the wraps will come off what
may be the largest database of election information ever assembled
on the Web. Called Web, White &AMP; Blue, it draws together information
on candidates and races in most U.S. locales.
</P>
<P>
   People will be able to search for candidates in their city or
state. Dozens of leading Web sites, including Cnet, Excite and
Yahoo, have already agreed to feature the data. Other Web sites can
link to the database at  &LR; www.webwhiteblue.org &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   The project was organized by the Markle Foundation in New York,
which specializes in funding citizen participation, and Harvard's
Kennedy School of Government, a leader in studying the societal
impacts of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Kathleen DeLaski, news director at America Online, and Steve
Clift, a free-lance political consultant in Minnesota, organized
the compilation of the candidate data.
</P>
<P>
   The impulse behind the program is laudable and altruistic. But
it doesn't take a great leap to see the advertising potential.
</P>
<P>
   Software exists that can recognize which race you're interested
in and can pull up a banner ad for a candidate in that race.
</P>
<P>
   AOL already has an election Web site with this ability to sell
context-linked ads.
</P>
<P>
   Seiger and Safdar, who clued me in to this site, said they
planned to recommend that their political clients buy banner ads
linked to this data. ``If somebody's looking at ZIP code 94301, you
have a pretty good idea they vote in Palo Alto,'' Seiger said.
</P>
<P>
   Although political advertising on the Internet has been
minuscule, this is the kind of development that could put this
medium on the political map.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _Sound (bite) advice:  &LR; Mike Nelson used to be Vice President Al
Gore's technology adviser. When I visited him at his new job here,
as one of IBM's Internet gurus, he taught me his one indispensable
lesson for politics _ or for any business that sells ideas.
</P>
<P>
   ``To succeed, you need a good bumper sticker,'' said Nelson.
``It explains what you're doing in a sentence.''
</P>

   _ &UR; Leaving Dodge: &LR;  It's been an instructive week in the capital,
but I head back to the real world with a heightened awareness of
the strange way we conjure up laws.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;  Washington is a witches' brew of whispers, rumors and
contradictory off-the-record remarks. The Internet Tax Freedom Act
is or isn't being linked to the so-called CDA II bill, depending on
whom you talk to. And both will come to a floor vote next week
before Congress recesses _ unless, of course, some unforeseen
glitch scuttles one or both.

tough to file shareholder class action suits in state courts.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate version of that bill contained one sentence demanded
by the Securities and Exchange Commission to ensure that real fraud
suits don't get thrown out with the frivolous. But with time
running out, the House leadership is balking at accepting that
compromise. As bill co-sponsor Congresswoman Anna Eshoo,
D-Atherton, told me, ``I'd sure hate to get beaten by the clock.''

BUYOUTS PLANNED AT HP  
 BY DAVID EINSTEIN 
</HEADLINE>
   c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
Looking to cut costs _ particularly in its slumping test and
measurement business _ Hewlett-Packard announced yesterday it plans
to eliminate 2,500 jobs through voluntary buyouts.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Although the figure represents less than 2 percent of HP's
127,200-person global workforce, it's a painful move for a company
that prides itself on being a conscientious employer.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the workers who have been offered severance packages are
in the United States, including 800 in Silicon Valley. HP also
hopes to cut some 400 jobs in Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   Company spokeswoman Mary Fallon would not disclose the total
number of buyouts offered but said individual employees were not
targeted.
</P>
<P>
   The buyouts involve mostly manufacturing operations, but also
some administrative and research workers, Fallon said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reducing the number of employees reflects the company's
continuing effort to fine-tune business strategies to address
changes in market dynamics,'' HP said in a statement. ``HP has used
voluntary programs like this in the past to manage the changing
needs of its businesses. They have proven successful for both
management and employees.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the Palo Alto computer and electronics giant has not
had a buyout since 1992, when it used voluntary severance to pare
2,700 jobs.
</P>
<P>
   The lion's share of the job cuts will come in HP's test and
measurement and components businesses, which have been hit hard by
Asia's economic turmoil and by a slowdown in the semiconductor
industry. Fallon said buyouts are not being offered in HP's big
computer organization, which accounts for 80 percent of the
company's revenues.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. workers who accept voluntary severance will get six months'
pay plus one-half month's pay for each year of service, up to a
maximum of a full year's pay. Terms in other countries will vary.
</P>
<P>
   HP set the stage for yesterday's announcement by taking lesser
actions over the past few months to reduce costs. It cut salaries
of top executives by 5 percent, put a lid on travel expenses and
said it would close offices worldwide during the December holidays.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday's news didn't have much affect on HP's stock, which
has been flirting with its 52-week low. The shares fell 38 cents to
close at $49.75.
</P>
<P>
   Many analysts continue to be bullish on HP despite the fact that
its earnings have disappointed Wall Street in nine of the past 10
quarters. They blame a dramatic slowdown in revenue growth _ which
was only 5 percent in the third quarter _ on the general lethargy
in the technology sector rather than on the company itself.
</P>
<P>
   With its broad product line, which ranges from computers and
printers to medical testing equipment, HP is believed capable of
weathering an industry downturn better than more one-dimensional
companies.
</P>
<P>
   Analyst Daniel Kunstler of J.P. Morgan said, ``As long as the
public feels this is a step in the right direction to keep their
business competitive in fairly difficult times, the buyouts will be
viewed positively.''
</P>
<P>
   HP said slightly more than half of a previously announced $150
million charge against fourth-quarter earnings will be for the job
reductions.

ENCRYPTION SOFTWARE DEBATE KEEPS INTERNET IN POLITICAL ARENA  
 BY TOM ABATE 
</HEADLINE>
   c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
Washington 
On my last day in town, I glimpsed the future of politics on the
Internet when I visited Jonah Seiger and Shabbir Safdar, two of the
online world's more accomplished rabble rousers.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Seiger is a Palo Alto native who sports a goatee and an earring.
Safdar is a long-haired programmer. Together they organized the
``Black Thursday'' protest two years ago, when thousands of Web
pages went dark to protest the Communications Decency Act.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, they run MindShare, a Washington political consulting
firm that uses the Internet for political organizing.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, they just finished a $100,000 job for Americans
for Computer Privacy, an ad hoc group funded by Microsoft, Novell
and Sun Microsystems. These companies want Congress to allow
high-tech firms to sell strong encryption software at home and
abroad.
</P>
<P>
   The encryption debate isn't just about money. Civil libertarians
fear Congress will bow to the Federal Bureau of Investigation and
write laws mandating breakable codes to make it easier for the
bureau to bust digital bad guys.
</P>
<P>
   The point is, this would be a tough issue to explain in TV
commercials. So Seiger and Safdar placed banner ads on Web sites,
where more viewers would understand the debate.
</P>
<P>
   The ads read: ``If you support strong crypto, type your ZIP code
here.'' Entering a ZIP code took viewers to a page displaying the
telephone number of their representative and urging them to
call &UR;  &LR; in to support a specific bill.
</P>
<P>
   I raised an eyebrow at that. Why not e-mail? But Seiger said,
``Phone calls get noticed. E-mail is too easy to ignore.''
</P>
<P>
   Now Seiger and Safdar have a database of about 3,200 people they
can mobilize in the future.
</P>
<P>
   And though the numbers are small, the two said they have at
least one constituent in almost every congressional district who
can act like a ``citizen lobbyist'' whenever encryption bills come
to a vote.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Internet has revolutionized business practices, it
hasn't had much impact on politics yet. I asked whether candidates
for state or local office might be able to use similar, low-cost
tactics involving the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Safdar said a candidate could create a database of ardent
supporters. These could be friends, family, party activists or
people who responded to ads from any form of media.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet simply becomes the vehicle with which to contact
this core group and ask them to do small things that might add up
to victory. For instance, the candidate could post a flyer on a Web
site and ask supporters to download the document, print it out at
home and distribute it to neighbors _ a cheaper, more personal
alternative to direct mail.
</P>
<P>
   The trick is to use the Internet as a network for organizing
people, rather than as a mass medium for flashing &UR;  &LR; slogans before
their eyes.
</P>
<P>
   As the sign in their office says: The Internet Is Not
Television.
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; Web, White &AMP; Blue:  &LR; On Tuesday, the wraps will come off what
may be the largest database of election information ever assembled
on the Web. Called Web, White &AMP; Blue, it draws together information
on candidates and races in most U.S. locales.
</P>
<P>
   People will be able to search for candidates in their city or
state. Dozens of leading Web sites, including Cnet, Excite and
Yahoo, have already agreed to feature the data. Other Web sites can
link to the database at  &LR; www.webwhiteblue.org &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   The project was organized by the Markle Foundation in New York,
which specializes in funding citizen participation, and Harvard's
Kennedy School of Government, a leader in studying the societal
impacts of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Kathleen DeLaski, news director at America Online, and Steve
Clift, a free-lance political consultant in Minnesota, organized
the compilation of the candidate data.
</P>
<P>
   The impulse behind the program is laudable and altruistic. But
it doesn't take a great leap to see the advertising potential.
</P>
<P>
   Software exists that can recognize which race you're interested
in and can pull up a banner ad for a candidate in that race.
</P>
<P>
   AOL already has an election Web site with this ability to sell
context-linked ads.
</P>
<P>
   Seiger and Safdar, who clued me in to this site, said they
planned to recommend that their political clients buy banner ads
linked to this data. ``If somebody's looking at ZIP code 94301, you
have a pretty good idea they vote in Palo Alto,'' Seiger said.
</P>
<P>
   Although political advertising on the Internet has been
minuscule, this is the kind of development that could put this
medium on the political map.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _Sound (bite) advice:  &LR; Mike Nelson used to be Vice President Al
Gore's technology adviser. When I visited him at his new job here,
as one of IBM's Internet gurus, he taught me his one indispensable
lesson for politics _ or for any business that sells ideas.
</P>
<P>
   ``To succeed, you need a good bumper sticker,'' said Nelson.
``It explains what you're doing in a sentence.''
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who doesn't follow this dictum runs the risk of having a
fuzzy message, or worse. ``If you don't create your own bumper
sticker, your opponents will do it for you,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; Leaving Dodge: &LR;  It's been an instructive week in the capital,

BAY AREA RACKS RUN SHORT ON MAGAZINES 
</HEADLINE>
   By Benny Evangelista  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
Bay Area magazine readers may have trouble finding favorite
periodicals like Time, Newsweek and TV Guide for the next week
because a major regional magazine distributor appears to have
halted deliveries.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bookstores and newsstands were scrambling to find alternate
distributors following reports that Cal-West Periodicals Inc. of
Stockton may be shutting its doors.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;  ``There are going to be some holes out there for a couple of
weeks at least,'' said Victor Hanson, South San Francisco branch
manager for Speedimpex USA, Inc., a smaller distributor of mainly
foreign magazines.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;  Cal-West supplied magazines to shops at San Francisco and
Oakland airports as well as supermarkets and other stores across
the Bay Area and as far away as Reno, Hanson said.
</P>
<P>
   Industry observers said Cal-West has been struggling for the
past three years as dramatic changes and lower profit margins have
swept through the magazine distribution business.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;  Officials from privately held Cal-West Periodicals in
Stockton, which once ranked as one of the country's top 10 magazine
distributors, declined to comment about the firm's current status.
Repeated messages left since Tuesday by The Chronicle for Cal-West
President Peter K. Fuller and other company officials went
unreturned.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &UR;  &LR; Stacey's Bookstore on Market Street also had trouble getting
information from Cal-West, which was the store's largest magazine
distributor, according to Paul Shanahan, Stacey's manager.
</P>
<P>
   Although most magazine readers care little about how their
favorites get to the rack, the apparent closure of a major regional
wholesale distributor was an unusual enough event to have industry
insiders buzzing from coast to coast.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether Bill Clinton will be impeached and this are the two
biggest questions,'' Shanahan said.
</P>
<P>
   The Booksmith bookstore on Haight Street in San Francisco began
looking for another distributor Tuesday when it learned of
Cal-West's troubles from a delivery driver.
</P>
<P>
   ``The driver came in and dropped off his magazines as he does
twice a week and said, `I'm not coming back,''' said Thomas
Gladysz, assistant manager at the Booksmith.
</P>
<P>
   John Harrington, publisher of a magazine-distribution industry
newsletter called the New Single Copy, said most major publishers
and national distributors stopped shipping magazines to Cal-West
last week because the company owed them money.
</P>
<P>
   Formerly based in Oakland, Cal-West used to be ``far and away''
Northern California's biggest wholesale distributor of magazines,
with an estimated 800 to 1,000 accounts at stores and retail
chains, Harrington said.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Costiglio, a spokesman for Time Inc. in New York,
confirmed that Time stopped delivering magazines to Cal-West in the
past two weeks because of an undisclosed amount owed ``over an
extended period of time.''
</P>
<P>
   Cal-West, along with other distributors, was hit hard by
sweeping changes in how magazines get to stores. Three years ago,
Safeway Stores Inc. decided it wanted to cut down the number of
magazine wholesalers that supplied its supermarket chain to just
``two or three rather than 20 or 30,'' said Ray Argyle, president
of the trade group Periodic Wholesalers of North America.
</P>
<P>
   Other major magazine retailers throughout North America quickly
copied Safeway, forcing wholesalers to cut their profit margins to
offer more competitive bids, Argyle said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That took the magazine wholesale business from respectable
profitability to break-even and even a loss position,'' Argyle
said.
</P>
<P>
   The number of U.S. distributors has since dropped from 300 to
60, with the top five now holding 70 percent of the business,
Harrington said. He said Cal-West had slipped from its previous
top-10 ranking, but he didn't know its current rank.
</P>
<P>
   Harrington said other regional distributors like Milligan News
of San Jose and Anderson News of Modesto were picking up Cal-West
clients and should be able to fill in the gaps in a week to 10
days.
</P>
<P>
   Gladysz said the Booksmith had reduced its reliance on Cal-West
from about 85 percent to 10 percent, so it may not be as hard to
find another distributor. But other retailers said it may take time
to switch over distribution contracts, meaning magazine readers may
see shortages.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;  Claude Carvalho, longtime owner of George's News Stand on
Seventh Street in San Francisco, said his shop will be fine since
he switched to Milligan News last month. Carvalho said he dropped
Cal-West after 17 years because they started missing orders for
popular publications like the Sporting News and Cosmopolitan.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;  ``There's going to be a dearth of reading material all over
Northern California until they get this straightened out,''
Carvalho said. ``It's going to be a mess.''

CUBS PIN THEIR HOPES ON WOOD'S SORE ARM 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By CLIFTON BROWN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ The Chicago Cubs will be home Saturday night, but they
will also be in deep trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Facing elimination, and coming off a heartbreaking 2-1 loss in
10 innings to the Atlanta Braves on Thursday night, the Cubs face
their most imposing challenge in a season that has been filled with
obstacles.
</P>
<P>
   Down by 2-0 in the three-of-five-game series, either the Cubs
will win three consecutive games against the Braves, or they will
be on vacation.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, the Cubs will get an emotional lift from their fans
at Wrigley Field and from the return of Kerry Wood (13-6), their
rookie phenom who will start Game 3 against Greg Maddux (18-9).
Yet, nobody knows what to expect from Wood, who is just 21, in his
first post-season game. Wood, sidelined by a sore right elbow, has
not pitched since Aug. 31.
</P>
<P>
   Will Wood be the overpowering pitcher who had 233 strikeouts
this year, including a 20-strikeout performance against Houston? Or
will Wood have problems with his control, his mechanics or the
magnitude of the situation? Those questions will be answered
Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Cubs will be trying to shake off their deflating loss in
Game 2 at Turner Field, a game that they led with one out in the
ninth inning. Then Javy Lopez of Atlanta hit a dramatic home run to
tie the score, and Chipper Jones had a run-scoring single to win it
in the 10th.
</P>
<P>
   The loss wasted an outstanding pitching performance by Kevin
Tapani, who was two outs away from a complete-game shutout until
Lopez became a hero.
</P>
<P>
   Some teams do not recover quickly from losses like that. The
Cubs believe they can, particularly with Wood on the mound.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kerry has lifted the spirit of the fans and his teammates
since the day he joined us,'' said Jim Riggleman, Chicago's
manager. ``We're asking a lot of Kerry to go out there and pitch
against Greg Maddux, but with the excitement at Wrigley Field, I
think our players will feed off that. I think it's going to be a
great day at Wrigley.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he worried about Wood reinjuring his arm, Riggleman
said: ``There is always a risk of a pitcher going out there and
getting hurt. Is there a risk of injury? Yes. But can he do it and
be successful? Yes.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, even if Wood pitches well, Chicago must solve Atlanta's
pitching, which is always a difficult task. The Cubs are hitting
only .150 in the series and have scored two runs. That's a tough
way to win games.
</P>
<P>
   Sammy Sosa, who hit 66 home runs during the regular season, has
been kept in the park by the Braves. He has a single and a double
in seven at-bats. The Braves have pitched very carefully to Sosa
and dared other Cubs to beat them.
</P>
<P>
   That strategy has worked to perfection, and the pressure is on
Chicago's other hitters to pick up the slack. Mark Grace is 0 for
8, Gary Gaetti is 0-for-7 and Lance Johnson is 1-for-8. And Maddux,
a four-time Cy Young award winner, is hardly the best pitcher to
end a slump against.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sounds like fun, huh?'' Grace said when asked about the
prospect of facing Maddux, after facing John Smoltz in Game 1 and
Tom Glavine in Game 2.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if Atlanta's pitching had frustrated him, Grace said:
``I'm not frustrated. I feel like I'm getting good swings. But the
results haven't been there.''
</P>
<P>
   So for the Cubs, the margin for error is gone. ``We're still
confident,'' Grace said. ``We've bounced back before, so we have to
do it again.''

EDITORIAL: EXPANDING METHADONE TREATMENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Saturday, Oct. 3:
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration's decision to make methadone more
accessible to heroin users is a long-needed change in national
policy.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Barry McCaffrey, head of the White House's Office of
National Drug Control Policy, has proposed allowing physicians to
administer methadone in their offices. Currently it is dispensed
only in special clinics, limiting the number of people who can use
this treatment. Only about 115,000 of the estimated 800,000
Americans addicted to opiates are participating in methadone
maintenance programs.
</P>
<P>
   Decades of experience have shown that methadone treatment is the
most effective way to control heroin addiction. Methadone blunts
the craving for the opiate, with substantial benefits to society. A
federal study has found that those on methadone maintenance cut
their heroin use by 70 percent and their criminal activity by 57
percent, and increased their full-time employment by 24 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Scientific panels convened by the National Institutes of Health
and the National Academy of Sciences have all recommended that
government regulations be eased so that more people can benefit
from methadone.
</P>
<P>
   Yet ignorance and prejudice persist. Several states ban
methadone programs despite clear evidence of the treatment's
effectiveness. The tirades against methadone by Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani of New York suggest that even senior officials need
further enlightenment.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani seems to believe that only abstinence can control
addiction, and his administration continues to press forward with
plans to end methadone maintenance programs at city hospitals that
currently serve 2,100 addicts. But medical experts, who applaud
McCaffrey's recommendation, point out that many opiate-dependent
individuals cannot remain free from heroin without medication.
</P>
<P>
   No single approach works for every addict, but methadone, when
properly administered and coupled with counseling, has helped
thousands reclaim their lives. Under the new national policy, many
more addicts might do the same.

   The weather has been unseasonably hot in central Iowa, and
farmers who are used to worrying about getting crops out of the
fields before the weather turns wintry are harvesting with the
air-conditioning turned up full in the cabs of their combines. The
Midwest is never more beautiful than at this season, even though
the air is dull with humidity. The ditches have ripened into a pale
ocherous palette of colors, shades of russet intermixed, and in the
fields where soybeans have already been harvested, the stubble lies
slicked back like an old man's crewcut. The corn hasn't stood in
shocks for 60 years and more, but even as it stands _ dry, skeletal
ruins of the plant it was in mid-August _ it suggests cool weather,
sharp nights and the plumage of that most autumnal bird, the
pheasant.
</P>
<P>
   All this would be enough to bring Keats to mind, except that
there is nothing mild about the fruitfulness of the Midwest at this
time of year. Because of the dry, warm weather, harvest is running
ahead of schedule, and the fields are full of machinery.
All-devouring combines run down the rows cutting 20-foot swaths
well into the night, moving across the landscape in the darkness,
their lights suggesting earthgoing yachts or mobile oil refineries.
Grain wagons pull alongside, offloading beans or corn from the
combines' hoppers. In the stubble-rows, trucks with red boxes wait
to be loaded, and then one after another they make their way to
grain elevators and storage bins, where grain dryers work
ceaselessly. The local news programs report uneven crop maturity,
and when they are asked farmers say they hope for a freeze.
</P>
<P>
   It is a laborious landscape, and that is part of its beauty. But
even as farmers stare ahead at the rows of uncut corn in the
headlights, their minds are on the grain glut, which has dropped
prices below the cost of production, and on the decline in the
value of farmland. The fields are enormous, the yields are
remarkable, the machinery is gargantuan, and so is the level of
agricultural debt. The margin on which the enterprise operates this
year is nearly nonexistent, which is why, as farmers watch the
harvest progress, their minds are also on Washington, where
Democrats and Republicans debate the terms of relief.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ They talked on and on, about haircuts, diets, sex
and more sex. But the tapes of the phone chats between Monica
Lewinsky and Linda Tripp show less a real friendship than a
temporary alliance between two women obsessed by Bill Clinton who
often don't even seem to like each other very much.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Tripp, who made the tapes, comes off in the conversations
she arranged as unable to resist making her feelings of moral and
intellectual superiority clear to the younger woman. She corrects
Ms. Lewinsky's grammar, sighs at her romantic yearnings, edits her
love notes, ridicules her girlish handwriting and needles her with
such zingers as ``He's never been attracted to you because you use
big words.''
</P>
<P>
   When Ms. Lewinsky admits with some embarrassment that she has
sent the president her thoughts on education reform, Mrs. Tripp
responds, ``Oh, you mean an actual idea.''
</P>
<P>
   At every opportunity, she prods Ms. Lewinsky to push the
president harder to get her a job, and not just any job. She tries
to persuade Ms. Lewinsky that she's thinking too small, settling
for too little and going too easy on Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   In Ms. Lewinsky's grand jury testimony, the former White House
intern presented herself as an operator who aggressively lobbied
the president to find her a well-paying, low-stress job. But these
tapes show the extent to which Ms. Lewinsky was in turn influenced
by Mrs. Tripp. Word by word, she helped Ms. Lewinsky write the
letter demanding that the president help her get a big job.
</P>
<P>
   When the two women discuss their own relationship, they pledge a
certain devotion but acknowledge some problems. Ms. Lewinsky asks
Mrs. Tripp if she's ever noticed how they make each other angry.
And Mrs. Tripp, at another point, says: ``The problem I have with
you, frankly, is I feel entirely too maternal towards you. And it's
almost like when I'm yelling at my kids, not that that ever has any
effect. When I yell at you, it's out of love.''
</P>
<P>
   The tapes released Friday fill in the blanks of a relationship
perhaps more mysterious than that between a younger woman and an
older man. Ms. Lewinsky, a recent college graduate in her first
professional job, and Mrs. Tripp, who is about twice her age,
became close at the Pentagon, where both had been reassigned from
the Clinton White House.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike Ms. Lewinsky, who was transferred against her will
for having a crush on the president, Mrs. Tripp had come to dislike
the Clintons intensely and felt she was shoved out for opposite
reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Tripp seems to become so involved in the relationship
between Ms. Lewinsky and the president that she even appears to try
managing the sex itself. After hearing a breathy holiday message
Ms. Lewinsky has recorded for the president, Mrs. Tripp says, `No
wonder he likes to have phone sex with you _ you're just like a
little Marilyn Monroe vixen,'' and then encourages her to rerecord
it to make it a little tartier.
</P>
<P>
   For her part, Ms. Lewinsky, who seems to feel more comfortable
with older men and women than with people her own age, leans
heavily on Mrs. Tripp but clearly resents her attitude, frequently
answering her putdowns with ``Thank you very much.'' Still, she
does not seem to be able to stop confiding in her, perhaps because
Mrs. Tripp shows an unusual willingness to listen to a replay of
endless detail of the presidential affair.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, it is the everydayness of their hours and hours of
conversation _ the ``Hang on a minute,'' ``Don't go anywhere, my
dinner's heating, I'm starving,'' and ``Cleo, get off that couch''
_ that makes the conversations taped by the one friend unbeknownst
to the other so ugly.
</P>
<P>
   One friend is losing her way, calling herself a crazy person and
wondering how she can live without her wonderful, awful, married
lover, the president. The other is jabbering about her bad haircut
and quietly collecting evidence.
</P>
<P>
   In her grand jury testimony, Mrs. Tripp defended her decision to
make the tapes of their conversations.
</P>
<P>
   ``My idea was never to manufacture evidence. In fact, I had
never even thought about the independent counsel in my wildest
dreams. My idea was, I'm going to arm myself with records so when
I'm in a position to speak under oath I can do so truthfully, not
to be set up in a perjury trap, and say, `Fine, you think I'm
committing perjury _ here, have a look.'
</P>
<P>
   ``At no time did I make a conscious effort to catalog or
document or even date the conversations. It was just my way of
having my backup so that when I had the fear of losing everything
that I had worked for my entire life, and my children, that I would
have some way of proving that I was not lying under oath.''
</P>
<P>
   In the conversations she recorded, there are a few funny
moments, as when Ms. Lewinsky says, ``Linda, if I ever want to have
an affair with a married man again _ especially if he's president _
please shoot me.'' (Mrs. Tripp laughs and promises to follow
through.)
</P>
<P>
   But mostly the tapes are a depressing record of a brand of
betrayal that some single women might consider more devastating
than that of an unfaithful man.
</P>
<P>
   At least obliquely, Mrs. Tripp repeatedly signals Ms. Lewinsky
that for her own good, she will hurt her to make sure she gets out
of the relationship. ``I know you're going to hate me, Monica,''
she tells her at one point, when the two are discussing how hard
the president is really trying to help her. ``I want you the
((deleted)) out of there. I want you with a life.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   There are many other moments when Mrs. Tripp overtly encourages
Ms. Lewinsky in her belief that there is hope for her with the
president, telling her that the president clearly does care for her
but can't be with her, because of the possible consequences: ``I
don't think he has it in him to say, ``I meant it _ I wanted you
back _ I want you in my life, but I can't do it.''
</P>
<P>
   In an e-mail to Mrs. Tripp, Ms. Lewinsky says, ``I will also be
checking my messages in the hopes that the creep will call and say:
`Thank you for my love note. I love you. Will you run away with
me?'' What do you think the likelihood of that happening is?''
</P>
<P>
   And Mrs. Tripp blatantly eggs her on, ``Ah, but that has already
transpired, says my omnipotent crystal ball,'' and ``You will come
home to an opportunity to get together with the creep, I am
positive.''
</P>
<P>
   There does not seem to be a huge maturity gap between the two
women. When Ms. Lewinsky says she may also be falling for Vernon
Jordan, the president's friend, who has been dispatched to help her
find work, Mrs. Tripp's only response is that yes, Jordan is
attractive, or as she says, ``very crushable.''
</P>
<P>
   And her advice to her young colleague is pretty uniformly bad.
Her thought for a good job option for Ms. Lewinsky in New York, for
example, is to check with Susan Thomases, Hillary Rodham Clinton's
good friend.
</P>
<P>
   When Mrs. Tripp testified before the grand jury, she said her
disillusionment with the Clinton administration dated to the first
days after Clinton took office. She was appalled by how the new
administration dismissed many senior civil servants to fulfill a
campaign promise to cut White House staff by 25 percent, and then
replaced them with political appointees.
</P>
<P>
   She saw Gary Aldrich, a former Secret Service agent who wrote a
tell-all book about the Clintons, as a ``professional, decent,
honorable'' man who was ``slimed'' by the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a vast font of knowledge and exposure to things that
went on in this White House that I found appalling, and I had made
a decision in 1996 to go forward with revelations about what I had
seen, but fear drove me away from what would have been a product
that would have certainly lost me my job.''
</P>
<P>
   When Mrs. Tripp speaks with Ms. Lewinsky about the president, it
is with considerable, though usually modulated, anger. She tells
her: ``Most people going through what you've gone through would
have said, ``Hey ((deleted)) you and the horse you rode in on, and
let me call the National Enquirer. You know? He has no business
yelling at you and saying, `If I had known what kind of person you
were in the beginning, I wouldn't have gotten involved with you.'''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Tripp also makes it clear that she believes Clinton has
abused Ms. Lewinsky, and only fleetingly gets Ms. Lewinsky to
agree. ``You protect him, every inch of the way,'' Mrs. Tripp says
in frustration.
</P>
<P>
   But she still seems to want to be in on every aspect of the
relationship between the president and his former intern. When Ms.
Lewinsky worries that Clinton must think she's an idiot because her
notes have not always been well-written, Mrs. Tripp sighs and says,
``I think most of the things that I've seen are well done. Of
course, you've let a few slip that I haven't seen.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky gives Mrs. Tripp presents, and showers her with
affection and gratitude in a way that Mrs. Tripp obviously enjoys.
But like her involvement with the president, the relationship is
way off-kilter and in the end, one-sided.
</P>
<P>
   When Ms. Lewinsky thanks her friend for helping her tape the
sexy message to the president, she gushes, ``Here you are, sitting
on the phone, going over all this stupid ((deleted)) with me,
listening to the tapes.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Tripp responds, ``It's because I care about you, and I _
you know, in my heart of hearts.''

EDITORIAL: FREEDOM'S LOSS IN MALAYSIA 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Saturday, Oct. 3:  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad of Malaysia has never had much
tolerance for criticism or for the legal rights of those who
challenge his authoritarian rule. But his high-handedness has taken
a dangerous turn in recent days with his treatment of Anwar
Ibrahim. Until a few weeks ago, Anwar was deputy prime minister,
finance minister and Mahathir's chosen successor. He seemed to be
Malaysia's best hope for a more democratic future. Then, abruptly,
he was arrested and this week appeared in court, charged mainly
with sexual improprieties.
</P>
<P>
   The more likely cause of his abrupt fall was his outspoken
campaign against the nationalist and restrictive economic policies
Mahathir has been promoting. Anwar, a supporter of open
international markets, rightly linked the controls on capital and
currency movements Mahathir imposed to increased opportunities for
corruption and a further erosion of individual freedoms.
</P>
<P>
   Mahathir endangers Malaysia politically and economically.
Temporary capital and currency controls might make sense if they
were coupled with serious reforms, including measures to stabilize
the exchange rate and shield the banking sector from political
pressures. But Mahathir has never shown much interest in such
reforms.
</P>
<P>
   Anwar's arrest has sparked rallies and protests in favor of
reform and an end to Mahathir's 17 years in power. Police have
arrested several of Anwar's supporters. He appeared in court with a
bruised arm and black eye and said he had been beaten nearly
unconscious in custody. Mahathir has suggested that his former
deputy's wounds were self-inflicted. An independent doctor who
examined Anwar disputes this.
</P>
<P>
   Several Asian leaders, normally silent on the human rights
questions of their neighbors, have publicly criticized Anwar's
beating. When President Clinton goes to Malaysia next month for a
regional economic meeting, he should ask publicly for the freedom
of Anwar and other detainees.

AN OVERNIGHT SUCCESS, AND IN JUST NINE SEASONS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Shane Spencer was 18, and the Yankee scout
who watched him did not know if he would hit for power, did not
know if he would become a good outfielder. But the scout was sure
Spencer loved to play baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Schmidt, the scout, offered Spencer a small bonus as the
28th-round pick in the 1990 draft, and Spencer passed up a college
scholarship so he could play professional baseball and pursue a
dream that almost all 28th-round draft picks never realize.
Spencer's passion for the game buoyed him through a nine-season
journey to the majors that has brought him here, to sudden and
extraordinary fame.
</P>
<P>
   Spencer hit 10 home runs in 67 at-bats in the regular season,
including three grand slams in 10 days, before hitting a home run
in his first at-bat in the postseason, in Game 2 of the division
series against the Texas Rangers. He was the starting left fielder
for the Yankees Friday night in Game 3. ``I am not surprised,''
said Spencer, 26. ``I guess I'm surprised it's all happening at
once.''
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-eighth-round draft picks such as Spencer do not get the
same opportunities as first-round picks. That is reality.
Twenty-eighth-round picks sign for thousands of dollars;
first-round picks get hundreds of thousands, or millions.
</P>
<P>
   When the Yankees took Spencer in the 28th round, Schmidt went to
his home to negotiate. Spencer polled each member of his family as
to what each thought his bonus should be, then gave Schmidt a
figure (perhaps about $25,000). ``I can't do that, Shane,'' Schmidt
replied. Spencer quickly reduced his asking price by almost half:
``Well, can you get me this?'' He just wanted to play.
</P>
<P>
   First-round draft picks are pushed to the big leagues;
28th-round draft picks must push themselves to the majors. They
must produce big numbers and earn attention.
</P>
<P>
   Spencer did not do that in his first five seasons in
professional ball. Gene Michael, who was the Yankees' general
manager when Spencer was in Class A, remembers that everybody liked
Spencer's compact swing. Everybody could see he was a pretty good
athlete, that he was a good guy willing to work. But Spencer hit
three homers in his first 618 at-bats, and in 1994 he batted .290
with eight homers and 53 runs batted in. Good production, but not
good enough to push a 28th-round pick to the majors.
</P>
<P>
   Before the 1995 season, Michael met with Spencer. ``I told him,
`You've got to start putting up numbers,''' Michael recalled. ``He
was just starting to get it together, but I don't think anyone
really looked at him like a super prospect.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael told Spencer he would return to Class A for his sixth
consecutive season; as Spencer recalled their conversation, Michael
told him it was time to ``put up or shut up.'' Spencer batted .300
with 16 home runs and 88 RBIs in 134 games. Just as important, he
had more walks (61) than strikeouts (60), an indication that he was
a disciplined hitter with a developed knowledge of the strike zone.
Spencer, a dead-pull hitter for most of his life, began driving the
ball to all fields.
</P>
<P>
   He jumped to Class AA the next year, where he hit 29 home runs
in 450 at-bats, and in 1997 Spencer slugged 30 home runs for Class
AAA Columbus, batting .241. The Yankees did not call him up in
September, which disappointed him. ``But he just said he needed to
work harder,'' said Althea Olejniczak, his mother. ``That's always
been his answer: work harder.''
</P>
<P>
   The hard work paid off as Spencer gradually pushed his way into
the sights of Yankee officials. They wanted more numbers, he gave
them more numbers. They wanted him to improve his defense, he
developed into an adequate outfielder. They wanted him to gather
experience, and Spencer went to various corners of the globe to
play winter ball _ to Hawaii, Australia, Venezuela and Arizona. He
played well in spring training.
</P>
<P>
   He began the 1998 season in Columbus, his ninth year in the
minors. Spencer had been discouraged from time to time, feeling
that his chances of ascending in the Yankee organization were hurt
by George Steinbrenner's habit of gathering veteran stars. But
Spencer never thought about quitting. ``If you see some of your
friends make it on other teams, that's what keeps you going,''
Spencer said.
</P>
<P>
   When Chili Davis injured his ankle on April 2, Yankee Manager
Joe Torre asked for the best right-handed hitter in the
organization as a replacement. He got Shane Spencer, who just loves
to play baseball.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   That love for baseball had always been there. Spencer played tee
ball and Little League, his mother recalled, and as a teen-ager
Spencer passed up family vacations to remain at home in El Cajon,
Calif., to play baseball in the summer.
</P>
<P>
   Gordy Thompson, the baseball coach at Granite Hills High School
in East San Diego, would open the batting cage during sixth period
and Spencer would be there daily, swinging, pulling balls into the
left side of the cage. Thompson eventually had to replace the left
side of the netting, and he was sure it was because Spencer had
punched holes in it with his batting practice. Thompson liked him,
and saw that other kids liked him, too.
</P>
<P>
   Spencer, his calves and thighs thickly built, was unusually
fast. That was what Schmidt first noticed about Spencer _ his
speed. He saw a short, compact swing that could develop, talked to
Spencer, and ascertained that he wanted to play pro ball. Badly.
Schmidt _ who now works for the Marlins _ turned in a favorable
report, and the Yankees took Spencer in the 28th round.
</P>
<P>
   Olejniczak, who had seen her son chase his dream for years,
watched his home run on Wednesday at her mother's home in Shirley,
Ark., and leapt to her feet screaming, ``I can't believe it!'' In a
bar in Arizona, Schmidt yelled and thrust a fist in the air,
drawing odd stares from other patrons.
</P>
<P>
   As Spencer strolled to the plate for that at-bat, Thompson sat
in his den in Santee, Calif., remembering Spencer as an
18-year-old, how hard he worked, feeling good about the young man
he had come to like and respect. When Spencer's ball disappeared
over the wall in left-center field at Yankee Stadium, his high
school baseball coach began to cry.

GIANTS KNOW JUST HOW BUCCANEERS FEEL 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By BILL PENNINGTON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ The Giants see a wounded opponent this
week in the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, and it is the last thing they
want to see.
</P>
<P>
   For the Giants, it strikes too close to home, because only a
week ago, they were the downtrodden. And since the Buccaneers are
so much like the Giants _ a young team coming off a breakthrough
season that has struggled to meet rising expectations this season _
the Giants have a sense for how the Buccaneers will react.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know what any good team does when it's getting beat on,''
Giants linebacker Jessie Armstead said. ``It punches back.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the Giants were in a position similar to the
Buccaneers': coming off a public humiliation in a Monday night
game, and facing a crossroads in their season.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants used that loss to Dallas to spur them on to their
best game so far, a 34-16 victory over San Diego last Sunday. It
salvaged a season early, before hope was lost.
</P>
<P>
   Now it is Tampa Bay's turn. Losing badly to Detroit on Monday
night, the Buccaneers could be worse off than the Giants were a
week ago. They are 1-3, and should they lose at home Sunday, they
will all but forfeit their designs on a division championship and
will face at least a few weeks of questions about whether their
10-victory season in 1997 was a fluke.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're frustrated, and beat up physically and emotionally,''
said Trent Dilfer, Tampa Bay's quarterback. ``It's a dangerous
situation we've put ourselves in, but it really doesn't matter,
because it's a must win.''
</P>
<P>
   There have been some reports of turmoil in the Buccaneers'
locker room this week in the wake of their second-half collapse to
Detroit on Monday. Losing breeds discord on most teams. It has also
been suggested that the Buccaneers thought they were better than
they are, and have played with a lack of intensity because of that
_ something that many Giant players have said about themselves in
recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think unfortunately some people were believing what was
being said about us too much,'' Dilfer said, referring to
predictions that the Buccaneers were Super Bowl contenders and the
heirs apparent to the Green Bay Packers in the National Football
Conference Central.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're still pretty confident as a team, but nobody is
fixing what we do wrong and that's frustrating,'' Dilfer said. ``We
are doing the same stupid, moronic things each week on offense, and
it's not being corrected. If we could just play like we practice,
we'd be a pretty good football team.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Like the Giants, the Buccaneers were a good rushing team a year
ago, but they have had trouble moving the football on the ground in
1998. Tampa Bay ranks 22nd in the league in rushing and 28th in
total offense, which is even lower than the Giants' No. 27 ranking
in offense.
</P>
<P>
   What Tampa Bay may need to rejuvenate them is the Giants. In
Tampa Bay's 20-8 victory at Giants Stadium last season, the
Buccaneers rumbled through the Giants' defense for 147 rushing
yards _ the second highest rushing total of any Giant opponent last
year. Warrick Dunn had 120 yards on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants, meanwhile, gained only 99 yards rushing against
Tampa Bay, the only time after the Giants' 1-3 start in 1997 that
an opponent held the Giants below 100 yards rushing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm thinking we've got to face a team that's desperate, and it
makes me nervous,'' Giants Coach Jim Fassel said after his team's
practice Friday. ``They are a well-coached team and there's a
rapport between the players and coaches. I expect them to rebound.
We did, and we had to go out to the West Coast.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're home and it'll be a hostile environment for us. I
expect their best shot.''

<P>
   Or, as Armstead said, it's Tampa Bay's turn to punch back.
</P>
<P>
   EXTRA POINTS:
</P>
<P>
   Giants linebacker Jessie Armstead (sprained ankle) practiced in
a limited fashion Friday and said he expected to play Sunday.
Safeties Sam Garnes (foot) and Tito Wooten (hamstring) also
practiced, but rookie safety Shaun Williams (hamstring) did not.
Defensive tackle Robert Harris (chest muscle strain) and linebacker
Scott Galyon (Achilles' heel soreness) are out for Sunday's game.

NOT A HAIR OUT OF PLACE IN MIAMI
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ERIC NOLAND  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The new man in charge usually wants to place his mark on the
operation, and for the Miami Dolphins, the fingerprints are
beginning to transcend the mere residue of styling mousse.
</P>
<P>
   This is beginning to resemble a Jimmy Johnson team; there's no
mistaking that. Squint a little bit and you might just see the
Dallas Cowboys, circa 1992 _ as if expectations in south Florida
aren't already running at precipitous heights.
</P>
<P>
   The Dolphins defense is comprised of guys barely old enough to
shave, and they fly around the field with the abandon of people who
haven't had a lot of encounters with pulling guards yet.
</P>
<P>
   The offense, in the land of Dan Marino, is pure heresy: a
ball-control running attack built around former UCLA star Karim
Abdul-Jabbar and an offensive line that boosted its nastiness
quotient with the addition of free-agent guard Kevin Donnalley of
the Tennessee Oilers.
</P>
<P>
   The fruit of all this? A 3-0 record, first-place positioning in
the AFC East and the No. 2-ranked defense in the NFL entering
Sunday's road game against the New York Jets.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the Dolphins, in his third season of coaching them, are
beginning to bear his distinctive stamp, Johnson didn't hesitate on
the phone this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' he said. ``Every coach has got his style and his
philosophy as far as winning games. What I want us to do is be a
well-conditioned, well-disciplined football team that runs the
ball, protects the ball and makes plays on defense.''
</P>
<P>
   It has taken three drafts, a sprinkling of free-agent signings
and a lot of retooling, but Johnson seems to be getting what he
desires.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the guy can be infuriating, a self-promoter who seems to
lead with his ego. But it's difficult to argue with his method. Or
its results.
</P>
<P>
   In '96, Johnson inherited from Don Shula a formidable team (one
coming off a playoff appearance, in fact), but also a system that
featured a complicated passing offense, a running game that
suffered from neglect, a defense in the mold of a typical AFC
softie, and a salary cap stretched to its outer limits.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson instituted swift changes, searching out those burners he
favored on defense in Dallas, simplifying the offense and easing
the payroll by relying heavily on young players who couldn't yet
command big bucks.
</P>
<P>
   ``In today's football, because of the salary cap and because of
free agency, you're forced to play younger players, you're forced
to play new players,'' Johnson said. ``You have to have a system on
both sides of the ball that is easily taught... where we can bring
a player in and he can be a rookie or a free agent and we can have
him ready to play in a short period of time.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is very concise. It is something that I am familiar with
that was successful for us in Dallas.''
</P>
<P>
   The Miami makeover has been extensive. About 80 percent of the
roster is new since Johnson took over. The average age of the
starting defense is 25.7 years, with six starters possessing three
or fewer years experience.
</P>
<P>
   To opponents who recall being swarmed under by the youthful but
supremely athletic Cowboys teams of the early '90s, it's a
hauntingly familiar development. Johnson now has sufficient depth
up front on defense so as to continually rotate seven-plus players
and keep them at peak production, much as he did at Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   After Miami's defenders shut out Pittsburgh 21-0 two weeks ago,
Steelers offensive coordinator Ray Sherman told the Ft. Lauderdale
Sun-Sentinel: ``They've got great speed, and they're more
aggressive, much more aggressive (than past Dolphins teams). But
that's Jimmy Johnson. That's him right there. This defense is a
reflection of him. They're doing all the things Jimmy wants them to
do.''
</P>
<P>
   Bob Ackles, the Dolphins' director of football operations,
worked with Johnson in Dallas, and the two have used that blueprint
in assembling Miami's roster.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not unlike any other team. Everybody is looking for big,
fast guys who can make plays,'' Ackles said. ``I guess one thing,
(Johnson) can take a guy who is undersized and will look at people
like that, whereas a lot of teams will think he can't play the
position.
</P>
<P>
   ``He likes guys who are very active, playmakers; they're bright
and they can run around.''
</P>
<P>
   A look into the background of some of the key defenders on this
Miami team reveals some of Johnson's preferred attributes.
</P>
<P>
   !arrow!!off!Second-year defensive end Jason Taylor is only 260
pounds, but he caught Steelers quarterback Kordell Stewart from
behind _ twice. While playing football at Akron, it turns out,
Taylor also lettered in basketball. Early in his football career,
he played free safety.
</P>
<P>
   !arrow!!off!Outside linebacker Derrick Rodgers, whose career at
Arizona State was delayed by a four-year hitch in the Air Force, is
listed at only 227 pounds, but his speed resulted in five sacks
last year.
</P>
<P>
   !arrow!!off!Rookie defensive end Kenny Mixon, a starter, is 273
pounds, but he ran the hurdles on his high school track team.
</P>
<P>
   The Dolphins offense appears to be lagging behind this group,
but at least the emphasis seems sound. The audibles at the line of
scrimmage have been greatly reduced, Johnson said, cutting down on
errors, and the frequency of running plays has toughened the
linemen.
</P>
<P>
   Marino is known to possess a short fuse on frustration, so he
will bear close scrutiny if the Dolphins' success with their
ground-bound approach begins to wane. At 37, though, he might find
this style better suited to him _ it certainly served Denver's John
Elway nicely last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way we're playing football right now,'' said Abdul-Jabbar,
``everybody may not get all the glamour that they want. But like
Coach always tells us, with a win, everyone is going to get some
glamour.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The other thing is,'' said Johnson, ``Dan and I both know
there are going to be some games that we want him to go out there
and throw for 300-plus yards. I don't want to see those games, but
I know they're coming.''
</P>
<P>
   Caution comes with the territory for Johnson's teams in Miami.
The Dolphins started 3-0 in his first year but finished 8-8. His
team opened 2-0 last year but went on to drop six of its final 10,
including a wild-card game at New England.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, however, says he feels he has addressed many of the
areas that led to past lapses. He cited better protection of
Marino, the improved running game and the aggressiveness of the
defense. Then he said, ``I feel better about this football team
than what I have had in the previous years.''
</P>
<P>
   Small wonder Jimmy Johnson is feeling so upbeat. The Dolphins
have begun to mirror his exact image of what a team should be.

 LEDE-COX &HT;    King family sues man allegedly involved in assassination
 &HT;    EDS: Correcting Loyd Jowers' age
 &HT;    By Arthur Brice
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- The family of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. filed
suit Friday in Memphis against a former restaurant owner who has
said publicly he was paid a large sum of money to hire an assassin.
</P>
<P>
   The civil suit against Loyd Jowers and ``other unknown
conspirators'' alleges that he was part of a plot in which a
now-dead Memphis produce dealer named Frank Liberto paid him to
find someone to kill King on April 4, 1968. The Kings are demanding
a jury trial and seeking damages.
</P>
<P>
   King's younger son, Dexter Scott King, said Friday evening that
the family filed suit ``as a way to get evidence on the record.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Most civil suits are for damages,'' King said. ``Ours is just
to get the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kings expressed their belief last year that James Earl Ray,
who pleaded guilty to the killing in 1969 but recanted within days,
had been set up by a smuggler he knew as ``Raul.'' The family tried
unsuccessfully to get a trial for Ray, who died in April while
serving a 99-year sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Jowers' attorney, Lewis Garrison, said Friday his client
expected the suit.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not happy about it, but he's not surprised,'' Garrison
said, adding that he will wage a spirited defense.
</P>
<P>
   Jowers, 71 and in ill-health, met with Dexter King twice within
the past year and detailed what he maintains was his role in the
assassination. One of those meetings included former U.N.
ambassador and Martin Luther King colleague Andrew Young.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department opened a limited inquiry in August into
Jowers' allegations and some papers that a former FBI agent said he
removed from Ray's abandoned car in Atlanta 30 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Dexter King said he hopes the family's suit will help that
probe.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt this would help to provide evidence under oath,'' King
said. ``If they decide to use this as part of the investigation,
they will have it as evidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department spokesman Myron Marlin declined to comment
Friday night on what effect the suit could have on the
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Memphis attorney Wayne Chastain, who filed the suit, also
declined to comment, referring all questions to lead attorney
William Pepper. Pepper, who lives in London, is traveling and could
not be reached.
</P>
<P>
   In 1968, Jowers owned Jim's Grill, on the ground floor of the
rooming house from which officials say Ray fired the fatal shot
from a rear second-floor bathroom window. King was stricken at 6:01
p.m. as he stood on the balcony of the Lorraine Motel, across the
street from the rear of the rooming house.
</P>
<P>
   The King family and others have contended the shot actually came
from a dense bushy area behind Jim's Grill.
</P>
<P>
   According to the suit:
</P>
<P>
   On the day of the murder, the mysterious ``Raul'' brought Jowers
the rifle. Jowers then gave the weapon to a third man. About 6
p.m., Jowers went out the restaurant's back door as instructed and
heard a shot. Within seconds, the man to whom he had given the
weapon handed him the still-smoking rifle. Jowers hid the rifle in
Jim's Grill and returned it to ``Raul'' the next morning.
</P>
<P>
   The alleged shooter is not named in the suit, but Ray's lawyers
have identified him privately as Earl Clark, a then-Memphis police
officer who died several years ago.

   Conradt is 2nd female coach in Hall of Fame
</P>
<P>
   By John Maher
</P>
<P>
   Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   AUSTIN _ Being inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame is
still pretty much a guy thing.
</P>
<P>
   Jody Conradt realized that after trying to pin down people on
exactly what she's supposed to wear to the different functions this
weekend. She's a little more meticulous about such matters than
say, Larry Bird, the headliner in the Class of 1998. Conradt, the
all-time winningest collegiate women's coach, will be inducted
tonight with Bird, Globetrotting legend Marques Haynes, Arnie Risen
and coaches Alex Hannum, Aleksandar Nikolic and Lenny Wilkens.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still in a state of disbelief,'' Conradt said from her
Bellmont Hall office, where she pulls double duty as Texas' women's
basketball coach and director of women's athletics. ``This isn't
anything I could have envisioned would happen. There's been some
changes in the Hall of Fame itself and the induction process. Women
being part of that certainly opened the door for this to happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure there are some people who feel like there should be
an asterisk by some of these categories. But, nevertheless, I don't
think anybody who loves the game of basketball doesn't dream about
the Hall of Fame and think about the people who are inducted
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Conradt joins the late Margaret Wade, former Delta State coach,
as the only women's coaches in the Hall.
</P>
<P>
   Conradt said, ``I don't see it as an individual honor. I see it
as my being representative of a group of people who got involved in
coaching women's basketball because they loved it, not because it
was the glamor job it is today. We had a small role in changing
society's perception of women's basketball.''
</P>
<P>
   Conradt says she wasn't in the first wave of pioneering coaches.
But she was in the forefront when the sport made the big jump from
being a cult sport at a few small colleges such as Delta State and
Wayland Baptist, to being the flagship women's program at major
universities. She and former Texas women's athletic director Donna
Lopiano, who'll be a part of the induction ceremony, came up with a
blueprint for building and promoting the sport that is still being
followed around the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``They built it and they built it first,'' said Chris Plonsky,
associate athletic director at Texas. ``She, Donna and Texas, they
were the first to step out and say the sport is viable,
entertaining and can actually draw fans.'' Growing up with
basketball In tiny Goldthwaite, Conradt didn't grow up watching pro
or college basketball.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't even have a television in my hometown because we
were too far away from any stations to get any kind of reception,''
she said. ``There wasn't any Little Dribblers or all the organized
sports they have today. But there was a basketball game going on in
my yard or someone else's yard all the time. Basketball was what I
loved doing. You dreamed about playing.''
</P>
<P>
   Conradt first had an inkling of how far those dreams could go
when Marie Reynolds came back to town with a touring women's
basketball team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the people who grew up in that community stayed there.
But there was a woman, and it was like she had made the big time.
She wasn't a redhead, but she was a good basketball player,''
Conradt said.
</P>
<P>
   The All-American Redheads were something straight out of the
barnstorming days of sports but they were the pinnacle of women's
basketball back then. The college game, as we now know it, didn't
exist for women.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought there was only one place that you could go to
college and play basketball and that was Wayland Baptist,'' Conradt
said. ``They were giving scholarships at that time. They were
having a series of tryouts where they might invite 400 or 500 girls
from across the state of Texas. I did not do that. I probably
thought I wasn't good enough. They were almost like the
Globetrotters. They didn't ever lose.''
</P>
<P>
   Conradt, a 40-point-per-game scorer at Goldthwaite High School,
wanted to continue playing at Baylor. She inquired about getting on
an intramural team. Instead, she was signed up for the extra-mural
team, which was what the school had instead of a varsity squad. The
catch for Conradt was that those players had to major in physical
education.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was intending to major in history and thought I wanted to
teach because that's the only thing I saw women doing in my
hometown,'' Conradt said. ``If they had a college degree, they were
teachers. I didn't think you could get a job with a degree in phys
ed.''
</P>
<P>
   She did, with the Houston ISD, after graduating from Baylor. She
later got into coaching and landed her first head coaching job at
Sam Houston, where she coached volleyball, basketball and track and
also taught seven activities. The next stop was the University of
Texas-Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lure there was that I didn't have to teach,'' Conradt
said. ``I stayed there until Donna called.'' Building support at UT
At Texas the brash Lopiano was trying to put together the premier
women's sports program in the country, even if she had to do it
with baling wire. ``It couldn't have happened here the way it
happened without Donna and Donna's influence and her vision,''
Conradt said. ``There's no doubt she was the right person at the
right time for the University of Texas. There were probably a lot
of people who didn't believe that to be true initially. She had
ideas by the dozens. A lot of them never got out of this room. And
that's a very good thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to remind her that the kazoo band playing the Eyes of
Texas was not going to fly here. She tried it because at that time
nobody would have given any serious thought to asking the Longhorn
band to come to a women's event.''
</P>
<P>
   Conradt acknowledges, ``We didn't think the game itself was
going to be a sufficient draw. We planned all these satellite
events around the game to try to build interest and that worked.
The most notable was the Fastbreak Club. That was the hook to build
fan interest. It would have been hard to let the game stand alone.
We were fighting the myth that women can't play. You almost had to
build an awareness that it's important to these women that you come
and watch. That's when we started to attract people who didn't even
really care about basketball, but they thought it was important
that women be supported in non-traditional roles. Barbara Jordan
didn't know a thing about basketball initially, and probably didn't
care that much about it, but I think she understood the social
significance of showing support.''
</P>
<P>
   Once people were in the door, they were entertained. In the
early and mid 1980s Conradt had assembled a huge pool of talent and
her players pressed and ran the fast break almost non-stop. Oddly
enough, the program had its breakthrough day at the very moment the
storied Texas football program was beginning its downward spiral.
While the football team lost a Cotton Bowl, and a possible national
championship on January 2, 1984, Conradt's team beat a No.1
Southern Cal team in a heavily promoted and well-attended game.
</P>
<P>
   In 1986 everything came together in the perfect season that
ended with another win over Cheryl Miller and Southern Cal in the
NCAA championship game. In 1987 came another milestone _ a sellout
for the women's Final Four in Austin.
</P>
<P>
   And now, Conradt will be inducted into the Basketball Hall of
Fame, not just for what she has accomplished at Texas, but what she
did for the women's game.

 &HT;    Blaney surprises field with first pole
 &HT;    By Tom McCollister
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLOTTE, N.C. _ Qualifying at Charlotte Motor Speedway took
another strange twist Thursday as former sprint-car champion Dave
Blaney won the pole for Saturday's Busch Grand National All-Pro
Bumper to Bumper 300.
</P>
<P>
   Blaney stunned fans, his opponents and himself with a lap of
177.247 mph in winning the first pole of his career, just as
Derrike Cope did Wednesday night in taking the pole for Sunday's
UAW-GM Quality 500.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think we had enough for the pole,'' said Blaney, a
26-year-old in his first year on the Busch circuit. ``This is a new
time, and it took a while to get everybody going. In that run at
the pole, I drove harder than in practice. This has been a bigger
struggle than I thought it would be.''
</P>
<P>
   It came against some tough competition.
</P>
<P>
   Matt Kenseth was second fastest at 176.887 mph. Mike McLaughlin
(176.373), Dick Trickle, (176.373) and Dale Earnhardt Jr. (175.393)
round out the top five.
</P>
<P>
   Blaney was the 22nd pole winner of the season, a record in the
series, and he's the 10th first-time winner this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were fast all day and were lucky to get some clouds there,
too,'' Blaney said. ``It's been a tough go, but this team and our
sponsors never have given up on me. We've had great cars and we'll
keep building on what we have.''
</P>
<P>
   Second-round qualifying
</P>
<P>
   Trickle led second-round Winston Cup qualifying with a lap of
177.795 mph and improved six positions, from 41st to 35th. ``We
just stayed with it. That's what you have to do in this
situation,'' said Trickle, who has made the field in every race
this season. Jeff Gordon, who did not qualify Wednesday, sat on his
time and will run from the 26th spot.
</P>
<P>
   Going home
</P>
<P>
   Those who didn't make the 43-car lineup for Sunday were Jeff
Green, Tony Raines, Andy Hillenberg, Dave Marcis and Randy
McDonald. Marcis has failed to qualify in 17 races, including five
of the last eight. He had no provisionals.
</P>
<P>
   Provisional lineup
</P>
<P>
   Winston Cup provisionals went to Steve Park (37th), Rick Mast
(38th), Johnny Benson (39), Geoff Bodine (40th), Rich Bickle
(45th), Robert Pressley (46th). Darrell Waltrip took the past
champion's provisional.
</P>
<P>
   A Petty thing
</P>
<P>
   As Adam Petty grew close to victory in Wednesday night's ARCA
Easy Care 300, dad Kyle Petty was nowhere to be seen. He escaped to
his Winston Cup hauler, a little nervous as expected. But when the
18-year-old reached victory lane, the Petty clan was there to cheer
the fourth-generation driver. ``It's been my dream,'' Adam said,
``since I was a little kid to come here and race where my dad raced
and proved himself. This is awesome.''

 &HT;    Love, Leonard enjoy Winged Foot reunion
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PINE MOUNTAIN _ It wasn't quite the same. They played the Winged
Foot Golf Club's East Course, not the West Course that hosted the
1997 PGA Championship in Mamaroneck, N.Y., and provided the setting
for Davis Love III's first major championship. There was no
rainbow. The skies were clear blue and the temperature a
comfortable 72 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   The outcome also turned out differently as Love and Justin
Leonard, who battled head-to-head on the final day in the 1997 PGA,
Tuesday played a match that will be aired Oct. 21 on ``Shell's
Wonderful World of Golf.'' After struggling with some early bogeys,
the two players eventually settled down, tied with 1-over-par 71s
and split the purse of $150,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``No blood,'' Love said Thursday. ``We remained friends.''
</P>
<P>
   Love defeated Leonard by five shots in the PGA at Winged Foot.
The East Course was used for the Shell match, the club said, to
give the less-publicized coursesome national attention.
</P>
<P>
   Getting antsy
</P>
<P>
   Defending champion Love gave Leonard a ride from New York to
Columbus on his jet Wednesday night, setting up a strange trip with
tournament officials in the transportation van. For some reason
there's been an ant problem in many vehicles at Callaway Gardens,
and when the two players entered the van, it was crawling with
them. Love, who is allergic to many insect bites, was extremely
nervous, fearing they might be fire ants.
</P>
<P>
   The transportation officials stopped on the way to Callaway
Gardens for some bug spray and fumigated the vehicle. Asked after
his 5-under-par 67 Thursday if he found any ants in his golf bag
during the round, Leonard said, ``No, I think I got through
ant-free.''
</P>
<P>
   Andrade, Faxon co-hosts
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of a controversial end to the PGA Tour CVS Charity
Classic in Pleasant Valley, Mass., a new event has been created for
next Aug. 1-3 at Rhode Island Country Club, also to be called the
CVS Charity Classic and co-hosted by native Rhode Islanders Billy
Andrade of Atlanta and Brad Faxon. The purse will be $1 million
with 24 players from the PGA Tour, Senior PGA Tour and
international tours participating.
</P>
<P>
   Kuchar receives Haskins
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Tech junior Matt Kuchar received his Fred Haskins Award
Thursday night at the Callaway Gardens Inn, honored as the nation's
outstanding collegiate player for 1998. Kuchar, 20, a native of
Lake Mary, Fla., is playing in the Buick Challenge on a sponsor's
exemption. He's the third Tech player to win the Haskins Award in
the last six years, following David Duval in 1993 and Stewart Cink
in 1995. ... Paul Azinger withdrew Thursday because of tendinitis.

</P>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Patrons in McDonald's across the street from Fenway
Park were stunned Thursday afternoon when Boston Red Sox manager
Jimy Williams walked up to the counter and said, ``Double
cheeseburger, diet drink.''
</P>
<P>
   Not many major-league managers answer the question, ``Did
somebody say McDonald's?'' And they don't stop in less than 24
hours before their team plays Game 3 of the American League
Division Series against the Cleveland Indians.
</P>
<P>
   And then Cleveland pitcher Charles Nagy drops into the media
interview room, looking as if he'd rather be on the other side of
the McDonald's counter asking Williams, ``You want fries with
that?''
</P>
<P>
   Nagy is the introvert's introvert. He answered questions softly,
refused to make eye contact . . . and his demeanor made one wonder,
``Is this the guy Cleveland wants on the mound in Fenway Park today
when it is trying to avoid falling behind two games to one?
</P>
<P>
   Don't be fooled. To the Boston Red Sox, Charles Nagy is as
deadly as Charles Manson. For his career, Nagy is 6-1 with a 2.54
earned-run average against Boston. And his only postseason win for
the Tribe was in Fenway Park in the 1995 Division Series.
</P>
<P>
   And he was 1-0 with a 2.35 ERA in two starts against the Red Sox
this year.
</P>
<P>
   But since 1995, Nagy is 0-3 in seven starts with a 6.17 earned
run average in postseason assignments. Manager Mike Hargrove
skipped him for Game 7 of the World Series in Miami last year in
favor of Jaret Wright. Nagy still lost . . . in relief in the 11th
inning.
</P>
<P>
   During this season, Nagy gave up 34 home runs, third most in the
American League and allowed 139 runs, most by any AL pitcher.
Hitters batted .298 against him and, incredibly, right-handed
hitters batted .322.
</P>
<P>
   So how did the 31-year-old right-hander win 15 games this year?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it was the blond hair. Twice this season he bleached his
hair and gave no explanation, other than to perhaps change his
luck, which ran real bad early in the season. He had a stretch of
eight games where he lost four times and had four no decisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something happened, couple of small things,'' he said. ``I
can't explain it. I fell into some bad habits and dug a big hole
for myself.''
</P>
<P>
   As Hargrove explained it, ``Nagy fell into some bad habits and
it took a half a year to find it. It was so subtle. We even
compared tapes side-by-side and finally (pitching coach) Mark Wiley
found something very small and it worked.''
</P>
<P>
   Nagy seems to be a guy always looking for a comfort zone and
what he said about his success against the Red Sox lends credence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can't explain it, other than Fenway is a great atmosphere,
Boston has great fans, there is a nice mound out there and I grew
up in New England and it feels like home,'' he said. He grew up in
Fairfield, Conn., nearly three hours from Boston and only 45
minutes from New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why I grew up a Yankee fan,'' he said. ``But unlike
most Yankee fans, I don't hate the Boston Red Sox. I don't dislike
the Red Sox. I don't dislike anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't even dislike Boston slugger/first baseman Mo Vaughn.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've pitched to Mo all my life _ little league, pony league,
high school, college (Nagy attended the University of Connecticut
and Vaughn attended Seton Hall),'' Nagy said. ``And he has hit home
runs off me every step of the way.''
</P>
<P>
   Nagy said Fenway's smallness, with the Green Monster lurking
over the pitcher's right shoulder, doesn't faze him, ``Because
nearly every ballpark is like this nowadays. The big thing I do is
walk off the mound with my head down because there always seems to
be somebody on top of the dugout screaming at you.''
</P>
<P>
   Nagy, though, has a double whammy to overcome this afternoon.
Before the game starts, Lynn Saberhagen, wife of opposing pitcher
Bret Saberhagen, will sing the national anthem.
</P>
<P>
   She sang it on Opening Day, then the Red Sox trailed the Seattle
Mariners, 7-2, going into the ninth inning. The first seven Boston
batters scored, the last four on Vaughn's grand slam home run in a
9-7 Red Sox miracle.
</P>
<P>
   There haven't been many miracles in Boston. Ask Bill Buckner. In
fact, today marks the 20th anniversary of the home run New York's
Bucky Dent hit off Boston's Mike Torrez in Fenway, a game-winner
during a one-game playoff for the American League East
championship.
</P>
<P>
   Ah, the ghosts.

 &HT;    Blaney's pole at end of hard road
 &HT;    By Tom McCollister
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CONCORD, N.C. _ Until Dave Blaney surprised even himself and won
the pole for today's All Pro Bumper to Bumper 300, he was more
noted for his sprint car prowess than speeding along the high banks
and flat tracks of NASCAR's Busch Grand National circuit.
</P>
<P>
   The 26-year-old rookie started slowly. When he qualified well,
he couldn't follow it up. Early finishes of 35th, 42nd, 34th, 37th,
43rd and 33rd were the results of wrecks, not all his.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew coming in it was going to be hard to go from sprint
cars to stocks,'' he said. ``I can honestly say it was harder than
I thought it was going to be. There's so much to learn, along with
all new race tracks and all new cars.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Busch series is so competitive and so close that if you're
a little bit off, you're way down the list. I couldn't be in a
better spot than with Amaco and (team owner) Bill Davis. They knew
it was going to take a while and they were willing to learn with
me. I'm more happy for them to pay them off a little bit for
sticking with me.''
</P>
<P>
   Practically speaking, he couldn't be better off. Davis is a
patient man, dedicated to racing and liked by all. For example,
when Blaney failed to qualify at Michigan in mid-August, he
wondered if he was capable of carrying on. No problem. Crew chief
Gil Martin gave him a pat on the pack and told Blaney, ``We'll get
'em next time.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's pole was payback.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still pretty excited about it,'' he said. ``I watched
those guys qualify and knew I had to step it up if I was going to
have a chance. When Matt (Kenseth) ran (30.52), I thought 'No way
anybody can beat that.' When they told me on the radio what it was,
I was amazed.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can say all you want about keeping your confidence, but
you lose it when you struggle. You doubt yourself and there's no
way around that.
</P>
<P>
   The way things have been going for us here, every week we've
been qualifying better and racing better. It's got everybody pumped
up.''
</P>
<P>
   Blaney has been close before. He qualified seventh at Talladega
in April, but lasted only 22 laps, then in mid-September started
seventh and finished 12 on the lead lap.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal Saturday is to stay in the lead lap all day, stay in
the hunt, and a top 10 finish for us is going to be a successful
day, no matter where it's at in the top 10.

OXFORD TO DROP COVERAGE FOR 26,000 IN MEDICARE HMOS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.J., Conn., Pa.)  (lb) 
 By MILT FREUDENHEIM   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Oxford Health Plans, one of the biggest managed-care companies
in the Northeast, said Friday that it was dropping coverage for
more than 26,000 elderly members of its Medicare health-maintenance
organizations in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut. The
cancellations, mainly in five suburban counties north of New York
City, take effect on Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
   The action by Oxford, together with similar recent announcements
by three other big insurance companies, brings the number of
consumers in the three states due to lose Medicare HMO coverage by
the end of the year to 35,000. It raises the national total to
about 250,000, or about 4 percent of the 6.6 million people now
enrolled in Medicare HMOs.
</P>
<P>
   The government pays most of the costs of health care for
Medicare HMO members; the amount per member varies widely from
county to county. Managed-care companies like Oxford have attracted
members by offering extras that Medicare does not cover, typically
including coverage for prescription drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The managed-care companies have been jolted by high expenses for
elderly people, who often need more intense care than younger
people who had been the mainstay of HMOs. Oxford, based in Norwalk,
Conn., has said it was losing money in its Medicare business.
</P>
<P>
   Oxford is dropping 26,601, or 17 percent, of the 155,600
Medicare beneficiaries in its health plans. At its peak last year,
Oxford had a total of more than 2 million members, mainly people
younger than 65, the age at which Medicare becomes available.
</P>
<P>
   The company said it would retain Medicare health plans that
cover 107,412 people in New York City and Long Island and 19,981 in
northern New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   In New York it will close HMOs serving 19,370 people in
Westchester, Rockland, Orange and Putnam counties. It will also
close HMOs with 5,006 customers in Fairfield County, Conn., and the
rest of Connecticut except for New Haven County. In New Jersey it
is leaving Sussex County and seven counties in the southern and
central parts of the state; it is also leaving five counties in
southeastern Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   Other companies that have announced they are dropping Medicare
HMO members in the three states include Prudential Health Care (930
members in New York and 3,300 in New Jersey); United Healthcare
Corp. (1,821 in New York and 2,599 in New Jersey) and Aetna U.S.
Healthcare (930 in New York).
</P>
<P>
   Friday was the deadline for managed-care companies to notify
federal officials of any operations that the HMOs wished to close.
</P>
<P>
   The companies have to notify their members of the withdrawal of
service at least 60 days in advance. The letters, which must be
sent by Nov. 2 in order to close by Jan. 1, must list nearby
Medicare HMOs and companies that will sell supplementary insurance,
called Medigap policies.
</P>
<P>
   If customers do not transfer to another HMO, those being dropped
will automatically receive traditional Medicare coverage.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Oxford has been under surveillance by state and federal
officials since it revealed big financial losses last year. Dr.
Norman Payson, chief executive of Oxford, said Friday that the
Health Care Financing Agency, which regulates Medicare, had found
``substantial improvements in our core operations.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials of a number of other large managed-care companies said
Friday that they intended to continue all their HMOs in the three
states. They included Empire Blue Cross and Blue Shield, Horizon
Blue Cross and Blue Shield of New Jersey, HIP (the trademark of the
Health Insurance Plan of Greater New York), and NYLCare, which is
merging with Aetna Inc. An official of Kaiser Permanente also said
recently that his company would not drop any Medicare consumers.

MASTERMIND OF SCHOOL CHEATING SCHEME IS SENTENCED 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)  (lb) 
 By BENJAMIN WEISER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A California man who pleaded guilty to charges that
he organized an ingenious nationwide scheme to sell answers to
graduate school admission tests was sentenced Friday, in U.S.
District Court in lower Manhattan, to four years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   The man, Po Chieng Ma, wept in court as he apologized to Judge
John Martin Jr., calling his own actions a disgrace and vowing
never again to violate the law. ``I'm very sorry for what I did,''
Ma said. ``I feel that during the rest of my life I'll never do
anything illegal.''
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors had said that 788 customers each paid up to $9,000
to buy answers to the Graduate Management Administration Test, the
Graduate Record Examinations and the Test of English as a Foreign
Language.
</P>
<P>
   In the scheme, people were paid to take the multiple-choice
tests in Manhattan and then call California, where the same tests
were to be given, with the answers.
</P>
<P>
   Those answers were passed on to Ma and his associates, who,
taking advantage of the three-hour time difference, carved the
answers in code on the sides of pencils, which were given to the
customers. The service was guaranteed, Ma told the judge last
January when he pleaded guilty. ``People don't pay me until they
are satisfied,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ma, 46, had pleaded guilty to two counts of conspiracy, one
count of obstruction of justice and one of bail jumping, which
stemmed from his fleeing the courthouse before a hearing in January
at which he was to enter a plea. ``I was so frightened, so I ran
away,'' he told the judge after he was rearrested as he tried to
enter Canada from Vermont.
</P>
<P>
   Under his plea agreement, Ma and the government had agreed on a
term of five to six years. But Martin said he would impose a lesser
term because Ma seemed genuine in his remorse.
</P>
<P>
   But prosecutors and officials of the Educational Testing Service
in Princeton, N.J., which administers the tests, say that the
effect of the scheme is still felt.
</P>
<P>
   Calling the fraud serious and widespread, an assistant U.S.
attorney, Mark Godsey, wrote that there were many victims,
including the testing service, universities and the students who
lost places in school because those who cheated were admitted
instead.
</P>
<P>
   Martin ordered the government on Friday to turn over its
investigative files to the testing service, which will continue to
seek to identify students who may have cheated.
</P>
<P>
   Patricia Taylor, associate general counsel of the service, said
her organization has been notifying students and universities when
it finds such cases, and that institutions have the right to revoke
the degrees of such students who have graduated.
</P>
<P>
   After the hearing, Ma's lawyer, Allan Haber, said that because
the case involved such widely recognized tests, what might have
been a run-of-the-mill fraud case was ``blown out of proportion.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The implications were more vast than the actual damages,''
Haber said. ``Everyone's child takes the SATs to get into college,
and people are very offended by the idea that someone could
circumvent the process, get in and be undeserving. There's a moral
piece to this that is larger than the crime.''
