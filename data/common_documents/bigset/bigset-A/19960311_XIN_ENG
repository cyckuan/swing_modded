<HEADLINE> Mubarak: Anti-Terrorism Summit Aims to Push Forward Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
said today upon arrival at the Red Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheikh
that Wednesday's anti-terrorism summit aims at pushing forward the
peace process and ensuring that it continues.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters that the summit, co-hosted by Egypt and the
United States, will discuss how to move the Middle East peace
process ahead... in the shadow of the terrorist operations, which
are blocking it.
</P>
<P>
According to the official Middle East News Agency, Mubarak also
said he hopes that the Sharm el-Sheikh summit will reach definite
conclusions. Otherwise, he said, the peace process will be
deadlocked.
</P>
<P>
The one-day summit, to be attended by some 30 world leaders and
U.N. Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali, was hurriedly
arranged in the wake of the recent four suicide bombing attacks by
the Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas), which claimed 58 innocent
lives in Israel.
</P>
<P>
Besides the United States and Russia, participating countries
include Israel, Jordan, Egypt and the Palestinians and most Gulf
nations, several North African countries. Officials from Europe,
Canada and Japan will also attend the meeting.
</P>
<P>
But Iraq, Iran and Libya, which are strongly opposed to the
peace process, are not to attend the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon today announced that it will not attend the summit, and
Syria also is expected to boycott.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa's Former Defense Minister Pleads Not Guilty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 11 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's former
defense minister Magnus Malan and his 19 co-accused today pleaded
not guilty in the Durban Supreme Court to all charges against
them.
</P>
<P>
Malan and his co-accused faced 13 counts of murder arising
from the massacre of 13 people in Kwazulu/Natal Province in 1987
and charges of conspiracy to murder members of political
organizations in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
Today's court appearance was the continuation of a one-week
postponement of the Malan's murder trial after the accused
appeared in court on March 4.
</P>
<P>
However, in his opening address, State Prosecutor and
Kwazulu/Natal Attorney-General Tim Mcnally said Inkatha Freedom
Party (IFP) leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi might be called to
testify in the trial.
</P>
<P>
According to the indictment of the court, Buthelezi was
allegedly involved in the establishment of 200-member IFP
military unit that received training from the then South African
military. The group allegedly carried out the 1987 attack on the
house of anti-apartheid activist Victor Ntuli that killed 13 of
Ntuli's friends and relatives.
</P>
<P>
It is reported the Malan's case is the first "super trial" of
the post-apartheid era. The former defense minister and his top
generals have been the most senior officials charged with
political crimes under apartheid so far.
</P>
<P>
Malan's murder trial aroused wild reaction from South Africa's
rightwing groups which described the trial of former government
officials as a witch-hunting.

<HEADLINE> E. African Co-operation To Take Off On Thursday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ARUSHA (TANZANIA), March 11 (Xinhua) -- The East African
Co-operation (EAC) will be launched in the Arusha International
Conference Center on March 14.
</P>
<P>
The whole of the fifth floor of the conference center's
Kilimanjaro wing has been rented out to EAC.
</P>
<P>
The three-wing complex was built less than 20 years ago to
house the East African Community which disintegrated in 1977.
</P>
<P>
The launching of the co-operation secretariat by the three
East African heads of state will be preceded by a three-day
meeting of civil servants and ministers from Tanzania, Kenya and
Uganda.
</P>
<P>
Principal Secretaries from the three countries' ministries
concerned have started a closed-door meeting here, finalizing
documents and preparing programs for the ministers' meeting and
the summit.
</P>
<P>
Tanzanian President Benjamin Mkapa, Kenyan President Daniel
Arap moi, and Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni are expected to
attend a summit in Arusha during which the regional co-opeation
will be launched.
</P>
<P>
A technical team was here mid-February to negotiate lease of
the offices and to inspect houses in Arusha Municipality that may
be rented to staff members of the EAC secretariat.
</P>
<P>
Most Arushans who were interviewed welcome the revival of the
East African Co-operation and the decision to put its secratariat
in Arusha again, as they believe it will be good for the
development of the three countries' economy and revitalizatin of
Arusha's economy in particular.
</P>
<P>
"We are going to become a focal point from the region and this
will attract businesses here," said Mr. Edwin Shatto, the
Secretary of the Arusha Chamber of Commerce, Industires and
Agriculture.

<HEADLINE> London to Lead in UK Economic Upturn in 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Greater London is expected to be
Britain's fastest growing regional economy this year, but to
underperform the national average next year, said an analysis by
Cambridge Econometrics, an independent research group.
</P>
<P>
The Cambridge report, which assessed regional growth prospects
into the next century, said today that the London economy has
shown a remarkably strong performance over the past two years.
</P>
<P>
Although most of the impetus has come from financial and
business services, which account for more than a quarter of all
employment in London, the region has outperformed even in areas of
traditional weakness, such as manufacturing.
</P>
<P>
Cambridge Econometrics predicted that the London economy will
expand by 2.7 percent this year compared with a national average
of 2.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
The capital's growth rate is forecast to rise to 2.8 percent
next year, while growth across the country as a whole moves up to
2.9 percent. This would relegate London from top place among the
12 regions of the UK to seventh.
</P>
<P>
The report expected growth to be distributed more evenly
throughout the country next year as consumer spending increases in
response to further tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
The biggest improvements are expected in the rest of the South
East and in the West Midlands, which has a great concentration of
heavy manufacturing and is likely to benefit from the combined
impact of rising consumption and higher levels of industrial
investment.

<HEADLINE> ICRC Urges Chechen Warring Parties to Respect  Humanitarian Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, March 11 (Xinhua) -- The International Committee of the
Red Cross (ICRC) today urged the Chechen warring parties of
Russian government troops and the rebels to respect humanitarian
law during fightings.
</P>
<P>
"The Geneva Convention should be observed" by the conflicting
parties, said Jean-Marc Bornet, ICRC chief representative for
Eastern Europe and Central Asia, who is back from a mission to the
North Caucasus region.
</P>
<P>
He expressed at a press briefing this afternoon the ICRC's
concern over the lack of respect of conflicting parties during
fightings to the humanitarian truce for evacuation of victims.
</P>
<P>
The humanitarian organization was also concerned about the many
restrictions or difficulties it faced in carrying out work due to
security reasons as a result of not only the war situation there,
but also the activities of bandists, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to the ICRC official, the ICRC had asked for a
humanitarian cease-fire for several hours during fightings so that
it could evacuate the wounded out of the battlefield, however it
had received no response so far yet.
</P>
<P>
The ICRC had had many talks with both parties of the fighting,
which were "positive," but the results were usually "negative," he
said. Many difficulties still existed in ICRC operations, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the ICRC has 15 personnel in Chechenya and 27 others
in the neighboring republics. According to Bornet, like many other
humanitarian organizations working in that region, ICRC staff had
also been attacked and sometimes taken hostages for hours.
</P>
<P>
On the situation in Chechenya, Bornet also reported an
estimated half a million people were left internally displaced
since the war in the rebelling republic of Russia began in 1994.
</P>
<P>
No estimates of casualties are so far available. Hundreds had
been wounded since a fresh military offensive was launched two
weeks ago, he added.
</P>
<P>
According to the ICRC official, the ICRC had been delivering
medical supplies to the 20 medical centers in the southern part of
Chechenya, as well as to hospitals in Grozny when the
organization's entry was allowed.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the ICRC has been providing water for the
population in Grozny, where many fresh water facilities were
destroyed during fightings and drinking water poses a major
problem in the city.

<HEADLINE> Arms Decommissioning Must Top Talks Agenda: Trimble </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) leader
David Trimble said in Dublin today that arms decommissioning by
the Irish Republican Army (IRA) must top the agenda of all-party
talks on the future of Northern Ireland to be held on June 10.
</P>
<P>
Trimble and his UUP delegation are to have "historic talks," as
described by Irish Prime Minister John Bruton, with leaders of the
Irish government on the Ulster peace process tonight.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Irish Radio, Trimble urged the Irish and
British governments to legislate for a "verification commission"
as suggested by the international panel of overseeing the arms
decommissioning process headed by former U.S. senator George
Mitchell.
</P>
<P>
The UUP leader said London's plans for the IRA's arms handover
were already under way and Dublin should match London's concern
over arms decommissioning.
</P>
<P>
Trimble said he did not believe the IRA would restore its
cease-fire before the all-party negotiations.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that it was not enough for the IRA merely to
restore its cease-fire. "What we want is for the IRA to declare an
end to violence, and mean it for good," he said.
</P>
<P>
Otherwise, there would be a "significant delay" before the
all-party talks, he added.
</P>
<P>
The meeting between the UUP delegation and leaders of the Irish
government will be the first full-scale session between the two
sides since the seven-month abortive talks in 1992.

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's exports rose to
5.055 billion US dollars in the first eight months of the current
fiscal year beginning last July, Secretary of Commerce Sulman
Faruqui said here today.
</P>
<P>
He told the press that the exports went up by 109 million US
dollars from as compared with the same period of the previous
fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
In February, total exports stood at 716 million US dollars, an
increase of 119 million US dollars over a year earlier, he said.
</P>
<P>
The substantial growth in February offsets the export losses in
the first six months of the current fiscal year, he added.
</P>
<P>
The declining trend in exports began to reverse in December
when the Pakistani government initiated various concrete measures
to boost the exports, he said.
</P>
<P>
The official attributed the improved export performance to
trade fairs, access to non-quota markets and increases in exports
of surgical items.

<HEADLINE> Workshop On Land Tenure Policy Opens In Addis Ababa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Addis Ababa, March 11 (Xinhua) -- A senior official in charge
of natural resources in the Economic Commission for Africa (ECA)
today called for the formulation of policies to enable women to
have control of land.
</P>
<P>
Yuri Pashkov, officer-in- charge of the ECA's Natural
Resources Division, said: " In most countries in Africa, women
have no right to owe or inherit land. This issue was addressed
during the fourth World Conference on Women which recommended
that policies should be formulated to enable women to have
control of land."
</P>
<P>
Pashkov made the remarks when he, on behalf of ECA
secretariat, opened the Workshop on Land Tenure Issues in Natural
Resources Management for the Inter-Governmental Authority on
Drought and Development (IGADD) Region at A the Africa Hall here.
</P>
<P>
Pashkov noted that productive land is becoming scarce in many
parts of africa, and population increase is not being matched by
a corresponding growth in industry or other service activity.
</P>
<P>
"So there is bound to be increasing competition for productive
land," he said, adding that "When competition for land increases,
a tendency towards the individualization of land will normally
develop."
</P>
<P>
This situation is specially critical in areas around rapidly
growing cities, but is more and more becoming a widespread
problem in africa, where agriculture is carried out on a small
scale by the rural poor, Pashkow said.

<HEADLINE> ESCAP Forum on City Life Opens in Thailand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 11 (Xinhua) -- The second Asia-Pacific Urban
Forum met here today under the sponsorship of the United Nations
Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) to
discuss living conditions in the region's cities.
</P>
<P>
Policy-makers, representatives from national and city
governments, non-governmental organizations, the private sector
and research institutions from Asian-Pacific countries are
attending the week-long meeting.
</P>
<P>
A paper to be adopted at the meeting will be presented to the
UN Conference on Human Settlements, which will take place in
Istanbul, Turkey, on June 3-14, as the Asia and Pacific regional
input to the conference.
</P>
<P>
Opening the forum today, ESCAP's Deputy Executive Secretary
Seiko Takahashi said the region is confronted by "a metamorphosis
rarely seen in human history."
</P>
<P>
She was referring to the anticipated "urban transition" by the
year 2020, when the population of the Asia-Pacific region is
expected to become predominantly urban against the backdrop of
rapid economic growth, the fastest, most massive population growth
in history, and increasingly severe environmental impacts.
</P>
<P>
Saying conventional methods failed to address the real
problems, the UN official called for a rediscovery of the cities
as "places where people live, work and anchor their lives" rather
than only as "economic engines or physical monuments to wealth and
development."

<HEADLINE> Liffe Considers Contract Changes in Run-up to EMU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 11 (Xinhua) -- The London International Financial
Futures and Options Exchange (Liffe) is considering a modification
of its short-term money market contracts as part of its
preparations for the European Monetary Union (EMU).
</P>
<P>
The Financial Times reported today that a full board meeting of
the exchange will assess Monday afternoon the technical and legal
issues arising from the timetable for the move to a single
currency, the euro, scheduled to take place in January 1999.
</P>
<P>
It will also consider a number of possible changes to two of
its leading contracts: the euromark and short sterling futures.
</P>
<P>
Liffe lists a range of financial futures and options contracts
denominated in currencies which may disappear following the
introduction of the single currency.
</P>
<P>
But a decision is particularly urgent in the case of these two
contracts as the exchange lists 12 future monthly maturities,
covering a three-year period in all.
</P>
<P>
New short sterling and euromark contracts due to be listed
Tuesday next week could mature after the scheduled introduction of
the euro and officials wish to be rid of any uncertainty.
</P>
<P>
Several options are under consideration:
</P>
<P>
The market may list two identical three-month futures
contracts, denominated in the euro, but convertible into either
Sterling or D-Marks if the monetary union is either delayed or
abandoned.
</P>
<P>
Another possibility would be to add an unprecedented
conditional clause to existing short sterling and euromark
contracts, stipulating that they will be settled by reference to
the future rate at which Sterling and the D-Mark will be exchanged
for the euro, if it is introduced according to the current
schedule.
</P>
<P>
Alternatively Liffe may develop contracts combining these
possibilities.
</P>
<P>
John Foyle, deputy chief executive of Liffe, insisted the
market would give "users the widest choice of products, while
ensuring that all possibilities (relating to the different
scenarios for the EMU) are covered."
</P>
<P>
Liffe executives believe the market's ability to manage the
transition to the single currency will be an important factor in
maintaining London as the biggest center for money market
operations in Europe.

<HEADLINE> Letter to UN Chief on Refugee Issue Signed in Nepal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Participants in a non-
governmental forum today signed a letter to be sent to UN
Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali urging him to personally
take up the issue of Bhutanese refugees in Nepal.
</P>
<P>
The letter appealed for free repatriation of more than 100,000
Bhutanese refugees, mostly of Nepalese origin, who have been
living in Nepal for six years.
</P>
<P>
It also called for protection of Bhutanese refugees living in
India especially in view of a proposed extradition agreement
between India and Bhutan.
</P>
<P>
The letter was signed by 68 delegates from 15 countries. Some
300 representatives from nearly 50 countries attended the
Conference of the People's Plan for the 21st Century that ended in
Kathmandu today.
</P>
<P>
King of Bhutan Jigme Singhe Wangchuk said when he visited India
last week that 99 percent of the refugees in Nepal were not
Bhutanese nationals.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, six rounds of bilateral talks between Nepal and Bhutan
at the home ministerial level failed to solve the refugee problem
as the two sides could not agree on the classification of the
refugees.
</P>
<P>
Bhutan only agreed to repatriate those whom it recognized as
genuine Bhutanese citizens.
</P>
<P>
The next round of Nepal-Bhutan talks on the refugee issue is
expected to begin next month at the foreign ministers' level.

<HEADLINE> Peres: Anti-Terrorism Meeting Aims at Tangible Results </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Shimon
Peres said here today that the purpose of the international
conference on terrorism to be held in the Egyptian Red Sea resort
of Sharm el Sheikh is to achieve both "tangible" and "symbolic"
results.
</P>
<P>
"This (the meeting) is a very powerful declaration on the part
of the civilized world, including the unprecedented participation
of the Middle East and the Arab world, to deliver a message that
will not permit terror to kill peace, that terror can kill a
person, but it can not and will never kill an idea," said Peres.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the Labor Party caucus in the Knesset (Israel's
parliament), Peres also said that the meeting will deal with
"tangible problems" such as flow of funds, weapons and equipments
from abroad to terrorist organizations in Lebanon and the Gaza
Strip.
</P>
<P>
He called on some countries to stop providing "shelters and
havens" to terrorists.
</P>
<P>
Representatives from 31 countries are expected to attend the
one-day meeting which will take place Wednesday, including
U.S. President Bill Clinton and Russian President Boris Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
The meeting comes following the recent wave of Hamas suicide
bombing attacks in Israel which killed 58 innocent people within
two weeks.
</P>
<P>
Peres also lashed out at opposition parties which describe the
government's fight against terror is a political matter.
</P>
<P>
The army, police and General Security Service do not serve any
political party, he said.
</P>
<P>
Opposition leaders, including Likud Chairman Binyamin
Netanyahu, have criticized that the Sharm el-Sheikh meeting is to
save Peres from his personal political crisis which sees him
losing popularity in opinion polls in the wake of suicide
attacks.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Peres said today that Israel now has a full picture
of the recent suicide bombings and of ways to deal with
terrorism.
</P>
<P>
He defended the renewed Israeli policy of sealing off and
demolishing homes of suicide bombers.
</P>
<P>
"We have no choice but to tell the father that if from your
home, your son is going to commit suicide, do not think only that
he is going to paradise, your home is in danger and will be
harmed," he said.
</P>
<P>
Peres added that nine such homes have been marked off and "we
will demolish all of them without mercy." One home has already
been demolished.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli leader also referred to the steps being taken
against the villages of the suicide bombers where the Israeli
soldiers are conducting home-to-home searches and where living
conditions are deteriorating.
</P>
<P>
"I'm opposed to collective punishment, but if there is a
collective terrorist effort, there is no other may but to break
down the resolve," he said.
</P>
<P>
The crackdown on Hamas continue today as the Palestinian
police have arrested another Hamas leader, Saed Abu Musameh, one
of the remaining Hamas leaders at large. Abu Musameh was detained
at his home near Rafiah in the Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, the Palestinian police arrested four key Hamas
figures, including a deputy chief of the organization's military
wing, Izzadin Kassam. So far, the Palestinian police have
arrested more than 600 Hamas activists.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, the Israeli army arrested 29 Hamas
suspects and seized home-made weapons in the West Bank Sunday
night. The operation was conducted in villages around Tulkarm,
Nablus, Ramallah and Bethlehem.

It asked the president to intervene as soon as possible by
dismissing the government headed by Rao and holding early
elections.

JERUSALEM, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Turkish President Suleyman
Demirel arrived in Israel today for an official visit.
</P>
<P>
He is due to meet with Prime minister Shimon Peres this
evening and feted by President Ezer Weizman afterwards.
</P>
<P>
Demirel arrived with a delegation of some 200, including the
foreign minister-designate, members of parliament, university
heads, Moslem leaders and businessmen. a bilateral agreement will
be signed during the visit.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish president visited the Holocaust Memorial at Yad
Vashem here this afternoon and will attend a prayer service on
the Temple Mount Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
Israel attaches great importance to Demirel's visit, especially
at a time when Israel is mobilizing international support for its
"total war" against Islamic fundamentalism.
</P>
<P>
Relations between the two countries have greatly improved in
recent years. The bilateral trade almost doubled last year,
compared to the previous year, reaching about 450 million
U.S. dollars. Cooperation on security is particularly
prominent. The U.S. has an interest in, for instance, cooperation
between Turkey and Israel in containing Iraq along the joint
Turkish-Iraqi border.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the Turks have been monitoring the negotiations
between Israel and Syria. They fear that the results of these
negotiations -- and primarily, what is perhaps being cooked-up
behind the scenes -- are likely to have a negative impact on
Turkey.
</P>
<P>
There are a number of serious issues between Turkey and Syria,
from the Kurdish problem to the water question. Israel has promised
the Turkish side that it would take into consideration the Turkish
aspect of the negotiations with Syria.

LUSAKA, March 11 (Xinhua)-- The new South African government
had appreciated the role of the Zambian people played in the
anti-apartheid struggle, visiting South African Foreign Affiars
Minister Alfred Nzo said today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters here, Nzo said the Zambians sacrificed a
lot during the liberation struggle which had brought in a

appreciate former Zambian President Kenneth Kaunda's role alone
rather than the majority of the Zambians.
</P>
<P>
" Let us face facts, Dr Kaunda was president and there is no
way his name can not be mentioned. But we have always appreciated
the role the people of Zambia played in our freedom struggle," he

During his three-day visit, the two countries signed a general
agreement on economic, social, scientific, technical and cultural
cooperation.

<P>
"We want solution to the current political impasse through
discussions," said Khaleda, describing the 70-minute meeting with
the president as "good."
</P>
<P>
On her way to and from the presidential palace, the prime
minister was greeted by tens of thousands of cheering supporters
lining the seven-kilometer road leading to her office.
</P>
<P>
Observers here noted that the BNP's promises were just a repeat
of its previous stand on the legality of the February 15 polls,
which were won easily by the BNP and boycotted by the mainstream
opposition.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether the parliamentary polls would be canceled, the
prime minister countered that without a parliament, "who would
pass the bill of the non-party government?"

<HEADLINE> UK Finance Unions Unite in Fight to Protect Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Trade unions in Britain
representing 300,000 financial services workers are to combine to
fight expected massive job losses in the industry following
mergers and takeovers.
</P>
<P>
The Daily Telegraph reported today that up to 40 unions and
independent staff associations will be invited to a meeting in
London next month to plan the campaign.
</P>
<P>
They aim to pool resources on a cooperative basis and to
develop common campaigns to influence the government, consumer
groups and other interested parties.
</P>
<P>
Their move comes as credit-rating agency Fitch forecast that
the major banks are heading for intense short-term competition in
the personal financial services market.
</P>
<P>
Fitch said that although the five biggest banks, Midland,
NatWest, Barclays, Abbey National and the recently merged Lloyds
TSB, made record profits totaling 10.6 billion pounds (16 billion
U.S. dollars) last year, their costs are rising and a showdown
with the building societies is looming.
</P>
<P>
Unions, led by the Banking, Insurance and Finance Union, are
concerned at the implications of this competition.
</P>
<P>
Ken Perry, general secretary of the National Union of Insurance
Workers, said Sunday, "Events are moving very quickly in the
industry. It's now a fact that on the union side, we need to pull
together."

<HEADLINE> Maize Bumper Harvest Forecast In SADC Region </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Maize output in the 12-nation
Southern African Development Community (SADC) is forecast to rise
to 18.62 million tonnes in the 1995/96 season on the back of a
good rainfall pattern.
</P>
<P>
The SADC Regional Early Warning Unit said in its latest food
security update, an overall maize harvest ranging from 16.68
million to 18.62 million tonnes was tentatively forecast for the
region this year compared to last year's 11.1 million tonnes.
</P>
<P>
The unit said SADC states had increased hectarage for maize in
the 1995/96 season and expectations of above average yields were
high excent in Namibia where the rain season started late.
</P>
<P>
''Dhould a harvest be realised, regional maize availability
will be more than sufficient to cover projected consumption
requirement of 17.07 million tonnes over the 1996/97 marketing
year,'' the unit said.
</P>
<P>
The SADC, which has an estimated population of 180 million
people, comprises Angola, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mauritius,
Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, Swaziland, Tanzania, Zambia
and Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
While this season's harvest was expected to be high, cereal
availability in the lean period leading to the harvest was said
to be tight.
</P>
<P>
The worst affected countries were Mozambique, Swaziland,
Zambia and Malawi where the unit said the situation was
compounded by inadequate import plans, coupled with slow delivery
rates.
</P>
<P>
Angola, Malawi, Mozambique and Zambia continued to reflect
large maize import gaps unlikely to be covered.

<HEADLINE> UK Tory Government Faces New Pressure on Europe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 11 (Xinhua) -- On the eve of publication of a
white paper on the single European currency, the British
government faces potential damage brought by a small but very rich
Referendum Party on Europe.
</P>
<P>
The Referendum party has been founded by a billionaire
financier, Sir James Goldsmith, who claimed today that a
plebiscite on a single European currency alone will not satisfy
his demand.
</P>
<P>
He asked the Conservative government to promise a referendum on
Britain's role in the European Union.
</P>
<P>
Sir James has bought full page advertisements in four national
newspapers today, threatening to put up candidates in every seat
against the Conservative party in the next general election if
they do not commit themselves to a referendum.
</P>
<P>
A memo has been leaked from the Tory party saying that the
Referendum party might not attract the level of support as some
people have predicted, but it could well secure 1 percent or 2
percent of the popular vote.
</P>
<P>
And that could be enought to deny the Tories 25 seats and make
the difference between winning and losing, said the leaked
document.
</P>
<P>
BBC TV reported this afternoon that the document is thought to
have been given wide circulation within the Conservative party.
</P>
<P>
Although not issued by the party's central office, the document
is believed to originate from a senior researcher working within
the Tory high command.
</P>
<P>
British Prime Minister John Major has promised a decision on a
single currency referendum in the next few weeks.
</P>
<P>
Downing Street reiterated this morning that if there was a
referendum, it would be restricted to the question of a single
currency.

<HEADLINE> British Defense Minister Leaves Saudi Arabia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, March 11 (Xinhua) -- British Secretary of State
for Defense Michael Portillo left Saudi Arabia today after a
three-day visit to the kingdom, during which he held talks with
Saudi officials on Defense issues.
</P>
<P>
British Embassy sources said that Portillo has expressed his
full satisfaction at the results of his talks with senior Saudi
officials, which he said would boost defense cooperation between
the two countries, according to Kuwait News Agency KUNA today.
</P>
<P>
During his visit to Saudi Arabia, the British defense minister
held talks with Saudi Crown Prince and First Deputy Prime Minister
Abdullah Ibn Abdul-Aziz and Second Deputy Prime Minister and
Defense and Aviation Minister Prince Sultan Ibn Abdul-Aziz.
</P>
<P>
Portillo reviewed with Prince Sultan all the cooperation
ventures in the defense field as well as new projects.
</P>
<P>
The British Embassy sources have not ruled out, in previous
statements to KUNA, the possibility that the Portillo-Prince
Sultan talks would deal with Britain's selling of high-tech
Challenger tanks to Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
Portillo renewed, during meeting with Prince Sultan, his
country's commitment to maintain peace and stability in the Gulf
region against any possible dangers, and stressed the strategic
importance of the region to his country and the world.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia and Britain signed a 14 billion pounds sterling
joint defense program in 1985 on selling British high-tech
military equipments to the Kingdom.
</P>
<P>
The Kingdom received at the end of last year one sophisticated
minesweeper and will receive two more during this year and next
year.

<HEADLINE> Earnings From Tourism Sector Grow In Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's tourism industry is
showing unprecedented growth, and last year foreign and domestic
tourists earned the country over 2.22 billion US Dollars.
</P>
<P>
David Chapman, an official of the Zimbabwe Council for
Tourism, said here today that the impact of tourism on the Gross
Domestic Product (GDP) was significant, with its contribution to
GDP growth rising from 3.4 percent in 1990 to 6.6 percent last
year.
</P>
<P>
The official said this was ''not bad'' by world standards and
in the next five years, tourism would contribute over 10 percent
to GDP.
</P>
<P>
Tourism earnings, as a proportion of Zimbabwe's total exports,
rose from 5.56 percent in the early 1990s to 9.93 percent in
1995, which, in itself, was a ''fairly significant increase'', he
said.
</P>
<P>
He revealed that new tourism projects were planned, and the
industry was confident of further growth during the period up to
the turn of the century.

<P>
WASHINGTON, March 11 (Xinhua) -- An almost week-long strike at
two General Motors Corp. (GM) brake plants has forced the auto
giant to close 11 North American assembly plants due to a shortage
of auto parts.
</P>
<P>
Some 3,000 members of the United Auto Workers union at two
Delphi Chassis Systems brake plants in Dayton, Ohio, began the
strike on March 5 over safety and job security issues. The plants
supply brake systems and parts to nearly all of GM's 29 assembly
plants.
</P>
<P>
The shutdown of the 11 plants has put 34,575 people out of
work. Moreover, with no talks scheduled, the strike threatens to
idle even more GM plants, including its plant in Moraine, Ohio,
which employs 4,000 workers.
</P>
<P>
Informal talks were held over the weekend, but no progress was

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Urges Kidnappers to Release Hostages </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, March 11 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian Armed Forces
(ABRI) today urged the Free Papua Movement (OPM) to release 12
hostages without conditions.
</P>
<P>
The call was issued by Maj. Gen. Dunidja of the eighth Trikora
Command of the ABRI in Irian Jaya, where the kidnapping took place
more than two months ago.
</P>
<P>
He stressed the hostages were innocent and they should be freed
without conditions.
</P>
<P>
The OPM kidnapped 26 people, including seven foreigners who
were on a scientific expedition, in Irian Jaya on January 8.
Later 14 hostages were released.
</P>
<P>
Twelve hostages, including six foreigners, are still in the
hands of the OPM kidnappers led by Kelly Kwalik and Daniel Yudas
Kogoya.
</P>
<P>
Maj. Gen. Dunidja said a persuasive approach may still be the
best way to secure the release of the hostages unharmed.
</P>
<P>
However, he warned the OPM kidnappers that if they stubbornly
refused to release the hostages, the military would be ready to
take sterner measures against the abductors.
</P>
<P>
According to a report of the Antara news agency today, Jayapura
tribal leader Theys H Uluay expressed regret that the OPM abducted
people who were conducting research for the development of Irian
Jaya.
</P>
<P>
Uluay urged Kwalik and Kogoya to release the hostages soon.
</P>
<P>
The OPM has been seeking independence in Irian Jaya since the
late 1960s. The Indonesian government has rejected its demand for
the recognition of a West Papua state in exchange for the release
of the hostages.

forward, it was important to first create a necessary platform for
development, Nzo said.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Announces Boycott of Anti-Terrorism Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon officially announced
today that it will boycott the anti-terrorism summit due to be
held in the Egyptian Red Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheikh Wednesday,
according the state-run National News Agency.
</P>
<P>
President Elias Hrawi has informed the U.S. Administration of
the Lebanese decision "through diplomatic channels," the agency
said.
</P>
<P>
Well-informed sources said that in a message sent today by
President Hrawi to his U.S. counterpart Bill Clinton, Lebanon
announced its position to boycott the anti-terrorism summit.
</P>
<P>
Thus, Lebanon became the first of some 30 countries invited to
the conference to refuse the participation, and Syria is expected
to follow Lebanon's move.
</P>
<P>
Reliable official sources said President hrawi handed over
today the written message to U.S. Ambassador Richard Jones,
answering an invitation Hrawi received last Friday from U.S.
President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese official sources said earlier that the message
expressed a Lebanese desire "to return to the essence of the
Madrid conference," with regard to the fact that the parties
concerned have not worked out how to execute its principles
despite four years have passed since the conference was held.
</P>
<P>
The message said that until today no parties have responded to
a Lebanese call condemning the violence (practiced by Israel
against Lebanon), and instead, they neglect a distinction between
the prohibited terrorism and the legal resistance.
</P>
<P>
It pointed to the repeated Israeli agressions against Lebanon,
and a failure to force the U.N. Security Council to hold a single
conference to denounce them.
</P>
<P>
After a meeting with Lebanese Foreign Minister Farez Boueiz
today, Egyptian Ambassador in Beirut Adel Khodari expressed a
disappointment on Lebanon's decision to boycott the anti-terrorism
summit.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador said he listened to the Lebanese foreign
minister on the justifications pushing Lebanon to the position.
</P>
<P>
"We have been hoping a participation of Lebanon and Syria in
the summit," the Egyptian ambassador added. "Because their
participation and their contribution will be strong inside the
conference, which, in an addition to the problem of terrorism,
will discuss the peace process in the Middle East, the ways to
advance it and the obstacles standing on its road."
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese sources said the Lebanese position to boycott the
anti-terrorism summit comes following intensive contacts with
Damascus and consultations among the Lebanese leaders in the past
few days.
</P>
<P>
In a telephone call between President Hrawi and Syrian
President Hafez al-Assad last Friday, the two sides decided to
taken a united position on the summit, the sources added.

<HEADLINE> Two Former South Korean Presidents Stand Trial Together </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, March 11 (Xinhua) -- The trial of former South Korean
Presidents Chun Doo-hwan and Roh Tae-woo on charges of
insurrection and treason opened at the Seoul District Court today.
</P>
<P>
They have been indicted for masterminding the military coup of
December 12, 1979, that brought Chun to power and the 1980
military crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators in South Cholla
Province.
</P>
<P>
On trial with the two former presidents are 14 co-defendants
also charged with playing key roles in the coup.
</P>
<P>
Because of lengthy opening speeches by defense lawyers,
prosecutors could question only Roh at today's session.
</P>
<P>
Chief prosecutor Kim Sang-hee charged that Chun, Roh and their
co-defendants arrested the then Army Chief of Staff Chung Sung-hwa
and several loyal generals in 1979 without presidential permission
with the aim of seizing control of the armed forces.
</P>
<P>
Defense lawyers, however, contended that Chung's arrest was a
lawful act of investigation, and that the mobilization of troops
by the defendants was to "suppress a mutiny by those forces which
sided with Chung."
</P>
<P>
"Since the execution of the right to investigation was the
inherent function of investigation authorities, there was no need
to obtain a presidential permit in the arrest of Chung," one of
the lawyers said.
</P>
<P>
In his reply to questioning by the prosecution, Roh said that
Chung's arrest was unavoidable as Chung was the top military
officer suspected of involvement in the assassination of President
Park Chung-hee in October 1979.
</P>
<P>
However, Roh evaded several questions by replying "I don't
know," "I don't remember" or "I've never heard of it."
</P>
<P>
Chun, who became the Army strongman after the 1979 military
coup, seized power on August 27, 1980, and ruled the country until
February 1988. He was followed by Roh, who stepped down in
February 1993.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time that the two former presidents are
standing trial together.
</P>
<P>
Chun and Roh have stood trial separately on charges that they
received huge bribes from businessmen while in office.
</P>
<P>
The new trial resumes on March 18.

<HEADLINE> Canada's Native Life Improved, Gap Remains </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Aboriginal people in Canada have
made significant gains in education, housing and health over the
past 15 years, but there is still much room for improvements,
according to statistics from the Ministry of Indian Affairs and
Northern Development.
</P>
<P>
In 1980, only half of native houses had safe drinking water and
less than half had sewage disposal. Last year, 94 percent of
native housing had safe drinking water and 88 percent had sewage
disposal, statistics showed.
</P>
<P>
Fewer than 20 percent of status Indian students on reserves were
enrolled in Grade 12 in 1980. That number has risen to 73 percent.
Status Indians enrolled in universities and post-secondary
education have risen to 27,000 from 4,500 in 1979.
</P>
<P>
In 1980, the infant mortality rate among natives was 23.7
deaths for every 1,000 live births. By 1993, that had been reduced
to 10.9 deaths per 1,000. The national average rate is 6.3
percent.
</P>
<P>
Among the improvements for aboriginal people is life
expectancy. In 1990, aboriginal women had a life expectancy of 74
years and men 67. But, the gap remains, with life expectancy for
Canadian women increasing to 81 years and for Canadian men to 74
years.
</P>
<P>
Despite all this progress, there are still many unfulfilled

<TEXT>
<P>
-- to adhere to the absolute leadership of the Party over the
army and implement the political line, principles, policies of the
Party and unswervingly obey the orders of the CPC Central
Committee and Central Military Commission.
</P>
<P>
"We must always abide by the regulations and obey the orders
and keep in line with the CPC Central Committee and the Central
Military Commission in all circumstances, "he said.
</P>
<P>
-- Always keep the political qualities and remain honest, clear
and forthright, so as to set an exemplary role for the masses of
the people.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Jiang Zemin urged PLA officers to implement the
requirements for stressing politics in various sectors of work.
One should be good at giving political consideration while
carrying out his work, he said, and strict demands should be set for the
army.
</P>
<P>
For example, political criteria must be cited as the first
principle guiding the promotion of officers. It is meant to
promote those who follow the party's instructions and leading
officers with both ability and integrity. Strict evaluation of
political performance should be done while selecting new soldiers,
he said.
</P>
<P>
In the full-member meeting of PLA representatives today, Jiang
also emphasized the importance of socialist cultural and
ideological progress. He said the Sixth Plenary Session of the 14
CPC Central Committee will specially study the progress of social
ethics and cultural development, he said.
</P>
<P>
The PLA has always evaluated high political consciousness, good
ethics, general mood and strict disciplines. He renews his call
that the army should lead the entire society in development of
social culture and ideology.
</P>
<P>
After citing the achievements of the PLA in this respect, Jiang
also said the troops must intensify the development of socialist
culture and ideology and strive to make fresh progress.
</P>
<P>
On army building, Jiang said, China must intensify army
building to strengthen the defense combat effectiveness. And China
should "take its own road of improving the quality of its troops
with Chinese characteristics" to meet the demands of the new
situation and tasks.

<HEADLINE> Jiang Zemin on PLA's Political Work (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Leading officers of the People's
Liberation Army (PLA) should combine politics with practical work
and carry it through in a down-to-earth manner, said Jiang Zemin
here today.
</P>
<P>
Joining deputies from the PLA during the on-going session of
the National People's Congress (NPC), Jiang, also general
secretary of the Communist Party of China Central Committee, urged
the PLA officers to study the Marxist philosophy and the
materialist dialectics.
</P>
<P>
The officers should attach importance to their way of thinking
to guard against and overcome the one-sideness in cognition and
work. Efforts should also be made to improve their style of work
to overcome formalism by integrating themselves closely with the
masses and serving the grassroots.
</P>
<P>
Over the past 17 years, Jiang said, China has achieved rapid
progress in its economy, and fulfiled the original target of
quadrupling the GNP of 1980 by the year 2000 five years ahead of
schedule.
</P>
<P>
China's achivements are attributed to a correct path it has
taken and they have been resulted from the unity and hard work of
the people of all nationalities in the country under the
leadership of the CPC and in accordance with the guidelines of
Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialist with Chinese
characterists, he said.
</P>
<P>
The army building has been further enhanced in the new
situation, providing a reliable guarantee for China's reform,
opening-up and modernization drive. Both officers and men in the
army have taken an active part in the construction of a number of
key projects and undertaken many urgent and dangerous tasks,
contributed greatly for the country's development.
</P>
<P>
By emphasizing politics, it is not meant to repeat some
political slogans but to closely and organically combine them with
specific work. First, such demands must be implemented on the
self-betterment of leading officers themselves, he said, before
listing a few fundamental points:
</P>
<P>
-- to continue to study Marxism-Leninsim-Mao Zedong Thought,
and particularly the theory of building socialism with Chinese
characteristics put forward by Deng Xiaoping.
</P>
<P>
In the whole process of reform and opening to outside world and
the modernization drive, he said, PLA officers should arm
themselves with Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with
Chinese characteristics and to refer it as a guiding principle in
their work. "Never should we be ambiguous or waver with this
fundamental principle," he said.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Vice-Premier Meets With WIPO leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier Li Lanqing
met with Francois Curchod, deputy Secretary-General of the World
Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO), here today.
</P>
<P>
Li said that intellectual property rights protection requires
not only international cooperation and exchanges, but scientific
and technological development.
</P>
<P>
The vice-premier said that China has always attached importance
to the protection of IPR and expressed the hope that, by
cooperating with the WIPO, China will increase its laws and
controls on IPR.
</P>
<P>
In addition to protecting IPR with its laws, he said, China has
focused on cracking down on piracy and the use of false trademarks.
</P>
<P>
Curchod praised China for establishing a system of IPR
protection. Last September, he recalled, China submitted the
Madrid Agreement concerning International Registration of
Trademarks to the WIPO.
</P>
<P>
Curchod said that violations of IPR have also been found in
developed countries, some of them involving advanced technology,
so that both judicial and administrative measures are needed to
solve these problems.
</P>
<P>
He praised the Chinese government for having made useful
efforts in this regard.

<HEADLINE> Socio-Economic Situation In Africa Improves Slightly, Says Amoako </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, March 11 (Xinhua) -- K.Y. Amoako, United Nations
Under-Secretary General and Executive Secretary of the Economic
Commission for Africa (ECA), said today that the socio-economic
situation in the African region has improved slightly since 1994.
</P>
<P>
The remarks was made in his opening statement to the Ninth
Conference of African Planners, Statisticians, and Population and
Information Scientists here.
</P>
<P>
He said, according to ECA's estimates, Africa's gross domestic
product (GCP) grew by 2.2 percent in 1995, as compared to 1.6
percent in 1994 and only 0.8 percent in 1993.
</P>
<P>
He said, "agricultural output virtually stagnated in 1995
after the exceptionally good growth performance of 3.5 percent in
1994. With per capita food production falling by 2.6 percent,
africa's food security continues to give cause for anxiety."
</P>
<P>
He added that in 1995 alone cereal production fall by 15
percent.
</P>
<P>
On the industiral sector, he said, manufacturing output
dropped as well, by 3.7 percent in 1994 and 2.8 percent in 1995,
due to a combination of factors including low levels of
investment and inherent structural weaknesses.
</P>
<P>
"Industiral decline, plant closures and capacity
underutilization, regular features of the african industrial
scene since the 1980's, characterised 1994 and 1995 as well," he
added.
</P>
<P>
he said the poor performance of the agricultural and
industrial sectors, the cornerstones of African economies,
heightens the concern about the sustainability of growth and
development in the region.
</P>
<P>
He attributed the improved gdp growth in 1995 mostly from the
mining sector, because of "oil prices increased by 12 percent and
the volume of production grew slightly, while metal prices rose
by 20 eprcent".
</P>
<P>
He said, African exports grew by nearly 16 percent in 1995
after stagnating in 1994.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that adverse external conditions also
negatively affected the regional growth. "For most of the 1990's,
external resource flows stagnated, and commercial lending
dropped".
</P>
<P>
"Official resource flows declined from 22 billion US dollars
in 1990 to 20 billion dollars in 1993, he said, adding that in
1994, africa's external debt reached 312 billion dollars, an
increase of about 1.5 percent over the 1990 level.
</P>
<P>
"Debt servicing now exceeds 30 percent of export earnings for
most African countries. The effects of the heavy debt burden are
a worsening balance of payments position, fiscal imbalances,
scarcities and rampant inflation," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
he called on African countries to move faster on the road of
economic development.
</P>
<P>
The six-day conference will assess the socio-economic
situation of Africa since its eighth session in March 1994.

<HEADLINE> China to Maintain Slower Population Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 11 (Xinhua) -- China will try to hold the
population increase to below 67 million over the next five years,
and the total population to below 1.3 billion by the year 2000,
said Peng Peiyun, State Councillor and director of the State
Family Planning Committee (SFPC), in a report submitted today to
the on-going national conference on family planning.
</P>
<P>
In the report Peng said that the natural growth rate of the
population dropped to 1.055 percent by 1995, as against 1990's
1.439 percent.
</P>
<P>
This shows that the country has effectively halted the trend
toward rapid population growth during the past five years when the
number of women between the ages of 22 and 29 reached its peak,
she said.
</P>
<P>
The investment for family planning by the financial departments
across the country is targeted at four yuan per capita by the year
2000, as opposed to 2.64 yuan in 1995, she said.
</P>
<P>
She noted that family planning work should focus on the basic
units in the rural areas, on publicity and education about family
planning, and on the training of cadres.
</P>
<P>
It is also imperative that scientific work in family planning,
such as technical services, be increased, she added.
</P>
<P>
She pointed out that during the next five years, China will not
only make efforts to keep a low fertility rate and a low birth
rate, but will also improve the quality and structure of the
population in a bid to maintain well-coordinated and sustainable
development of population, economy, society, resources, and
environment.

<HEADLINE> China Nips Cuba in Four Nation Women's Basketball , grabbed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZENGCHENG, Guangdong Province, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Veteran
Zheng Haixia scored a game high 35 points to lead China to a
thrilling 86-80 vitory over Cuba in the four-nation women's
basketball tournament here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
China displayed dominance after the start, jumping to a 20-10
lead 10 minutes into action.
</P>
<P>
But Cuba fought back to make it 20-22 soon after Zheng was
replaced by her teammate.
</P>
<P>
At 12:30, Zheng Haixia, who also had 12 rebounds in the game,
bounced back to the court. The two teams then witnessed an intense
seesaw play, exchanging the lead for six times.
</P>
<P>
Liang Xin hit a jumper and Zheng scored seven points in a row
in the last two minutes to give China a 46-42 halftime lead.
</P>
<P>
The Cubans scored nine points without answer to open the second
half and take a 51-46 lead. But China took over the game again
and sunk 11 consecutive points to lead 57-51.
</P>
<P>
Cuba managed to level the score at 61-61 with the short-time
absence of Zheng.
</P>
<P>
Zheng went back into the game again and led China to an 82-68
bulge with two minutes remaining.
</P>
<P>
The Cuban women fought on to narrow the gap to 82-77 before
Liang and teammate Zheng Dongmei hit two points apiece to seal the
victory for China.
</P>
<P>
"The game showed that our team is lacking experience in the
crucial moment," said Chen Daohong, China's head coach. "There is
still a lot to improve for us, especially in skill and mental
quality."
</P>
<P>
Chen admitted that Zheng Haixia played an deciding role in the
match. "It is necessary to have the 2.04-meter veteran center,"
Chen added. "No one could take her place."
</P>
<P>
China will face the United States on Tuesday to vie for the
title for the second session of the four-nation tournament.

<HEADLINE> Presidential Runoff Date In S. Leone To Be Decided </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FREETOWN, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Sierra Leone's elections
officials say they will ''stay'' with March 15 as the polling
day in the second round for the presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
Officials earlier hinted the date of March 18 as they were
''uncertain'' whether the London security firm Thomas de la Rue,
which printed the ballot papers, would be able to send the
ballots before March 15.
</P>
<P>
The Chairman of the Interim National Electoral Commission
(INEC), James Jonah said on Monday that INEC had ''hoped'' it was
possible the government ''might make a slight change in the date
for the ballot papers should be flown in at least five days to
polling day to enable INEC to distribute them to the various
polling stations in the provinces.''
</P>
<P>
INEC's contact date for delivery by Thomas de la Rue is March
14, ''but every effort is being made to get the ballot papers
here a bit earlier,'' Jonah said.
</P>
<P>
In another development, the runoff continues to be plagued
with problems.
</P>
<P>
The registration of some 130,000 eligible voters out of the
Sierra Leonean refugees in Guinea and Liberia will not take place
for the runoff according to a decision taken by the government
over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
INEC was unable to undertake registration for them because of
various logistics problems prior to the February 26 and 27
voting.
</P>
<P>
Last week, while INEC officials were planning to travel to
Liberia and Guinea, the leader of the United National People's
Party (UNPP), John Karefa Smart, one of the two presidential
candidates for the runoff, objected to the registration on the
grounds that it would be illegal to register eligible voters for
the second round of the elections when they had not been
registered for the first round of voting.
</P>
<P>
Political analysts said UNPP's objection is more likely due to
fear the 130,000 eligible voters who would be the deciding factor
in the final lap of the race, may vote for the Sierra Leone
People's Party (SLPP). Most of the refugees are from the eastern
and southern provinces considered as traditional strongholds of
the SLPP.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 11 (Xinhua) -- China must intensify army
building to strengthen the defense combat effectiveness of its
People's Liberation Army, said President Jiang Zemin here today.
</P>
<P>
Joining deputies from the PLA during the ongoing session of the
National People's Congress (NPC), Jiang, general secretary of the
Communist Party of China Central Committee, said China should
"take its own road of improving the quality of its troops with
Chinese characteristics" to meet the demands of the new situation
and tasks.
</P>
<P>
Jiang, who is also chairman of the Central Military Commission,
urged the army to strengthen ideological and political education
for its men and officers, step up training to prepare against war,
modernize weaponry, and ensure logistical supplies, for a general
improvement of the troops' combat effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
The key to completing the PLA's tasks lies in having a stronger
contingent of officers at various levels, of middle- and
high-ranking officers in particular, he said. "This is of
great strategic significance and must be done well and
thoroughly," he said.

</P>
<P>
Illing said the representatives of Aidid had refused to meet
him.
</P>

and met with Somali doctors and international NGOs working in
Forlanini Cholera lsolation Camp.
</P>
<P>

Mogadishu's international airport and seaport. He said "the
unbridgeable political differences over these two facilities will
complicate the efficient delivery of humanitarian assistance (in
southern Somalia)."
</P>
<P>
He declined the allegation that the international community
had abandoned Somalia, adding "we're doing even more than
before."
</P>
<P>
Illing concluded his three day visit to Mogadishu today.

<HEADLINE> China's and Surinam's Defense Ministers Confer in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Chinese State Councillor and
Defense Minister Chi Haotian held talks with visiting Defense
Minister Siegfried F. Gilds of Surinam here today.
</P>
<P>
Chi, also vice-chairman of the Central Military Commission,
said that China attaches importance to the visit, which is the
first by a military leader in Surinam since the two countries
established diplomatic ties in 1976.
</P>
<P>
He said the visit will open a new page in the history of
relations between the armed forces of China and Surinam and will
promote the development of the friendly relations between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
Chi noted that China and Surinam have some similar views on
major international issues and both countries are concentrating on
economic development.
</P>
<P>
Developing friendly relations and cooperation between the two
countries more is in the interest of the two peoples, Chi noted,
adding that, "we hope that relations between the two armed forces
will develop steadily."
</P>
<P>
He also expressed appreciation to Surinam for its attaching
importance to relations with the People's Republic of China and
its "one China" stand.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese minister also briefed the visitor on this country's
national defense policies and military development.
</P>

and that the purpose of his visit was to improve relations between
the two armed forces, as well as between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
He added that Surinam has not changed its position on the
Taiwan issue. Surinam holds that the Taiwan issue is an internal
affair of China and should not be interfered in by outside
forces. Surinam respects the sovereignty and territorial
integrity of the People's Republic of China, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Chi presided over a welcoming ceremony for Gilds, who arrived
here Sunday night on an official good-will visit as Chi's guest.

BELGRADE, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslav Foreign Minister Milan
Milutinovic left here for Croatia today to discuss bilateral
cooperation and problems blocking the normalization of relations
between the two countries.
</P>

<P>
Prevlaka is a small but strategically important peninsula on
the border between Yugoslavia and Croatia overlooking Kotor Bay,

ISLAMABAD, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Although guns have been
silenced in Bosnia-Herzegovina, scars of hatred and devastation
are still tarnishing its fair landscape, Pakistani Foreign
Minister Sardar Aseff Ahmed Ali said here today.
</P>
<P>
The tenuous peace, brought by the Dayton Agreement, had yet to
take root, he said while addressing the opening of a two-day

Islamic Conference Assistance Mobilization Group (OICAMG).
</P>
<P>
"The challenges are enormous, and it is the will of the Bosnian
people to overcome them," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
The Dayton Agreement signified the first step towards realizing
the vision of a multi-ethnic, pluralistic and democratic
Bosnia-Herzegovina, he said.
</P>
<P>
Its implementation requires continued and sustained involvement
and vigilance of the international community, he added.
</P>

"The OIC, which has played a critical role in galvanizing
international efforts culminating in the Dayton Accord, cannot
afford to distance itself from the implementation phase," he said.

<HEADLINE> Sheraton Hopes to Open More Hotels In China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 11 (Xinhua) -- ITT Sheraton has an ambitious
plan to operate 20 chain hotels in China by 2000, representing the
largest number in a single country outside the United States.
</P>
<P>
China's fast economic growth will bring about big increases in
business and leisure travel, Edward Davie, president of ITT
Sheraton Asia Pacific Division said today.
</P>
<P>
He was in Hong Kong for a stopover from a trip to Beijing. He
hoped to extend Sheraton's brand to more Chinese cities.
</P>
<P>
ITT Sheraton was the first international chain to open a hotel
in China in 1984 -- the Great Wall Sheraton Hotel in Beijing.
Currently, there are five Sheraton hotels, located in China's
three largest cities -- Beijing, Shanghai and Tianjin, and two
tourist attractions -- Guilin and Xi'an.
</P>
<P>
According to Davie, Sheraton hotels in China have performed
well, with a 12-percent increase in overall revenue in 1995 over
the previous year. A total of 4,000 staff members are employed.
</P>
<P>
Sheraton will open four more hotels in the country in the next
three years, in Shenyang, Wuxi, Dongguan and Guangzhou cities.
</P>
<P>
Davie hoped that the total number in China could reach 20 by
the end of the century. A number of locations for development are
in negotiation.
</P>
<P>
ITT Sheraton, a subsidiary of the US-based ITT Corporation, now
owns, leases, manages and franchises 420 properties in 60
countries and regions around the world. In Asia it has 33 hotels
in 13 countries and regions.

<HEADLINE> Iran Willing to Improve Relations with Egypt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Akbar Hashemi
Rafsanjani today revealed that he has been working hard for the
resumptions of full diplomatic ties between Tehran and Cairo.
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani said at a press conference that relations with Egypt
have to improve despite past and present differences, noting that
cooperation with Egypt is in the interest of the Moslems, Arabs
and Third World countries.
</P>
<P>
He noted that there is a psychological block for improving
relations with Egypt. "The Egyptians were the ones who created
Camp David (agreement). They shook the foundation of the struggle
against Israel," he said.
</P>
<P>
The president said Egypt "created a gap in the unified rank of
Arab-Moslem countries. We consider it a big crime." But, he added,
this would not mean that "we should permanently have no ties, or
weak ties, with Egypt."
</P>
<P>
"We have to work with Egypt. I myself am trying to improve the
relations," he said.
</P>
<P>
The relations between Iran and Egypt are now remaining at
charge d'affaires level.
</P>
<P>
On Iran's relations with Arab countries, Rafsanjani said Iran
wants to have close ties with all the Arab countries despite the
U.S. interference.
</P>
<P>
He noted that there are "certain elements outside of the
region, including the Americans, who do not like to see the
friendly ties developed."
</P>
<P>
"The American interference has created an obstacle. I hereby
assert that Iran will welcome friendly ties with any Arab country
that wants to have good relations with us," he said.
</P>
<P>
On Iran's relations with Iraq, he said Iran was against any
partition of Iraq, adding that the situation in Iraq was
complicated because the Americans were involved there.
</P>
<P>
Regarding relations with the U.S., he said that resumptions of
ties with the U.S. would depend on its goodwill. "The U.S. has to
prove its goodwill. We are skeptical about their goodwill," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"As I have said before, if the U.S. releases our frozen asset,
it would be one instance of showing goodwill," he added.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Americans had tried to influence relations
between Iran and other countries including Japan. "I know that
Japan is under American pressure but the Japanese are handling
these pressures and have good relations with us," he said.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the Iranian president criticized Japan for
withdrawing their investment on Iran's petrochemical project.

<HEADLINE> Top Legislator Calls For Enhanced Environmental Protection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 11 (Xinhua) -- China's top legislator today
called for greater efforts at protecting the environment and the
ecological system in the process of economic development.
</P>
<P>
Qiao Shi, chairman of the Standing Committee of the National
People's Congress (NPC), the Chinese legislature, warned against
seeking short-term economic growth at the cost of the environment.
</P>
<P>
"A deterioration of the environment will inflict wide-spread
and long-standing damages to the country, and this will ultimately
threaten a sound and sustainable economic development for China,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Joining in a group meeting of Fujian deputies to the NPC in
session here, Qiao told the deputies that environmental protection
is an issue "concerning the human race's survival and living
quality, and deserves great attention."
</P>
<P>
He said, no efforts should be spared in bringing pollution
under control, especially where people's interests and health are
at stake.
</P>
<P>
Qiao also dealt on the importance of bringing about a change in
China's economic system and economic growth mode.
</P>
<P>
"Such a change is the key to finding solutions for existing
economic problems," he said.
</P>
<P>
Effecting a transition from central planning to a socialist
market economy and a transition from facility expansion-based
growth to a growth based on higher efficiency, he said, is a
complex historical process.

<HEADLINE> Zhu Rongji On Enliving State-Owned Enterprises in Heilongjiang </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier Zhu Rongji
urged local officials in the northernmost province of Heilongjiang
to cope with problems in state-owned enterprises through different
measures and have them revamped.
</P>
<P>
This morning, Zhu joined deputies of the National People's
Congress (NPC) from Heilongjiang to discuss Premier Li Peng's
report on the country's medium- and long-term development
programs.
</P>
<P>
Zhu noted that the province, being a major grain producer and
old industrial center, has contributed tremendously to the
development of national economy, but many of its enterprises have
been facing difficulties over years during the course of their
shift to a socialist market-oriented economy, especially
state-owned enterprises in the coal, weaponry and forestry
sectors.
</P>
<P>
The change in production of coal and weaponry industries should
be brought about step by step in accordance with the market demands
and, otherwise, they may add new burdens, Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he called on local officials to tap the province's
potentials, so as to turn it into the biggest strategic grain
reserve base in China. At the same time, some new ways should be
tried out to enlive the large- and medium-sized state enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Prior to Zhu's speech, the deputies put forward a lot of
suggestions on reinvigorating the province's state-owned
enterprises, establishing large-scale grain production centers,
stabilizing petroleum production in the Daqing Oilfield, and
propping up the growth of national industry.

MANILA, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel Ramos
today said his country stands ready to enter into a wider sphere
of economic, political and development cooperation with Belgium
and other countries.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks while meeting with visiting Crown Prince
Philippe of Belgium here this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Ramos said the visit of the crown prince marks a new height in

hosting the peace talks between the Philippine government and the
National Democratic Front in June last year.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, the president and the prince witnessed the
signing of four agreements aimed at opening a new chapter in the

<HEADLINE> Qian Qichen Meets HK-Based World Business Group </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 11 (Xinhua) -- China welcomes the international
business community in Hong Kong to remain there to continue their
business activities after 1997.
</P>
<P>
The remark came from Qian Qichen, vice-premier of the State
Council, who addressed a group of leaders of 16 chambers of
commerce from 14 countries and Hong Kong here today. It was led by
Paul Cheng, former chairman of the Hong Kong General Chamber of
Commerce and member of the Preparatory Committee of the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region (SAR).
</P>
<P>
Cheng said that the delegation's visit to Beijing will be
beneficial to deepening mutual understanding and strengthening
exchanges.
</P>
<P>
Qian noted that the Hong Kong transitional period will soon be
over, and China will resume sovereignty on July 1, 1997, and
implement its "one country, two systems" policy.
</P>
<P>
"China welcomes those international businesses in Hong Kong to
continue to develop there after 1997," he said.
</P>
<P>
In reply to a question about whether talented people will leave
Hong Kong to go abroad as 1997 approaches, Qian said some people
may leave, but others will come back to Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
On the whole, he said, if one looks back to the past dozen
years of the transitional period, it has been good. Worries about
this are unnecessary so long as Hong Kong maintains its prosperity
and stability, he added.
</P>
<P>
As for Hong Kong's prospects for development over the next ten
years, Qian said he was confident that Hong Kong will continue to
be a financial, trade and shipping center.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that the inland's support and its close links
with the rest of the world play a key role in Hong Kong's
maintaining prosperity and stability.
</P>
<P>
In referring to China's Ninth Five-Year Plan and Long-Term
Development Program to 2010, Qian said Hong Kong has the inland's
backing, and will maintain its prosperity and stability for the
next ten years or longer.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong relies on the huge market in the inland and the
inland needs Hong Kong as a "window" on the world, Qian said,
adding although there are some cities in the inland that are
growing fast, but, that does not mean that Hong Kong can be
replaced by one of them, or that it can be replaced by Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
In fact, the two can mutually benefit each other and achieve a
common development, he added.
</P>
<P>
Qian stressed that Hong Kong is an economic center, not a
political one. It has a boundless future if it is regarded as an
economic center linking China's inland with the rest of the world,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of the U.S.'s offering most-favored-nation status to
China, Qian said that if this question is not settled, it will not
be good for China, but will also greatly harm Hong Kong and the
U.S. itself.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that the political struggle between the
parties in the United States will not affect the settlement of
this issue.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Qian also answered a series of questions
concerning the role of the Preparatory Committee of the Hong Kong
SAR and personnel exchanges between China's inland and Hong Kong
after 1997.

KATHMANDU, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Nepal's main opposition
Communist Party of Nepal (UML) today asked King Birendra to call a
special parliament session to discuss a non-confidence motion
against the government.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued by the UML today said its delegation led by
party president Man Mohan Adhikari had presented a petition to the
king earlier today, asking for convening of the special session of
parliament.
</P>
<P>
The UML party in its statement accused the present coalition
government headed by Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba of
directing the country towards a path of stagnancy.
</P>
<P>
According to the statement, the UML also accused the government
of failing to control smuggling, corruption and inflation, saying
it no longer enjoys the confidence of the parliament.
</P>
<P>
The UML party would table a non-confidence motion against the
government during the forthcoming special parliamentary session,
it said.
</P>
<P>
It was expected that the king would announce the date for the
special session which would be convened within two weeks in
accordance with the constitution, sources close to the opposition

<HEADLINE> Stability in Tibet Emphasized </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier Wu Bangguo
said stability is always of overriding importance for the Tibet
Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
Joining in a panel discussion today of Tibetan deputies to the
National People's Congress in session here, Wu urged Tibet to do a
better job of handling the relationship between reform,
development and stability.
</P>
<P>
"Only with stability can there be economic development and
social progress," said Wu, who is also a member of the Political
Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China.
</P>
<P>
He said any activities that aim to split Tibet from China and
sabotage unity among different ethnic groups should be resolutely
opposed.
</P>
<P>
Since Tibet has its peculiarities, its economic development and
social advancement must proceed from local conditions, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Tibet should never copy the experience of other areas," Wu
said, noting that Tibet, first of all, should do a good job in
building up infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
Acknowledging that Tibet's guidelines and strategy for its
medium- and long-term development conform with the actual regional
conditions, Wu also urged Tibet to train more skilled people as
"capital investment."
</P>
<P>
According to leading Tibetan officials at the discussion,
Tibet's major goals for economic development in the next five
years include: a ten percent annual economic growth rate, basic
self-sufficiency in grain and oil, and a "relatively comfortable
life" for the majority of the local population.
</P>
<P>
To achieve the goals, Tibet will give priorities to
mineral-related industries, processing of timber and farm and
animal products, the handicraft sector, and construction of
transportation, energy, telecommunications and other
infrastructural facilities.

<TEXT>
<P>
Remittances are now used for other things than providing
support for relatives. Many people pay for correspondence school
courses in this way or use it for commerce and trade.
</P>
<P>
A private entrepreneur in Quanzhou has sent large amount of
money through the post office to his partners in northeast China's
Heilongjiang Province every month to maintain relations with a
local forestry company.
</P>
<P>
In Guangdong, Fujian, and Hainan provinces, which are the
ancestral homes of many overseas Chinese, people have received
money from abroad to set up processing factories, develop mountain
resources, or build bridges and roads.
</P>
<P>
Some have put money from overseas into public facilities. A
teacher in a normal college in Fujian has built a kindergarten
with 50,000 US dollars sent to him by his elder brother in the
Philippines.
</P>
<P>
Although remittances are playing a more important role in
peop1e's daily lives in China, some problems have emerged. The
government has found that some underground organizations have
transferred capital illegally in the form of private remittances
to some economically advanced regions.

<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Li Laishun, a migrant laborer in
the capital of southeast China's Fujian Province, has been sending
600 yuan to his family each month, for the past 18 months.
</P>
<P>
"The money is sufficient to allow my wife and two children to
have a better life," said Li, who is from southwest China's
Sichuan Province. Before he found the job in Fuzhou, his annual
income was less than 2,000 yuan.
</P>
<P>
The amount of remittances sent by ordinary citizens has
increased dramatically because of China's economic boom, experts
point out, and it has been growing over the past 15 years. The
average amount sent in each order had risen to 1,080 yuan by 1995,
from 52 yuan when China launched its reform drive in 1979.
</P>
<P>
Migrant laborers from Sichuan sent 15 billion yuan home in
1994, according to official statistics. An official with the
Fujian Postal Deposit Bureau said that 10.9 billion yuan was sent
out of Fujian in 1995. Only south China's Guangdong Province and
east China's Jiangsu Province sent out more.
</P>
<P>
In eastern coastal areas, the large number of foreign-funded
and rural enterprises have not only created "economic miracles"
but provided a large number of job opportunities for laborers from
other parts of China.
</P>
<P>
Over the past 17 years, Fujian has hired nearly five million
migrant laborers. More than 1.2 million migrant laborers came to
Fujian in 1995. The wealthier Pearl River Delta in Guangdong has
become the choice of seven million migrant laborers.
</P>
<P>
The growth of the market economy, especially the non-government
sector, pushed average urban per capita income to more than 3,800
yuan in 1995. In Shenzhen, a special economic zone in Guangdong,
and Quanzhou, a port city in Fujian, the figure has exceeded
10,000 yuan.

JERUSALEM, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Israeli and Palestinian
security forces have carried on their intensive campaign to round
up Hamas activists in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, reported
Israel Radio today.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli army arrested a total of 29 suspected Hamas
activists and seized weapons in the West Bank. The operation was
conducted overnight in villages around Tulkarm, Nablbus, Ramallah
and Bethlehem.
</P>
<P>
The army today lifted the closure on the West Bank for 12 hours
to allow Palestinian villagers to get food and other supplies.
</P>
<P>
In the Gaza Strip, the Palestinian police have arrested
another Hamas leader Said Abu Musameh. Palestinian sources said
that the man, one of the remaining Hamas leaders at large, was
detained at his home in Rafah.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, the Palestinian police captured the deputy commander
and two other members of the Hamas armed wing, Iz a-Din
al-Qassam. The three Qassam members -- Abdel-Fatah Satari, Kamal
Khalifa, and Sallam Abu Maaruf -- are based in the Khan Yunis
area and appear on Israel's 13 most wanted list for attacks on
soldiers before the Israeli pullout in June 1994.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian police are reportedly searching for a man
called Hassan Salameh, who is believed hiding in Ramallah and may
have been in overall charge of the bombings. He was trained in
Sudan after fleeing to Egypt in 1990.

<HEADLINE> Rare Opportunities For Hong Kong: Li Ruihuan (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Li Ruihuan stressed that studying, understanding and
implementing the Basic Law for the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (SAR) is an important precondition for a
smooth transfer of Hong Kong's sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
Due to historical and social reasons, he pointed out,
differences exist between mainlanders and Hong Kongers in life
style, way of thinking and language usage, and their feelings and
perceptions of Hong Kong's return to China also vary.
</P>
<P>
This state of things will continue for a long period of time to
come, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Neither mainlanders nor Hong Kongers should attempt to
transform the other with their own standards," Li said. "However,
the two sides should be in agreement in abiding by the basic law.
Only in this way can the two sides do things with a common
ground."
</P>
<P>
He said the central authorities are absolutely firm in its
determination to implement the basic law and bring about "a high
degree of autonomy" for Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Achievement of national reunification with the policy of "one
China, two systems" is an integral part of senior leader Deng
Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese
characteristics, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Reunification of the motherland is where lie the common
interests of the Chinese people, including those in Hong Kong and
Macao," Li said.
</P>
<P>
Strictly following the basic law in handling the Hong Kong
issue is not only a basic requirement for Hong Kong people, but
also one for the central government, he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the belief that, guided by the "one China, two
systems" policy, Hong Kong people and people in the mainland will
closely unite with each other, properly handle any problems that
may arise during the process of China's resumption of sovereignty
over Hong Kong, and accomplish this great historic mission."

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong will play a
irreplaceable role in the Chinese mainland's development program
for the next 15 years and face rare opportunities for its own
development during the period, a senior Chinese official said here
today.
</P>
<P>
Li Ruihuan, chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese
People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), China's top
advisory body, expressed the view when he paid a visit to Hong
Kong and Macao CPPCC members, who are here attending the current
session of the body.
</P>
<P>
He spoke highly of the members' concern for the country's
future and of their suggestions and proposals on China's
resumption of sovereignty over Hong Kong and Macao.
</P>
<P>
Serving as a bridge between the mainland and the rest of the
world since the late 1970s, Hong Kong has played a key role in the
formation of an overall framework for China's economic development
and opening to the outside world, Li pointed out.
</P>
<P>
He said, "Hong Kong remains important and irreplaceable in the
process of China's fulfillment of its trans-century development
program. As one of China's special administrative regions, Hong
Kong will make greater contributions to a national
revitalization."
</P>
<P>
And, with increasing economic cooperation between the mainland
and Hong Kong, which is expected to become more convenient and
efficient after Hong Kong's return to China, the mainland's
trans-century development program also provides Hong Kong with a
lot of business opportunities, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Hong Kong has made great progress in the past 17 years by
taking advantage of the mainland's reform and opening up," Li
said. "It will achieve even greater prosperity in the next 15
years."

confidentially to a number of foreign governments and
non-governmental organizations.
</P>
<P>
The sources said the Sri Lankan government sent food and other
daily necessities to civilians in the north of the country, but
the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) only gave 40-60
percent of the supplies to the civilians.
</P>
<P>
The civilians are urging the Tamil rebels to let them return to
their houses as they are now living in squalor huts and facing
severe shortage of food, the sources added.
</P>
<P>
The sources quoted some people as saying their children were
deprived of education because of the LTTE.
</P>
<P>
In November and December last year, the Sri Lankan government
troops captured most of the LTTE-held areas on Jaffna peninsula,
including the city of Jaffna itself.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE has staged a 13-year war against the government for a
separate Tamil state. More than 50,000 people have been killed in
the war, according to official figures.

<HEADLINE> Stonehenge Built 5000 Years Ago </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Stonehenge was built between 2950
BC and 2300 BC, experts from English Heritage found by using
radiocarbon technology.
</P>
<P>
The findings are to be disclosed officially at exhibitions at
the Salisbury and South Wiltshire Museum later this month, but the
mysteries of why it was built and why it was abandoned in about
1600 BC remain unsolved.
</P>
<P>
Geoffrey Wainwright, chief archaeologist at English Heritage,
said yesterday: "All the information from previous studies was
pure conjecture. Now for the first time we are able to put a
proper date on Stonehenge and we realize that much of the previous
data had been wrongly analyzed. It had been thought that there was
a long period in the middle of the life of Stonehenge during which
it was abandoned and then reactivated. We now know that this is
not correct. It was in continuous use throughout the 1,400-year
period."
</P>
<P>
There had been theories that the ditch surrounding the site,
about 8 feet deep and 10 feet wide, had taken hundreds of years to
build, but it now appears that most of the work was completed in
50 years, indicating that those responsible must have lived in a
more structured and ordered society than previously thought.
</P>
<P>
"We now know that the stones from western Wales arrived
virtually together in around 2600 BC, and that the other large
upright stones which give the classical goalpost look were
installed only some 300 years later, in about 2300 BC," Wainwright
said.
</P>
<P>
The new techniques were pioneered by scientists at Queen's
University, Belfast, and the Radiocarbon Accelerator Unit at
Oxford University. Laboratory results were combined with an
innovative program of mathematical analysis known as Bayesian
statistics.
</P>
<P>
"This sort of information and technology has never been
available before, and it is an absolute first in archaeological
science," Wainwright said.
</P>
<P>
Julie Gardener, project manager at Wessex Archaeology, said the
new techniques meant that datings could be made from much smaller
objects than before. On average they could be calculated to within
a range of 80 years and sometimes to within as little as 18 years,
she said.

<HEADLINE> Iran Drops Death Sentence on Rushdie </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Iran announced here today that it
drops the death sentence on Salman Rushdie, a British writer
accused of defaming Islam in his novel, under tremendous pressure
from European countries.
</P>
<P>
Iranian President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani said at a press
conference this morning that "the death sentence was never meant
to be carried out."
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani attacked Europe, especially Britain, for their lack
of resolve to solve the issue.
</P>
<P>
He said: "The Europeans, especially the British, made hue and
cry over it. Even now they do not allow it to be solved."
</P>
<P>
"The fatwa issued by Imam Khomeini can be found in all the
books on Islamic law for the past 1,000 years. He only said
something which existed in these books," Rafsanjani added.
</P>
<P>
"We really do not think it is prudent that we would dwell on
this issue so much," he added.
</P>
<P>
Observers here said that the indirect Tehran-EU talks on Salman
Rushdie is producing some understanding. The two sides have agreed
that the case should be regarded merely as a religious and
theoretical issue.
</P>
<P>
On February 14, 1989, late Iranian leader Ayatollah Khomeini
issued a religious edict, pronouncing a death sentence on the
Indian-born British author Salman Rushdie and his publishers in
protest against the publication of Rushdie's novel "The Satanic
Verses," which was believed by Moslems as defaming Islam, and
exhorting all Moslems to carry out the sentence.
</P>
<P>
In 1993, Rafsanjani told prominent Egyptian journalist Muhammad
Hassanein Haykal that there was a difference between a fatwa
(ruling) and hokm (command). He said that Khomeini did not mean
the death sentence to be a command.
</P>
<P>
An observer here said that with U.S. pressure mounting on
Iran, Iranian authorities have decided to solve the Rushdie issue
to gain cooperation of the European Union.
</P>
<P>
"The Iranians no longer want any of the troubles they went
through over the Rushdie issue," one observer said.
</P>
<P>
"The question is not whether but how to withdraw from previous
position, in such a way that Iran will not lose face both at home
and abroad," he said.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati reiterated here
last week that Iran would not send anyone to kill the author.
</P>
<P>
Mostafa Mirsalim, Minister of Culture and Islamic Guidance,
said at a press conference held last week that Iran will take the
case of insulting religious sanctities like the Rushdie affair to
the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
He said that Iran will ask the United Nations to effectively
put a ban on insulting religious sanctities in a bid to prevent
disputes such as the Rushdie affair.

<HEADLINE> Technological Upgrading to Enliven State-Owned Enterprises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Since 1979 nearly 61 billion yuan
has been invested in technological upgrading of basic construction
of state-owned enterprises in southeast China's Fujian Province.
</P>
<P>
This has helped the enterprises add about 40 billion yuan in
fixed assets and import new technologies and equipment.
</P>
<P>
So far, the province has set up a group of key large- and
medium-sized state-owned enterprises, with more than 10 products,
including video-recorders, computers, farm trucks, sneakers and
jewelry leading the country in output.
</P>
<P>
Among them, the output of "Jinhuan" brand aureomycin produced
in this provincial capital accounts for two-thirds of the world's
total.
</P>
<P>
More than 23 percent of China's newsprint is produced by the
Nanping paper mill, and 50 percent of nation's middle-density
fiberboard for export is provided by a mill in Fuzhou.
</P>
<P>
In order to further enliven its enterprises, the province plans
to inject 60 billion yuan more into technological upgrading in 500
state-owned enterprises by the turn of this century.

<HEADLINE> UK Poised to Join European Arms Agency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 11 (Xinhua) -- British Secretary of State for
Defense Michael Portillo is expected to announce this week that
Britain will join the European Arms Agency created by France and
Germany, The Times newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
The report said that after weeks of consultations with the
Foreign Office and the Department of Trade and Industry, Portillo
appears to be convinced that joining the agency would cut costs
for the British arms industry and make its arms exports more
competitive.
</P>
<P>
France and Germany established the agency in January in an
attempt to achieve economies of scale by sharing weapon
development costs and increasing production runs.
</P>
<P>
Britain's membership of the arms agency comes on condition that
it takes part in a three-nation program to buy 8,000 armored
personnel carriers, a purchase regarded as vital to rationalize
the crowded arms industry in Europe.
</P>
<P>
German Defense Minister Volker Ruhe made it clear late last
month that Britain must participate in collaborative European arms
projects if it wanted to join the Franco-German arms agency.
</P>
<P>
He warned that cooperation between Germany, France and Britain
was the only viable course for Europe to maintain its leading role
in the global defense industry.
</P>
<P>
Britain was excluded from the newly-created arms agency for its
perceived bias towards buying U.S. weapons rather than joining
European arms programs.

<HEADLINE> Tanzanian Border With Burundi, Rwanda To Remain Closed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, March 11 (Xinhua) -- The Tanzanian government
has turned down the United Nations appeal to re-open its border
with Burundi and Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
This was announced by Tanzanian Minister for Foreign Affairs
and International Cooperation, Jakaya Mrisho Kikwete while
briefing a news conference here over the weekend on the
implementation of the Bujumbura Plan of Action.
</P>
<P>
He said the Tanzanian Government was refusing to re-open the
border but was deeply concerned with the deterioration of the
security situation in Burundi and its consequences on
displacement of its population.
</P>
<P>
The appeal to re-open the border was made by the UN High
Commissioner for Refugees, Ms. Sadako Ogata, in Addis Ababa,
Ethiopia, last month during the OAU Council of Ministers' second
meeting on the implementation of the Bujumbura Plan of Action.
</P>
<P>
Kikwete said the border's closure remained indispensable to
control the refugees' influx.
</P>
<P>
He added that Tanzania as an asylum country was conscious
of the burden and the adverse effects of the presence of refugees
on their environment, infrastructure and security of the local
communities.

<HEADLINE> Rafsanjani Not to Run for Next Presidency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Iran's moderate President Akbar
Hashemi Rafsanjani announced here today that he will not run for
a third term amid rumors here that the constitution might be
amended to allow for his third consecutive run for presidency.
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani said at a press conference that it would not be in
the interest of the country that the constitution would be
changed "for the sake of one person."
</P>
<P>
"Even if it is legally approved that I would run for
presidency, I would not run," said the 61-year-old president.
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani said that the rumor was merely "a promotional
rumor" used by the main contenders in last week's parliamentary
elections.
</P>
<P>
The two main group jockeying for the 270-seat parliament here
were the clerical group Society of Combatant Clergy (SCC) headed
by hardline Parliament Speaker Ali Akbar Nateq-Nouri and the
pro-Rafsanjani group called G-6.
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani's daughter, Faezeh Hashemi, ran last week as a G-6
candidate for Tehran constituency. She is known as a Moslem
feminist with independent views supported by most middle-class
women in Iran.
</P>
<P>
According to early count of the votes revealed today here,
Faezeh Hashemi is running second in the list of 30 candidates for
Tehran, according to early count of the votes.
</P>
<P>
The first person on the list is Ali Akbar Nateq-Nouri, the
present speaker of the Parliament. A populist clergyman and a
presidential hopeful, Nateq-Nouri is among the SCC leaders..
</P>
<P>
During the press conference, Rafsanjani was asked if there
would be any competition between the two leading candidates
especially for the speaker's position at Iran's fifth parliament.
</P>
<P>
"Nateq-Nouri is a dear friend of mine and Faezeh is my
daughter. She did not enter the race for competition. I think
they will work closely with each other at the Majlis," Rafsanjani
said.

<HEADLINE> Guangzhou to Introduce More Foreign Funds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, March 11 (Xinhua) -- This capital city of south
China's Guangdong Province will introduce more overseas investment
to develop commerce, finance, insurance and trade.
</P>
<P>
More overseas funds, including offshore securities financing,
project loans on mortgage, BOT (Build-Operate-Transfer) financing
and non-recourse financing, will be introduced to help the
development of compensation trade and international leasing.
</P>
<P>
According to Tan Kecheng, director of the Guangzhou Foreign
Trade and Economy Commission, the city will relax the restrictions
on some foreign-funded banks and enterprises, and encourage
international insurance companies and financial groups to set up
their regional headquarters in Guangzhou.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, some international freight agencies and
foreign-funded tourism agencies are expected to be set up in the
city.
</P>
<P>
Official sources said that Guangzhou used overseas investment
totalling 2.25 billion US dollars last year, a rise of 10 percent
over 1994.
</P>
<P>
This amount was second only to the amount of overseas
investment attracted by Shanghai, China's largest commercial
center.
</P>
<P>
In 1995 the export value of the foreign-funded enterprises in
Guangzhou amounted to 50.6 percent of the total, while industrial
value accounted for 38.9 percent, and taxation 46.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
The top six countries and regions which have invested in
Guangzhou are Hong Kong, Britain, Japan, the United States, Macao
and Singapore.
</P>
<P>
During the Ninth Five-Year Plan period (1996-2000) Guangzhou
intends to make full use of overseas investment to help its social
progress and economic construction, and the annual increase rate
is expected to top 10 percent.

The loans will be used to finance a highway project to connect
Istanbul to Izmir via Bursa and Balikesir, a 350-kilometer highway
between Ankara and Pozanti in southern Anatolia, a 60-kilometer
highway between Izmir and Bandirma on the Marmara coast, a bridge

TEHRAN, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Iran today declared once again
that it is not going to do anything to disrupt the Middle East
peace process.
</P>
<P>
Iranian President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani said at a press
conference: "From a practical standpoint, we are not going to do
anything to disrupt the peace process."
</P>
<P>
"If they propose a well-thought-out plan for peace, you will
see that Iran will cooperate with them," said the Iranian

</P>
<P>
However, Rafsanjani said that Iran does not agree with what is
called "the peace process" because it is not a just peace.

<P>
He believed that the right of Palestinians is being trampled.
</P>
<P>
"No thoughtful and wise person could imagine that such a peace
would be durable without defining the fate of millions of
refugees that are outside of Lebanon, Syria, Jordan and other
places and who are yearning to return to their homeland," he
noted in his 90-minute press conference.
</P>
<P>
However, he expressed his welcome to the visit by Europeans
who will come to Tehran and persuade Iran to condemn terrorism.
</P>
<P>
"If these gentlemen want to come to Iran, they are
welcome. They can come here and we will negotiate with them," he

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabweans who have been
transferred locally or are abroad but not with the country's
diplomatic missions will not be allowed to vote during this
month's presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
This was stated by Registrar-General Tobaiwa Mudede while
addressing a meeting of constituency registrars, election
supervisors and presiding officers in Mutare, East Zimbabwe, over
the weekend.
</P>
<P>
He said the government had decided to cut down on the number
of postal votes.
</P>
<P>
The Registrar-General said the move was taken following a
number of what he termed ''political problems'' with the
acceptance of postal votes, especially those from outside the
country.
</P>
<P>
In past parliamentary and presidential elections, defeated
candidates used to accuse the ruling ZANU (PF) party of rigging
the election through the use of postal votes.
</P>
<P>
Mudede, one of the five-member election directorate, said
for the first time postal votes would only be allowed from
Zimbabweans working in diplomatic missions and their spouses, and
members of the police and the army on UN-sponsored peace missions
outside the country.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Hale-Bopp, a newly-discovered
extraordinarily large comet in the solar system, has been recently
observed for the first time in China.
</P>
<P>
Astronomers at the Shanghai Observatory under the Chinese
Academy of Sciences located the comet, which has a very dim light,
700 million km from the earth.
</P>
<P>
Drawing closer to the sun at a speed of 1.3 million km per day,
the comet is expected to reach the proximity of the sun around the
end of March or in early April 1997.
</P>
<P>
The comet was first spotted by Hale and Bopp, both US
astronomers, on July 22, 1995. It was later designated as a new
comet by the International Astronomical Union.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that the comet is 100-150 km in diameter, five
to 10 times the size of the world-famed Halley's Comet.
</P>
<P>
Major observatories in China are preparing for a co-observation
on the comet.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Deport 45,000 Illegals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 11 (Xinhua)-- South Africa has arrested
and deported some 46,000 illegal immigrants to their respective
countries in the past two month, the local daily Sowetan
reported today.
</P>
<P>
According to recent statistics released by the Department of
Home Affairs, Africans, especially Mozambican and Zimbabwean
nationals, accounted for the large number of the deportees. A
total of 43,995 Mozambicans and 1,832 Zimbabweans were deported.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the deportees also include 24 Germans and
20 Russians.
</P>
<P>
Spokesman for the department Marks Nkwana said about 90
percent of all the illegal immigrants were africans.
</P>
<P>
"The reason is simply because South Africa is part of the
African continent and thus within easy reach of illegal African
immigrants than for Europeans who have to fly to the country,"
said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Johannesburg police spokesman Inspector Andy Pieke
also indicated that they would continue to arrest illegal
immigrants despite accusations that they were biased.
</P>
<P>
A police unit had been in existence since 1982 to deal with
illegal immigrants, said Pieke.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that about 2.5 to three million illegals are
currently believed living in South Africa. enditem

BEIJING, March 11 (Xinhua) -- The Beijing Capital International
Airport will close one of its two runways for repairs from April 1
to June 30, the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC)
announced here today.
</P>
<P>
Information released by the CAAC says the West Runway will
operate normally during the closure of the East Runway.
</P>
<P>
The CAAC apologized for the inconvenience to passengers due to
the adjustment in flights and longer waiting times.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, it has asked airlines to arrange, whenever possible,
for their flights to be diverted to the Tianjin International
Airport or the Zhengding Airport in Shijiazhuang City, the capital
of surrounding Hebei Province.
</P>
<P>
The administration says flights in and out of the Capital
Airport have been increasing by an annual 20 percent in the last
few years. In 1995 the airport saw 121,000 takeoffs and landings,
compared with only 39,000 in 1985.
</P>
<P>
Under the pressure of the busy traffic, the runways of the
airport have been severely overloaded. So, for safety reasons, the
CAAC has decided to close the East Runway for repairs.

MACAO, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Macao's inflation rate reached 8.6
percent last year, up 2.3 percentage points compared with the
previous year, according to latest statistics.
</P>
<P>
Figures from the Macao Statistics and Census Department show
that the composite consumer price index grew by 8.6 percent last
year from that of 1994.
</P>
<P>
The increase was mainly owing to the rise in such prices as of
fuel and electricity, garments and footwears, and of housing rents.
</P>
<P>
The price index was much higher in the first half of the year,
but it dropped in the latter half. In particular, the price of
foodstuffs, non-alcoholic beverages, durable goods and tobacco,
among others, dropped by over 0.2 percent in last December.
</P>
<P>
Macao has more than 400,000 residents. Its leading sources of
income include textiles, garment and toy-making, tourism and casino
income. Official figures show its per capita gross domestic product
(GDP) reached to about 16,000 US dollars last year.

who committed various crimes.
</P>
<P>
The police spokesman said that of the arrested tourist
criminals last year, 280 were Filipinos, 120 Britons and 80 from
the Chinese mainland.
</P>
<P>
He said that the others arrested came from Thailand, Indonesia,
India, Pakistan and a number of other countries.
</P>
<P>
Thefts, drug-related offenses and fighting were most common
among the offenses committed by the tourists, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that some local syndicates also employ the tourists to
steal fashionable commodities to sell on the black market and they
make use of the advantages of the transit status of the tourists
who are less easy to track down.
</P>
<P>
Some "tourists" would simply grab any handbags put on the floor
by other customers in crowded shops, police said, adding that
Filipino's pickpocketing targeted mainly Filipino domestic workers
gathering in Central while British tourists tended to commit
crimes individually.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 11 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Trade Development
Council (TDC) today launched a 10-point plan to promote Hong Kong
internationally as the services hub of Asia.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference, Victor Fung, TDC's chairman, said that
TDC has been successfully promoting merchandise trade for the past
30 years and the new emphasis on services is a natural
development.
</P>
<P>
He said that as a result of China's economic opening, Hong
Kong's economy has become more services-oriented, covering design,
financing, marketing, distribution and transportation.
</P>
<P>
The services sector has grown by an average of 16 percent per
year since 1982 and services account for 83 percent of Hong Kong's
GDP.
</P>
<P>
He said, "What we will be doing is maximizing the full
potential of TDC's resources and capabilities."
</P>
<P>
He said that these resources included TDC's worldwide network
of more than 50 offices, its database of 500,000 business
contacts, its expertise in organizing trade fairs and exhibitions,
its match-making experience in handling 420,000 trade inquiries
each year from all over the world.
</P>
<P>
TDC's 10-point plan is aimed at strengthening Hong Kong's
services economy and services promotion, focusing on setting up
four new services advisory committees for market priorities and
promotional strategies, increasing TDC's own expertise on the
services sector, and organizing a series of high-profile business
conferences between May and October in Southeast Asia, the United
States, Europe and four major cities in China.
</P>
<P>
TDC is also planning to allocate 40 million HK dollars (5.14
million US dollars) to pay for the direct costs for the promotion
services this year.

<P>
BAGHDAD, March 11 (Xinhua) -- A UN official said here today
that Iraq has provided with the U.N. all the documents related to
its past weapons program and pledged full cooperation with the
United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Charles Duelfer, Deputy Chairman of the U.N. Special Commission

four latest revised declarations concerning Iraq's weapons
programs.

the inspection team came to an end.
</P>
<P>
"We will begin reviewing these declarations and have some
assessments of them for the April report to the Security Council."

<HEADLINE> Lebanon to Boycott Anti-Terrorism Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese President Elias Hrawi
will announce his country's boycott of an international
anti-terrorism summit to be held Wednesday in Egypt in a reply
message to the U.S. President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
Well-informed official sources here said early this morning
that Lebanon's move is expected to be followed by Syria which will
also announce the boycott.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that President Elias Hrawi will hand over
today a written message to U.S. Ambassador Richard Jones, in
response to an invitation Hrawi received last Friday from
U.S. President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
President Hrawi listed in the message various reasons for
Lebanon's absence from the meeting. They include Lebanon's
dissatisfaction with the fact that the parties concerned have not
worked out ways of implementing the principles mapped out in the
Madrid conference held in 1993, the failure to force the
U.N. Security Council to hold a single conference to condemn
Israeli's aggressions against Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference held in his Beirut residence Sunday
afternoon, Lebanese Foreign Minister Farez Boueiz stressed that
the summit with a topic related to terrorism is not a "sought
treatment" for the problem which is still a political problem.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Lebanon is against violence and wants to find out
a final solution to the problem.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese sources said that the Lebanese decision of
boycotting the anti-terrorism summit comes after intensive
contacts with Syria and consultations among the Lebanese leaders
in the past few days.
</P>
<P>
In a telephone call between President Elias Hrawi and his
Syrian counterpart Hafez al-Assad last Friday, the two decided to
take a united position on the summit, the sources said.

ANKARA, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Turkish President Suleyman
Demirel said today Turkey sincerely hopes that the region of the

<HEADLINE> Demonstration of Huge Glass Production Line Successful </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QINHUANGDAO, March 11 (Xinhua) -- A demonstration of a
production line to produce 500 tons of float glass a day proved
successful at the Yaohua Glass (Group) Company in this north China
coastal city.
</P>
<P>
Construction of the production line, one of the key state
projects of the Eighth Five-Year Plan (1991-1995), started in late
1994, involving a total of 860 million yuan in investment.
</P>
<P>
The largest and most advanced float glass production line in
China by the turn of this century, it is expected to produce 2.7
million crates of plate glass annually.
</P>
<P>
The over-70-year-old Yaohua glass company, cradle of China's
glass industry, produces more than eight million crates of glass
annually, accounting for one tenth of the national total.
</P>
<P>
Glass produced by Yaohua occupies most of the domestic market
and is exported to more than 60 countries and regions.
</P>
<P>
Once operational, the production line is expected to lift the
company's annual production capacity to 11 million crates, making
Yaohua the largest glass production base in China.

<HEADLINE> PNA Police Arrest Key Izzadin Kassam Figures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 11 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian police have
arrested the deputy commander and two other members of Izzadin
Kassam, military wing of Hamas, and a possible Hamas-Kassam
go-between, according to Palestinian sources today.
</P>
<P>
The three Kassam members -- Abdel-Fatah Satari, Kamal Khalifa
and Salaam Abu Maaruf -- were based in the Khan Yunis areas and
appeared on Israel's 13 most wanted list for attacks on soldiers
before the Israeli army withdrawal in June 1994, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Satari, 33, is considered deputy chief of Izzadin Kassam, and
is believed to have organized last year's attack at Kfar Darom in
the Gaza Strip. His superior is Mohammed Dief, who is still at
large.
</P>
<P>
Satari has been on Israel's wanted list for six years and was
with Imad Akel, the most wanted member of Izzadin Kassam then and
the killer of 13 Israeli soldiers.
</P>
<P>
Imad Akel was shot dead by Israeli soldiers two years
ago. Satari escaped and has headed Izzadin Kassam in Khan Yunis
since then.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian sources close to Hamas said that Satari had at
least one meeting with PNA President Yasser Arafat after the
January 5 killing of Yihye Ayyash, the Hamas chief bomb-maker, in
which Satari promised to maintain a ceasefire.
</P>
<P>
It is not clear whether he broke his pledge or whether he was
powerless to impose it.
</P>
<P>
The fourth man, Abdullah Abdel-Fatah Duhan, is considered a
Hamas official with close links to Izzadin Kassam. His
interrogation could reveal whether Hamas gave direct orders to
Izzadin Kassam to launch attacks, said Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) Attorney-General Khalid al-Qidrah Sunday.
</P>
<P>
This could affect the tolerant attitude to Hamas as a
political organization. Izzadin Kassam, as an armed group, has
been outlawed by the PNA following the suicide bombing attacks
last week in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian police are now searching for a man called
Hassan Salameh, who is believed hiding in Ramallah and may have
been in overall charge of the bombings.
</P>
<P>
Other action taken by the PNA against Hamas includes
confiscation of keys to mosques frequented by Hamas and their
deposit so that the PNA can keep a closer eye on activities in
them.
</P>
<P>
So far, the PNA have arrested more than 600 Hamas activists in
the Gaza Strip and the West Bank in the latest wave of crackdown
on the organization and its military wing.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres has expressed satisfaction
with the crackdown and is considering easing the closure within
two weeks.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian officials are demanding that the closure be lifted
or that Palestinians at least have access to the sea for fishing
and to Egypt, from which they can import essential supplies such
as flour, which has almost run out.

<HEADLINE> Iran Dismisses Anti-Terrorism Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Iran's President Akbar Hashemi
Rafsanjani today dismissed the forthcoming anti-terrorism summit
to be held in Egypt, saying "we do not hope anything would come
out of it."
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference held at the Presidential Palace,
Rafsanjani said, "The summit is organized by Americans, we do not
hope anything would come out of it. It serves propaganda only."
</P>
<P>
"Those who support terrorism would not be able to achieve any
success in blocking terrorism," said the Iranian president.
</P>
<P>
Essentially, he added, "we are against terrorism from any side
or anybody, from any side or anywhere."
</P>
<P>
On the issue of Iran's support to Palestinian groups, he said,
+Hamas as a Palestinian group is fighting for the foundation of
its country. We will not condemn."
</P>
<P>
"But if the terrorist action is committed, it should be
rejected," he noted.
</P>
<P>
He said that if the European countries said that "we should
condemn the struggles by Palestinians, we will not do so. The
people of Palestine have lost their homeland."
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani stressed "Iran will never accept any violent
action."
</P>
<P>
He said that Iran will never condemn struggles by Palestinians
and denied any involvement with the bombing attacks in Israel.
</P>
<P>
"Iran is by no means engaged in terrorism and there is no solid
evidence that the United States can prove."
</P>
<P>
The Iranian president made the statement while European
countries are calling on Iran to condemn terrorism and the
anti-terrorism summit is to be held in Egypt Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
He said Iran provided no financial assistance to such
Palestinian organizations as Hamas. He charged the United States
with providing financial support to anti-government organizations.
</P>
<P>
However, Rafsanjani said that Iran welcomes the critical
dialogue with European countries on the issue of terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Iran's support for Lebanon's Hezbollah exacerbates the problem
between Tehran and Tel Aviv. Iranians feel committed to support
their Shiite brothers in south Lebanon, while Israelis feel
committed to check Hezbollah as the most formidable threat to the
security of northern Israel.
</P>
<P>
However, Iran's support to the Islamic group is also
decreasing.
</P>
<P>
A diplomat from an Arab country told Xinhua that Iran used to
offer 150 million U.S. dollars worth of military assistance
annually to Hezbollah in the past. But now, he added, Iran could
only afford 65 million dollars worth of goods to Hezbollah.
</P>
<P>
Iran has expressed its opposition to the anti-terrorism summit.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, Iran's three major newspapers -- Iran News, Akhbar
and Resalat -- carried editorials, dismissing the summit as "a
Western political game."

<HEADLINE> Inflation Control Remains Arduous Task </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 11 (Xinhua) -- China's law makers are urging the
government to continue taking effective measures to contain
inflation.
</P>
<P>
With the fulfillment of the government's macroeconomic control
goals for last year by cutting the inflation rate from 1994's 21.7
percent to 1995's 14.8, inflation is no longer a hot issue at the
current session of the National People's Congress, the Chinese
parliament.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, some deputies call for continued attention to the
issue.
</P>
<P>
Sun Shangqing, director-general of the Development Research
Center under the State Council, said, "It remains a difficult and
complex task, and blind optimism is not justified."
</P>
<P>
Despite the lowered inflation rate, Li Chengbo, chief engineer
of Qinchuan Machine Tools Plant in Shaanxi Province, said prices
for agricultural capital goods have remained high.
</P>
<P>
An excessive money supply is the direct cause for inflation,
Cai Lulun, governor of the People's Bank of China Hunan Branch,
explained. And absence of an effective mechanism restricting
excessive increases in fixed asset investment and consumption
funds is the deeper cause, he said.
</P>
<P>
In Sun Shangqing's view, apart from macroeconomic controls,
financial subsidies totaling tens of billions of yuan, delayed
implementation of some reform measures and tightened
administrative controls on prices contributed to last year's drop
in inflation.
</P>
<P>
While necessary, he said, these are but expedient measures,
which "neither conform with a market economy, nor tend to last."
</P>
<P>
Cai said, it is quite difficult for the government to contain
this year's inflation below ten percent.
</P>
<P>
Last year's price hikes are expected to contribute, in a
delayed fashion, four percentage points to this year's inflation,
and market forces will automatically contribute another four
percentage points or more, he said, quoting an analysis by
economists.
</P>
<P>
"This means," he said, "to meet macroeconomic control goals for
this year, price rises to be caused by government reform measures
must be kept below two percentage points."
</P>
<P>
The government should firmly stick to a relatively stringent
monetary and financial policies, accelerate the pace of changing
the economic growth mode, improve microeconomic efficiency, and
implement both reform and administrative measures, Cai Lulun
pointed out.

<HEADLINE> Ethical Progress Emphasized by CPPCC Members </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Ethical progress has been a focal
topic at the ongoing session of the National Committee of the
Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC).
</P>
<P>
CPPCC members, most of whom are specialists in different
fields, deplored a deterioration in social, occupational and
individual ethics in recent years in China, pointing in their
speeches to problems such as drug abuse, prostitution, the making
and marketing of fake or inferior products, gambling, abduction of
children and women, production of pornographic materials and
extreme individualism.
</P>
<P>
A deterioration of social ethics poses a threat to China's
social stability and may hinder the establishment of a socialist
market economy in China -- a common concern of many CPPCC members.
</P>
<P>
Ying Zhongyi, vice-chairman of Gansu People's Political
Consultative Conference, said governments at all levels must treat
improvement of ethnical standards as an important part of their
work and draft guidelines for supervision over ethnical progress.
</P>
<P>
Feng Hongshun, vice-chairman of the Pingdingshan People's
Political Consultative Conference, Henan Province, suggested
improving occupational ethics first of all.
</P>
<P>
"In my view, work should start from the service industry," he
said. "Retail and service businesses are the society's 'window,'
and their ethical standard has a radiating effect."
</P>
<P>
Zhang Kaizhi, from Qinghua University, spoke about moral
standards among university students.
</P>
<P>
"University students are masters of the 21st century," he said.
"They need to have a strong sense of responsibility."

<HEADLINE> Facts &AMP; Figures on China's Development Program (27) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Following are the seven economic
zones covering more than one province, municipality or autonomous
region envisaged by the new Ninth Five-Year Plan and the long-term
development program to the year 2010:
</P>
<P>
(1) A zone in the Yangtze River Valley and along the river --
to take the advantage of a solid agricultural and industrial
foundation and high technological level, ride on the momentum in
the development of the Pudong New Area and the construction of the
gigantic Three-Gorges dam project, and stand face to the large and
medium-sized cities along the river;
</P>
<P>
(2) A zone around the Bohai Bay including the Liaodong and
Shandong peninsulas, Beijing and Tianjin and Hebei province -- to
take the advantage of developed transportation, a concentration of
large and medium-sized cities and scientific and technological
personnel as well as the abundant resources of coal, iron and
petroleum.
</P>
<P>
(3) A zone in the southeastern coastal areas -- to take the
advantage of the geographical location of neighboring Hong Kong,
Macao and Taiwan and of high-level openness. The zone will rely
mainly on the Pearl River Delta and the southeastern areas of
Fujian Province and focus on growth of export-oriented
agriculture, capital- and technology-intensive foreign-funded
enterprises and high value-added industries.
</P>
<P>
(4) A zone covering some parts of the southwest and south China
-- to take the advantage of coastal, riverside and boundary
locations and abundant resources in agriculture, forestry, water,
minerals and tourist attractions. The zone will rely on the
technological force of the defense industry and become an
important national base for energy, non-ferrous metals,
phosphorus, sulphur, tropical and subtropical crops, and tourism.
</P>
<P>
(5) A zone in the northeast -- to take the advantage of
developed transportation, a complete heavy industry system and
rich land and energy resources. The zone will be focused on the
revamping of old industrial base there, revitalizing enterprises,
increasing the technological level and comprehensive development
of agricultural resources, thereby forming an important national
base for heavy and chemical industries and farm produce.
</P>
<P>
(6) A zone covering five provinces in central China -- to give
scope to the relatively developed agriculture and transportation
and a relatively sound industrial foundation, in order to
accelerate development along the rail routes of
Lanzhou-Lianyungang, Beijing-Kowloon and Beijing-Guangzhou and
form important agricultural, raw materials and machinery bases.

<HEADLINE> Seoul Tries Two Ex-Presidents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Former South Korean presidents Chun
Doo-hwan and Roh Tae-woo were put on trial at the Seoul District
Court Monday on mutiny charges.
</P>
<P>
Also on trial at the same court are 14 close aides of theirs,
including former Commander of the Army 20th Division Park
Jun-byung, former Commander of the 30th Security Group Chang
Se-dong and former Commander of the 3rd Airborne Brigade Choi
Sae-chang.
</P>
<P>
Today's trial is focused on the 1979 military mutiny, which
gave Chun, then a major general, a nine-year grip of power.
</P>
<P>
Roh inherited his power in 1988 and served until 1993.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors are trying to bring to light the illegal nature of
the arrests of the then army chief of staff, Chung Sung-hwa, and
other loyal generals, in what President Kim Young-sam has dubbed
as "a coup-like incident."
</P>
<P>
They maintained that the arrests were illegal because they were
made without a prior approval of then President Choi Kyu-hah.
</P>
<P>
Choi, pressured by Chun and other rebellious generals, endorsed
the arrest warrants next morning.
</P>
<P>
Roh, who was then commander of the Ninth Army Division and one
of the pro-Chun generals, moved his troops to Seoul to help
counter the loyal forces.
</P>
<P>
The court plans to open hearings on the trial each Monday
during the next several weeks.
</P>
<P>
The March 25 hearing will be focused on the May 18, 1980 bloody
suppression of the civil uprising in Kwangju, Capital of the
country's South Cholla Province, which left some 150 people dead
and 2,000 injured.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time for the two former presidents to stand
trial side by side.
</P>
<P>
Chun and Roh, who were arrested last year, are also separately
on trial for graft charges.

<HEADLINE> New Method For Sweet Potato Storage Introduced In Uganda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, March 11 (Xinhua) -- A new method for sweet potato
storage has been introduced in Uganda, the local daily the New
Vision reported today.
</P>
<P>
With the technology, termed pit and clamp storage, sweet
potatoes could be preserved under ground for more than three
months.
</P>
<P>
The method was officially launched and witnessed by a visiting
team of scientists from Kenya, Tanzania, Malawi, Burundi and
South Africa.
</P>
<P>
The scientists came to the country on February 11 for a
ten-day workshop on sweet potato post-harvest technology.
</P>
<P>
The new method reportedly involves digging a pit of a
preferable size according to the quantity of sweet potatoes.
</P>
<P>
Potatoes are accommodated inside the pit, which is then
covered with dry grass.
</P>
<P>
And, the clamp system involves putting up a mud structure over
the pit.
</P>
<P>
Uganda has been identified as the leading producer of sweet
potatoes in sub-Saharan Africa and ranks fourth in the world with
a yearly production of some 1.8 million tons. enditem

<HEADLINE> Saudi Deputy PM: Military Talks with British Official Constructive </HEADLINE>

KUWAIT CITY, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Second Deputy Prime
Minister and Defense Minister Prince Sultan Ibn Abdul-Aziz
described his talks with British Secretary of State for Defense
Affairs Michael Portillo in Riyadh Sunday as cordial and
constructive.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait News Agency reported today that Prince Sultan spoke
after attending a ceremony held by King Faisal Charity Foundation
late Sunday in honor of winners of King Faisal International Award.
</P>
<P>
The Saudi official said his talks with the British secretary of
state dealt with defense affairs of mutual concern and their
previously crafted joint military programs.
</P>

Saudi Arabia and Britain signed the first phase of
21-billion-U.S.-dollar Yamamah program in 1985 and the second
phase of program in 1993.

<HEADLINE> Qian Qichen on Human Rights Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Vice-Premier and Foreign Minister
Qian Qichen today described the just-concluded Europe-Asia meeting
in Bangkok as a great success, which was the start on a journey
toward increased cooperation between European and Asian nations,
in the field of economic cooperation and trade in particular.
</P>
<P>
On the question of human rights, Qian said China has conducted
several rounds of dialogues with the European Union (EU) and that
the latest round was held prior to the Sicily meeting of 15
foreign ministers of the EU.
</P>
<P>
"It is meaningless to try to adopt a resolution on an issue
like human rights at an international meeting," Qian said. "The EU
should not impose its views upon China and tell the country what
to do or what not to do from its perspective."
</P>
<P>
"This is an erroneous policy," Qian noted.
</P>
<P>
"If the 15 EU foreign ministers are able to reach a decision on
this issue," Qian said. "This demonstrates only bloc politics --
it might mean something during years of the Cold War, but it is no
longer useful as before."
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government is willing to develop its relations with
the EU in all fields, Qian said, adding that "We hope the EU would
refrain from doing anything irrelevant at the present time.
</P>
<P>
In response to a German reporter's question on whether China
intends to link its vote on the Haiti issue with the human rights
resolution in Geneva, Qian noted that the question of Haiti has
already been resolved. "We have always supported the peace process
in Haiti. However, we do not endorse the continuing presence of a
large number of U.N. peacekeepers there," he said.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, Qian added, China has put forward a reasonable
proposal on shortening the mandate of the U.N. peacekeepers and
reducing their number. This position has been agreed upon by all
the other parties, he said.
</P>
<P>
As for the human rights issue, Qian said, China has always
called for dialogues to be conducted rather than confrontation.
</P>
<P>
Last year when Chinese President Jiang Zemin and U.S. President
Bill Clinton met in New York, Clinton expressed the hope in person
that the U.S. would like to avoid confrontation with China on the
issue of human rights but to have dialogue with China on the
issue.
</P>
<P>
"We endorse his view," he said.
</P>
<P>
But regettably, it seems that another anti-China resolution is
in the works in Geneva, Qian said, adding that his country is
opposed to such action.
</P>
<P>
Western nations have tabled anti-China resolutions in Geneva
over the past five years but all ended in failure, Qian said, and
the outcome of the forthcoming Geneva meeting is likely more or
less the same.

HEFEI, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Anhui Province, a leading grain,
cotton and oil-bearing crop producer in central China, is to
launch a five-year mass campaign to apply modern science in
agriculture.
</P>
<P>
The move, started this year, is to place emphasis on
spreading practical agro-techniques and applying major research
findings to production.
</P>
<P>
The province will send 30,000 agro-technicians down to the
countryside to help with 40 farm projects, including production of
high-yield rape and wheat.
</P>
<P>
When the campaign winds up in 2000 the output value yielded
from the application of science will soar to 45 percent in its
total agricultural output value.
</P>
<P>
Anhui registered double-digit growth in the output of grain,
cotton, oil-bearing crops, meat and aquatic products in 1995. Its
grain output amounted to 26.5 million tons, cotton reached 300,000
tons and oil-bearing crops climbed to 1.9 million tons last year.

WEIHAI, March 11 (Xinhua) -- This coastal city in east China's
Shandong Province now has more green areas, adding another
attraction to this, China's first state-level "sanitary city".
</P>
<P>
Green land now accounts for 36.7 percent of the city's total
coverage, compared with only 18 percent in the 1980s; the per
capita green area has also risen from four to 16.8 sq m, according
to the local afforestation department.
</P>
<P>
The municipal authorities believe that trees are the "city's
lungs", and have made great efforts at afforestation in recent
years.
</P>
<P>
A local regulation says that all the old urban areas will be
used for afforestation purposes, with no new buildings allowed
there; and trees should be planted on at least one third of the
newly-developed areas.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the city has introduced more than 240 species
of plants suited to the local weather and soil conditions, making
itself green and flowery from the beginning of spring to the end
of autumn.

<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam is emerging as a major
leather shoe producing country which turned out 145 million pairs,
with 85 million ones for export, last year.
</P>
<P>
Domestically made leather shoes are outselling imported ones on
the local market as they often offer customers a variety of
fashions at a reasonable price, an official report said here today.
</P>
<P>
This indicates a promising future for the local leather shoe
industry, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The success is largely due to increased investment, which
resulted in the introduction of 200 new production lines and 1,600
new machines for the industry, the report added.

<HEADLINE> Somali Faction Leader Ali Mahdi Elected Chairman Of USC/SSA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Ali Mahdi Mohamed, North
Mogadishu faction leader, was elected chairman of the United
Somali Congress/Somali Salvation Alliance (USC/SSA) at a once day
conference held in North Mogadishu yesterday.
</P>
<P>
Four deputy chairmen and a secretary-general for the USC/SSA
were elected at the conference, chaired by Ali Ugas Abdulle,
Mogadishu's ex-Mayor.
</P>
<P>
The conference also elected 187 members for the organization's
central, executive and permanent committees.
</P>
<P>
During the election process, Ali Mahdi Mohamed was challenged
by another well-known businessman, Haji Ali Daud, who won only
four votes of the total 127.
</P>
<P>
Before the voting process started, Haji Ali Daud asked for the
postponement of the election for at least another 24 hours so
that he could work on his lobbying campaign properly. However,
the chairman of the conference denied his request.
</P>
<P>
After the election, Haji Daud congratulated Ali Mahdi Mohamed
for his success and told reporters that he was satisfied with the
voting results.
</P>
<P>
The chairman of the conference said the conference was a
complete success and very democratic.
</P>
<P>
Gen. Aden Mohamed Nur Gabyow, Chairman of the Somali Patriotic
Movement (SPM), who attended the conference, also congratulated
the re-formation of the USC/SSA. "This is what all SSA factions
were waiting for to enhance its political and militia powers," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Ali Mahdi Mohamed said after the election that there are power
greedy elements who are preparing to sabotage the peaceful life
in North Mogadishu. They are "foreign manipulated who work under
the cover of the Islam religion to cheat our faith loving
communities," he said.
</P>
<P>
He did not specify these groups, however. Observers say Ali
Mahdi's speech is the first step for an attack against the strong
religious man, Sheikh Ali Sheikh Mohamud, who boycotted the
conference.
</P>
<P>
Sheikh Mohamud, Chairman of North Mogadishu Islamic Sharia
courts, stands firmly against the USC/SSA and refuses to become a
member of the organization. He has said his religious career is
much stronger and sacred.
</P>
<P>
Abdurhman Gabow Mohamud, political rival of Ali Mahdi in North
Mogadishu, did not support the conference. "If they would have
elected other person, I would welcome the organization and would
even work with them." Gabow Mohamud was jailed by the Islamic
court a month ago, but was released after the court dropped all
accusations against him on February 29.
</P>
<P>
The USC/SSA has no chairman since Mohamed Qanyare Afrah had
abandoned the organization and aligned himself with South
Mogadishu faction leader Mohamed Farah Aidid.
</P>
<P>
The conference was attended by more than 800 politicians, clan
elders, religious men and dignitaries from other political
factions, including the United Somali Congress/Somali National
Alliance (USC/SNA) led by Osman Hassan Ali Atto, former financier
of Ali Mahdi's rival Gen. Mohamed Farah Aidid. Eenditem

<HEADLINE> More Shanghai Students Return from Abroad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, March 11 (Xinhua) -- This, the largest industrial
city in China, is attracting more and more students who have
studied abroad to return and work here.
</P>
<P>
In 1995 the number of returned students increased by 37 percent
over the previous year, according to statistics.
</P>
<P>
In recent years Shanghai has paid increased attention to
invigorating the city through science and technology.
</P>
<P>
Huang Yaowen, deputy director of the Shanghai Personnel Bureau,
said that returned students are playing an important role in
bridging the gap between Shanghai's level of science and
technology and that of the advanced countries.
</P>
<P>
The city has provided sufficient research funds, favorable
working conditions and good houses to attract students studying
abroad, he added.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai has sent about 60,000 students to study abroad since
1979, when China began to adopt the reform and open policies. Of
these, 17,000 have returned.
</P>
<P>
Eighty percent of the students have gained doctor's or master's
degrees. Their specialities, including international finance,
economy and trade, computer science, micro-electronics, new
materials and biochemistry are badly wanted by the city.
</P>
<P>
The bulk of the returned students who decide to settle down in
Shanghai are young or middle-aged people. Besides, students coming
back to give lectures or work on a short time are also increasing
in number.
</P>
<P>
Over the past year the city has for the first time sent
delegations from large enterprises to Britain, France and Germany
and other countries to recruit Chinese students studying there.
</P>
<P>
The city has also welcomed visiting delegations consisting of
Chinese students from Germany and Japan, Huang said.
</P>
<P>
He revealed that in the coming year, Shanghai will earmark
special funds and adopt other measures to attract students
studying overseas to the city.
</P>
<P>
Since 1979 China has sent nearly 250,000 students to more than
100 countries or regions around the globe.

<HEADLINE> Guangdong to Open Up Large Tracts of Wasteland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Guangdong Province, an economic
powerhouse in south China, intends to open up 2.4 million mu
(about 160,000 ha) of land for agricultural purposes in the coming
five years.
</P>
<P>
Of this, cultivated land will account for 1.1 million mu,
according to a recent working conference on developing barren land
in the Pearl River Delta.
</P>
<P>
By the year 2000 Guangdong's grain output should reach 19
billion kg or even 20 billion kg, Deputy Governor Ou Guangyuan
told the conference.
</P>
<P>
Besides raising per-unit area yield, the key to meeting this
target is to expand sowing area, he said.
</P>
<P>
The official revealed that the provincial government will set
up an exclusive fund for the opening up of waste land in the
coming five years.
</P>
<P>
In the Ninth Five-Year Plan Period (1991-1995) the province
will mainly open up hillside fields with slopes of not more than
20 degrees and polder areas with development potential along the
coast.
</P>
<P>
Yuan Zheng, director of the Guangdong Land Department, said
that this year the province will put efforts into 50 key projects
for the development of land for agricultural purposes.

<HEADLINE> Qian Qichen on Hong Kong Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Chinese vice-premier and foreign
minister Qian Qichen said here today that the Chinese government
has always been unswerving in pursuing the policy of "one country,
two systems" with regard to the issue concerning Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
He told a press conference this morning that the central
government will grant Hong Kong Special Administration Region
(SAR) a high-degree autonomy, and its affairs will be managed by
the Hong Kong people. This policy has already been stipulated in
the legal form through the Basic Law of the SAR.
</P>
<P>
He cited this policy as enjoying the overwhelming support and
endorsement of the Hong Kong people, and he went to say that the
prosperity and stability of the Chinese mainland will continue to
provide a reliable guarantee for the long-term stability and
prosperity of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
As 1997 is drawing near, Qian noted, there will be a steady
increase in confidence by the Hong Kong people about the future of
Hong Kong. "I think this represents the trend of the times and the
aspiration of the people."
</P>
<P>
"It is my hope that the British side will do more practical
things and play a more constructive role (in this regard)," Qian
said. He also urged the British side not to do anything that might
undermine the confidence of the Hong Kong people.
</P>
<P>
The Sino-British Joint Liaison Group will still play its due
role in increasing cooperation between China and Britain even
though the Preparatory Committee of the Hong Kong Special
Administration Region has been set up.
</P>
<P>
Many affairs related to Hong Kong will have to be discussed by
China and Britain so that consensus can be reached through the
liaison group, Qian said.
</P>
<P>
The secretariat of the Preparatory Committee has established a
liaison office and the British Hong Kong authorities now has a
liaison organization in Hong Kong, and Sino-British talks can also
be conducted by the two bodies, he said.

<P>
However, the Russian was also a little bit nervous when he made

<P>
GUANGZHOU, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Some 3,200 farmers in this
capital city of south China's Guangdong Province have been awarded
certificates bearing technical titles.
</P>
<P>
The titles cover a wide range of skills connected with
agriculture, industry, finance and animal husbandry.
</P>
<P>
The move will spur farmers' enthusiasm to study modern
agro-science and technology, and provide a basis for the signing
of technical contracts and recruitment of skilled workers by rural
businesses, said a municipal official.
</P>
<P>
As a pilot city for this scheme, the government of Huadu opened
10 training courses on accounting in 1994. And 62 percent of the
614 trainees have been awarded technical certificates.
</P>
<P>
A regulation on the issuing of such certificate has been

</P>
<P>
It is reported that the practice is also being implemented in
Shanghai's Pudong New Area and some other cities on a trial
basis.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 11 (Xinhua) -- China has issued its first
regulations to standardize the work of insurance agents following
the going into effect of the Insurance Law in
October.
</P>
<P>
The regulations, worked out by the People's Bank of China, the
central bank, are expected to take effect from May 1, according to
today's "Shanghai Securities News".
</P>
<P>
Agents should pass special exams organized by the central bank,
or other institutions authorized by the bank, and gain the
relevant certificates, the regulations state.
</P>
<P>
Governments and their departments at all levels, social groups
with legal person status, banks and insurance companies are not
allowed to invest in specialized agents, or insurance agencies
with limited responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
Institutions not specializing in insurance agency activities
should obtain licenses with the help of the insurance companies
for which they will act, and they are only allowed to provide
services directly connected with their professions.
</P>
<P>
People who have insurance agency certificates can apply to work
as insurance agents. Individual agents should have licenses issued
by the insurance companies they work for, but they can only work
for one insurance company and are forbidden to handle enterprise
property insurance or group life insurance.
</P>
<P>
The regulations bar individuals from working as part-time

SHENYANG, March 11 (Xinhua) -- The Anshan Iron and Steel
Company has been commended by the provincial government and the
Ministry of the Metallurgical Industry for effectively combining
pollution treatment with technical renovation and utilization of
industrial waste.
</P>
<P>
During the past five years this, the country's largest iron and
steel production base, located in northeast China's Liaoning
Province, has developed 34 environmentally-friendly products from
its industrial waste, which reported 1.7 billion yuan-worth of
output value and 780 million yuan in profits last year.
</P>
<P>
A responsibility system linking the rewards of factory
directors or managers to environmental protection has been set up
in the corporation as a major measure to protect the
environment. A deputy company manager has signed contracts with
leading officials of 13 of the company's factories on the
treatment of industrial waste, ensuring that the major
environmental indicators meet the state standards for Class A
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
At present, industrial waste is recycled for widespread use in
iron and steel production and construction materials. The four
million tons of slag produced annually is all recycled.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Central, Eastern Europe Become Closer Neighbors  (by Shao Jin) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WARSAW, March 11 (Xinhua) -- After unremittingly pursuing NATO
and the EU since the late 1980s, central and eastern European
countries are now busy re-discovering their neighbors.
</P>
<P>
Heads of state are busy shuttling between each others' capitals
to build up economic and political relations with each other.
</P>
<P>
Top Polish leaders visited Hungary, Slovakia, Lithuania and the
Czech Republic in February and March, with membership of NATO,
relations with Russia and closer bilateral relations high on the
agenda.
</P>
<P>
Polish President Aleksander Kwasniewski is due to hold talks
with his Czech counterpart in March and visit Russia in April.
</P>
<P>
In a declaration signed by Polish Prime Minister Wlodzimierz
Cimoszewicz and Lithuanian President Alirdas Brazauskas in the
Lithuanian capital Vilnius, on March 5, the two sides vowed to
enhance cooperation and political ties which are already regarded
as the best in the history of bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Cimoszewicz reiterated Poland's support for Lithuania's bid to
join the Central Europe Free Trade Zone, and in return,
Brazauskas said he will offer preferential treatment to foreign
investment from Poland.
</P>
<P>
During their talks on March 3, Cimoszewicz and his Czech
counterpart Vaclav Klaus announced support for Lithuania, Bulgaria
and Romania's bids to join the Central Europe Free Trade Zone.
</P>
<P>
The Zone, now comprising Poland, The Czech Republic, Slovakia,
Hungary and Slovenia, will establish free trade in most industrial
products by 1997.
</P>
<P>
As the deadline approaches, the louder the call for
strengthening economic ties within the central and eastern
European region has become.
</P>
<P>
This new mood is in sharp contrast to that of the last few years,
when, so eager were the former eastern bloc countries to court
NATO and the EU that they ignored to some extent their mutual
political relations and left Russia out in the cold.
</P>
<P>
But over the last two years ago, these countries have been busy
restoring and developing their political and economic ties.
</P>
<P>
The latest statistics released here show that the volume of
two-way trade between Poland and the Czech Republic jumped 63
percent in 1995 over 1994, and trade volume between Poland and
Slovakia hit a record high.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, these countries are also attaching more and
more importance to harmonious relations with Russia, seeing it as
a key to their continuing, patient efforts to be integrated into
NATO and the EU.
</P>
<P>
Without a doubt, entry into NATO remains the common strategic
goal of these central and eastern European countries and they want
to be seen as mutually supportive.
</P>
<P>
When the Polish and Slovak presidents met earlier this month,
they said neither would hinder the other's attempts to become
full members of NATO or the EU.
</P>
<P>
The EU has become an important trading partner with the region
in recent years. Two thirds of Poland's imports come from the EU
and 71 percent of the country's exports go to the EU.
</P>
<P>
However, as a whole, poor competitiveness and strict limits on
agricultural imports into the EU still plague these central and
eastern European countries in their attempts to integrate their
economies into the EU.

COLOMBO, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's navy blasted four
Tamil rebel boats off the northwestern coast on Saturday morning,
reports reaching here said today.
</P>
<P>
During a confrontation between the navy patrol and boats of the
Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), four LTTE boats were
blasted but a fifth boat escaped, the reports said.

<P>
The navy said at least two rebel soldiers were killed in the
incident.

last December, the navy has strengthened its presence along the
northwestern coast, where it observed a significant increase in
the activities of the Sea Tiger (the LTTE sea rebels).
</P>
<P>
The LTTE has been fighting a 13-year guerrilla war for a
separate state in the north and east of the country.

WELLINGTON, March 11 (Xinhua) -- The use of new 96 octane
unleaded petrol has raised concern over its safety in New Zealand
after four car fires were reported suspected of being caused by
using the new fuel.
</P>
<P>
Altogether, over 50 motorists have reported problems in their
cars since the petrol was introduced this year to phase out the
super-grade petrol containing lead which is harmful to human
health and the environment.
</P>
<P>
A parliament select committee has asked the four oil companies
in NZ, Shell, BP, Mobil and Caltex, to face questioning over the
issue Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Jim Bolger said today that if the new petrol is
not safe, it should not be sold.
</P>
<P>
"The oil companies make it and sell it. It is over to them to
produce a safe 96 octane unleaded petrol," he said.
</P>
<P>
The four oil companies have started urgent testing of car
components to determine whether the damage was caused by the new
fuel.

The foreign minister said that he might have a chance to meet
U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher next month. "When I
meet him, I would ask him if the United States has made a decision
to criiticize China on its military exercises as a 'reckless' and
'erroneous' move," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I would also ask the United States if their decision is
reckless and erroneous," he added.
</P>
<P>
"In the spring of 1995, the situation between the two sides of
the Taiwan Straits was very sound," he noted. "but later on,
tensions emerged in Taiwan Straits, precisely because of the
erroneous decision by the United States,"he added.
</P>
<P>
"I think it is up to the United States to consider how they can
change the situation there," he said.
</P>
<P>
The vice-premier also recalled that after Chinese President
Jiang Zemin made his eight-point speech on the Taiwan issue in
January of 1995, which attracted wide attention and endorsement
among all Chinese both at home and overseas, including Taiwan
people, the minister said, people were hopeful that positive
developments would occur in cross-Straits relations in 1995.
</P>
<P>
"Regrettably, what happened afterwards undermined that
situation and created tensions in relations between the two
sides," said Qian.
</P>
<P>
He said the responsibility does not lie with the Chinese
government, but with some Taiwan leaders as well as foreign forces
behind them who are attempting to create the "independence" of
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
"This is the root cause of the tension in the Taiwan Straits,"
the vice-premier said.
</P>
<P>
"The situation would ease if the Taiwan authorities mend their
way and return to the principle of one China, in deeds as well as
in words," he said.

<P>
Commenting on Singaporean senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew's

</P>
<P>
Qian said that he personally respects Lee and he knows that the
senior minister understands China's affairs very well. Foreign
leaders and governments, if they want to see the issue be resolved
through peaceful means, should support China's policy of peaceful
reunification and "one country, two systems", and not the
opposite.

DHAKA, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi President Abdur Rahman
Biswas will meet ruling party leaders today to seek a solution to
the country's prolonged political impasse following his
discussions with opposition leaders Sunday.
</P>
<P>
According to an official announcement, the ruling Bangladesh
Nationalist Party (BNP) delegation, led by party chief and Prime
Minister Begum Khaleda Zia, will hold discussions with the
president at 4:30 p.m. today.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the major opposition parties, led by Awami
(People's) League chief Sheikh Hasina, accepted the president's
invitations and held separate discussions with him Sunday
following the prime minister's request for the president's
initiative for a dialogue to resolve the political crisis.
</P>
<P>
The head of state gave the opposition leaders a patient hearing
to their opinions and said he would try to resolve the crisis on
the basis of the opinions and suggestions tendered by the leaders
of all political parties and with their help and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Asked about probable suggestions by his party at today's talks
with the president, BNP Joint Secretary General and Food and
Agriculture Minister Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan denied reports that the
ruling party was ready to negotiate the opposition's demand for
cancellation of the results of the February 15 parliamentary polls
boycotted by the opposition.

It was learnt that a round-table conference is likely to be
held shortly as a follow-up of the two-day meetings with the

<HEADLINE> Afghanistan Asks Pakistan to Drop Road Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, March 11 (Xinhua) -- The Afghan government Sunday
urged Pakistan to drop its plan to reconstruct a transit road
through the Afghan territory controlled by the Taliban student
militia, said a report reaching here today.
</P>
<P>
"Pakistan should not go ahead with the repair work on the road
as the region is a battlefield and anything could happen to their
project there," Afghan Foreign Minister Najibullah Lafrale was
quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Outrage was sparked in Kabul last week by reports of
Pakistan's plan to repair the road that passes through five
Taliban-held Afghan provinces.
</P>
<P>
The route reportedly links the Pakistani border town of Chaman
to Troghunday, a town in northwestern Afghanistan bordering
Turkmenistan.
</P>
<P>
"We do not object to the reconstruction of the road in
principle. In fact it would be very good for Afghans to have a
new transit route," said Lafrale.
</P>
<P>
But he stressed it was not the right time to repair the road
and without the Afghan government's permission either.
</P>
<P>
Relations between the Afghan and Pakistani governments have
been deteriorating since the uprising of Taliban last year.
</P>
<P>
The Afghan government has been accusing Pakistan of supporting
the Taliban war machine while Pakistan has categorically denied
the charge.

<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Former prime minister and
leader of the main ruling Nepali Congress (NC) party Girija Prasad
Koirala is almost certain to be elected NC president in the
forthcoming general convention of the party, according to the
official news agency rss.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba of the present coalition
government, believed to be a young generation leader of the NC
party, has reportedly said that he would support for Koirala's bid
for the party presidency during the party convention from the end
of this month.
</P>
<P>
Deuba said last week in an eastern Nepali district that efforts
were being made within the party to elect Koirala party chief
unanimously.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Koirala said Sunday that the NC party would take a
new turn for the better after he becomes the party president.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Koirala had attributed the NC loss in the last general
election to inner party differences which led his NC government to
step down in late 1994.
</P>
<P>
Koirala announced in January that he would run for the NC
president and so far, he was the only party leader who formally
announced candidacy for the party chief post.
</P>
<P>
Incumbent NC president Krishna Prasad Bhattarai has announced
he would not seek re-election in the forthcoming party convention.
</P>
<P>
The ninth general convention of the NC party was scheduled to
begin on march 31 in the western Nepali city of Nepalgunj.

<HEADLINE> Thailand to Join WTO Talks on Telecommunications </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Thailand is ready to join the
World Trade Organization (WTO) talks on the liberalization of
basic telecommunications services, Krirk-Krai, an official at the
Commerce Ministry was quoted by the local press today.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, officials at the Thai Transport and Communications
Ministry had said Thailand did not want to fully participate in
the WTO talks because the local industry might not be ready to
face open competition.
</P>
<P>
However, Krirk-Krai said as key WTO members, notably the US and
the European Union, are likely to force most WTO members to
endorse the agreement, Thailand might as well get involved in the
negotiating process to prevent the loss of benefits.
</P>
<P>
Thailand would fully comply with the requirements once the
international agreement on telecommunications services is
concluded, said Krirk-Krai, director-general of the Business
Economics Department of the Commerce Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's regulations banning the entry of foreign competitors
are mainly found in the Telegraph and Telephone Act, enacted in
1934, which provides for government monopolization in the
telecommunications sector.
</P>
<P>
The US last month offered to open its entire telecommunications
sector in a bid to press other WTO members to improve their
proposals on the issue.

BEIJING, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Taiwan is part of China and has
no right to have a seat in the UN, Chinese Foreign Minister Qian
Qichen said.
</P>
<P>
"The United Nations is an organization of sovereign states.
Taiwan, only a regional economy, is part of China. How can it be
eligible for membership of the United Nations?" Qian said at a
press conference hosted by the ongoing session of the National
People's Congress here today.
</P>
<P>
As for the question of Taiwan's activity of expanding
international space, Qian said Taiwan has already had rich
economic and trade relations with the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
"With regard to international space... What is Taiwan after?
It is after independence," he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
Bangkok, march 11 (Xinhua) -- Thai shrimps being exported to
the United States are farm-raised, according to Plodprasob
Suraswadi, director-general of the Fishery Department.
</P>
<P>
US officials have reacted to charges by environmental groups
that some Thai shrimps are harvested at sea using methods that
endanger sea turtles.
</P>
<P>
In fact, 95 percent of Thai shrimps are farm-raised, Plodprasob
was quoted by Today's Bangkok Post as saying.
</P>
<P>
Plodprasob hopes his department can begin issuing certificates
next month.
</P>
<P>
A US court has moved to ban shrimp imports starting in May from
53 countries, including Thailand, because of poor environmental
protection.
</P>
<P>
Thailand is the largest shrimp exporter in the world.

<HEADLINE> China to Improve Steel Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 11 (Xinhua) -- China will spare no effort to
improve product quality and varieties of the steel industry during
the Ninth Five-Year Plan period, which starts this year, to
fulfill the demand of national fast-growing economy.
</P>
<P>
More funds are needed to be injected into the sector to lift
production capacity and develop a wider range of products, today's
China's Daily quoted Liu Qi, minister of the metallurgical
industry, as saying at a recent work conference.
</P>
<P>
By the end of this century, China aims to meet domestic basic
demands for rolled steel used in power, railways, autos and ship
building industries. To be supplied domestically are 80 percent of
sheet metal for autos, 80 percent of cold-rolled silicon steel
sheet, and 70 percent of oil pipes and stainless steel.
</P>
<P>
China is expected to turn out over 96 million tons of steel by
the year of 2000, meeting 95 percent of domestic demand for all
kinds of rolled steel.
</P>
<P>
The international steel market is forecast to suffer a glut in
supply this year, thus the Chinese minister urged domestic steel
producers to take up the challenge and to improve themselves to be
more competitive both at home and abroad.
</P>
<P>
As one of the world's major steel producers, China turned out
an estimated 94 million tons of steel in 1995, up 1.39 million
tons over 1994.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Disagrees to Fully Liberalize Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Thailand disagrees with the
European Union (EU) proposal to fully liberalize investment here,
but it will proceed with a draft framework to promote investment,
according to Thai Deputy Prime Minister Amnuay Viravan.
</P>
<P>
The Asia-Europe investment promotion action plan was proposed
by Thai Prime Minister Banharn Silpa-Archa during the Asia-Europe
meeting earlier this month in Bangkok. It arose in response to
concern that European investment in Asia lagged behind investment
from the United States and Japan.
</P>
<P>
The action plan will identify opportunities and obstacles to
investment between Asian and EU countries. A draft is to be
completed within six months.
</P>
<P>
Amnuay was quoted today by the local newspaper Bangkok Post as
saying that each country has a different framework for foreign
investment, with different levels of openness depending on a
country's stage of development. Thus, any Asia-Europe framework
will be limited to broad areas regarding investment, product
standards, trans-border issues such as visas, work permits and
information support.
</P>
<P>
The EU has proposed a multilateral industrial investment code,
which relates to the investment framework of the Organization for
Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) -- the club of rich
nations. That elicited only lukewarm response from Asian leaders
at the Bangkok meeting.
</P>
<P>
The OECD framework sets no limits on those who invest in other
member countries. Thailand and other Asian countries are not yet
ready to subscribe to such an idea, said Amnuay.
</P>
<P>
"It might take at least 50 years for all member countries to be
ready to adopt such a framework," he said. The EU is now lobbying
for a committee to be set up under the World Trade Organization
(WTO) to study a multilateral investment code.
</P>
<P>
The WTO's framework is not as liberal as the OECD's. But the
WTO does have a declared goal to gradually eliminating limits on
foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
Currently, foreign investors in Thailand can hold only 25
percent of equity in finance firms and 49 percent in securities
firms. In addition, the alien business law reserves certain
activities exclusively for Thais.
</P>
<P>
The Thai government is amending these rules to accommodate more
foreign investment. And the Board of Investment (BOI) of Thailand
will continue its foreign investment promotion under WTO rules.
</P>
<P>
The Board of Investment expected to complete a draft investment
promotion plan by July, for discussion at the Asia-Europe business
forum in November in France.

<HEADLINE> Beijing City to Spend Heavily on Technical Renovation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 11 (Xinhua) -- The nation's capital plans to
rein in investment in fixed assets to within 58 billion yuan this
year, with more funds to be spent on technical renovation.
</P>
<P>
According to the Municipal Planning Committee, the investment
in fixed assets is estimated to grow by 9.4 percent in comparison
with that of 1995. The growth rate of investment in technical
renovation is expected to much higher than that of investment in
capital construction.
</P>
<P>
Macro control of investment scope will continue to be
strengthened in 1996, and investment in new projects will be put
under strict control, officials said.
</P>
<P>
The adjustment of the investment structure is aimed at solving
two problems, officials said.
</P>
<P>
The investment in technical renovation decreased last
year. This year 10.5 billion yuan will be put into technical
renovation, an increase of 16.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the adjustment of the investment structure for
commodity housing will continue. A total of 16 billion yuan will
be invested in commodity housing development, with the growth rate
dropping by nearly 25 percent in comparison with that of 1995.
</P>
<P>
The construction of luxury buildings will be put under strict
control, and projects such as luxury hotels, villas and
entertainment facilities will be banned during 1996, according to
the Municipal Planning Committee.

<HEADLINE> German Breuer Snatches Gold at Euro Indoor Athletics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, March 10 (Xinhua) -- German runner Grit Breuer
staged an impressive comeback to the track when she won the 400
meters gold on the last day of the European indoor championships
here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Breuer, competing in her first major event after her three-year
doping suspension ended last August, clocked 50.81 seconds, the
eighth best indoor of all time.
</P>
<P>
Breuer, 24, had been banned since 1992 along with sprinter
Katrin Krabbe, who repeatedly appealed against the disciplinary
measure, and Manuela Derr after the trio was tested positive for
steroid.
</P>
<P>
But Sunday's performance showed that she was regaining the
speed that won her the European 400 meters title and a silver
medal at the 1991 world championships in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, reigning outdoor European champion Du'aine Ladejo,
easily retained the indoor 400 meters title in 46.12 seconds,
suggesting he could be a serious medal contender in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
The Briton's time beat the 46.29 seconds stadium record set by
U.S. outdoor world champion Michael Johnson five years ago.
</P>
<P>
Two athletes also caught the audience's attention in the meet
of mostly low-class fields.
</P>
<P>
Spain's European junior champion Roberto Parra, 20, overtook a
vastly more experienced field to win the 800 title in one minute
47.74 seconds.
</P>
<P>
Alina Astafei of Germany won the women's high jump title in a
modest 1.98 meters but her victory was earned when officials of
her native Romania and her adopted country of Germany started a
brawl over her.
</P>
<P>
Romanian sports officials said they would not allow Astafei
compete for Germany unless Germany pays compensation to them.
</P>
<P>
An Olympic Charter clause indicates athletes could not compete
for an adopted country within three years of gaining citizenship
for another country.
</P>
<P>
Germany topped the final medals table with four golds, two
silvers and two bronzes, followed by Spain with four golds and a
bronze.

BEIJING, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Chinese vice-premier and foreign
minister Qian Qichen said here today that the Chinese government
has always been unswerving in pursuing the policy of "one country,
two systems" with regard to the issue of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
He told a press conference this morning that the central
government will grant Hong Kong Special Administration Region
(SAR) a high-degree autonomy, and its affairs will be managed by
the Hong Kong people. This policy has already been stipulated in
the legal form through the Basic Law of the SAR.
</P>
<P>
He cited this policy as enjoying the overwhelming support and
endorsement of the Hong Kong people, and he went to say that the
prosperity and stability of the Chinese mainland will continue to
provide a reliable guarantee for the long-term stability and
prosperity of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
As 1997 is drawing near, Qian noted, there will be a steady
increase in confidence by the Hong Kong people about the future of
Hong Kong. "I think this represents the trend of the times and the
aspiration of the people."
</P>
<P>
"It is my hope that the British side will do more practical
things and play a more constructive role (in this regard)," Qian
said. He also urged the British side not to do anything that might
undermine the confidence of the HongKong people.

But if we look at the reality, there are frequent troubles in our

<TEXT>
<P>
COPENHAGEN, March 10 (Xinhua) -- One man was killed and four
injured today in two motorcycle gang shootouts at Scandinavian
airports, police said today.
</P>
<P>
The shootings, which happened almost simultaneously at
Copenhagen and Oslo international airports on Sunday, appeared to
be part of a growing feud between rival Hell's Angels and Bandidos
biker gangs in Scandinavia.
</P>
<P>
One Bandidos member was shot dead and three were injured
when men armed with sub-machine guns opened fire at Copenhagen's
Kastrup airport. Police arrested sixteen Bandidos and Hell's
Angels rockers at the airport after the shooting and were
hunting for two gunmen believed to have escaped by car.
</P>
<P>
In Oslo, a Bandidos member was taken to hospital after being
shot in the chest at Fornebu airport. Motorcycle gangs were
also believed to be involved in that incident.
</P>
<P>
Police in Denmark said the Bandidos rockers had returned to
Copenhagen from a weekend meeting in Helsinki when they were
attacked by rival Hell's Angels gunmen waiting for them outside
the airport building.
</P>
<P>
There has been an escalation of violence in the internal feuding
between rival gangs of bikers throughout Scandinavia. Tensions
between the Bandidos and Hell's Angels rose after a shootout in
the southern Swedish town of Helsingborg on March 5 when four
people were arrested.

<P>
BEIJING, March 11 (Xinhua) -- China will work together with the
international community to conclude a treaty on nuclear test ban
within 1996, said Chinese Vice-Premier and Foreign Minister Qian
Qichen.
</P>
<P>
Qian made the remark in response to a question from a Japanese
reporter at a press conference hosted here today by the press
center of the ongoing session of the National People's Congress,
China's top legislature.
</P>
<P>
He said that China has always been for the complete prohibition
and destruction of nuclear weapons and that China is the first to
have pledged not to use nuclear weapons first or threaten the use
of nuclear weapons against nuclear weapon-free countries.
</P>
<P>
"This position of ours is in the interest of the vast number
of nuclear-free countries including Japan," he said.
</P>
<P>
"No other country with nuclear weapons has made such a
pledge," he said.
</P>
<P>
On nuclear testing, Qian said, "China has exercised utmost
restraint."
</P>
<P>
"China will work together with the international community to
conclude a treaty on nuclear test ban no later than within 1996,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
He assures nuclear-free countries including Japan not to
worry about China's nuclear testing.
</P>
<P>
He said he would push for strengthened relations between China
and Japan during his visit to the latter country around the turn
of this month.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Oil Company Wins Trademark Infringement Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, March 11 (Xinhua) -- The Intermediate People's Court
in the capital of east China's Zhejiang Province has found a local
enterprise guilty of infringing on the trademark of a well-known
Singapore company.
</P>
<P>
Zhu Guoqing, director of the Grain and Oil Packaging Plant of
Tonglu county of the province, who was using the "Jin long yu"
(Gold dragon fish) trademark was ordered by the court to pay
100,000 yuan in compensation to the plaintiff, a Singaporean grain
and oil company. He was also ordered to cover court costs
totalling 37,960 yuan.
</P>
<P>
The infringement was discovered in June of last year when the
Hangzhou plant was found to be selling oil products using a faked
trademark, according to a local source. He was forced to hand over
20,000 faked trademarks and 3,000 oil cans with the labels.
</P>
<P>
The local source said that the trademark "Jin long yu" and its
design were registered in the Chinese State Trademark Bureau by
the Singaporean company, and was valid from 1991 to 2000.

HANGZHOU, March 11 (Xinhua) -- East China's Zhejiang Province
is at the head of the list for afforestation among China's
provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities, according to a
recent national survey.
</P>
<P>
At present, some 87 percent of its land allocated for
afforestation has been planted with trees, and the forest coverage
in the province accounts for 54.6 percent of its area, one of the
highest in the country.

<P>
The province eliminated its barren hills in 1994, one year
ahead of schedule.

than ten million people in the province have been taking part in
tree planting activities.

<HEADLINE> China's Television Industry Set for Tough Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 11 (Xinhua) -- The Year 1996 is expected to be
tough on China's television manufacturers as import tariffs fall
on a market already facing a glut in supply, today's "China Daily"
said.
</P>
<P>
According to the Ministry of Internal Trade, total production
of color TVs increased 19.5 percent in the first eleven months of
1995 to reach 17.5 million. But, only 70 percent of these were
sold, including those sold abroad, pushing TV inventories in
State-owned stores up 17.7 percent to total 1.86 million during
the period.
</P>
<P>
Imported products will further exacerbate the situation when
their prices fall due to decreased tariff rates to be announced in
April, said ministry official Pei Yanpeng.
</P>
<P>
Hardest-hit will be companies making large-screen color TVs
with screens of 64-centimeters or greater, Pei said.
</P>
<P>
China's large-screen TV manufacturing technology development is
still in the initial stages and manufacturers often have to rely
on importing key parts.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the sales prices of domestically made,
large-screen color TVs are too high to compete with imported
products.
</P>
<P>
The domestic market is estimated to need 3.5 million color TVs
with screens of 64 centimeters and over in 1996, said Pei, adding
that the leading products in 1996's TV market will be color TVs
with 54-centimeter screens.
</P>
<P>
He said that domestic 54-centimeter screen TVs can compete with
imported products in quality and price.
</P>
<P>
The least popular products are 37 to 53-centimeter screens,
total demand for which will still be over one million, said Pei.
</P>
<P>
The supply of these small and medium-size TVs was short of
demand for a while in 1995. The market for these TVs consists of
hotels, low-income urban families and rural families recently
rising above the poverty line.
</P>
<P>
While market demand for color TVs is not expected to rise in
large cities, demand from medium and small cities and the
countryside will grow steadily.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Admitted To UN Population Commission </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria has been admitted to the
U.N. Commission on Population and Development, a special agency
co-ordinating population-related activities of member nations.
</P>
<P>
The admission would boost the population policy of the
Nigerian federal government, said Chairman of the National
Population Commission Chris Ugokwe here today.
</P>
<P>
Such issues as family planning, reproductive health and
reproductive rights, adolescence, maternal morbidity and
mortality, child survival and demography would also receive a
more appropriate focus, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Also to be in sharper focus are issues of gender equality,
equity and empowerment of women, male responsibilities and
participation and the girl child, said the chairman.
</P>
<P>
Ugokwe, who doubles as chairman of the African Population
Commission, said African countries would continue to depend on
aid to supplement family planning program, adding, however, that
time had come for the continent to establish its own
condom-producing factory.
</P>
<P>
Since it has a population of nearly 100 million, Nigeria is
the largest black country in the world.

<HEADLINE> Swaziland's Opposition Changes Executive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 10 (Xinhua) -- The entire executive
committee of Swaziland's main opposition party has been changed
and elections held secretly in Mbabane over the weekend, the
South African Press Association reported today.
</P>
<P>
The People's United Democratic Movement (PUDEMO), which
operates illegally in defiance of a 23-year-old ban on political
parties in the kingdom, Saturday elected an entirely new
executive committee at its weekend annual congress.
</P>
<P>
PUDEMO President Kislon Shongwe, who suddenly resigned a week
before the convening of the congress without furnishing reasons,
was replaced by one of the movement's founder members, Mario
Maseku.
</P>
<P>
Maseku has been a leading member of PUDEMO since its formation
as an underground political movement in the mid-1980s, following
the death of King Sobhuza II in 1983.
</P>
<P>
PUDEMO Secretary-General Domenic Mngomezulu was also replaced
by Mbonginkhosi Dlamini while a veteran PUDEMO woman activist
Zodwa Mkhonta was elected vice-president.
</P>
<P>
PUDEMO has led an active campaign aimed at ending the
non-party political system, reintroducing multi-party rule and
relieving ruling King Mswati III of his executive powers.
</P>
<P>
After King Sobhuza's death, the Liqoqo, a traditionalist
Supreme Council of State comprising senior members of the Swazi
royal family, assumed control of the country. It subsequently
dismissed the then Queen regent, Queen Dzeliwe.
</P>
<P>
Swaziland is the only southern African country in which all
political activities are banned by a royal decree in 1973.
</P>
<P>
But King Mswati III recently promised to introduce political
reforms and reinstate the constitution suspended by his father
late King Sobhuza in 1973.
</P>
<P>
Swaziland is a small land-locked country surrounded by South
Africa and Mozambique.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Refutes Cameroon's Mud-slinging </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria has dismissed Cameroon's
claim that Nigeria was the aggressor in the February 3 fighting
between the two countries in the Bakassi Peninsula, the News
Agency of Nigeria reported today.
</P>
<P>
The dismissal was contained in a documentary evidence
presented at the International Court of Justice at Hague, the
Netherlands, over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
Transcripts of the communication between the Nigerian soldiers
in the peninsula and the Nigerian defense headquarters were
presented to the court as proof that Nigeria was the victim of
"Cameroonian aggression", and not vice versa.
</P>
<P>
According to the transcripts, the Nigerian military formation
at West Atabong in Bakassi Peninsula, reported to the defense
headquarters Cameroon's "surprise attack" on Nigerians on the
island and was ordered by the headquarters to "maintain your
position, repulse Cameroonian attack and lose no ground."
</P>
<P>
The document was not immediately disputed by Cameroon during
the court session, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The two West African countries have long been at loggerheads
over the ownership of the oil-rich peninsula in the Gulf of
Guinea and have had armed clashes in the peninsula. The latest
one occurred in February this year and they accused each other of
mounting first attack on the other.
</P>
<P>
Cameroon first took the dispute to the world court in
February, 1994 after an armed clash happened between the two
countries.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, March 10 (Xinhua) -- President Frederick Chiluba today
urged Zambians, youths in particular, to work hard to achieve
the desired goals.
</P>
<P>
President Chiluba made the call at a gathering here to mark
the end of this year's Youth Week whose theme is "participation,
development and peace".
</P>
<P>
Chiluba said the Zambian people should be ready to face
challenges lying ahead.
</P>
<P>
It is the Zambian people who should build their own country by
applying concerted efforts, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba reminded that since Zambia attained independence in
1964, she has been receiving aid from the international
community, but that has not eradicated poverty in the country.
</P>
<P>
Only through hard work can Zambians reduce dependence on
foreign aid, he pointed out.

<HEADLINE> Big Donations to Presidential Race from American  Wealth Epicenters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 10 (Xinhua) -- An analysis of the big
donations -- those over 200 dollars -- that have fueled the 1996
U.S. presidential race makes one thing clear: those who bankroll
the campaigns are concentrated in the epicenters of American
wealth.
</P>
<P>
Both Senator Majority Leader Robert Dole and President Bill
Clinton raised more money from the 4,500 residents of Bloomfield,
Michigan, where the median household income is 150,000 dollars,
than they did from the 1 million residents of nearby Detroit.
</P>
<P>
Dole collected 92,125 dollars from Bloomfield Hills, nearly
four times his take from Detroit. Clinton raised 66,600 dollars
from the suburb, compared to 51,800 dollars from the city.
</P>
<P>
Millionaire publisher Steve Forbes is financing most of his
Republican presidential bid from his own fortune. But when he does
collect private donations, they are usually the maximum.
</P>
<P>
Forbes had the largest average donation, at 914 dollars -- just
under the 1,000 dollars maximum per person for primary candidates.
Dole (828 dollars) and Clinton (780 dollars) followed close
behind.
</P>
<P>
The contributor records do not include the thousands of
Americans who give less than 200 dollars to the presidential
campaigns because federal law does not require small donations to
be reported. But the 200 dollars-plus donations provide the bulk
of money the candidates spend.
</P>
<P>
"This is all a story about big money and big givers," said
Ellen Miller of the Center for Responsive Politics, a nonpartisan
group in Washington that studies political money.
</P>
<P>
Sixty percent,or 14,997 of Clinton's 25,000 biggest donors gave
at least 1,000 dollars, while Dole had 13,623 donors at the
1,000-dollar mark.
</P>
<P>
Clinton also collected 142,265 dollars from residents in
Washington D.C.'s prosperous Cleveland Park neighborhood, popular
among lawyers, retired diplomats and other capital players.

<HEADLINE> Al Official Calls for Solution to Palestinian Problem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 10 (Xinhua) -- An Arab League official today
called on the world leaders who will attend the anti-terrorism
summit in Egypt Wednesday to work out a just and honorable
solution to the Palestinian problem.
</P>
<P>
Said Kamal, Arab League Assistant Secretary General for
Palestinian affairs, was quoted by the Middle East News Agency
(MENA) as saying that no such a solution has been reached since
the inception of the Middle East peace process in 1991 though the
agreements signed between the Palestinians and Israel so far are
considered an important step toward achieving the land-for-peace
principle.
</P>
<P>
The official of the cairo-based organization said that the
Palestinians' attainment of their rights is the only way of
realizing peace and security.
</P>
<P>
The international summit on the Middle East peace process and
countering terrorism, to be attended by some 30 world leaders and
U.N. Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali, is scheduled to be
held in the Egyptian Red Sea resort town of Sharm el-Sheikh.
</P>
<P>
The summit, to be co-chaired by Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak and his U.S. counterpart Bill Clinton, was arranged in the
wake of the recent four suicide bombings in Israel, which
jeopardize the faltering peace process.
</P>
<P>
The Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) claimed responsibility
for the attacks, which killed a total of 62 people,
including the bombers.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopian Somalis Urged For Peace,Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, March 11 (Xinhua) -- An Ethiopian senior official
has urged Somalis in the country to work for regional peace and
development, the Ethiopian News Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
The call was made by Ethiopian Deputy Prime Minister and
Minister of Defense Ttamirat Layne when he opened a four-day
peace and development conference of the Somali Regional State in
Jijiga yesterday.
</P>
<P>
Tamirat said that development efforts in the region could not
be carried out as rapidly and smoothly as expected because of
ethnic problems created by few anti-people, anti-democratic
elements.
</P>
<P>
Equal participation of members of all ethnic groups and the
strengthening of infrastructure are indispensable to implementing
development plans,he said.
</P>
<P>
Tamirat said administrative justice can best be ensured not by
promoting individual members of ethnic groups to higher positions
but by facilitating and expanding regional development.
</P>
<P>
He called on all Somalis to bridge the gap created by trivial
differences and join forces for development and regional
prosperity.

<HEADLINE> Istanbul Police Report Breakthrough in Political Assassination </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, March 11 (Xinhua) -- The Istanbul police chief today
announced the capture of Irfan Cagrici, one of the Islamic
Movement Organization leaders believed to be involved in the
assassination of named secularist journalist Cetin Emec six years
ago.
</P>
<P>
Cagrici, the "brain" of Turkey's Islamist radicals, had been
sought by police several years and was finally captured in
Istanbul last week during a secret operation, said Istanbul police
chief Orhan Tasanlar.

<P>
Police believe Cagrici was involved in the March 1990 murder of
Cetin Emec, former editor-in-chief of leading newspaper Hurriyet,
as well as a series of political assassinations, bomb attacks and
kidnappings.
</P>
<P>
Cagrici reportedly went twice to Iran illegally and

The capture of Cagrici will bring to light many unsolved cases
concerning the Islamist radicals in Turkey, said local media
reports.
