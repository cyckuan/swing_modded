<HEADLINE> U.S. Economy Growth Slows Down in 2nd Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 31 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. economic growth slowed
sharply in the second quarter as the protracted GM strike cut in
output and companies reduced inventories, the Commerce Department
reported here Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Gross Domestic Product (GDP) grew at a 1.4 percent annual
rate in the second quarter, the weakest growth rate since 0.4
percent in the second quarter of 1995, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
This year's first-quarter growth was revised up to 5.5 percent
from 5.4 percent reported earlier.
</P>
<P>
However, the second-quarter performance was significantly
stronger than some economists prediction that output would be flat
instead of continuing to grow as it has since the last recession
ended in March 1991. Some analysts had even expected a slim
decline in output.
</P>
<P>
The department said the strike against General Motors Corp. had
cut growth by a full percentage point in the quarter by reducing
additions to inventories of completed vehicles.
</P>
<P>
GM output is expected to bounce back after a settlement this
week reopened plants, which would bolster the economy in the
second half of the year.
</P>
<P>
"The sharp slowdown in GDP growth was more than accounted for
by a sharp downturn in inventory investment, a larger decrease in
exports, and slowdowns in business purchases of producers' durable
equipment and consumer purchases of goods," the department said.
</P>
<P>
For the first time, the department reported GDP figures
excluding the vibrant computer industry, and said the economy grew
1 percent in the second quarter excluding this sector.
</P>
<P>
Strong buying of computers by businesses and consumers has been
making a growing contribution to the economy.
</P>
<P>
The department also noted that consumer spending on services
accelerated and defense spending was strong.
</P>
<P>
The report suggested robust domestic demand was offsetting a
drag from weakening exports to Asia.
</P>
<P>
The department said net exports fell at a record annual rate of
54.4 billion U.S. dollars in the quarter after dipping to a 49.5
billion dollar rate in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
Companies added fewer items to inventories in the quarter as
they sought to bring stocks into line with sales. Inventories rose
44.7 billion dollars in the quarter after a record 91.4 billion
dollars increase in the first quarter.

JOHANNESBURG, July 31 (Xinhua) -- The South African government
would cooperate fully with the United States authorities in the
latter's investigation into assault charges against a South
African diplomat, the Foreign Ministry said Friday.
</P>
<P>
"Should the prosecutor in the case formalize charges and serve
summons against the diplomat in question, the South African
government will, if requested by the U.S. Department of State,
waive the individual's diplomatic immunity in order that the
matter may be resolved," the ministry said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
A newspaper reported Friday that the Maryland state prosecutor
is weighing criminal assault charges against Ndumiso Ntshinga,
chief deputy of South African ambassador to the United States,
Franklin Sonn.
</P>
<P>
Ntshinga allegedly joined a highly charged fight between
guests at a South African national day party at his home in
Washington in April.
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Ministry said it has been discussing these
allegations with the U.S. State Department, and that it has
instructed legal counsel in the United States to investigate the
matter and to provide a report as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
Ambassador Sonn said Thursday that the embassy was cooperating
fully with the authorities. He said the allegations were untrue
and he was confident the charges against his deputy would be
dropped.

<HEADLINE> UK MPs Endorses Legislation for N.Irish Assembly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 31 (Xinhua) -- The British parliament passed on
Friday a legislation setting up a new Northern Ireland assembly,
which was part of a political deal aimed at ending 30-year-long
conflict in the divided province.
</P>
<P>
The bill was passed almost unaltered, even though some hardline
Protestant Unionist MPs tried to make it difficult for members
from Sinn Fein, the political wing of the Irish Republican Army
guerrilla group, to join the assembly's executive.
</P>
<P>
Sinn Fein has 18 seats in the assembly, which entitle it to two
executive posts.
</P>
<P>
But the government did agree to tighten rules which would expel
ministers and parties from the assembly if their commitment to
peace was in doubt.
</P>
<P>
Under the peace agreement which was reached last April, the
rival pro-British Unionists and pro-Irish Catholic Republicans
will sit together in the new assembly and share power in a new
executive of ministers from all the major parties.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Tightens Rules on Rallies, Processions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 31 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwean government Friday
issued new rules to control public gatherings and processions
which make it mandatory for organizers to notify or seek police
permission in writing not less than seven days before the event.
</P>
<P>
The new rules gazetted on Friday as statutory instrument 188
of 1998, under the Law and Order Act, also require conveners of
public gatherings and processions to specify in writing the
purpose of the gathering and the people to address it.
</P>
<P>
While public gatherings require written notification to the
police, public processions will now require a permit to be issued
by the police.
</P>
<P>
The application for a permit shall detail the names and
address of the applicant, the date, time and proposed route of
the procession.
</P>
<P>
Police would, however, retain the power to change or issue
further regulations with respect to any public gathering or
procession.
</P>
<P>
The new rules have come at a time when the Zimbabwe Congress
of Trade Unions is threatening the government with another mass
national strike over taxes, the Zimbabwe News Agency Ziana
reported.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Denies Deal With U.S. on Naval Base </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, July 31 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus Friday denied a report that
it has granted permission to the United States Navy to use one of
its ports as a maintenance and supply base.
</P>
<P>
Government spokesman Christos Stylianides told a press briefing
here that the two countries began to discuss the issue three years
ago, but nothing was achieved.
</P>
<P>
"So far there has been no agreement on this," he added.
</P>
<P>
The Cyprus Weekly magazine reported Friday that the Cypriot
government has allowed the U.S. Navy to use the port of Limassol
on southern coast as its maintenance and supply depot for its
Mediterranean-based Sixth Fleet.
</P>
<P>
The magazine quoted an unidentified official of the Cyprus
Ports Authority as saying that the port has been upgraded for the
safe mooring of American warships and submarines.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the spokeswoman for the U.S. Embassy in Nicosia,
Judy Baroody, said: "we have no knowledge of such a request."
</P>
<P>
He quoted the embassy's defense attache as saying that "we do
not make comments regarding (military) contracts."
</P>
<P>
Cypriot Foreign Minister Ioannis Kasoulides told the weekly
Thursday that he had not been fully informed about the details of
the deal, but he unreservedly voiced welcome to it.
</P>
<P>
"Apart from any political benefits, this also has an enormous
economic potential as well," Kasoulides said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Sixth Fleet is headquartered in Naples, Italy.

<HEADLINE> S. African Minister Visits Volatile Region </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 31 (Xinhua) -- South African Safety and
Security Minister Sydney Mufamadi arrived in Richmond in
KwaZulu-Natal province Friday to determine the security situation
in the massacre-torn region.
</P>
<P>
His visit came in the wake of Tuesday's slaying of nine
people, including four children, near Richmond, west of Durban.
At least 39 people have been gunned down in Richmond village and
surrounding townships since July 3.
</P>
<P>
Mufamadi said the warrants of arrest were issued for possible
suspects involved in the violence. But he declined to elaborate,
South African Press Association SAPA reported.
</P>
<P>
More soldiers would arrive in the area Saturday to assist
about 800-men security forces already deployed there, Mufamadi
said.
</P>
<P>
The minister was scheduled to officially switch on the power
of six mast lights erected in flash point areas in townships
surrounding the village.
</P>
<P>
Police said that the lighting would help them in policing the
area where visibility after sunset was virtually nil.
</P>
<P>
The failure of police to curb violence in Richmond has drawn
sharp criticism from political parties and KwaZulu-Natal
communities. The recent slaughter of nine people sparked a
protest of local residents, who said police were protecting
criminals instead of protecting them.

</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Egypt decided to participate in the construction of
two new cement plants in Syria, which will annually produce 1
million tonnes of cement, 500,000 tonnes each, Egyptian press
reporter Friday.
</P>
<P>
The plants are aimed at bridging the gap between Syria's cement
consumption that amounts to 4 million tonnes and its production
capability of only 3 million tonnes a year.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the Egyptian Holding Co. for Mining and
Refractories Mohammed Basyouni said his company would send experts
to Syria within the next 18 months to offer advice on the
rehabilitation and vertical expansion of the existing Syrian
cement plants.

<HEADLINE> 105 Killed in Bula, Angola: U.N. Observer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, July 31 (Xinhua) -- Only 105 people were killed in the
July 21 massacre in Bula Town in Angolan northeastern Lunda-Norte
Province, the spokesman of the United Nations observer mission to
Angola confirmed Friday.
</P>
<P>
In an exclusive interview with Xinhua, the U.N. spokesman,
David Wimhurst, added it could not be proved that the rebel UNITA
movement had anything to do with the killings.
</P>
<P>
after the preliminary investigation by the U.N. mission,
Wimhurst said, only 105 bodies, not 215, as claimed by the
Angolan government and national media, were found in the site of
the massacre.
</P>
<P>
The dead included nationals from Angola, the Democratic
Republic of Congo, Mali and Senegal, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, the spokesman said one witness charged that the UNITA
was responsible for the massacre, saying he saw around 40 UNITA
men shooting at defenseless citizens who were shopping at the
market.
</P>
<P>
The massacre last week has caused chaos among the Angolan
people, upsetting the peace process and worsening the political
and military situation in the war-ravaged southern African
country.
</P>
<P>
The propaganda campaign has increased since the death of U.N.
mediator Alione Blondin Beye in an air crash over the Cote
d'Ivoire on June 26.
</P>
<P>
Wimhurst also disclosed that in order to help the Angolans to
get rid of the increasingly serious crisis, the new U.N. envoy to
Angola, Lakhdar Brahimi, is scheduled to arrive in Luanda on
Friday afternoon on a five-day visit.
</P>
<P>
During his stay here, Brahimi will hold talks with Angolan
President Jose Eduardo Dos Santos and UNITA President Jonas
Savimbi to persuade them to comply with the 1994 Lusaka Peace
Accords word by word so as to achieve lasting peace in the
country.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: SAARC Moves Further in Economic Cooperation, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, July 31 (Xinhua) -- More than a year after they set
the ambitious target of creating a free trade zone in the region
by the year 2001, South Asian leaders at the Colombo summit
resolved to stick to the goal with measures to speed up trade
liberalization in the region.
</P>
<P>
But the measures adopted at the summit of the South Asian
Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) seemed, as many
agreed, to be overshadowed to a considerable extent by the
unresolved political issues, particularly the worrying security
situation in the region in the wake of the nuclear tests carried
out by India and Pakistan in May this year.
</P>
<P>
At their three-day summit which ended on Friday, the leaders of
the seven SAARC members -- Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, the
Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka -- reaffirmed, as widely
expected, their commitment to the goal of establishing a South
Asian Free Trade Area (SAFTA) by the year 2001.
</P>
<P>
The timetable was decided on at SAARC's Male summit in May last
year, four years ahead of the previous deadline of 2005.
</P>
<P>
SAARC, formed in 1985 to speed up economic development and
social progress among member states through regional cooperation
in trade, economy and other fields, took a first step towards
forming SAFTA by creating the South Asian Preferential Trading
Arrangement (SAPTA) in 1995, under which member countries exchange
tariff concessions in more than 2,000 items.
</P>
<P>
Two rounds of trade negotiations under SAPTA have already been
completed. In Colombo, the SAARC leaders decided to bring the
year-long third round to an early conclusion and accelerate
progress in the next round.
</P>
<P>
And deeper preferential tariff concessions are to be extended
to products being actively traded among members and discriminatory
practices and non-tariff barriers removed on items in which tariff
concessions are granted.
</P>
<P>
"Measures to remove structural impediments should also be taken
in order to move speedily towards the goal of SAFTA," the leaders
said in their declaration adopted in Colombo Friday.
</P>
<P>
Among other numerous agreed areas of cooperation, the SAARC
leaders also reiterated their commitment to eradicate poverty in
one of the poorest regions in the world at the earliest time
possible, "preferably by the year 2002," which is a daunting task.
</P>
<P>
In the face of the serious threat of terrorism and drug
trafficking in the region, they called for swift enactment of
legislation to implement SAARC's regional conventions on terrorism
and drugs.
</P>
<P>
Reiterating serious concern at the plight of many women and
children who are the victims of trafficking, the leaders said they
would sign a regional convention on combating the crime of
trafficking in women and children for prostitution and other
purposes at their next summit in Kathmandu, Nepal in the second
half of 1999.
</P>
<P>
Alarmed by what they described as "unpredictable" global
economic changes, as have been manifested by increased
globalization and financial crises -- like the one in Southeast
Asia, the SAARC leaders decided to strengthen regional and
bilateral cooperation in meeting both the challenges and
opportunities and realizing "the full potential of South Asia."
</P>
<P>
The leaders' decisions at Colombo may not be so spectacular,
yet their resolve and determination to move forward and catch up
with the rest of the world in face of mountains of difficulties
are winning admiration.
</P>
<P>
The worrying episode of the summit was that the bilateral
meeting between the prime ministers of Pakistan and India, which
had been the focus of world attention against the backdrop of a
new security environment in South Asia, ended in Colombo without
any achievement.
</P>
<P>
The nuclear tests conducted by India, as well as by Pakistan
which did so in a tit-for-tat manner, have prompted fears of a
nuclear arms race in the region.
</P>
<P>
It seems that no body can be sure how the clock of the SAARC
progress would be set back by the nuclear tests. SAARC deals
chiefly with economic issues and its charter prohibits any
discussion of contentious political issues.
</P>
<P>
The Colombo Declaration says the SAARC leaders recognize that
"the aims of promoting peace, stability and amity and accelerated
socio-economic cooperation may best be achieved by fostering good
neighborly relations, relieving tensions and building confidence,"
and that the process of informal political consultations, set up
in Male last year, "would prove useful in this regard."
</P>
<P>
But that still brings little inspiration to those who cherish
the hope that a peaceful environment would prevail some day in the
region in the interest of the well-being and prosperity of the
people there.

<HEADLINE> British Miners Set to Win Damages Payment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 31 (Xinhua) -- Twenty-five thousand British coal
miners suffering from Vibration White Finger were set to receive
damages totalling 500 million pounds (800 million U.S. dollars)
following an appeal court ruling on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Appeal court judges cut the damages levels in just two out of
the nine test cases brought against British Coal.
</P>
<P>
They said British Coal should have warned miners to report
symptoms as quickly as possible and have carried out proper health
checks on the work force.
</P>
<P>
Vibration White Finger is a form of Raynaud's Phenomenon, in
which vibration affects the blood supply to peripheral parts of
the body and causes tingling, numbness and pain. There is usually
a loss of dexterity with damage both to the brain and blood
vessels.

<HEADLINE> Russia Calls on Lifting Embargo on Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 31 (Xinhua) -- Russia suggests that the U.N.
Security Council should discuss the lifting of oil embargo against
Iraq, though there are some existing problems, the Itar-Tass news
agency report on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a news briefing Foreign Ministry spokesman Vladimir
Rakhmanin said that despite some existing problems concerning
Iraq's past nuclear program, certain progress and the "technical
picture" of the nuclear situation allow the International Atomic
Energy Agency (IAEA) to begin the implementation of long-term
monitoring plan.
</P>
<P>
He said that this initiative was put forth by Russia and other
U.N. Security Council permanent members.
</P>
<P>
According to the Russian spokesman, on July 29, the U.N.
Security Council discussed the IAEA director general's report on
"the state of affairs in the nuclear dossier" of Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Russia will seek to give a new impetus to \h6s issue and is
calling on the U.N. Security Council chairman to adopt a brief
resolution or to make a statement on the comprehensive transfer to
monitoring after Iraq approves the legislation on the punishment
of persons accused of violating U.N. Security Council disarmament
resolutions, the Russian spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Rakhmanin pointed out that such decision will stimulate Iraq to
develop further cooperation with the U.N. and allow to join
efforts aimed at eliminating missiles, chemical and biological
weapons.
</P>
<P>
He stressed Russia hopes that this will be possible in October
during regular debates in the U.N. Security Council to be focused
on other IAEA reports and the results of the UNSCOM work.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Welcomes Sudan's Statement on Arms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 31 (Xinhua) -- South African National
Conventional Arms Control Committee (NCACC) Friday welcomed an
announcement by the Sudanese ambassador to South Africa clearing
Pretoria of illegally smuggling arms to Sudanese rebels.
</P>
<P>
"This confirms what we said earlier, that the South African
government has not supplied arms to rebels in Sudan," NCACC
Chairman Kader Asmal said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Friday, Ambassador Nasr Eddin Ahmed Idrisse told a
Sudanese newspaper that there was no evidence backing up such a
claim against the South African government. But he did not clear
individual weapons dealers of the charges.
</P>
<P>
A recent South African television report charged that South
African arms traders supplied Colonel John Garang's Sudan
People's Liberation Army (SPLA) with weapons and other military
equipment.
</P>
<P>
The report claimed that in exchange for arms, the suppliers
get mining concessions in southern Sudan or the right to cut
timber there.
</P>
<P>
Asmal said the South African government would be pleased to
receive the names of the companies which were said to be arming
the Sudanese rebels. "This would help us to investigate these
allegations," he said.
</P>
<P>
The South African official said he personally believed there
could be South Africans who were illegally supplying Sudanese
rebels with arms from elsewhere, in Africa.
</P>
<P>
Asmal, who is also Water Affairs Minister, said should these
individuals be found, they would be liable to heavy fines in
terms of regulations on illegal arms dealing.

TUNIS -- The International Advertising Association has recently
opened a new branch in Tunis to facilitate its activities in the
Tunisian market and help its agents form partnerships with
Tunisian counterparties, local daily Al-Sabah reported today.
</P>
<P>
In the past years, Tunisia has witnessed an increase in the
number of foreign advertising agencies operating on its land.
</P>
<P>
These agencies seek to satisfy the needs of the world firms
that want to enter the Tunisian market as well as the needs of the
local firms that have increasingly recognized the importance and
effect of advertisements in promoting their market sales.
</P>
<P>
TUNIS -- The dairy sector accounts for 7.6 percent of the total
value of Tunisia's farm production and 22 percent of the total
animal production, the latest issue of the AL-Zeraa (Agriculture)
magazine reported.
</P>
<P>
The government is carrying out a plan for developing this
sector with the aim to achieve self-sufficiency in the dairy
supply. Under the plan, 790,000 tonnes of diary products are
expected to be produced annually by the year 2000 against 523,000
tonnes in 1994, an annual increase of 8 percent.
</P>
<P>
Until then, the self-sufficiency rate of diary products in
Tunisia be increased from the 67 percent in 1994 to 100 percent.

CAIRO -- Egypt's Minister of Petroleum Hamdi El-Banbi said the

</P>
<P>
Alf Akitian will open a series of gas and auto service stations
on the highways. It has also made bids for oil and gas exploration
in west of Delta on the Mediterranean coast.
</P>
<P>
Total has also offered to build gas stations and provide auto
service as well as oil marketing services.
</P>

The two French firms had taken part in the discovery and development
of gas fields on Egypt's northern coast and the oil fields in some
areas in the Suez Gulf.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa to Revamp Financial Management </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 31 (Xinhua) -- The South African Finance
Department Friday unveiled a draft legislation to modernize
government's financial management and crack down on national and
provincial officials guilty of overspending.
</P>
<P>
The draft Treasury Control Bill proposes that the accounting
officers of national and provincial departments, usually the
directors-general, ensure their departments have efficient and
transparent financial management systems.
</P>
<P>
They will also be responsible for the prevention of
unauthorized spending, and will have to report impending
overspending on their budget votes to the national or provincial
cabinets and finance departments.
</P>
<P>
The national finance minister will be obliged to issue
regulations setting up disciplinary boards to hear charges of
financial mismanagement, including overspending and late
submission of year-end accounts.
</P>
<P>
Sanctions may include a reprimand, fine, suspension, demotion,
and recommendations of criminal prosecution or dismissal.
</P>
<P>
The bill outlines the functions and powers of the national and
provincial treasuries, how revenue should be controlled and the
budget process. Every treasury has to publish a monthly report
on its finances.
</P>
<P>
The bill, which was compiled on the basis of best practice in
other countries, is expected to go through parliament before the
end of September, a finance department official said.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Police Prevent Militants' Attack Against </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 31 (Xinhua) -- Iranian police Friday stopped
Islamic radicals from attacking the offices of a weekly accused of
insulting the late supreme leader Ayatollah Khomeini.
</P>
<P>
More than 10 Islamic militants allied with hard-liners in the
government tried to enter the building of the Khaneh weekly, but
were stopped by 30 baton-wielding policemen.
</P>
<P>
They argued with the police but left without trouble.
</P>
<P>
The attempted attack was triggered by a letter published by the
newspaper recently, which was alleged to have insulted the Islamic
sanctities and Khomeini, the leader of Iran's 1979 Islamic
Revolution.
</P>
<P>
In the letter, a woman writer blamed Khomeini for the 1980-1988
Iran-Iraq war that left thousands of Iranian youths dead, and she
also doubted the late leader's wisdom in issuing an order to
murder the British writer Salman Rushdie, who was charged for
defaming Islam by his novel Satanic Verses.
</P>
<P>
The managing director of the weekly, Mohammad-Reza Zaeri, has
been taken into custody and will be tried on Monday for printing
the letter.
</P>
<P>
The militants Monday threw a petrol bomb at the paper's office
and threatened the editors on a telephone call.
</P>
<P>
Khomeini, who also led Iran in the 1980-88 war with Iraq, is
portrayed as a saint by the clergy in Iran and any criticism of
Khomeini has been taboo.
</P>
<P>
The publication of the letter resulted from a free press policy
being promoted by Iranian President Mohammad Khatami, a moderate
cleric who came to power last August.

<HEADLINE> Israeli-allied Militiaman Killed in Roadside Bomb </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, July 31 (Xinhua) -- A soldier of the pro-Israeli South
Lebanon Army (SLA) was killed in a roadside bombing in southern
Lebanon Friday, reports reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
When the explosion occurred, the soldier was driving with his
12-year-old sister in a pickup truck on a road near the town of
Jezzine in the Israeli-proclaimed South Lebanon Security Zone, the
reports said.
</P>
<P>
His sister was injured in the blast, apparently detonated by
remote control. She was sent to a nearby hospital for treatment.
</P>
<P>
Jezzine is 20 kilometers north of Marjayoun, the biggest town
in the occupied zone that is run by the Israeli-backed SLA.
</P>
<P>
No one has claimed responsibility so far for the bombing.
</P>
<P>
Israel has occupied the 1,200-square-kilometer security zone
since 1985 with the alleged aim to protect its northern territory
from cross-border attacks by Lebanese Muslim guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
There are about 2,000 Israeli troops and 2,500 SLA soldiers
deployed in the zone.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, one Israeli soldier was killed and five others
wounded in an ambush in south Lebanon by the Hezbollah (Party of
God) gunmen.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian-backed Hezbollah has been leading the Lebanese
resistance movement to oust Israel from the zone, inflicting a
heavy death toll on both Israeli and SLA soldiers.

<HEADLINE> ECOWAS Sets Up Committee on Guinea Bissau </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 31 (Xinhua) -- The Economic Community of West African
States (ECOWAS) has constituted a special committee on the resolution
of crisis in Guinea Bissau, where rebellious troops have been battling
to unseat President Joao Bernado Vierra since early June.
</P>
<P>
The committee, comprising Burkina Faso, Cote d'Ivoire, Gambia,
Ghana, Guinea and Nigeria, was set up at the end of a recent two-day
meeting of the ministers of defense, internal affairs and security in
Banjul, Gambia, the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, the ministers considered the draft mechanism on
conflict prevention, management and resolution as well as peacekeeping
and security in the sub-region.
</P>
<P>
With the composition of the committee, ECOWAS has begun the
implementation of its three-pronged strategy, adopted early this month
in Abidjan, Cote d'Ivoire, by ECOWAS foreign ministers on the
resolution of the crisis in Guinea Bissau.
</P>
<P>
The strategy is expected to graduate from dialogue to sanctions
before military intervention as the last resort.
</P>
<P>
Member states are expected to contribute troops for effective
intervention by the west African peacekeeping force known as ECOMOG.
</P>
<P>
ECOWAS Executive Secretary Lansana Kouyate is soon to produce a
list of countries ready to contribute troops to ECOMOG, Nigeria's Head
of State General Abdulsalam Abubakar, who is ECOWAS chairman, said
early this week.
</P>
<P>
The intervention by ECOMOG into Guinea Bissau is at the behest of
President Vierra of that country.
</P>
<P>
The draft mechanism envisages the establishment of an observation
system for conflict prevention as well as the establishment of new
organs for mediation, including a security council and council of
elders, NAN said.
</P>
<P>
It also provides for the expansion of the capacity of the ECOWAS
executive secretary with the aim of conflict prevention, mangement and
resolution, as well as the intervention of ECOWAS in the internal
affairs of member countries.
</P>
<P>
The draft mechanism invests ECOMOG with the mandate to engage in
all forms of military intervention within the framework of actions
taken by ECOWAS.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Pledges Support to Palestinians Despite </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, July 31 (Xinhua) -- Turkey on Friday pledged full
support to the Palestinian cause despite its increasingly warm
relationship with Israel.
</P>
<P>
The promise was made here by Turkish President Suleyman Demirel
to visiting Palestinian National Authority (PNA) President Yasser
Arafat.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after their meeting, Demirel blamed
Israel for the stalled Middle East peace talks: "It is policies
that cannot be condoned that have lead to the failure of the
Middle East peace process."
</P>
<P>
The Turkish leader promised that Turkey would give its "full
support to the Palestinian cause" and would use its influence with
the Jewish state to get the peace process moving again.
</P>
<P>
Demirel's promise came despite the fact that Turkey and Israel
have been forging closer strategic ties since 1996 after the
signing of a military cooperation deal.
</P>
<P>
Israeli fighter pilots have been training in Turkish airspace,
and Israeli experts are upgrading Turkish warplanes with its
advanced aviation and electronic technologies.
</P>
<P>
The two sides have also been making efforts to increase
bilateral trade and economic ties.
</P>
<P>
Arafat arrived in Ankara Friday morning from Morocco where he
attended a conference held by the Organization of Islamic
Conference on the future of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The meeting mainly dealt with the Israeli decision in June to
expand the municipal boundaries of the disputed holy city
Jerusalem to annex some Jewish settlements in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
The PNA denounced the Israeli move as a violation of Oslo
accords, which bar both sides from taking unilateral steps to
change the status of Jerusalem that should be settled through the
final status talks.
</P>
<P>
Arafat on Friday repeated concerns over increased efforts by
Israel toward what he called "Judaization" of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
"We appreciate continuing efforts to prevent the Judaization
of Al Quds (Jerusalem)," Arafat said. "I hope that we will
meet in (Jerusalem) and to pray together."
</P>
<P>
Arafat was scheduled to fly to Paris Saturday for talks with
French President Jacques Chirac, who has been pushing with Egypt
for an international conference to discuss the stall in the
Mideast peace process.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli-Palestinian talks have been stalled since March
last year when Israel began building a settlement in the Arab East
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The sticking point now is Israel's refusal to accept a peace
initiative put forward by the United States calling for the
handover of another 13 percent of the West Bank to the PNA.
</P>
<P>
Israeli and Palestinian negotiators resumed the direct talks on
July 19 to discuss the U.S. peace plan, but the talks quickly hit
a snag due to the Israeli intransigence.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Cypriots Attack European Court Ruling on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, July 31 (Xinhua) -- The Turkish Cypriots Friday
attacked a European court ruling on a Greek Cypriot refugee's
property, saying it meant the death of Cyprus' peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash said the ruling by the
Strasbourg-based European Court of Human Rights "is biased and
politically-motivated."
</P>
<P>
The decision led to the "total closure of all doors" between
the Turkish Cypriots and the Greek Cypriots, Denktash said.
</P>
<P>
The European court has ordered Turkey to pay 320,000 Cyprus
pounds (704,000 U.S. dollars) to Titina Loizidou, a Greek Cypriot
refugee, for depriving her of access to her property in Kyrenia,
a port in northern Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
The Cypriot government has welcomed the ruling as "a landmark
decision" that sets a legal precedent for all 180,000 Greek
Cypriot refugees from the north.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Turkish Cypriot-controlled
north and the Greek Cypriot-control south since 1974 when Turkish
troops took over the northern third of the Mediterranean island
after a failed coup in Nicosia by the Greek Cypriots seeking union
with Greece.
</P>
<P>
"Until the decision is reversed, there will be no discussions
with the Greek Cypriot side," Denktash said.
</P>
<P>
The United States and the European Union (EU) have been pushing
for the resumption of the U.N.-sponsored peace talks between the
two Cypriot communities.
</P>
<P>
The Cyprus peace process has been suspended since last August
when Denktash walked out of the negotiations in protest against
the EU decision to start membership talks with Cyprus.

WASHINGTON, July 31 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton on
Friday promised to testify "completely and truthfully" in the
Monica Lewinsky probe. "No one wants to get this matter behind us
more than I do," he told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said this public comments of his would be his last on
the matter until he testifies to Whitewater prosecutor Kenneth
Starr scheduled for August 17.
</P>
<P>
"I am looking forward to the opportunity in the next few days
of testifying. I will do so completely and truthfully. I am
anxious to do it," he said.
</P>
<P>
"But I hope you can understand why in the interim, I can and
should have no further comment on these matters."
</P>
<P>
Clinton's comments, his first since his decision to testify was
announced Wednesday, came in a brief Rose Garden exchange with
reporters.
</P>
<P>
As he spoke, lawyers familiar with the case said, the FBI was
set to begin forensic testing of one of Lewinsky's dresses, a key
piece of evidence in the last weeks of an investigation into
alleged presidential sex and cover-up, news reports said.
</P>
<P>
The dress and the pending testimony of Lewinsky, the president
and a few others are likely the last matters in the evidence phase
of Starr's Lewinsky investigation. Then, Starr must decide what he
should report to the House about potentially impeachable offenses.

ATHENS, July 31 (Xinhua) -- Turkey would place itself outside
the European chart for human rights and as a result out of the
Council of Europe and the European stage if it refused to abide by
a European court decision concerning compensation to a
Greek-Cypriot woman, the Greek Foreign Ministry said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Strasbourg-based European Court of Human Rights ruled on
Wednesday in favor of Titina Loizidou and ordered Turkey to pay
700,000 U.S. dollars for depriving her of property she owns in
Kyrenia, northern Cyprus which has been occupied by Turkey since
1974, but Turkey Thursday rejected the decision and argued that
the court's judgement lacked "the means of applicability and

WASHINGTON, July 31 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank announced here
Friday the approval of a 28 million U.S. dollar loan to expand
coverage and improve the quality of preschool and elementary
education in Uruguay.
</P>
<P>
The second education project aims to expand coverage of
preschool education to near-universal levels for children ages
four and five and to improve the quality of primary education,
focusing on socio-economically disadvantaged areas.
</P>
<P>
Uruguayans will benefit from an increase in the coverage of
single-shift, full-time schools, which will afford 33,500 children

<HEADLINE> Acid Leak on Train Shuts Down Highway </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 31 (Xinhua) -- A train tanker car carrying a
hydrochloric acid solution sprang a leak Friday, forcing the
evacuation of several commercial buildings and the closure of a
highway in Massachusetts of the United States.
</P>
<P>
At least one man was taken to Somerville Hospital after
complaining of feeling ill, The Associated Press reported.
</P>
<P>
Friday morning, the car hit a piece of metal in a rail yard,
splitting open and leaking the liquid chemical, which is toxic to
inhale or ingest.
</P>
<P>
Mark McKeon of the Federal Railroad Administration said
investigators en route called the leak "relatively minor" and said
it was dripping, not gushing.
</P>
<P>
Hydrochloric acid is not usually deadly, but can cause a
temporary burning sensation when it comes in contact with a
person's eyes or lungs.
</P>
<P>
Firefighters on the scene said the liquid that spilled was 28
percent hydrochloric acid and 72 percent water.
</P>
<P>
A nearby Maytag distributorship and a six-story building were
evacuated, and police closed part of the McGrath/O'Brien Highway,
creating traffic jams at the tail end of rush hour.
</P>
<P>
John Nadolny, general counsel for Guilford Transportation
Industries, which is responsible for the rails, said the tanker
car had come from Virginia and was destined for Eastman Gelatin
Co. in Peabody. The acid was to be used in making gelatin, said
Paul Carter, a manager at Eastman.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Urges Obuchi Government to Act Quickly on Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 31 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton on
Friday urged Japan's new government, led by Keizo Obuchi, to move
quickly and effectively to stimulate its mired-economy so that it
could lead Asia out of its financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
"It is especially important for Asia and for our economy that
the new Japanese government move forward quickly and effectively
to strengthen its financial system and stimulate and open its
economy," Clinton told reporters in a brief appearance in the
White House Rose Garden.
</P>
<P>
"It's going to be very, very difficult for Asia to recover
unless its leading economy -- Japan -- leads the way," he added.
</P>
<P>
Japan's recession-hit economy has also affected the United
States. The Commerce Department said in a report on Friday that
the U.S. economic growth is slackening during the April-June
quarter.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the report, Clinton said one reason for the
slow growth was the ripple effect from Asia's economic crisis,
which has reduced demand for key American exports.
</P>
<P>
"We are feeling the direct, discernible effects of the Asian
economic downturn," he said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton welcomed Keizo Obuchi to be elected new Japanese
Prime Minister and Obuchi's selection of former Prime Minister
Kiichi Miyazawa as finance minister.
</P>
<P>
"I welcome the election of the new prime minister, as well as
the former prime minister Mr. Miyazawa as the new finance
minister," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We want to work with them and we hope this new government
can find the keys to restore to the Japanese people, who have a
great economy and a great society, the growth that they
deserve," he said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said he would call Obuchi on Saturday. White House
spokesman Mike McCurry told reporters that the president hoped
to meet Obuchi as early as September in U.N. General Assembly in
New York.

prospects.
</P>
<P>
"We learned a lot from Malaysia and get to know their success
and problems," said Chissano.
</P>
<P>
Cooperation between the two countries has made positive
achievement since his visit to Malaysia in March, 1997, Chissano
said, noting that nothing can stop the progress of such
cooperation despite problems facing Malaysia.

of a Malaysian bank in Maputo. Businessmen of the two countries
also signed a deal on a construction project involving over 50
million U.S. Dollars.

for home.

LONDON, July 31 (Xinhua) -- Police and government officers have
made the first seizure of Viagra, the illegal anti-potence drug,
after a raid on a sex shop in central London, the BBC reported
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Fourteen boxes containing a total of 60 pills of the drug were
taken from the shop during a joint operation by the Metropolitan
Police, the Westminster Council and the Medicines Control Agency
(MCA).
</P>
<P>
After spotting a sign in the window advertising the drug, some
MCA officer made a test purchase from the premises, and then
grouped up and returned to raid the shop.
</P>
<P>
A 38-year-old employee in the shop was being questioned by the
police, the BBC said.
</P>
<P>
Viagra, made by U.S. pharmaceutical company Pfizer Inc and due
to be licensed in the UK in the autumn, at the moment is a banned
substance in the country.
</P>
<P>
Even being licensed, the drug will only be available through
prescription from doctors or hospitals.
</P>
<P>
"Viagra is not available to the general public and we'll do
anything we can to prevent illegal sales," an official from the
Westminster Council's licensing sub-committee, was quotes as

<HEADLINE> U.S. Congress Puts Off Vote on IMF Funding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 31 (Xinhua) -- Despite the Clinton
administration's plea, Republicans in Congress have put funding
for the International Monetary Fund (IMF) on hold until at least
September.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Republican-controlled House of Representatives and
Senate had been expected to hold critical floor votes before the
August recess on legislation to replenish IMF reserves, drained by
bailouts for Russia and some Asian nations.
</P>
<P>
President Bill Clinton urged Congress to approve the IMF an 18
billion U.S. dollars cash boost to prevent financial crises from
spreading to other emerging markets, and to limit their impact on
the United States and other industrial economies.
</P>
<P>
"I urge Congress to do this quickly, and not to put at risk our
prosperity," Clinton told reporters at the White House on Friday.
"Congress should step up to its responsibility, put... progress
ahead of partisanship, and renew our commitment and pay our fair
share to the IMF."
</P>
<P>
But the Republican leadership, betting the U.S. economy is
strong enough to withstand pressure from Asia for now, opposes the
proposal to bring forward the debate.
</P>
<P>
Strong opposition from House Republican Leader Richard Armey of
Texas this month forced the postponement of legislation that
includes 3.4 billion dollars for the IMF.
</P>
<P>
This would have paid Washington's share of the New Arrangements
to Borrow, a special fund to help the IMF cope with future crises.
</P>
<P>
The Senate, which approved 18 billion dollars for the IMF in
March, had planned a floor vote this week on a broad spending bill
that included the IMF cash. But Senate leaders have put off that
vote until after the recess.
</P>
<P>
Top Republicans in both chambers doubt votes on IMF funding can
take place before mid-September or early October. Congress has
targeted October 9 to adjourn its session ahead of mid-term
elections in November.

<HEADLINE> More "Green" Fuels Used on EU Roads </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, July 31 (Xinhua) -- The usage of unleaded petroleum
on the roads within the European Union has increased to account
for 76 percent of the total fuel usage, Eurostat reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Luxembourg-based statistical bureau of the European
communities said that five short-term environment indications had
shown the progress to EU sustainable mobility with the most
striking feature in the share of unleaded petroleum as a
percentage of the total.
</P>
<P>
Until 1985 it was almost all leaded petroleum used on EU roads,
Eurostat said.
</P>
<P>
Leaded petroleum has completedly disappeared in Austria,
Denmark, Finland, the Netherlands and Sweden.
</P>
<P>
It has almost disappeared in Germany and has come close to
disappearance in Luxembourg, Ireland and Belgium with percentages
of unleaded petroleum usage at 90 percent, 84 percent and 81
percent.
</P>
<P>
Spain and Greece, however, still have a long way to get rid of
the leaded petroleum from their roads as leaded petroleum still
accounts for 54 percent of total fuel usage in both countries.
</P>
<P>
The European Union aims at eliminating leaded petroleum by the
year 2000.
</P>
<P>
EU emissions of lead from road transport, measured in tons, are
estimated to be 75 percent down in 1998 compared to 1990.
Following the elimination of leaded petroleum in Austria, Denmark,
Finland, the Netherlands and Sweden, such emissions have fallen to
zero.
</P>
<P>
Emissions of lead have also fallen to zero in Germany and are
close to zero in Belgium, Ireland and Luxembourg, though they are
still moderately high in France, Italy, Spain and Britain.

<P>
NEW DELHI, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Ambassador to India
Hiroshi Hirabayashi has said that India's nuclear tests in May
were denounced all over the world, Press Trust of India (PTI) said
here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Japan was not the only country to take measures against India.
The measures showed how the present nuclear tests, which might
ignite chain reactions of nuclear proliferation, were considered
detrimental to the world order, he said.
</P>
<P>
By conducting the nuclear tests, India has taken the nuclear
genie out of the bottle it was corked in. Japan did not know who
and how many countries would follow Pakistan hereafter in
conducting the test, he said while addressing members of the
Confederation of Indian Industry, southern region, here Friday
night.
</P>
<P>
India's concern for security environment around it did not
justify India going nuclear, he said.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that India would listen to the voice of
international community and move ahead in the direction of signing
and joining the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) and
Non-proliferation Treaty (NPT).

ALMA ATA, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Kazakhstan foreign trade has
suffered a decline in the first half of the year amid a continuous
fall in global oil prices and financial crises raging through
Southeast Asia and Russia.
</P>
<P>
The period has witnessed a year-on-year 9 percent drop in
Kazakhstan exports, whose main exports are energy and non-ferrous
metal, to stand at three billion U.S. dollars, a Kazak newspaper
reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, imports to the central Asian nations, endowed with
oil and natural gas, experienced a slight decrease of 1 percent to
3.5 billion dollars from the same period last year, with a deficit
in foreign trade amounting to 500 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Exports to Asian nations in the January-April period were hit
hardest by the financial turmoil. Compared with the same period in
1997, a plunge, 10 times the amount of exports in ferrous metals,
was reported.
</P>
<P>
Foreign trade in the country in the third quarter is expected
to gain a slight rise compared with the second quarter, but it
will be still lower than the 1997 period.

<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, August 1 (Xinhua) -- The flooding situation in the two
cities of Wuhan and Jiujiang on the Yangtze River is still
serious even though the third flood crest has passed.
</P>
<P>
Recent rains brought the water level at Wuhan up again to 29.19
m at 7:00 p.m. today, 2.89 m above the danger mark, and with the
flow rate to 65,600 cubic meters per second, according to the
local hydrology department.
</P>
<P>
Department analysts say they expect it to climb to 29.23 m by
August 2 and to stay at that level for a relatively long time.
</P>
<P>
The water level at Jiujiang was about 23 m at 8:00 p.m., a
slight bit higher than six hours earlier.
</P>
<P>
The rains that are expected over the next few days will mean
even greater difficulties for the 110,000 soldiers and local
people who are already exhausted from the flood-control efforts
and yet who still have to keep a watch on the two dikes at
Wuhan.

<HEADLINE> Another Iranian Moderate Daily Banned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Another Iranian moderate daily
Tous was banned from publication on Saturday, the second banned in
two weeks, the official news agency IRNA reported.
</P>
<P>
The ban order was issued by a branch of Tehran Justice
Department and will take effect immediately.
</P>
<P>
The ruling on the newly-published daily came hours after a
group of unidentified people gathered in front of the daily's
building threatening to attack the building.
</P>
<P>
The group, estimated to be around 30, protested against what
they referred to as "the ploy by the daily to continue the path of
Jameah (Society)," a moderate daily which was closed down last
week.
</P>
<P>
Tous, named after the appellation of ancient Iranian city
Mashhad, hit the newsstands only on last Saturday to replace the
banned Jameah by absorbing Jameah's staff. Its publication aroused
sharp criticism from the powerful conservatives which dominate the
country's judiciary and legislative bodies.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, a group of hard-liners in the holy city Qom,
central Iran, blast the moderate Minister of Culture and Islamic
Guidance Ataollah Mohajerani for giving green light for the
publication of Tous.
</P>
<P>
The group of about 4,000 staged a demonstration after the
Friday prayers congregation, calling on the conservative Majlis
(Parliament) to impeach Mohajerani or for his resignation.
</P>
<P>
Mohajerani, also government spokesman, came under strong fire
of the conservatives after he rejected the call by conservative
leaders, including the judiciary chief Ayatollah Mohammad Yazdi,
to halt Tous' publication.
</P>
<P>
The minister, one of the close allies of President Mohammad
Khatami, argued that the current press laws do not impose
restrictions on the staff of a banned newspaper from being
transferred to another daily.

<HEADLINE> 4 people Killed in Floods in Samarinda, Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Floods hitting Samarinda, capital
of Indonesia's East Kalimantan province, since Thursday, have
claimed four lives, Antara News Agency reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The city is paralyzed by two-meter high flood waters which have
caused a virtual halt to economic activities, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The floods occurred because the Benanga dam, some 20 kilometers
north of Samarinda, burst its banks Friday following one week of
heavy rains.
</P>
<P>
Described as the worst ever in the past 30 years, the floods
have inundated 7,000 hectares of Samarinda's land area which is
inhabited by 450,000 people.
</P>
<P>
Material losses from the floods were estimated to reach
billions of rupiahs (one U.S. dollar equals 13,000 rupiah) as the
floods came suddenly, making it impossible for the population to
save their belongings.
</P>
<P>
Data from the local disaster control command post showed 500
hectares of agricultural land consisting of 350 hectares of rice
fields and 150 hectares of food crop fields were damaged.
</P>
<P>
The floods have also disturbed air transportation as the
landing strip of Samarinda's Temindung airport was submerged.
</P>
<P>
In an effort to cope with the disaster, 11 command posts have
been set up in three subdistricts in Samarinda, the report said.

<HEADLINE> France Urges Early Trial of Khmer Rouge Commander </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, August 1 (Xinhua) -- France Saturday asked the Cambodian
government to immediately bring to trial Khmer Rouge guerrilla
commander Nguon Paet for the murder of three Western tourists in
1994.
</P>
<P>
Nguon Paet, arrested on Friday by the Cambodian police, is
accused of murdering Frenchman Jean-Michel Braquet, Australian
David Wilson and Briton Mark Slater. All three were taken hostage
in July 1994.
</P>
<P>
"Thanks to his arrest, Nguon Paet will quickly be brought
before the justice department in his country in order that his
responsibilities, if he is convicted, will be punished according
to Cambodia's law,'' said the French Foreign Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The Cambodian police said that Nguon Paet, who was a car dealer
on the border, was lured to the capital by policemen pretending to
make a business deal with him.
</P>
<P>
Australia has also welcomed the arrest and has thanked the
Cambodian government for their action.
</P>
<P>
The arrest came days after the Cambodian general election in
which Hun Sen's Cambodian People's Party, which is seeking
international acceptance of the poll result, is set to win.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen, the incumbent co-premier, said on Saturday that Nguon
Paet would be tried as soon as possible.

<P>
MOSCOW, August 1 (Xinhua) -- The Russian central government
started talks with its Republic of Chechnya on Saturday in Nazran,
capital of the southern Republic of Ingushetia.
</P>
<P>
The talks, between Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko and Chechen
President Aslan Maskhadov, are the first negotiations at this
level since May 1997, the Itar-Tass news agency said.
</P>
<P>
Kiriyenko and Maskhadov discussed relations between the federal
government and the republic as well as measures needed to enforce
the rule of law in Chechnya, which fought a 21-month war of
independence from Russia until a ceasefire in August 1996.
</P>
<P>
Kiriyenko said at Vladikavkaz Airport before the talks that he
was "expecting normal talks" with Maskhadov on restoration of the
Chechen economy, stabilization of the situation and problems of
relationship between Chechnya and the federal bodies of power.
</P>
<P>
Prior to departure from Grozny, Maskhadov told Grozny
television that at the meeting with Kiriyenko, he intends to
discuss "what the Russian government is planning to do as regards
Chechnya in the framework of earlier reached agreements."

<HEADLINE> Indonesia, Portugal to Discuss East Timor in New York </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali
Alatas said Saturday that he will discuss with his Portuguese
counterpart Jaime Gama a proposal to grant East Timor the status
of special autonomy.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after meeting with visiting United States
Defense Secretary William Cohen, Alatas said the
Indonesia-initiated proposal would be tabled at a United
Nations-sponsored meeting of the two countries' foreign ministers
in New York on August 4-5.
</P>
<P>
The upcoming meeting will be the first opportunity for
Indonesia to discuss its special-autonomy proposal with Portugal,
Alatas said.
</P>
<P>
"Solving the East Timor issue by granting the province special
autonomy is more practical, realistic and peaceful than holding a
referendum," he said.
</P>
<P>
A referendum in East Timor would only revive old conflicts
among the East Timorese themselves and could thus provoke a civil
war, Alatas said.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian government is planning to withdraw at least
1,000 soldiers from East Timor.
</P>
<P>
The first batch of 300 troops has already pulled out of East
Timor. The second stage of withdrawal is scheduled to take place
in early August.
</P>
<P>
Cohen said he hoped that more soldiers will be withdrawn from
East Timor and that the tripartite meeting in New York would
achieve significant progress.
</P>
<P>
Indonesian troops entered East Timor in 1975 after the
departure of the Portuguese colonists and annexed the territory
the following year.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia declared East Timor its 27th province. The U.N. has
been demanding that Indonesia withdraw its troops from East
Timor.

<HEADLINE> Six IRA Prisoners Released Under Peace Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 1 (Xinhua) -- The Irish government has released
six Irish Republican Army (IRA) prisoners from a high-security
jail, the BBC reported on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The report said three prisoners released from Portlaoise jail
were recently transferred from prisons in Britain.
</P>
<P>
One prisoner, Adrian Donnelly, had served almost 21 years of a
life sentence for murder. Another, Michael O'Brien, had served six
years of an 18-year sentence for the attempted murder of a British
policeman.
</P>
<P>
The six were freed under the historic Northern Ireland peace
accord reached in April, which stipulates that members of the
conflicting guerrilla groups will be freed within two years
provided their organizations move towards giving up their arms.
</P>
<P>
More than 200 prisoners were expected to be released by the end
of this year under the peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
However, Mo Mowlam, the Northern Ireland secretary, said last
week that prisoners from four guerrilla groups would be barred
from early release because they were still "involved in
terrorism."

<HEADLINE> Taiwan Woman's Death Should Not Hurt Cross-Straits Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, August 1 (Xinhua) -- The death of Ms. Lin Ti-Chuan, a
Taiwan woman who was kidnapped and murdered in southeast China's
Liaoning Province last Monday, is an "isolated" criminal case and
should not have a negative effect on cross-strait ties.
</P>
<P>
Lin's death was a result of a business dispute between two
companies and not a political dispute, according to Liu Gangqi,
deputy secretary-general of the Beijing-based Association for
Relations Across the Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
Liu was in Haicheng City, Liaoning, today and said that
government departments on the mainland have always been serious
about protecting the rights and interests of Taiwan compatriots
and in dealing with any problems they have.
</P>
<P>
"We are shocked at and sad about Lin's death," said Liu, who
expressed his deep condolences to her relatives.
</P>
<P>
The association fully respects the desires of Lin's relatives
and will pass their requests on to concerned departments, he said,
and departments dealing with the case will also respect their
desires.
</P>
<P>
The case will be handled with care, whether the Taiwan-based
Straits Exchange Foundation plays a part or not, he said, and
expressed confidence that people suspected of having a connection
with Lin's death will be arrested and punished promptly and
according to law.
</P>
<P>
He denounced some people in Taiwan for attempting to create a
political incident by taking advantage of Lin's death.

<HEADLINE> African Women's Day Marked in Somalia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Festivals marking the African
Women Day continue for the second day here Saturday with parades,
soccer games, performances of traditional songs and dances as
part of the drive to fight all forms of violence against women.
</P>
<P>
The nation-wide campaign is being attended by more than 14
international agencies mainly from the United Nations and nine
local organizations from the towns like Hargeisa, "capital" of
the breakaway republic of Somaliland, Badhan, Bossaso and
Galkaio.
</P>
<P>
According to the participating agencies, the campaign is aimed
at raising public and policy awareness of the dimensions of the
cost of violations against women with a view to changing people's
attitudes and behaviors.
</P>
<P>
The aim also includes provision of support and reinforcements
to U.N. awareness and advocacy programs for the elimination of
female genital mutilations, a practice which dies hard here in
Somalia.
</P>
<P>
During the gathering for the festivals, women spoke about
different violations committed against the Somali women and girls
especially during the height of the civil war since 1991, in the
town of Kismayu, 500 km south of Mogadishu. They also made a list
of more than 100 cases of violations committed against women in
lower Jubba region alone.
</P>
<P>
Those who took the floor have also expressed disappointment at
the polygamy system advocated by some religion. Two women
committed suicide by setting themselves afire in Mogadishu
recently to protest against their husbands who arrogantly told
them that they are going to marry another woman.
</P>
<P>
"The polygamy system is a serious social problem that ends
innumerable marriages every month," said one.
</P>
<P>
These women festivals are taking place at a time when the main
faction leaders are busy negotiating for the formation of an
all-inclusive administration amid increasing insecurity in the
capital.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 1 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) has said it
is prepared to discuss other ideas on saving the Mideast peace
process if the U.S. initiative fails.
</P>
<P>
The EU Special Envoy Miguel Angel Moratinos made the remark
before leaving here for home Saturday after a two-day visit to
Cairo, the last stop of his multi-leg tour of the region. He has
visited Jordan, Israel, Syria, Lebanon and the Palestinian
self-rule areas.
</P>
<P>
Moratinos expressed the hope that the Israeli government would
finally accept the U.S. proposal, which calls for a further 13.1
percent Israeli troop withdrawal from the West Bank in return for
Palestinian security guarantee.
</P>
<P>
He noted that direct Palestinian-Israeli contacts are underway
on the initiative.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the EU is in constant contacts with diplomats in
Egypt and France regarding the other alternative in case the
U.S. one should be rejected, Moratinos told reporters.
</P>
<P>
He was referring to an idea of holding an international
conference on Mideast peace, floated first in May by Egyptian and
French presidents during their talks in Pairs.
</P>
<P>
"The EU is exerting intensive efforts in quest of peace in the
area including serious preparation for the possibility of holding
such a conference," he added.
</P>
<P>
During his two-day visit to Egypt, Moratinos held talks with
Foreign Minister Amr Moussa on Friday night. After the meeting, he
said there must be other options to save the Mideast peace-making
if the U.S. efforts fail.

<HEADLINE> Jordan's FM: King Hussein Enjoys Good Health </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Jordan's Prime Minister Abdul Salam
Majali said here Saturday that King Hussein now "enjoys good
health" after preliminary chemotherapy at a U.S. clinic.
</P>
<P>
At a regular cabinet meeting held in the Madaba governorate, 35
kilometers south of Amman, Majali said the king assured him Friday
night on the telephone that he "enjoys good health after receiving
medical treatment."
</P>
<P>
The prime minister will leave for U.S. to meet the king at the
Mayo Clinic in Rochestor, Minnesota, later in the day.
</P>
<P>
The 62-year-old king has been hospitalized at the clinic since July
14 after suffering from numerous spells of fever and cold sweats.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued by Hussein's physicians Tuesday said that
they have concluded the king was suffering from non-Hodgkin's
lymphoma, or cancer of the lymphatic tissue, and "this condition
is highly treatable with chemotherapy."
</P>
<P>
It said that Hussein will receive chemotherapy treatment
intravenously for four days every 21 to 24 days over four to five
months.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that the results of the first cycle of
chemotherapy "are very encouraging."
</P>
<P>
In an interview Tuesday with Jordanian television, the king
also said he can "fully overcome his problem."
</P>
<P>
Hussein's physicians said he has B-cell lymphoma. Low-grade
non-Hodgkin's lymphoma is not curable but is very responsive to
treatment and the five-year survival rate is about 75 percent.
</P>
<P>
High-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma is curable with aggressive
treatment, but survival is usually less than one and a half years
if there is not a complete remission after treatment. Sixty to 80
percent of sufferers enter a complete remission with chemotherapy.
</P>
<P>
The king underwent surgery to remove cancer from his ureter
and left kidney at the Mayo Clinic in 1992 and has since had
regular medical checkups at the clinic.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Jordan's PM: King Hussein Enjoys Good Health </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Jordan's Prime Minister Abdul Salam
Majali said here Saturday that King Hussein now "enjoys good
health" after preliminary chemotherapy at a U.S. clinic.
</P>
<P>
At a regular cabinet meeting held in the Madaba governorate, 35
kilometers south of Amman, Majali said the king assured him Friday
night on the telephone that he "enjoys good health after receiving
medical treatment."
</P>
<P>
The prime minister will leave for U.S. to meet the king at the
Mayo Clinic in Rochestor, Minnesota, later in the day.
</P>
<P>
The 62-year-old king has been hospitalized at the clinic since July
14 after suffering from numerous spells of fever and cold sweats.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued by Hussein's physicians Tuesday said that
they have concluded the king was suffering from non-Hodgkin's
lymphoma, or cancer of the lymphatic tissue, and "this condition
is highly treatable with chemotherapy."
</P>
<P>
It said that Hussein will receive chemotherapy treatment
intravenously for four days every 21 to 24 days over four to five
months.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that the results of the first cycle of
chemotherapy "are very encouraging."
</P>
<P>
In an interview Tuesday with Jordanian television, the king
also said he can "fully overcome his problem."
</P>
<P>
Hussein's physicians said he has B-cell lymphoma. Low-grade
non-Hodgkin's lymphoma is not curable but is very responsive to
treatment and the five-year survival rate is about 75 percent.
</P>
<P>
High-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma is curable with aggressive
treatment, but survival is usually less than one and a half years
if there is not a complete remission after treatment. Sixty to 80
percent of sufferers enter a complete remission with chemotherapy.
</P>
<P>
The king underwent surgery to remove cancer from his ureter
and left kidney at the Mayo Clinic in 1992 and has since had
regular medical checkups at the clinic.
</P>
<P>
He had surgery for an enlarged prostate in April 1997, and an
operation in November 1997 to remove an inflamed lymph gland, but
no cancer was found.
</P>
<P>
Hussein is the longest-reigning ruler in the Middle East. He is
due to celebrate 46 years on the throne on August 11.

<HEADLINE> U.S. to Intensify Military Contacts with Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 1 (Xinhua) -- The United States government
wanted to intensify military contacts with Indonesia, U.S. Defense
Secretary William Cohen said here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Talking to reporters after meeting Indonesian Minister of
Security and Defense General Wiranto, Cohen said the U.S. hopes
that military cooperation between the two countries can be
enhanced in the future.
</P>
<P>
The military of the two countries were working together to
serve humanitarian purposes and that these efforts would continue,
he said, adding that it was not to talk about U.S. military bases.
</P>
<P>
According to press reports here, the U.S. is considering to
rent out Indonesia's islands for military base and using the money
to bail Indonesia out of its economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
Cohen, arrived here Saturday for a two-day working visit, held
talks with President B.J. Habibie for nearly two hours this noon.
He also met Foreign Minister Ali Alatas and Coordinating Minister
for Political and Security Affairs Feisal Tanjung.
</P>
<P>
Cohen would leave for Manila, the Philippines on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Asked about the purpose of his visit to Indonesia and his
meetings with Habibie and several high officials, Cohen said it
was to reaffirm the U.S. preparedness to give Indonesia a friend's
support.
</P>
<P>
He said the U.S. was concerned about the difficulties Indonesia
had to deal since being hit by economic crisis because Indonesia
was an important country in the region and what was happening in
the region also had an impact on the U.S.
</P>
<P>
His visit to Indonesia was to show that "we are friend in good
times and bad," he said.
</P>
<P>
About human right affairs in Indonesia, Cohen said he commended
the Indonesian government for placing human rights on a high level
of priority in its policy-making.
</P>
<P>
"I do know that the Indonesian government is trying to organize
several investigations on human rights abuses," he said, adding it
was hoped the probes were conducted openly, honestly and with
professional integrity.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia saw the worst looting and rioting in decades in
Jakarta and other cities from May 13 to 15 this year. The
Indonesian government has set up a fact-finding team to probe the
riots.

<HEADLINE> Grain Price in Mozambique Stable </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Despite price fluctuations in
parts of the country, Mozambique enjoyed stable grain price
throughout the country in the 1997-98 agricultural year, the
Mozambican agricultural authorities said.
</P>
<P>
Sources at the Mozambican Agricultural Information System said
the price of a 20-liter barrel of maize flour varies between
20,000 and 31,600 Metical (one U.S. Dollar equals to about 11,900
Metical) in most parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
The price rises to 40,000 Metical per barrel in some markets
in southern mozambique in the last three weeks of July, the
period of time marking the end of the country's agricultural year
which often sees some price hike.
</P>
<P>
Maize has been the staple food crop in Mozambique as in many
other African countries.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that the bumper harvest in the country of
turning out about 1.69 million tons, or a 10 percent increase
over the last agricultural year, has helped stabilize the maize
price.
</P>
<P>
Food prices in Maputo remain stable as the capital has enough
foodstuffs to get going. It gets maize from other provinces, and
imports white maize from neighboring countries and ground nuts
from Swaziland.
</P>
<P>
While provinces in the south, especially Maputo have to import
grain, provinces in the north could export about 120,000 tons of
maize this year, normally to Malawi.

<HEADLINE> Drug Using, Dealing Rife in S. African Schools </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Drug-taking and dealing
among school children have become an epidemic in Pretoria and
Johannesburg, Saturday Star paper reported.
</P>
<P>
It is so rife that at least nine schools in Johannesburg are
officially testing pupils for drugs and asking them to leave if
they fail consecutive tests.
</P>
<P>
In Pretoria, between five and 10 pupils are appearing in court
every week for possession or dealing in drugs, including cocaine,
the newspapers quoted detectives and school officials as saying.
</P>
<P>
Two narcotics detectives have been permanently assigned to
keeping tabs on drug-taking and dealing in Pretoria's schools.
The youngest they have arrested for possession of hard narcotics
was just seven years old.
</P>
<P>
From dusk till dawn the officers follow young suspects through
the streets of Pretoria, and arrest offenders when they observe a
deal going down. They said dealers come in all sizes and colors
and range from a school pupil to an 85-year-old.
</P>
<P>
Serious drug problem has forced a high school in Johannesburg
to adopt a special program, the report said.
</P>
<P>
School officials said when worrying behavior of a student is
reported, the school calls in both the student and his parents to
ask for a drug test. If the test is positive, the school will
test the child at regular intervals and send the child for
counseling.
</P>
<P>
The parents would pay for counseling and would be kept
informed throughout the process.
</P>
<P>
School officials said parents and pupils are usually
supportive of the program as it is confidential and is designed
to assist. If the students continue to deny the problem after
testing and counseling, the school would ask them to leave.
</P>
<P>
Drugs such as LSD and crack cocaine have been accessible and
available virtually everywhere in Johannesburg, and school
children easily get hooked by dealers, a drug rehabilitation
center said.
</P>
<P>
The Education Department of the Gauteng Province, where
Pretoria and Johannesburg are located, has taken a hard line on
drugs in schools. Department officials said any possession and
use of drugs in schools should be dealt with as a criminal
matter.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Enlists Britons in World Cup Bid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 1 (Xinhua) -- The South African Football
Association (SAFA) on Friday took a positive step toward its bid
to stage the 2006 World Cup when it named two high-ranking Britons
to its bid committee in Johannesburg.
</P>
<P>
Geoff Thompson and Ray Whelan have been appointed to the bid
committee, South African newspapers reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
SAFA chief executive Danny Jordaan said both were appointed
because of their expertise, experience and fine track records in
past bids.
</P>
<P>
"It is important that we draw from international experience and
interact with the outside world. South Africa will not get the
World Cup because we wish it so. We must convince the 24 members
of FIFA that we deserve to stage the tournament in 2006," he said.
</P>
<P>
Thompson, 40, was involved in two successful Olympics and the
Commonwealth Games bids, and Whelan, 47, is a sports consultant in
Britain.
</P>
<P>
The two said they were confident South Africa had an excellent
chance of winning the World Cup bid.
</P>
<P>
"To succeed, this bid has to be unique and South Africa cannot
lose the bid...the main objective is to ensure the bid must be a
win-win-win situation for everybody in this country and the
international world," Thompson said.
</P>
<P>
Whelan said South Africa should concentrate on demonstrating
its own strengths rather than look at weaknesses in the other
countries' bids. England and Germany are the country's archirivals.
</P>
<P>
However, Whelan said three areas may cause problems for the bid
-- South Africa has no record of organizing such big events, the
country's escalating crime, and its political stability when
President Nelson Mandela steps down after the 1999 general
election.
</P>
<P>
Jordaan said South Africa had to learn from the experience of
France, which staged this year's World Cup.
</P>
<P>
He said there were three pillars which underpin the South
African bid -- the youth development program, the socio-economics
of the country and the necessary infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
"We have to address these issues if the bid were to succeed,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Jordaan said he had got support from the country's rugby
authorities to use rugby stadiums, which were the best in the
world." We feel there is no need to build more big stadiums as
some people believe. We have the best here," he said.

<HEADLINE> 16th ASEAN Ministers on Energy Meeting Ends </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, August 1 (Xinhua) -- The one-day 16th ASEAN
Ministers on Energy Meeting ended here Saturday afternoon after
issuing a joint statement on further cooperation in the energy
area.
</P>
<P>
The statement said the ministers collectively resolved to
further strengthen cooperation in the area of energy as part of
ASEAN's overall efforts to address the economic and financial
crisis through closer economic cooperation and integration.
</P>
<P>
In particular, the ministers expressed strong confidence in the
growing opportunities for long-term mutual cooperation in
electricity and gas interconnections, joint exploration and
production in the region, the statement noted.
</P>
<P>
According to the statement, the ministers were satisfied with
the substantial progress achieved in the regional development,
cooperation and collaboration among the petroleum industries in
the ASEAN region by virtue of the instrument of the ASEAN Council
on Petroleum, and they endorsed a Conceptual Planning Framework
for incorporation into the ongoing formulation of the Hanoi Plan
of Action to be adopted by the ASEAN summit scheduled for December
1998 in Hanoi, Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
The ministers also expressed welcome to the expansion of the
ASEAN Power Grid to 10 electricity interconnection projects and
held that an integrated and coordinated planning policy approach
for the ASEAN Power Grid's implementation would pave the way for
greater opportunities for enhancing inter-regional electricity
trade, developing business opportunities and promoting joint or
cross-border investment in energy projects in the ASEAN member
countries.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, some measures were taken for the enhanced
implementation activities of the Sub-Sector on Coal, Energy
Efficiency and conservation, and New and Renewable source of
Energy.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh's New Industry Policy Awaits Cabinet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, August 1 (Xinhua) -- The share of Bangladesh's
industrial sector will go up to a fourth of the national economy
in 10 years from the current 10 percent, according to a proposed
new industrial policy 1998 which awaits Cabinet approval.
</P>
<P>
There are also hopes that the industrial sector will employ a
fifth of the national workforce, The Daily Star newspaper Saturday
quoted the new policy as saying.
</P>
<P>
The key elements in the new draft policy include private sector
development, removal of barriers to foreign and local investment,
reforms of laws and regulations to spur protection and support to
domestic industries, tariff rationalization, incentives to small
and cottage industries, development of human resources and
formation of a national council.
</P>
<P>
"A vibrant and dynamic private sector will be the principal
actor in Bangladesh's industrial arena," the draft policy says.
"The manufacturing sector will employ at least 20 percent of
workforce and compete in the liberalized internal market and
external market as well."
</P>
<P>
There is also a special emphasis on export-oriented industries,
with a target to give an export bias to the industrial sector in
general.
</P>
<P>
The policy suggests establishment of an integrated and
comprehensive management information system in the ministry of
industries for providing information services to the
entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
It also speaks of encouraging "progressive infusion of new
technology leading to increasingly efficient corporate structure."
</P>
<P>
The new policy proposes to free the industrialists from taking
prior permission for setting up new industries. "No prior
permission will be necessary to start a new industry outside those
on the reserved list," the policy says.
</P>
<P>
A national council headed by the prime minister will oversee
implementation of the new policy.

<HEADLINE> Hun Sen Hopes CPP's Victory Benefits All Countrymen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Incumbent co-premier Hun Sen
said Saturday that he expects the election victory of the ruling
Cambodian People's Party (CPP) to benefit all Cambodians.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen, speaking after preliminary results indicated the CPP
as winner in the July 26 election, told reporters that all
Cambodians, no matter whether they support the CPP or not, will
reap the fruit of the CPP's victory.
</P>
<P>
He said the CPP would investigate the alleged cases of
intimidation during the election. He welcomed human rights groups
and international organizations to take part in the probe.
</P>
<P>
Prince Norodom Ranariddh's FUNCINPEC party, the Sam Rainsy
Party (SRP) and a number of small parties disclaimed the election
as "unjust" and "unacceptable" because of irregularities,
including voter intimidation by the CPP. But the CPP denied the
charge.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen said he would punish the CPP officials if evidence
showed that they were involved in the alleged cases of
intimidation.
</P>
<P>
But he also added that the CPP had been sure of its victory and
had no need to resort to intimidation.
</P>
<P>
According to preliminary results announced by the National
Election Committee (NEC) earlier in the day, the CPP has secured
enough seats in the National Assembly (parliament) to head the
next government, and Hun Sen, as the only candidate fielded by the
CPP for the premiership, will become Cambodia's next prime
minister.
</P>
<P>
The NEC announced the preliminary results after vote counting
was almost completed in all 23 constituencies. But the NEC said it
has to verify the figure and reserve the right to correct it for
the sake of accuracy. The NEC would not give the final official
results before August 19.
</P>
<P>
There were about 4.87 million valid votes out of a total of
nearly five million votes. By calculation, the CPP won about two
million votes, to be followed by the FUNCINPEC party with almost
1.55 million and the SRP with about 700,000, said the NEC.
</P>
<P>
No information was given about the specific number of seats
acquired by each party. But it is certain no single party has got
the constitution-required two-thirds, or 82 seats, in the
parliament to form a one-party government.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the CPP will form a coalition government with
either the FUNCINPEC party or the SRP -- or probably even both.

<HEADLINE> Egypt to Launch Anti-Smoking Campaign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 1 (Xinhua) -- In Egypt where one in every nine
citizens smokes, a government-sponsored campaign is taking shape
to advise people to refrain from cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
Hamdi al-Sayyed, head of the National Association of Physicians
said the government has earmarked 300,000 U.S. dollars for a
tobacco awareness campaign targeting juveniles.
</P>
<P>
The campaign will be carried out in "clubs, schools and
universities" to alert people of the dangers smoking can cause,
the Egyptian Mail reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
According to the figures released last year by the Health
Ministry, over 7 million Egyptians, or one in every nine, are

Al-Sayyed said 20 percent of students and women, 60 percent of
school and university teachers, and 40 percent of doctors, are

day, or 2.5 cigarettes for every citizen. Tobacco advertisements
swaggered in local publications and street billboards in Egypt.
</P>

Shisha smoking, a traditional pastime of puffing on scented
tobacco and herbal plants, is still a common street scene.

<HEADLINE> Building Project to Be Resettled for Conserving 2,200-Year Palaces </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, August 1 (Xinhua) -- A gigantic telecommunications
mansion under construction in downtown Guangzhou, south China, has
to make way for a newly-unearthed group of 2,200-year-old palace
structures and move to another site to protect the cultural relics.
</P>
<P>
The group of palace structures located at the capital site of
Nanyue, a small southern state dating back to (211 to 206 B.C.),
was discovered by workers when they began building the foundation
of the large project. It was cited as one of China's ten major
archeological funds in 1997.
</P>
<P>
As the excavation of ancient palaces was within the reach of
the five-star China Hotel, the city government has preliminarily
to designate a protection zone of 48,000 square meters.
</P>
<P>
It meant that investors in the telecommunications mansion and
another building on site of ancient palaces had to lose as much
as 50 million yuan (6 million U.S. dollars) for suspending
construction and resettling the buildings to other locations.
</P>
<P>
Guangzhou, a pioneer city to experiment with China's opening-up
and reform policies in the late 1970s, declared that it would bear
all costs for the sake of protecting the ruins of ancient relics.
</P>
<P>
Peng Jun, an official in charge of urban planning, said
Guangzhou has been rising from the nuclear part of the ancient
state during the past 2,000 years. So many ruins of the ancient
structures are located at the city's central part, where each inch
of land is evaluateed as precious as one once of gold.
</P>
<P>
Guangzhou Mayor Lin Shusen noted that each sq m of floor space
of a commercial building in the downtown areas is currently sold
at some 10,000 yuan (1,200 U.S. dollars). Nevertheless, he
emphasized that the value of a historical relic is priceless.
</P>
<P>
"So the city attaches importance to the conservation of ancient
buildings left over by our ancestors," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to an official with the city's cultural relics
administration, nearly 20 sites of ancient buildings or museums
are closely related to the adjacent commercial centers.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he added, the city has listed more than 120 cultural
sites and places of historical interest under the protection of
the city government.
</P>
<P>
The city of Guangzhou has so far spent huge amounts of funds in
resettling factories from sites of ancient ruins.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> El Nino Affects Asia, Central/South America: UNFAO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, July 31 (Xinhua) -- The climate phenomenon of El Nino has
severely affected agriculture, fishery and forestry in many
countries of Asia and Central/South America since April, 1997.
</P>
<P>
This is announced in a report Friday by the U.N. Food and
Agricultural Organization (UNFAO).
</P>
<P>
The report said the phenomenon has caused particularly severe
damages to fishery in area off western South America, which is one
of the world's richest fishing regions, producing 12-20 percent of
its total.
</P>
<P>
Another great El Nino-related threat is to forests and
natural vegetation of the areas. Increased risk of wildfires has
caused potentially adverse impact on national and household food
security, said the report.
</P>
<P>
Through its offices, the report said, UNFAO has intensified the
monitoring of weather developments and crop prospects in the whole
world. It will continue to help countries prepare for and respond
to the impact of the El Nino in the future, the report
added.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Receives Export-Import Credit from the U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Thailand and the United States
have finalized an agreement to provide a short-term trade
financing program of up to one billion U.S. dollars for U.S.
exports of goods and services to Thailand, a press release from
the U.S. Information Service available Saturday said.
</P>
<P>
Thai Finance Minister Tarrin Nimmanhaeminda, Chairman of U.S.
Export-Import (Exim) Bank James Harmon, President of the Thai Exim
Bank Pridiyathorn Devakula signed the agreement in Bangkok Friday.
</P>
<P>
The agreement provides short-term insurance coverage for
letters of credit issued by Thai commercial banks and confirmed or
negotiated by U.S. correspondent banks.
</P>
<P>
This trade financing program is part of the 1.7 billion dollar
assistance package announced by U.S. President Bill Clinton during
Thai Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai's visit to Washington in March.
</P>
<P>
The program responds to the working capital shortage facing
many Thai companies who are unable to finance imports of raw
materials and intermediate goods.
</P>
<P>
"This agreement is particularly important as lack of access to
financing has severely restricted Thai trade flows," Harman was
quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Exim Bank is an independent U.S. government agency
that assists in financing the export of U.S. goods and services to
industrializing and developing markets all over the world by
providing loans, loan guarantees and insurance.
</P>
<P>
In fiscal year 1997, the bank supported 15 billion dollar of
U.S. exports.

CHONGQING, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Chen Wenxue, 52, and four other
villagers from the outskirtan areas in southwest China's Chongqing
Municipality recently joined hands to establish a foreign language
institute.
</P>
<P>
The four men invested a total of 5.5 million yuan (663,000 US
dollars) to establish the the Foreign Languages College under the
Three Gorges United University. The latter institution was founded
in 1993 to promote the development of adult education.

<P>
Chen, a stonemason from outskirtan Chongqing, who had only
attended a primary school, became the first millionaire in his
village by making and selling furniture in urban areas.
</P>
<P>
"Poverty compelled me to quit school, and I will use my money
to help poor children receive both a basic and higher education,"
said Chen.
</P>
<P>
The college, scheduled to open in September, includes
classrooms, a student dormitory and a dining hall.
</P>

<P>
KAMPALA, August 1 (Xinhua) -- A total of 25 rebels of the
Allied Democratic Forces (ADF) have been killed and some 56
abductees rescued in the latest offensive by the Uganda People's
Defense Forces (UPDF).
</P>
<P>
The offensive operation was carried out last week in
Bundibygyo District in western Uganda, acting Chief of Staff
James Kazini was quoted by Saturday's New Vision daily as saying
Friday.
</P>
<P>
He said the rebels were killed Tuesday and Wednesday when the
UPDF soldiers overran the ADF hideouts near river Sindira where
the rebels had tried to regroup after being flushed out of the
Rwenzori mountains.
</P>
<P>
The rescued abductees, including 13 old women and 43 children
aged one to 10, are from western Uganda and eastern part of the
Democratic Republic of Congo, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The UPDF's recent intensified offensives in the west have
seriously weakened the ADF, said the paper, noting that the
rebels who invaded through Mpondwe border post in November 1996
resorted to abductions to bolster their ranks.
</P>
<P>
In a ghastly pre-dawn attack on June 8, they burnt to death
over 80 students of Kichwamba Technical College in their
dormitories. The rebels allegedly locked the dormitories before
setting the students ablaze with petrol.

<HEADLINE> Harbin to Set Up Social Security System For Laid-Off Workers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, August 1 ((Xinhua) -- The Northeast China city of
Harbin plans to set up social security and employment schemes over
the next five years in an effort to battle local pressing
unemployment problems.
</P>
<P>
The plan aims to provide jobs for the increasing ranks of the
unemployed.
</P>
<P>
The capital city of Harbin in Heilongjiang Province has been
facing great difficulties in providing jobs for a growing number
of laid-off workers by the restructuring of local state-owned
businesses.
</P>
<P>
A majority of local state-owned enterprises, which carry great
weight in local economy, are in the red. This, together with local
fledging and slow-moving service enterprises, has further worsened
the local job opportunity situation and has led to the
fast-growing number of jobless people.
</P>
<P>
The number of laid-offs in the city has now reached 250,000 and
will rise to 308,000 by the end of the year. And the number of
laid-off workers from local state-owned enterprises alone is
expected to hit 400,000 in three years' time.
</P>
<P>
Harbin has promised to guarantee basic living standards for
laid-off workers registered at local reemployment service centers,
and will provide jobs to more than 65 percent of the already
laid-off workers, as well as those newly unemployed this year.
</P>
<P>
The city of Harbin also will set up more service centers for
reemployment projects providing basic living costs and job
training.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, it will draw up policies to speed up the development
of local services and private economies as a major channel for
providing jobs to local laid-off workers.

<HEADLINE> Russian Stabilization Program Takes Effect </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Russian stabilization program
proposed by the government takes effect on Saturday, an Itar-Tass
news agency report said.
</P>
<P>
The program has been approved by the Federation Council and
some of the bills not passed by the State Duma, the lower house of
Russian parliament, have been brought into effect by government
resolutions and presidential decrees.
</P>
<P>
Government experts estimate the realization of the entire
package of measures provided by the program needs an additional
revenue of 105 billion rubles (about 17 billion U.S. dollars) to
the federal budget next year.
</P>
<P>
Innovations in the program are: a change in the procedure for
the payment of value-added tax (VAT), a shortening of a list of
commodities with preferential VAT rate, an increase in the rates
of pensions fund (PF) charges from natural persons, and the
introduction of a temporary special customs duty of 3 percent on
all imports until the end of 1999.
</P>
<P>
Thus, the preferential 10-percent VAT rate will now be applied
to bakery products, dairy products, and baby and dietetic foods.
</P>
<P>
The program was officially put forward by Prime Minister Sergei
Kiriyenko on June 23.
</P>
<P>
Apart from increasing revenue to the state budget, the program
is also important for Russia to convince international financial
organizations to grant a package of additional aid to it, the
report said.

<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, August 1 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright concluded her six-hour visit to New Zealand and
left Auckland for home Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The local TV station said that although Albright's visit marked
the two countries has the "warmest relationship" in more than a
decade", the nuclear issue is "still smart".
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Albright was the most senior U.S. official to visit New
Zealand in 14 years. The last was the ill-fated visit of George
Schults when the United States learned for the first time the
implications of New Zealand Labor Government's anti-nuclear
stance. Their relationship soured when it became clear Labor's
anti-nuclear policy would block U.S. warships from visiting New
Zealand ports. As a result, their defense links were suspended and
political relationship was downgraded. Both nations continued to
quarantine what they referred to as their "unfinished business".
</P>
<P>
During her stay in Auckland, the biggest commercial city in the
 country, Mrs. Albright held talks with New Zealand Prime Minister
Jenny Shipley.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, the TV station reported, the U.S. Secretary
of State insisted that New Zealand must scrap its anti-nuclear
legislation, but there was "no sign of compromise" from the New
Zealand side.
</P>
<P>
After the talks, Mrs. Albright said at a press conference that
she hopes "the time will come when New Zealand is able to resolve
our unfinished business."
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Shipley told the reporters that the moment "is unlikely
that the New Zealand community will accept any change."
</P>
<P>
At the press conference, Mrs. Albright admitted that the issue
still remains between the two nations, but she said that there was
so much "we can do as friends, and the United States plans to do
so."
</P>
<P>
When Mrs. Albright arrived in Auckland, she was greeted at the
airport by New Zealand Foreign Minister Don Mckinnon.

<HEADLINE> Getting A Million People Out Of Poverty In South China Region </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, August 1 (Xinhua) -- South China's Guangxi Zhuang
Autonomous Region expects to help 1.1 million rural people get
away from poverty this year.
</P>
<P>
This will bring the number of people there still living below
the national poverty line to 2.5 million, compared with 3.6
million at the end of 1997. The region say it will basically wipe
out poverty by 1999.
</P>
<P>
Last winter, the autonomous region spent 470 million yuan (56.6
million U.S. dollars) on water supply facilities in poor areas,
solving the drinking water problem for over 1.47 million people
and 1.25 million head of livestock.
</P>
<P>
In another move, small-scale loans have been provided for
farmers in 28 poverty-stricken counties, and 153,000 government
officials have been assigned to help with poverty-relife projects
in 200,000 poor households.
</P>
<P>
The region has always been supported by the World Bank in its
poverty-relief efforts. By the end of June, more than 600 million
yuan (72.3 million US dollars) of World-Bank loans had been used
to move rural people from desolate areas to more fertile lands.

HARARE, August 1 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwean government has
expressed strong reservations over the setting of conditions by
the British government on how to use the granted aid.
</P>
<P>
London has said it is now willing to release over 11 million
U.S. Dollars to buy 1,500 Land Rovers jeeps for the Zimbabwe
police on condition that the vehicles are not used to repress
demonstrations, the Herald newspaper reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Harare feels it reserves the right to use resources at its
disposal as it saw fit, said the Zimbabwean cabinet.
</P>
<P>
In April the British government was reported to be having
second thoughts about honoring last year's agreement with the
Zimbabwean government in which they had promised the grant.
</P>
<P>
The British were concerned that after the highly volatile
political situation especially in January, after the food riots
and the mass job stay-aways, police would most likely use the
vehicles to violate human rights, the report noted.
</P>
<P>
The police desperately need a new fleet of service vehicles.
Operations are being heavily hampered by shortage of transport.

(Parliament) to impeach Mohajerani if he refused to step down.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, they asked the country's security organs to
"properly deal with monarchists, liberals and spies," according to
the conservative newspaper Tehran Times.
</P>
<P>
"Revolutionary Majlis, Impeach, Impeach," the protesters
chanted, "Minister of Guidance, Resign, Resign."
</P>
<P>
Mohajerani, also the government spokesman, came under strong
fire after a moderate daily Jameah (Society), banned by a
conservative court, practically continued publication under
another name, Tous.
</P>
<P>
A number of conservative leaders, including judiciary chief
Ayatollah Mohammad Yazdi, have urged Mohajerani to halt Tous'
publication, which they claimed was illegal and violated the
country's law.
</P>
<P>
The minister, a close ally of President Mohammad Khatami,
rejected the call, arguing that the current press laws do not
impose restrictions on the staff of a banned newspaper from being
transferred to another daily.
</P>
<P>
It has become a topic in the capital that the conservatives are
now aimed at launching new attacks after they scored two victories
against the moderates over the past two months.
</P>
<P>
They successfully ousted former Interior Minister Abdollah
Nouri in an impeachment motion in June and convicted former mayor
of Tehran on corruption charges in July.
</P>
<P>
Mohajerani appears to be the next target because his
open-minded policy on the freedom of expression has annoyed the
hardliners, observers here noted.
</P>
<P>
Mohajerani has said he had no information about any impeachment
against him, but acknowledged the Majlis has the right to question
or impeach a minister.

<HEADLINE> Thailand's Economy Continues Downward Spiral </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's economy is continuing
its downward spiral with falling export values and declines in key
industrial indexes, the latest figures from the Bank of Thailand
showed.
</P>
<P>
The dollars value of exports contracted by 12.1 percent in May
compared with the same month last year, and by 4.7 percent since
the beginning of the year, according to the figures released
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The manufacturing Production Index fell 17.4 percent in May in
line with a contraction in domestic demand. The April decline was
16.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
The private Investment Index fell a year-on-year decline of
14.6 percent in the month, as the credit squeeze forced companies
to reduce investment.
</P>
<P>
Suchada Kirakul, deputy director at the Economic Research
Department of the Bank was quoted Saturday by the Bangkok Post as
saying that The monthly economic indicators confirmed that the
economy was worsening but was within the central bank's
projections.
</P>
<P>
At the rough estimate, gross domestic product growth will post
a deficit of between 6 percent and 7 percent for the whole year
because the government will not introduce additional stimulus
measures, Suchada said.
</P>
<P>
"The government's relaxed fiscal policy will take some time
before it will result in stimulating the economy", Suchada said.
</P>
<P>

billion U.S. dollars for the first five months of this year, The
surplus in May was 1.01 billion U.S. dollars.

billion U.S. dollars: 17.4 billion in government debts, 9 billion
in Bank of Thailand, and 61.8 billion in private sector debts. Of
the private sector debts, the long-term amount is 36.9 billion
while the shot-term is 24.9 billion.
</P>
<P>
Foreign reserves as of July 24 stood at 27.5 billion U.S.
dollars, compared with 27.2 billion on July 17. Net forward

<HEADLINE> Zimbabweans Worry Over Electricity Charges Hike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's industrialists are
concerned with the recent 37 percent hike in electricity charges,
saying the recovery of commerce will not take place in an
environment of punitive lending rates and escalating input costs.
</P>
<P>
The daily Herald Saturday quoted acting Chief Executive of
Chamber of Mines Doug Verden as saying Friday although the
increase was not unexpected, it was going to seriously affect the
mining industry in general as electricity contributed about 18
percent of total production costs.
</P>
<P>
Seriously affected will be operating smelters who are the
major consumers of power and gold mines.
</P>
<P>
''The overall effect of this increase on the economy has not
been considered but it will cause a great deal of stress to the
mining industry that is already under threat from low mineral
prices internationally,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
The Zimbabwe National Chamber of Commerce said in a statement
Friday since electricity was a major input, the once-off increase
was going to erode earnings, lead to massive retrenchments and
push many companies to the wall.
</P>
<P>
The hike is also predicted to push up annual inflation, which
is currently pegged at 29.8 percent as of June, it said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, President of the Confederation of Zimbabwe
Industries K. Katsande said the price increase would be reflected
almost immediately in product selling costs, although this was
under a situation where the government had to lift the price
freeze imposed on manufactured food items.
</P>
<P>
''We have to accept that Zimbabwe is now a high cost economy
and companies cannot continue to operate under a freeze price
while input costs continue to rise,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan FM to Visit Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan First Deputy Prime
Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs Eriya Kategaya will pay
a four-day visit to Israel to forge a close trade relationship
with the Mideastern country.
</P>
<P>
The top diplomat, who is scheduled to leave for Israel on
August 2 or Sunday, will be accompanied by a trade delegation and
officials from the ministry of agriculture, the Monitor daily
reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The report said these agricultural officials will meet with
their Israeli counterparts to locate sources for joint investment
and development projects.
</P>
<P>
During his stay there, Kategaya is expected to hold talks with
President Ezer Weizman, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu,
Agriculture Minister Rafael Eitan and business leaders.
</P>
<P>
Israel was deeply involved in Uganda at the end of 1960s. It
built Uganda Commercial Bank, Bugolobi Flats, and extensive
agricultural projects in the northern part of the country.
</P>
<P>
However, when Field Marshal Idi Amin came to power in 1971, he
went to many Western countries including Israel to ask for fund
to revitalize the economy but returned empty-handed. Since then
the bilateral relations deteriorated.
</P>
<P>
As a result, Israel closed its diplomatic mission in Kampala.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, their relations have warmed up. Dr. Samson
Kisekka, former vice president, was the first high-ranking
Ugandan government official to visit Israel. Earlier this year,
Vice President Specioza Kazibwe also visited Israel.
</P>
<P>
Kategaya, now still presumed number two figure inside the core
Movement Camp and a long-time bosom ally of President Yoweri
Museveni, will send the clearest signal that a new active phase
of contacts between the two former friends is at hand.

<HEADLINE> Cuba Takes three Boxing Golds at Goodwill Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, July 31 (Xinhua) - World amateur boxing powerhouse
Cuba took three out of six gold medals in the boxing finals while
the United States and Russia split the two titles in the figure
skating at the 1998 Goodwill Games here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Five meet records were shattered in the men's swimming team
competition which the World All-Star Team beat the United States
78-43, and Russia defeated Germany 84-38.
</P>
<P>
The International Amateur Boxing Association suspended four
boxing referees after the Russian boxing team threatened to pull
out of the current competition and lodged a formal protest.
</P>
<P>
The Russian Boxing Federation said the judgements made by those
referees were biased and led to the elimination of some of their
boxers.
</P>
<P>
The four referees suspended including Macario Sosa of
Guatemala, Alfredo Toledo of Cuba, Per-Olof Larsson of Sweden, and
Dieter Mika of Germany. Following the suspension, the Russian
boxers returned to the competition tonight and one of their two
boxers landed a title.
</P>
<P>
Maikro Romero, Olympic champion in 1996, led Cuba rout over
their rivals to win the first gold in the 48kg class with a 10-5
decision. But his teammate Waldemar Fonst, world silver medalist
last year, was nipped 15-14 by Timur Tulyakov of Uzbekistan in the
54kg Catergory.
</P>
<P>
Mario Kindelan, who ranked third in the world, had an easy win
over U.S. champion Jacob Hudson in the 60kg class with an
overwhelming 13-4 record.
</P>
<P>
However, Ariel Hernandez, Olympic champion in 1992 and 1996,
had a tough battle against France's Jean-Paul Mendy in the
five-round bout, beating the European champion 15-14.
</P>
<P>
Felix Savon needed just 55 seconds to secure the 91kg class
title and confirmed he is still the world's best amateur fighter.
</P>
<P>
The twice Olympic champion snatched his chance when his
American rival Davarryl Wiliamson dropped his guard in the first
of the five two-minute rounds.
</P>
<P>
Russia's only triumph tonight came from the 67kg class through
Andrei Mishin, who pounced U.S. champion Larry Mosley relentlessly
to win 11-3.
</P>
<P>
Russia's Elena Berezhnaya and Anton Sikharulidze, world
champions this year, displayed a brilliant performance to win the
pairs gold in the figure skating, ahead of Olympic champions
Oksana Kazakova and Artur Dmitriev, also from Russia, and Dorota
Zagorska and Martiusz Siedek of Poland.
</P>
<P>
In the men's long program skating, Todd Eldredge of the United
States finished first in front of Alexei Urmanov and Evgeni
Plushenko, both from Russia.
</P>
<P>
"I felt very good and I am certainly happy with my performance.
I did eight triples and they felt good," said the winner, "My legs
were good and I was not as tired as expected. "
</P>
<P>
But Plushenko was just upset, saying "It is very difficult to
skate because I still have a problem with my back."
</P>
<P>
Five swimming meet records fell tonight in the team
competition. An American team beat the 4x100m medley relay record
with a time of 3 minutes 39.73 seconds before Lenny Krayzelburg of
the United States shattered 200m backstroke mark in 1:58.17.
</P>
<P>
The World Team beat three records through Fernando Scherer in
the 100m freestyle in 48.91, Denis Sylantiyev in the 100m
butterfly in 52.52, and Curtis Myden in the 200m medley in 2:00.38.
</P>
<P>
In the women's beach volleyball, Lisa Arce and Holly McPeak of
the United States advanced to the semi-finals. Another pair into
the top four were Brazilian Shelda Bede and Adriana Behar, the
top-seeded players in the world.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN Must Uphold Unity and Stick to Strategic Goals: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Singapore Deputy Prime
Minister Lee Hsien Loong has called upon ASEAN members to uphold
unity and stick to its strategic goals in face of current economic
crisis.
</P>
<P>
He made the point in his keynote speech delivered at the
opening ceremony of the one-day 16th ASEAN Ministerial meeting on
Energy Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Referring next years as a period of considerable economic
restructuring and uncertainty as well as a very difficult period
for the regional economies and ASEAN people, Lee Hsien Loong said
ASEAN has to remain a credible grouping, must not abandon the
vision of free and open trade which has underpinned the regional
prosperity these last years and must continue to strengthen
economic cooperation and to work towards long-term goals.
</P>
<P>
Billing the current crisis as a major test of the resilience
and unity of ASEAN and quoting some doubters as having asking
whether ASEAN will remain a credible grouping in the face of
crisis, the deputy prime minister said that "ASEAN has to prove
the doubters wrong," adding "it would be a costly mistake to allow
the crisis to undermine what ASEAN has achieved in these past
years, and derail plans for the future."
</P>
<P>
"This would dampen confidence and set back regional cooperation
for many years, long after the crisis has past," he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
"We should not lose sight of ASEAN's longer-term strategic
goals, however busy we are tackling immediate problems. We must
continue to pursue the realization of the ASEAN Free Trade Area,
the ASEAN Investment Area, and other strategic initiatives," the
deputy prime minister stressed.
</P>
<P>
"We may not be able to change the overall regional climate. But
we must make the most of specific opportunities for mutual
cooperation and gain, which exist even in the bleakest times," he
said, urging ASEAN members to bring into full play its habit of
pragmatism and "corporate culture" of cooperation.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN countries which used to enjoy the highest growth rate in
the world are now contracting. Reports say some countries battered
by the economic cyclone that swept the region have questioned the
benefits of plugging into the globalization and become
inward-looking.
</P>
<P>
Some reports even said that ASEAN's effectiveness and cohesion
had become unstuck in the wake of the regional crisis.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Takes Steps to Overcome Effect of Southeast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Yangon, August 1 (Xinhua)-- The Myanmar government is making
systematic plans and taking cautious steps to overcome the effect
fell on its country due to Southeast Asian currency crisis.
</P>
<P>
At a three-day seminar here began Friday on development of
economy and trade, Second Secretary of State Peace and Development
Council Lieutenant-General Tin Oo admitted that the currency
crisis occurring in the Southeast Asian countries affected the
economy of other neighbors including Myanmar, the official
newspaper New Light of Myanmar reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that decline in the currency prices, high
interest, close-down of factories and decline of stock market
were caused by this effect, saying that national economic life
must be built firmer and more developed stage by stage through
proper means.
</P>
<P>
The secretary called on its people to study and assess the
world's political, economic and social conditions and to find
ways and means to make reforms conforming to the national
characteristics and stand.
</P>
<P>
He urged them to work harder, to constantly study the situation
in the neighbors, to be thrifty as well as to prevent loss and
wastage without relying much on foreign goods.
</P>
<P>
Efforts must be directed toward boosting production in various
sectors, exporting new items and providing more incentives to the
private investors, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
The country's growth of gross domestic product in the fiscal
year 1997-98, which ended in March, gained only 4.6 percent
against the set growth of 6.4 percent due to the crisis.
</P>
<P>
In the fiscal year, the country's foreign trade totaled 3.24
billion U.S. dollars, of which exports amounted to only one
billion dollars, registering a deficit of 1.24 billion dollars in
its balance of trade in the period.
</P>
<P>
The increase in foreign investment in 1997 was less than that
in 1996, falling by one billion dollars despite reaching a total
of 6.6 billion dollars at the end of the year.

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi Government to Buy Jute from Growers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, August 1 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi government has
decided to buy raw jute directly from farmers this year so that
growers get a fair price.
</P>
<P>
A total of 150 purchasing centers would be set up throughout
the country, State Minister for Jute A.K. Faezul Huq stated
recently, a media report said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
A government committee headed by the finance minister has
decided to allocate one billion taka (21.3 million U.S. dollars)
for purchasing raw jute by the government-owned mills, the state
minister said.
</P>
<P>
In the past, jute growers did not like to sell their products
to the government-owned mills as they usually got pay late. The
government decision aims to solve the problem.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh is a major jute producing and exporting country in
the world, with 6 million bales (1.08 million tons) produced last
year and export of raw jute and jute products worth over 430
million dollars in the 1996-97 fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
The raw jute production in the country might fall to 3 to 3.5
million bales (0.54-0.63 million tons) this year from last year's
6 million bales (1.08 million tons) because the price of raw jute
and jute products at international jute market is declining and
jute growers have lost their interest in jute cultivation, a
preliminary government estimate said.
</P>
<P>
This South Asian country has attached importance to expanding
the jute sector in order to earn more foreign exchange, and
therefore, the Finance Ministry had allocated 2.3 billion taka
(48.9 million dollars) for the jute sector, out of which 1.3
billion taka (27.7 million dollars) will be spent for providing
incentives to jute goods exporters, according to other press
reports.

<P>
Sikharulidze told reporters after the performance that they
have prepared a lot and tried to concentrate on the ice.
</P>
<P>
"If you have good practices, you know how you must feel each

you know you can do it because you do it everyday," said
Sikharulidze.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> New Generation of African Leaders Have Emerged: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad said Saturday a new generation of African leaders
have emerged and they are more focused on the economic development
of their countries and their people.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said that during the recent Southern Africa
International Dialogue (SAID) in Namibia, he found the leaders
were different from before and they were not power-hungry
dictators who were only interested in enriching themselves.
</P>
<P>
"This is a new generation of African leaders who are more
focused on the economic development of their countries and their
people," he told reporters on his return from a visit to South
Africa, Namibia and Mozambique.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir had addressed the dialogue on "Global Cooperative
Governance" and also spoke on the Asian currency crisis. The
dialogue was attended by 14 African nations.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said that they were very impressed with the approach
adopted by Malaysia through "smart partnership".
</P>
<P>
He also took the opportunity to explain measures taken by
Malaysia to overcome the problem of disparity between the
Bumiputeras (sons of the soil) and non-Bumiputeras.
</P>
<P>
The Prime Minister said the West was not helping African
developing nations and seemed more concerned with issues like
freedom, more transparency, more open economy and problems in
countries like Angola and Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
"They can only say that this government is not good and that
government is not good and never recognize the change in the
attitude of African leaders who are now focused on the economic
development of their countries and their people," said Mahathir.
</P>
<P>
"And if they see there are opportunities to enrich themselves
in Africa, they will do so...for intense attacking South Africa
even though it is not all that rich," he said referring to the
recent attack on the South African rand which dropped 30 per cent
in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said that the depreciation of the rand had resulted in
neighboring countries having to devalue their currency to enable
them to compete with South Africa.
</P>
<P>
"So, the developing countries face very serious problems and
they feel that they have many things in common with us and they
look with fear at what is happening in Southeast Asia and East
Asia," he said.

HANOI, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Vietnamese Prime Minister Phan Van
Khai called on the nation Friday to get ready for, and deal with a

</P>
<P>
Vietnam's official media quoted the prime minister as saying
the nation did not record considerable progress in the economy in
July.
</P>
<P>
In July, agricultural production was hit by severe droughts
while industrial production and exports grew slowly compared to
the average growth in the first six months of the year, Khai said.

<P>
To successfully overcome difficulties, the government at all
levels must promptly and seriously implement the cabinet's June

</P>
<P>
He also called for stepped-up efforts to supervise and settle

<HEADLINE> Flood Situation Deteriorates in Dhaka </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Flood situation in Bangladesh's
capital of Dhaka and its adjoining areas has deteriorated as
several cracks have developed in the Dhaka-protecting embankment.
</P>
<P>
Cracks had developed at seven points in the 32.8
kilometer-Dhaka-Narayanganj-Demra embankment due to heavy pressure
of gushing water of Buriganga and Shitalakhya rivers, press
reports said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The important embankment came under threat as both the
Buriganga and Shitalakhya rivers were flowing above the danger
level, an official of the Water Development Board was quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of local people and those from authorities concerned
were working round the clock to repair the cracks in the
embankment. They managed to stop the flow of water by felling
sands and mud bags, but failed as more breaches were found later
at six points of the embankment, witnesses said.
</P>
<P>
At present, one-third of Dhaka's low-lying areas has been
flooded, and about 30,000 people of Dhaka have been forced to take
refuge in 50 shelters while many others shifted to safe places on
their own.
</P>
<P>
The Dhaka City Corporation, which is in charge of municipal
management, is organizing citizens to protect the embankment and
to do relief work.
</P>
<P>
However, the flood situation is improving in the northern and
eastern districts of the country, which has been seriously
affected since early July with over 17 million people in 37
districts of the total of 64 hit by flood, and the flood related
death toll arising to 242 as of Friday.
</P>
<P>
The government has so far distributed over 11 million taka
(about 23,000 U.S. dollars) in cash and about 30.000 tons of rice
and wheat among the flood-hit people, and sent more than 3,400
medical teams to the flood-hit districts.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Has No Wish to Dispute With Singapore: PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad said Saturday Malaysia does not wish to have any
dispute with Singapore and called on its neighbor to settle the
issue over the long-standing Malaysian immigration checkpoint at
the Tanjong Pagar railway station south of Singapore.
</P>
<P>
"The initiative is with them, we were going along fine when
suddenly they decided that they do not want our people to be in
Singapore. I need a little bit of time to think about what we need
to do," the prime minister told reporters at the Kuala Lumpur
International Airport upon his return from a week-long visit to
three African nations.
</P>
<P>
Asked by reporters on the matter, Mahathir said the dispute was
started by Singapore and not Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
"Actually, if there is a souring of relations between Malaysia
and Singapore, it is because of them," he said, maintaining that
Malaysia would not relocate its customs, immigration and
quarantine (CIQ) checkpoint from Tanjong Pagar to Woodlands.
</P>
<P>
The two countries are at a standoff following Singapore's
decision to move its own CIQ facilities from the Tanjong Pagar
station owned by Malaysia's Railway Company to Woodlands closer to
the Malaysian border effective today.
</P>
<P>
Singapore had insisted that Malaysian immigration moved to
Woodlands and warned that rail passengers would face difficulties
and Malaysian immigration would be acting without legal authority
if it continued to operate from Tanjong Pagar.
</P>
<P>
To a question, Mahathir said he did not know if Singapore could
force Malaysia to relocate its checkpoint to Woodlands "but
certainly when we are having problems with our economy, this is an
unwelcome problem.
</P>
<P>
"I don't know why they choose this time to do this thing. Maybe
to them it is a strategy," said Mahathir.
</P>
<P>
Asked if he was confident that Malaysia and Singapore would be
able to settle the dispute without the intervention of a third
party, Mahathir said: "We hope we can, we'll try."

<HEADLINE> Bulgarian Clearance of White-collar Crime Up 50 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, July 31 (Xinhua) -- Bulgaria's clearance rate of
white-collar crimes improved by over 50 percent in the first half
of this year, compared to the same period last year,the Interior
Ministry said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The government solved 9,447 crimes involving the equivalent of
more than 487 million U.S. dollars, of which it appropriated more
than 33 million dollars in the first six months of this year.
</P>
<P>
In the checked 10,761 cases of non-performing bank loans, an
estimated 48 million U.S. dollars in loans as bad debts were
returned, the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
During the past six months, the government made nearly 900
police raids on about 3,000 outlets involved in the manufacture
and distribution of pirated CDs.
</P>
<P>
More than 110,000 CDs, 15,000 pirated video cassettes, and
8,500 bootlegged audio cassettes were seized. More than 182
preliminary inquiries were initiated, said the ministry.
</P>
<P>
Structural changes in society, the effective management of
currency and the more efficient performances of the relevant
government sectors were partially the reason for success against
crime.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said new forms of crime were emerging including
computer crime, software pirating and fraudulent bankruptcies. The
smuggling of excisable goods was expected to intensify following
the ban on duty-free retailing at border crossings.
</P>
<P>
The government would also target fraudulent claims for refunds
through fictitious deals and letter-box companies.

<HEADLINE> India's Industrial Slowdown Continues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Indian industry continues to
suffer the effect of a slowdown, Indian newspaper Business
Standard reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
52 segments have reported lower production growth in the first
quarter of the current financial year 1998-99 (April 1, 1998-March
31, 1999) in comparison with the same period of the last financial
year. The latest figures belie the hopes of a potential revival
indicated by the figures for April, which showed signs of a
pick-up in certain key segments like automobiles, consumer
durables, cement and steel.
</P>
<P>
An overwhelming section of industry including steel (1.6
percent) and cement (5 percent) reeled under negative or moderate
growth rates during April-June 1998 compared with April-June 1997.
</P>
<P>
Medium and heavy commercial vehicles (-54 percent), light
commercial vehicles (-29 percent), cars (-4 percent) and
multi-utility vehicles (-14 percent) recorded negative production
growth.
</P>
<P>
Capital goods like textile machinery (-25 percent) and basic
goods like diesel (-0.2 percent), petrol (6.8 percent) and oil
refinery (3 percent) also bore the brunt of the slump in the
economy to record dismal performance, the paper said.

<HEADLINE> US Against Split Bosnia-Herzegovina, Says Envoy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZAGREB, July 31 (Xinhua) -- The United States is against "any
attempt to split Bosnia-Herzegovina," a U.S. presidential envoy
for the Balkans said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Recently, there were some ridiculous sayings about splitting
Bosnia-Herzegovina and revising the 1995 Dayton peace agreement,
Robert Gelbard said, and Washington was resolutely opposed to any
such attempts.
</P>
<P>
The aim of the United States is to keep Bosnia as a unified
state composed of two multi-ethnic entities, as the Dayton
agreement stipulated, Gelbard told a press conference in Sarajevo.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. will continue to link its financial support for
Bosnia's reconstruction to support for the Dayton accords which
ended the 1992-95 war, said the special envoy, who is making a
three-day visit to Bosnia-Herzegovina.
</P>
<P>
"Our aid is provided only to those who demonstrate their
willingness to support the Dayton agreement -- and if they don't,
we won't provide any assistance."
</P>
<P>
Gelbard criticized Momcilo Krajisnik, the Serbian member of the
Bosnian Presidency, and other Serbian leaders who were saying that
the United States was supporting the split of the republic.
</P>
<P>
That's purely a lie, he said.
</P>
<P>
With elections to be held in Bosnia on September 12-13, the
U.S. envoy said Washington wanted to see "smoothly functioning and
very positive" joint institutions, including the three-member
inter-ethnic presidency.
</P>
<P>
The elections would be decisive to the future of
Bosnia-Herzegovina, he added.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar, Indonesia Sign Agreement to Explore Coal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar's Department of Geological
Survey and Mineral Exploration (DGSME) of Ministry of Mines and
PT Austindo Nusantara Energi of Indonesia signed Friday an
agreement on mineral prospecting, exploration and feasibility
study for development of coal resources in Taninthayi Division,
southern Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar government, in accordance with its market-oriented
economic policy, has opened up the mineral prospecting and
exploration opportunities to foreign investors, Myanmar Minister
for Mines Brigadier-General Ohn Myint was quoted by Saturday's
official newspaper the New Light of Myanmar as saying.
</P>
<P>
Ohn Myint said that Myanmar has provided incentives in the form
of initial tax exemption and, in addition, option has been given
to purchase government interest at an agreed price after the
positive feasibility study.
</P>
<P>
It is the first agreement signed between an Indonesia coal
mining company and Myanmar's DGSME.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, the output value of Myanmar's
mining sector, which include coal, rose 1.5 percent in 1997-98
fiscal year which ended in March and the production of coal in the
year went to 37,000 tons from 30,733 tons of the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Up to now, more than a dozen foreign companies including those
from Australia, Japan, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand and the
United States have been participating in mining extraction in
Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics showed that Indonesia had injected over 236
million U.S. dollars in eight permitted projects in Myanmar by the
end of April this year, ranking the eighth in the 23 countries and
regions which had invested a total of 7 billion dollars in
Myanmar.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Press Hailing PLA's Heroic Deeds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Beijing's major newspapers hailed
the People's Liberation Army's 71st founding anniversary which
falls on today.
</P>
<P>
Today's Liberation Army Daily extended greetings to all members
of the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA), armed police,
reserve military personnel and people's militia.
</P>
<P>
In an editorial, the paper described the PLA's history as a
history of working hard and dedicatedly for the people's interest,
both in war time and in the period of peace.
</P>
<P>
The paper called on the whole army to adhere to its traditional
value of being loyal to the Communist Party, to the country and
its people, and to socialism.
</P>
<P>
The three generations of Chinese leadership have all attached
importance to retaining the PLA's general purpose and character
and, to do this, the PLA must subject itself entirely under the
leadship of the Communist Party of China.
</P>
<P>
The paper also calls on the army to unswervingly adhere to the
fine style of hard work and to consciously resist the erosion and
influence of decadent ideological culture and living style.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, officers in the people's army should take a lead in
fighting against the money worshipping, hedonism and out-and-out
egoism, and other evil tendencies, said the paper.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, today's People's Daily also carries a commentator's
article on its front page entitled "Salute to the Heroic People's
Army" to show respects to Chinese officers and men, thanking them
for their remarkable deeds in the battle against heavy flooding
along the Yangtze, Yellow and Nenjiang rivers as well as in other
parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
When central China's Hubei and Hunan provinces, and east China's
Jiangxi, Anhui and Jiangsu provinces as well as the northernmost
Heilongjiang province suffered from heavy floods in the past
month, officers and men of the PLA and armed police threw
themselves into the fierce battles against the floods.
</P>
<P>
They helped repair river dikes, rescued flood victims and saved
their properties, and helped them to rebuild their homes and go
all out for post-flood industrial and farm production.
</P>
<P>
Under the leadship of the Party Central Committee and the State
Council, the paper says, China is surely to win the battle against
floods.
</P>
<P>
The article also paid tribute to the armymen's outstanding
performance during the Tangshan Earthquake in July 1976, and the
subsequent fierce fires in Greater Khingan Mountains, saying that
success in China's socialist construction cause is inseparable
from the dedicated efforts of the army.
</P>
<P>
"Wherever there is floods, there are soldiers," echoes China
Youth Daily, praising nearly four million Chinese soldiers
involving in the battle against the flooding this year.
</P>
<P>
So far this year, the army personnel have helped rescued more
than 300,000 flood victims from surging floods the Yangtze River
innundated their homes.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Improving Its Urban Planning </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Beijing is carrying out research
on how to improve its urban expressway and public communications
systems, said today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
This is part of the municipality's comprehensive program to
improve urban planning. The program, begun in 1991, will continue
until 2010.
</P>
<P>
The aim is to make Beijing into a prosperous and stable
international metropolitan with first-class public services, basic
facilities and a sound environment, according to Cui Fengxia,
vice-director of the city's urban and rural planning commission.
</P>
<P>
To control the city's growth and adjust the municipality's
industrial structure, the emphasis on construction and development
should be transfered from urban to suburban areas, Cui said
yesterday at the closing session of the 11th municipal people's
congress standing committee.
</P>
<P>
As a city with a history of more than 3,000 years, Beijing
should also be preserved as an ancient historic city as it
develops, and this has been taken into account by the city's
government in mapping out urban planning programs, according to
Cui.

<HEADLINE> IMF to Expand Loan Aid to Ukraine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, July 31 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary Fund (IMF)
will make a loan of 2.2 billion U.S. dollars to Ukraine, the IMF
mission announced here Friday.
</P>
<P>
The three-year loan, from July 1, 1998 to June 30, 2001, was
decided at a tentative agreement between the two sides and still
needs the approval of the IMF Board of Governors in August, said
Mohammed Shadman-Valavi, head of the mission.
</P>
<P>
The loan, termed an "extended fund facility", will promote the
annual growth of the gross domestic product of Ukraine to three to
five percent, and limit the inflation rate to below 10 percent or
even eight percent between 1999 and 2000, the agreement predicted.
</P>
<P>
The IMF mission arrived in Kiev on July 23.

<P>
In their discussion with the Ukrainian side about the
possibility of more loans, the IMF mission expressed appreciation
of Ukraine's economic promotion measures. It said these efforts
would encourage the development of private economy and help
attract more foreign investment.

Association with Foreign Countries and the Jamaican-Chinese
Friendship Association.

<P>
Speaking at the opening ceremony, Jamaica's Governor General,

economic development of Latin American and Caribbean countries.
</P>
<P>

development of Jamaica, and of the region in general, he said.

model to achieve everything in the world if we work together," he
added.

countries should shoulder the obligation of safeguarding national
sovereignty, developing national economies and raising people's
living standards, he said.

economic cooperation, he said.

and the progress of mankind.

further support.
</P>
<P>
Accusing the central government led by Prime Minister Nawaz
Sharif of intriguing against his government, Mengal announced his
resignation after a series of meetings with PML(N) failed to yield
results.
</P>
<P>
Protracted talks between Mengal's Balochistan National Party
(BNP) and PML(N), mediated by the representatives of the federal
government, broke down Wednesday night, then Mengal informed the
aides to the prime minister that he would relinquish his post.
</P>
<P>
Mengal's resignation as the provincial chief minister came
after he had survived an abortive no-confidence motion tabled
against him by some PML (N) members of the Parliament Assembly and
a revolt within his own BNP a few days ago.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here believe that the political crisis in Balochistan
province may have been triggered by more than one factors.
</P>
<P>
But sarcastic and scornful remarks made by Ataullah Mengal,
father of the chief minister, at a party meeting ignited a revolt
against his son's fragile coalition which has seen several ups and
downs since its inception in February 1997.
</P>
<P>
"That all those who now make up the rank of the dissidents were
ministers. They explain how strongly they felt their honor was
slighted at the meeting," Pakistan's leading English daily "The
News" said in a recent article.
</P>
<P>
The PML(N) members deserted the 28-year-old Akhtar Mengal
after his party revolt and proposed him to firm up his support or
stand down.
</P>
<P>
"The situation had reached a point of no return between the
PML(N) and the chief minister," Federal Minister for Provincial
Coordination Chaudhry Nisar Ali Khan said after holding marathon
meeting with Akhtar Mengal.
</P>
<P>
Akhtar Mengal, who was driven from pillar to post to salvage
his government, announced that his BNP had no justification to
remain in power after PML (N) withdrew its support.
</P>
<P>
He complained that he faced non-cooperation from PML (N)
members in the provincial assembly, despite that "I maintained
good relations with the center and extended full support to it at
the time of judicial crisis, rift with (former president ) Farooq
Leghari and constitutional amendments."
</P>
<P>
Mengal blamed the central government for motivating
resignations by PML (N) ministers in Balochistan. But he said he
would not advise provincial governor to dissolve the state
legislature to pave way for fresh polls.
</P>
<P>
Balochistan, the sparsely populated southwestern province
bordering with Iran and Afghanistan, hit headlines in the
international media when Pakistan conducted its nuclear tests at
the end of May in its uninhabited Chaghi district.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here noted that the politics in Balochistan is
absolutely different from rest of the country where tribal and
ethnic linkages are much stronger than political parties.
</P>
<P>
It would not be surprising that ideologically distant entities
such as religious fundamentalists and hard-core nationalists may
join hands to form the coalition in the province or PML (N) and
its arch rival, Pakistan People's Party led by Benazir Bhutto
enter into alliance at the provincial level.
</P>
<P>
Apparently, the dissident elements in BNP turned tables against
Akhtar Mengal out of an urge to restore their tribal honor rather
than any political or ideological considerations.
</P>
<P>
Media Reports said that the eight dissident ministers felt that
choice of words by the father of outgoing chief minister while
taking them to task was "offending".
</P>
<P>
The tribal set-up in Balochistan is as strong and powerful as
it was in the 1970s when late prime minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto
announced that he had done away with the Sardari (tribal system).
</P>
<P>
The in-party revolt against Akhtar Mengal came hardly a month
after PML (N) moved vote of no-confidence against his government.
The central PML (N) ordered the estranged deputies to withdraw the
motion or face disqualification from the provincial legislatures.
</P>
<P>
PML (N) stripped its five deputies of their assembly seats for
their failure to comply with the party instructions.
</P>
<P>
The ruling PML (N) has kept its options open and authorized its
provincial leadership to negotiate with the regional parties for a
coalition.
</P>
<P>
Government sources suggested that PML (N) has decided to lead
the coalition government with its nominee as the chief minister.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Defense Minister Pledges Legal Action </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian Defense Minister
General Wiranto confirmed his pledge to bring to justice all
parties involved in sexual violence against Chinese women during
the May riots, including any military personnel, local press
reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after a meeting with Wiranto, chairperson of the Civil
Society on Violence, Saparinah Sadli said the general would have
no problem taking legal recourse against military members
suspected of raping or sexually assaulting Chinese women.
</P>
<P>
Sadli said the minister, also chief of the Indonesian Armed
Forces (ABRI), also promised to issue a public statement
condemning the gang rapes, as demanded by her group, and vowed to
uncover everything surrounding the cases in a transparent manner.
</P>
<P>
The group urged Wiranto to issue a statement condemning the
terror and any acts of violence, and to lay out concrete steps to
revive the public's sense of security.
</P>
<P>
Sadli said a public statement from the military was urgently
required to allay people's fears of the possibility of further
acts of violence against women.
</P>
<P>
The group said ABRI's immediate and concrete action would also
be received favorably by the international community whose
increasing concern with the violations against human rights in
Indonesia might result in a request for an United Nations
investigation.
</P>
<P>
From May 13 to 15, Indonesia saw the worst looting and rioting
in decades in Jakarta, Medan and Solo. According to a
non-governmental organization, the total number of victims of rape
and sexual harassment from the rioting has now reached 168. The
greater Jakarta area recorded a total of 152 victims including 20
deaths.

<HEADLINE> Panama Commemorates Late Leader Torrijos </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PANAMA CITY, July 31 (Xinhua) -- Panamanian people gathered
Friday to commemorate their late leader, Omar Torrijos, who died
in an aircraft accident 17 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Panamanian President Ernesto Perez Balladares, government
ministers and other leaders of the ruling Revolutionary Democratic
Party, of which Torrijos was the founding father, attended a
religious ceremony in homage to the late leader.
</P>
<P>
One of Torrijos' greatest achievements is believed to be the
signing of the 1977 Torrijos-Carter Treaty with then United States
President Jimmy Carter. Under the treaty, the Panama Canal and all
its ancillary installations will revert to Panamanian control at
midnight on December 31, 1999.
</P>
<P>
United States troops - which have guarded the canal since it
opened in 1914 - will have to leave the country.
</P>
<P>
Also present at the Friday ceremony was his son, Martin
Torrijos, now interior and justice minister, as well as his
friends and representatives of social, cultural and political
organizations.
</P>
<P>
A photographic exhibition focusing on Torrijos' military and
political life was also inaugurated Friday.
</P>
<P>
Torrijos, born on February 13, 1929, led the Panamanian
government from October 11, 1968 until July 31, 1981, when the
plane he aboard crashed into the foothills of Santa Marta on one
of his routine domestic tours.
</P>
<P>
The accident and his death have remained a mystery over the
past 17 years. Some said he was murdered by a disaffected army,
and others suspected that the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency was
involved.

<HEADLINE> Four Referees Suspended from Goodwill Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, July 31 (Xinhua) -- The International Amaeur Boxing
Association (AIBA) announced the suspension of four boxing
referees at the 1998 Goodwill Games here Friday after the Russian
Boxing Federation lodged a formal protest and withdrew from the co
mpetition.
</P>
<P>
Suspened from officiating for the remainder of the Games are
referees Macario Sosa of Guatemala, Alfredo Toledo of Cuba,
Per-Olof Larsson of Sweden and Dieter Mika of Germany.
</P>
<P>
In registering its protest, the Russian Boxing Federation had
also withdrawn its remaining competitors from the competition. But
following the decisive action taken by AIBA, the Russian team has
agreed to continue to compete.
</P>
<P>
"It was the opinion of the Russian Boxing Federation that
judgments made by the officials were biased and led to the
elimination of some of their boxers," said Arthur Tunstall, the
AIBA technical delegate to the Goodwill Games.
</P>
<P>
"Upon review of the judgements, it was decided by the AIBA
international jury that suspensions of certain officials were
warranted. It is an unfortunate incident, but we hope the AIBA
action puts to rest any remaining questions or concerns," Tunstall
added.
</P>
<P>
The suspensions will shrink the pool of available referees from
13 to nine. Goodwill Games officials said that the controversy
would not change the remaining schedule for boxing, taking place
in the Theater at Madison Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
"We regret that such action was necessary during this exciting
boxing competition," said Goodwill Games President Mike Plant.
"This decision is the most appropriate for all parties concerned,
and we respect the action taken."

<HEADLINE> NZ Scientists to Chart Dairy Family Tree </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, August 1 (Xinhua) -- The Livestock Improvement
Corporation of New Zealand has contracted the Forest Research
Institute and a United States firm to use forestry DNA techniques
to trace the parentage of most of New Zealand's milking cows.
</P>
<P>
According to recent reports in local newspapers, the signing of
such a contract is aimed at ensuring the success of Corporation's
breeding programs, which is regarded as the largest project of its
kind ever carried out by it.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that the DNA technique has been successful in
improving forestry tree stock quality, giving growers confidence
that a product will grow to its label description.
</P>
<P>
NZ forest scientist Tom Richardson was quoted as saying: "The
number of bulls and calves to be paternity-tested runs into tens
of thousands, making this the biggest dairy cattle testing program
the world has ever seen."
</P>
<P>
According to the scientist, the techniques for plantation
forestry gene-typing had been adapted for the project to cover DNA
testing in many other species.
</P>
<P>
More than 14,000 sire tests had been put through the laboratory
and another 18,000 tests on calves born in 1996 were scheduled to
be processed by September.
</P>
<P>
After that, between 20,000 and 40,000 animals would be tested
each year by the laboratory to provide an up-to-date register for
the national dairy herd, according to the contract.

<HEADLINE> No Epidemics Reported In Flooded Parts Of East China Province </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANCHANG, August 1 (Xinhua) -- An official in east China's
Jiangxi Province says that, thanks to the hard work of 1,600
medical and epidemic prevention teams, they were able to prevent
any outbreak of epidemic disease even though the province was
ravaged by floods for more than a month.
</P>
<P>
The provincial medical department has sent more than 8 million
yuan (964,000 US dollars) worth of medicines to flooded areas. The
city of Jiujiang, one of the heaviest-hit areas in northern
Jiangxi, received 330,000 yuan (398,000 US dollars) worth of
medicine alone. Medical workers there formed more than 400 groups
that treated over 50,000 people and spread essential medical
information and diseases prevention knowledge.
</P>
<P>
Hospitals in Nanchang city, the provincial capital, sent
doctors to 18 villages that were stranded by floods from late June
to mid-July. Medical personnel worked day and night to treat
approximately 1,700 local people suffering from diarrhoea, fevers,
and heatstroke and applied disinfectant to 220 ha of ground.

<HEADLINE> NZ Turns down British Call for Child Migrant Inquiry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, August 1 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand has turned down
Britain's call for the NZ Parliament to conduct an inquiry into
the treatment of 549 child migrants from Britain in the post-war
years.
</P>
<P>
Wellington-based paper "The Dominion" Saturday quoted NZ
Associate Welfare Minister Nick Smith as saying that The NZ
government will not hold a formal inquiry into the case.
</P>
<P>
Smith said yesterday that the practical help would be of more
use to the people involved.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that a British House of Commons committee has
repeated its call for the Social Services Committee of the NZ
Parliament to make a detained inquiry into the circumstances of
former child migrants in New Zealand. The British Child Migrants
Society in New Zealand also has urged the NZ government to act on
the House of Commons inquiry.
</P>
<P>
A Society spokesman was quoted as saying that "The New Zealand
Government has not spent one penny and doesn't want to," unlike
the Australian Government, which had spent more than 500,000 U.S.
dollars on research and on travel for former migrants to return to
Britain to contact their families.
</P>
<P>
"My concern is that we'll end up spending millions on experts,
on commissioners, on lawyers without necessarily advancing the
interests of these people," Smith replied.
</P>
<P>
"I think we're better to put our resources into helping those
individuals trace their family origins so they can make contact
with other family members back in the United Kingdom," he said.
</P>
<P>
"But we need to keep the issue in proportion to some of the
other issues. The most important issue is we can't put right what
occurred in the 40s and 50s."

<P>
BEIJING, August 1 (Xinhua) -- A recent survey in 10 large
Chinese cities found that 10.6 percent of the people there do not
often eat breakfast.
</P>
<P>
The study of 5,128 permanent residents in Beijing, Shanghai,
Guangzhou, Chengdu, Nanning, Wuhan, Xi'an and other cities was

</P>
<P>
It found that, out of 545 people who said they do not often
have breakfast, 57.6 percent were male. It also found that, of the
20 percent who often have breakfast in restaurants, males
outnumbered females two to one.
</P>
<P>
Although the traditional porridge, steamed bread, eggs, and
deep-fried dough sticks are still the main breakfast food for most
residents in urban areas, milk, yoghurt, and cake have come to be
accepted by more Chinese families.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Government Optimistic About Economic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 1 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government
expressed optimism about the country's economic recovery prospects
following international aid from donor countries and agencies for
the 1998/99 fiscal year, local press Saturday quoted a minister as
saying.
</P>
<P>
"The president is very optimistic the country's economy will
improve after the Consultative Group on Indonesia (CGI)
commitments," Minister of Industry and Trade Rahardi Ramelan told
reporters after a meeting with President B.J. Habibie here on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, international donors pledged 7.9 billion U.S.
dollars in aid to Indonesia, to be disbursed during the 1998/99
fiscal year which ends in March 1999. The pledges came after a
two-day meeting between the Indonesian delegation led by
Coordinating Minister for Economy, Industry and Finance Ginandjar
Kartasasmita and international donors grouped under the CGI in
Paris.
</P>
<P>
The country's economic recovery prospects had brightened with
the international community's show of confidence, Habibie was
quoted by Ramelan as saying.
</P>
<P>
"The president welcomes the confidence shown in Indonesia by
friendly countries and international agencies. The aid will go to
the Indonesian budget. Together with International Monetary Fund
loans, the total aid will be around 14 billion U.S. dollars,"
Ramelan added.
</P>
<P>
In Paris, Ginandjar told reporters that he was grateful for the
money, most of which would be spent on poverty reduction and basic
commodity subsidy programs.
</P>
<P>
"I am very happy to note the good understanding of our
situation on the part of bilateral and multilateral donors," he
added.

<HEADLINE> Harbin Reports Steady Rise in Industrial Output Value </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Harbin, capital of China's
northernmost Heilongjiang Province, generated an industrial output
value of 16.8 billion yuan (2.02 billion US dollars) during the
first half of this year, up 9.17 percent on the same period last
year.
</P>
<P>
The figures indicate that the city's industrial output has
entered a period of stable growth when compared to the 1998 first
quarter rise of 4.58 percent.
</P>
<P>
Related growth has also been attributed to local efforts to
restructure unprofitable state-owned industrial
enterprises. Harbin's state enterprises account for close to 70
percent of local industrial assests, a level substantially above
the national average.
</P>
<P>
The city has introduced 40-odd preferential policies to support
the retooling of local state-owned enterprises, including measures
such as auctions, mergers and payroll reduction programs.
</P>
<P>
Some 146 state enterprises have been sold, and an additional 18
bankrupt companies have been involved in mergers.
</P>
<P>
The city has also completed more than 100 industrial
technological upgrades and has granted a substantial amount of
loans to profitable industrial enterprises.

LONDON, July 31 (Xinhua) -- Manchester United were stunned
Friday when Aston Villa called off Dwight Yorke's multimillion
pound move to Old Trafford.
</P>
<P>
Villa manger Johan Gregory blocked the deal because United will
not give him Andy Cole in part-exchange.
</P>
<P>
Selling the 16 million-pound Trinidad striker could double
Villa's cash mountain, but Gregory insisted:"as far as I'm
concerned, the deal is off."
</P>
<P>
"If Andy Cole is not available, that is it. Dwight Yorke will
stay here.
</P>
<P>
"We need striker, but we do not need money. Money in the bank
does not score you goals," he said.
</P>
<P>
He even hinted he was prepared to quit if chairman Doug Ellis
decided to sell the 26-year-old over his head.
</P>
<P>
"If it's taken out of my hands, I'll be very upset," warned Gre
gory, "I've been told that any decision relating to Dwight is mine

<HEADLINE> Beijing Students Explore Water Resources </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Some 100 primary and middle
school students from Beijing have spent at least part of their
vacation attending a summer camp focused on water conservation.
</P>
<P>
The students gained a better understanding of the overall
status of Beijing's water resources, according to organizers from
the city's water conservation office and the Beijing Children's
Palace.
</P>
<P>
The campers went to visit the city's waterworks, reservoirs,
sewage treatment plants and drought-stricken areas.
</P>
<P>
Beijing has recorded higher than normal precipitation levels
this summer, but nonetheless continues to face an acute water
shortage. Recent statistics list the city's per-capita water
resources at 300 cu.m., a level equal to around 12 percent of the
national average and slightly below eight percent of the world
average.
</P>
<P>
In addition, problems surrounding rampant waste are compounded
by the lack of a rational system for the use of limited water
resources.
</P>
<P>
Organizers noted that participants would quite likely play a
major role in convincing the city's students to conserve and save
water.

<HEADLINE> Central Chinese Province Ensures Projected GDP Growth Despite Flood </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Hubei, one of the provinces hardest
hit by floods in central China, will not wait for the safe passage
of the third flood crest of this year before mobilizing all forces
to resume orderly production.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government urged local people to lose no time in
agricultural and industrial production, while combating the floods,
in an effort to meet this year's economic target.
</P>
<P>
Hubei has set a goal of 12 percent growth in gross domestic
product (GDP). Its mid-year results show a steady year-to-year
increase of 9.5 percent, 2.5 percent higher than the national
average.
</P>
<P>
Though Hubei reaped the third best summer grain harvest this
year, it was hit by heavy flooding in late June and torrential
rains in July, which affected 20.7 million people and 1.38 million
hectares of farmland, and resulted in direct economic losses of
12.7 billion yuan (1.53 billion US dollars).
</P>
<P>
So far, flood control efforts have been successful, with some
1.486 billion cubic meters of floodwater drained off from farmland
and urban districts. Wuhan, the provincial capital, and Huangshi
City, which suffered its worst flood since 1954, have drained off
all floodwater and resumed normal industrial production and
communications and power operations.
</P>
<P>
At a recent emergency metting, the provincial government called
on all departments to channel more funds into infrastructure
construction, expand domestic markets and accelerate the growth of
the township and private sectors.

<HEADLINE> American Giant Computer Maker Cuts Managers' Pay </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles, July 31 (Xinhua) -- Hewlett-Packard Co., the
world's third-largest computer maker, is asking managers to take a
five percent pay cut, computer information provider CNET online
service reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
As part of HP's ongoing effort to cut expenses, the decision
will affect about 2,400 mid- to upper-level managers worldwide.
The cut is expected to last three months. The Silicon Valley-based
company has 125,000 employees.
</P>
<P>
HP also will close offices worldwide for four days between
Christmas and New Year's.
</P>
<P>
The move follows a warning last week by the company that
third-quarter profits will be lower than expected due to poor
sales in Asia, slowdowns in the United States and Europe and the
plummeting PC prices.
</P>
<P>
The computer giant has been in cost-controlling mode for months
now. Various departments, including profitable ones, were asked
earlier in the year to cut their expenses after the company
reported disappointing second-quarter results. Travel expenses
were reduced, parts of the company closed for several days during
the July 4 holiday and even company picnics were canceled.
</P>
<P>
The 60-year-old HP, which helped create California's Silicon
Valley, makes a range of products from personal computers and
high-end servers to printers. A company spokeswoman said that HP
has taken similar steps in the past as a means to cut costs while
avoiding layoffs.
</P>
<P>
Citing problems similar to HP, another Silicon Valley company
-- National Semiconductor Corp. -- on Thursday asked its 13,000
employees worldwide to take 10 days unpaid leave or vacation.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 31 (Xinhua) -- Michale Owen, who scored a wonder
goal during the Engliand-Argentina games at the World Cup in
France, is so vital to Liverpool, which want to increase by six
times his insurance cover against a career-threatening injury.
</P>
<P>
The 60 million pounds valuation is the highest known for a
footballer and relects the 18-year-old's soaring worth since his
impressive displays this summer.
</P>
<P>
The premium for 60 million would cost one million a year, but
Liverpool may find it hard to persuade an insurer to take on the
risk and could end up cutting their valuation.
</P>
<P>
Liverpool believe Owen is vital to their hopes of qualifying
for the European Champions League. His World Cup impact has
already boosted ticket and club shirt sales.

LONDON, July 31 (Xinhua) -- Students and academics in the UK
will pay for the transatlantic Internet traffic from midnight on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The UK Education and Research Networking Association (UKERNA),
which runs JANET, the UK's academic and research network, has
announced that it will start collecting new charges for incoming
traffic on transatlantic links from August 1.
</P>
<P>
According to an announcement from the UKERNA, all universities,
most colleges of higher education and most research council
establishments who link to JANET will pay two pence (0.033 U.S.
dollars) for every two megabytes received over transatlantic
links.
</P>
<P>
Traffic received between 01:00 and 06:00 each morning will be
free from charging. Other than that, all incoming transatlantic
traffic, including that at weekends, will no longer be free.
</P>
<P>
Because of the nature of the Internet routing and JANET's set
up, not only incoming U.S. data, traffic from some organizations
within Europe or even the UK is subject to charging if it is
routed via the United States.
</P>
<P>
The annual bill for institutions should average 15,000 pounds
(24,489 U.S. dollars), and the UKERNA estimates that it can raise
about two million pounds (3.3 million U.S. dollars) in the current
financial year.
</P>
<P>
JANET's costs have risen in 10 years from 2.5 million pounds
(4.1 million U.S. dollars) to 20 million pounds (32.7 million U.S.
dollars) with traffic increasing at between 200 to 300 percent
annually.
</P>
<P>
"The Funding Council consider it no longer appropriate to
provide central funds to provide 100 percent funding for what
appears to be an unlimited demand for networking service," the
UKERNA said in the announcement.

<HEADLINE> Ultrasound Boosts Detection of Down's Syndrome </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 31 (Xinhua) -- A new ultrasound test can pick up
20 percent more Down's syndrome fetuses than traditional analysis,
scientists said Friday in The Lancet medical journal.
</P>
<P>
The new method to select the high-risk pregnant women is based
on the mother's age combined with measurement of the swelling of
the back of the neck in fetuses, which is assessed by ultrasound.
</P>
<P>
Studies have shown that swelling under the skin at the back of
the neck of the fetus after 10 to 14 weeks of pregnancy is
associated with increased risk of Down's syndrome and other
chromosomal defects.
</P>
<P>
Doctors from the Fetal Medicine Foundation First Trimester
Screening Group assessed the risk of Down's syndrome in 96,127
pregnant women at 22 clinics across the UK using this new method.
</P>
<P>
The scan was more than 82 percent accurate, compared with a 60
detection rate for current tests involving selection of risk by
the mother's age and an analysis of her blood and lymph make-up.
</P>
<P>
Traditional way to assess whether a pregnant woman is at high
risk of having a baby with Down's syndrome is her age. Screening
by age alone can only identifies 30 percent of cases.
</P>
<P>
Down's syndrome is a condition caused by a chromosomal
abnormality which produces mental retardation, a flattened face
and coarse, straight hair. Those afflicted are usually born to
mother over 40.

<HEADLINE> Scientists Identify New Muscle Disease </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 31 (Xinhua) -- A new muscle disease of unknown
cause appear to be emerging in Europe, scientists warned Friday.
</P>
<P>
The disorder, named macrophagic myofasciitis, was first seen in
France in 1993 and appears to be spreading, French doctors
reported in the medical journal The Lancet.
</P>
<P>
Researchers from the Henri Modor hospital in Creteil, France,
said that the disease has affected 18 patients who complained of
joint pains, weakness, fever and fatigue.
</P>
<P>
On physical examination, the patients show no sign of muscle
wasting, but in some individuals muscles were tender to the touch.
</P>
<P>
An examination of muscle tissue from the patients under a
microscope revealed something never seen before.
</P>
<P>
Large numbers of immune system cells called macrophages were
densely packed around the connective tissue sheaths that bundle
the muscles together.
</P>
<P>
Normally, macrophages engulf and digest invading microbes. Why
they would gather near this sheathing tissue and apparently cause
damage was puzzling.
</P>
<P>
"At present the cause of this unique disorder is unknown."
researchers wrote.
</P>
<P>
However, they speculate that an infection may be responsible.

<HEADLINE> Deutsche Bank May Have Known of Nazi Gold: Historians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, July 31 (Xinhua) -- An independent panel of historians
reported Friday that Germany's largest commercial bank, the
Deutsche Bank, may have knowingly purchased gold looted by German
Nazis during World War II.
</P>
<P>
The panel, commissioned by the Deutsche Bank to investigate the
bank's war-time activities, indicated in its final report that
some former top officials of the bank could have known the origin
of the gold that was looted from territories occupied by Nazi
Germany and from Nazi concentration camps.
</P>
<P>
The report said that during World War II, the Deutsche Bank
purchased a total of 4,466 kilograms of gold from Germany's
war-time central bank, the Reichsbank, an amount worth some 5
million U.S. dollars at that time.
</P>
<P>
It also said that the Deutsche Bank made profits of about
938,000 Reichsmark from the gold between 1941 and 1943, which
amounted to about 1.5 percent of the bank's total profits for the
period.
</P>
<P>
The Deutsche Bank Friday declined to comment directly on the
panel's report, but said that it deeply regretted the injustice
that took place during the war and fully acknowledged its moral
and ethical responsibility.
</P>
<P>
Holocaust survivors last month launched a collective lawsuit in
New York claiming that the Deutsche Bank and another big German
bank -- Dresdner Bank -- had profited from Holocaust victims'
personal assets like gold teeth fillings, gold jewelry and coins
seized by German Nazis.
</P>
<P>
The Holocaust survivors also demanded 18 billion U.S. dollars
in compensations from the two biggest German banks.
</P>
<P>
The Deutsche Bank said in reaction to the lawsuit that the gold
received by the Deutsche Bank from Nazi Germany's central bank had
been delivered in the form of bullions so that its origin was not
known.
