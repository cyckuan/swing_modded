<HEADLINE> Officials Become Modern Farmers Because of Institutional Reform (3) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jiangxi's provincial governor, Shu Shengyou, said his province
is an agricultural province with little science and technology and
few social services. With its large amount of of barren hillsides
and uncultivated land, he added, it has great agricultural
potential.
</P>
<P>
They intend to adopt a series of preferential policies to
prompt more officials to go to rural areas where they can do
something really significant, he says.
</P>
<P>
Various media report that, in other provinces, the agricultural
sector has become a destination of government officials or workers
laid off by state-owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
According to some statistics, about 30 percent of China's 33
million hectares of barren hills have now been cultivated, and a
large number of the people involved are former officials and
workers from the cities.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1997, China's state-owned sector had laid off
about 11 million people and the number is expected to increase by
3.5 million this year.
</P>
<P>
Many people believe that it's a good idea to encourage
officials and unemployed workers, who are better-educated and more
open-minded than most farmers, to go to rural backward areas and
start operating farms in a more modern way.
</P>
<P>
This could help change the old ways where rural areas seriously
lacked skilled personnel with modern management techniques and
could be one way of guaranteeing the modernization of China's
agriculture, according to Zhu Mei'e, a professor of economics at
the Jiangxi Finance and Economics College.

<HEADLINE> Chinese National Conference on Film-Making </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANCHANG, March 30 (Xinhua) -- A national conference on
film-making, sponsored by China's Radio, Film and Television
Bureau, was held from March 28-30 in Nanchang, the capital of
Jiangxi Province,.
</P>
<P>
Ding Guan'gen, a member of the CPC Central Committee Political
Bureau, asked the film industry to work harder to welcome the 50th
anniversary of the People's Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
Ding, who is head of the CPC Central Committee Publicity
Department, said that more Chinese artists have adopted correct
thinking in their film making and there have been a number of best
selling films in the country.
</P>
<P>
China has achieved certain things in restructuring its film
industry, improving management, increasing investment, and
exploring the film market, Ding said, and in broadening the
recreation industry and challenging foreign best-selling films.
</P>
<P>
He said that an important CPC principle is respecting the rule
of art and the creative work of writers and artists, and the only
way out for the country's film industry is in carrying out the
reforms. This requires ideological emancipation, seeking truth
from facts, making active probes, and being bold in practise, he
said.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that more excellent films will be
produced next year, the fiftieth anniversary of the People's
Republic of China, to push the country's film industry to what he
called its "third peak of development".

<HEADLINE> Egypt to Launch NILESAT in April </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 30 (Xinhua) -- Egypt's first satellite, NILESAT,
will be launched into orbit on April 28 from South America, the
Middle East News Agency reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The satellite will be placed in a launching position on the
French rocket Ariane 4 on April 14 before final tests are carried
out on April 24 for launching, Information Minister Safwat Al
Sherif said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Egypt will be the first country in the area to launch its own
satellite, according to the information minister.
</P>
<P>
"From that moment, Egypt will enter the space age and becomes
the 60th member in the world space club," Sherif said in an
interview with the Egyptian news agency.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian satellite was transported on March 23 from the
place of its manufacture and assembly at Tolouse, southwest
France, to Guyana, after a trans-Atlantic nine-hour journey, by a
giant Russian-made Antinov plane.
</P>
<P>
According to press reports, NILESAT will combine 12 channels,
with each airing six programs simultaneously through digital
technology. Some channels will specialize in news coverage, women,
drama and music.
</P>
<P>
Ground facilities necessary for the operation of the NILESAT
have been completed at the October 6 City, in southern Cairo.
</P>
<P>
Egypt's first satellite is run by an Egyptian stock company to
which the Egyptian Radio and TV Union has a 40 percent stake, the
banking industry 15 percent, private enterprises 25 percent and
the public holding 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
The 158-million-dollar project is expected to rake in huge
profits to cover the costs in a span of four to five years.

<HEADLINE> 65 Taliban Prisoners Released by Opposition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, March 30 (Xinhua) -- Former Afghanistan's military
chief Ahmad Masood, one of the leaders of the anti-Taliban
alliance, released 65 Taliban prisoners Monday, a report by the
Associated Press of Pakistan said.
</P>
<P>
The release ceremony held in Panjsher Valley, about 120
kilometers north of Kabul, was attended by officials from the
International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), the report said,
adding that the ICRC will help transport the freed men to the
Taliban-controlled areas.
</P>
<P>
The release came a day after the Taliban leader, Mulla Mohammad
Omar, ordered his followers not to kill any opposition soldier
held by them, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that a total of 7,000 prisoners are held by the
Taliban and the anti-Taliban northern alliance, out of which about
1,200 are in custody of Masood, the report said.
</P>
<P>
About two months ago, the Taliban militia, who control two
thirds of Afghanistan including the capital of Kabul, released
around 200 prisoners after the northern alliance freed almost an
equal number of their prisoners in December, last year.
</P>
<P>
The anti-Taliban alliance, composed of forces led by
ethnic-Uzbek warlord Rashid Dostum, the Shiite Hezb-e-Wahdat and
Masood, has been battling the Taliban since the militia drove them
out from Kabul in September, 1996.

<P>
GUANGZHOU, March 30 (Xinhua) -- A ceremony was held today in
Guangzhou, the capital of China's Guangdong Province, to celebrate
the establishment of the Joint Conference on Guangdong-Hong Kong
Cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The group, which will meet twice yearly, held its first meeting
today.
</P>
<P>
Liao Hui, head of the State Council's Hong Kong and Macao
Affairs Office, spoke at the ceremony and conveyed Vice-Premier
Qian Qichen's congratulations on the occasion.
</P>
<P>
The idea for the conference was put forth by HKSAR Chief
Executive Tung Chee Hwa, who also spoke today and explained that
the group was established for Hong Kong's long-term development.
</P>
<P>
He said that Hong Kong should have a far-sighted approach and a
more positive attitude towards high-level links with its neighbor
to create a better investment and policy environment.
</P>
<P>
Guangdong's Governor Lu Ruihua, who also spoke, praised the
HKSAR for its remarkable success in social and economic stability
in spite of the current financial crisis in Asia.
</P>
<P>
The conference is expected to help Guangdong-Hong Kong
cooperation enter a new period, Lu said, and it means that
cooperation has gone from non-government activities, before Hong
Kong's return, to more government-backed efforts under the "one
Country, two Systems" policy.
</P>
<P>
Various government officials were also present at today's
ceremony. Li Changchun, a member of the CPC Central Committee's

<HEADLINE> Turkey Vows to Protect Turkish Cypriots </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, March 30 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Foreign Minister Ismail
Cem on Monday said that Turkey is determined to defend the rights
and freedom of Turkish Cypriots.
</P>
<P>
Cem made the announcement at a press conference held in the
northern part of the divided Nicosia, where he is on a visit to
the Turkish-Cypriots controlled part of Cyprus, according to a
press release issued by the Turkish Foreign Ministry.
</P>
<P>
"Any provocation or aggression directed against you
(Turkish-Cypriots) from the Aegean to the Mediterranean will be
treated as directed towards us," Cem said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the Greek military build-up and planned
deployment of Russian-made S-300 missiles pose a threat not only
to Turkish Cypriots but to Turkey itself as well.
</P>
<P>
Cem said that Turkey always attaches special importance to
the security of Turkish Cypriots, adding that no body should
have doubt on Turkey's determination to protect their brothers
on the island.
</P>
<P>
"Let this be known to all, whether friends or foes, and
let them watch their steps," the foreign minister said in a
tough tone.
</P>
<P>
As to the European Union (EU)'s invitation to Cyprus for
the EU enlargement process, Cem claimed that it constitutes not
only an open violation of international law but also a denial of
reality in Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
He warned that what the EU is doing will increase the
tensions between Greek and Turkish Cypriots and make the
situation in the eastern Mediterranean region more complicated.
</P>
<P>
"We once again call upon the EU to evaluate its future
steps very carefully before it is too late and before the
Greek Cypriot administration paves the way towards another war
in the island," he said.
</P>
<P>
The EU on Monday formally started its eastward enlargement
process by opening negotiations with the first wave of EU
membership candidates which also includes Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Turkey was greatly annoyed by the EU decision to invite
Cyprus to the process, saying that the Greek Cypriot-dominated
administration has no right to apply for the EU membership on
behalf of the whole island.
</P>
<P>
"We want you to stay independent. But remember that, if
pressure and oppression leave you with no other alternative, the
possibility of and the decision to integration with Turkey is
always yours," Cem said.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash also made statements on
different occasions that Turkish Cypriots will integrate with
Turkey if Cyprus is really be admitted into the European body.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into Greek-Cypriots dominated south
and the Turkish-Cypriots controlled north since 1974 when Turkish
troops intervened and took over the northern third of the
island in the wake of a pro-Athens coup in Nicosia.

<HEADLINE> U.S. New Home Sales Climb to Record High in February </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 30 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. nationwide new home
sales shot up to a record high in February, thanks to low mortgage
rates and unseasonably warm weather, the Commerce Department
reported here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Sales of new single-family homes surged 4.8 percent to a
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 893,000, as against the old
record of 880,000 set in March 1986, the department said.
</P>
<P>
The country's new home sales are off to an extraordinarily fast
start this year as they rose 5.2 percent in January following
hitting a 19-year high of 804,000 in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The National Association of Realtors reported last week that
existing home sales hit a record 4.75 million annual rate during
the month.
</P>
<P>
Analysts believed that some combined factors have helped the
robust market which include mild temperatures associated with the
El Nino current in the Pacific Ocean, mortgage rates hovering
around a four-year low of 7 percent and healthy growth pushing the
nation's unemployment rate to a 24-year low of 4.6 percent.

<HEADLINE> Iraq, Syria to Develop Medical, Health Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, March 30 (Xinhua) -- Ministers of Iraq and Syria had
talks here Monday on developing medical and health ties between
the two countries, the Iraqi News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The talks was held between Iraqi Health Minister Omed Medhat
Mubarak and Syrian Health Minister Iyad Shatti who arrived in
Baghdad on Sunday for a visit, first of its kind since the two
countries broke ties in 1980.
</P>
<P>
During their talks, Mubarak expressed the hope that the visit
of the Syrian delegation to participate in the Iraqi-Syrian
Medical Week which started Monday, would enhance bilateral
relations in medical and health fields.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Shatti expressed Syria's appreciation for the
Iraqi people in facing up to the hard conditions caused by the
U.N. embargo against Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, and reiterated
Syria's solidarity with Iraq for putting an end to the suffering
of the Iraqi people.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that we could always meet in service of our common
interests and those of Arab nations in all aspects," said Shatti.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, the Syrian delegation showed a list of
foodstuffs and medicine presented as a gift from the Syrian
people to Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Ties between Iraq and Syria were severed in 1980 when Syria
sided with Iran during the eight-year Iraq-Iran war (1980-88). The
relations have further worsened after Syrian troops joined in the
multinational allied forces in the 1991 Gulf War against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Iraq began to take measures to resume trade ties
with Syria by buying food and re-opening customs offices on the
border with Syria.
</P>
<P>
Syria opposed to the use of force against Iraq during the
Iraq-U.N. weapons inspection crisis, when the United States and
Britain threatened to launch military strikes against Iraq.

<HEADLINE> Japan is Jordan's First Aid Donor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, March 30 (Xinhua) -- Japan has given Jordan a total of
235.783 billion yen (about 1.816 billion U.S. dollars) in aid over
the past 20 years, making it the first aid donor for the kingdom.
</P>
<P>
According to Japanese Economic Counselor to Jordan, Mataya
Atanaka, Japan's aid made up 23 percent of the overall
international aid to Jordan over the two decades.
</P>
<P>
The aid took the forms of loans and grants. The total amount of
grants stood at 26.517 billion yen (about 204 million dollars)
from 1979 to 1996, said Atanaka.
</P>
<P>
The total amount of loans from 1974 to 1996, on the other hand,
was 209.266 billion yen (about 1.611 billion dollars). Most of the
loans had a maturity of 30 years, with a grace period of 10 years
and carried annual interest rates ranging from 1 to 3.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
The aid has helped to improve the country's water, irrigation,
environment, energy and communication projects.
</P>
<P>
"Japan thinks we are important to the peace of the region and
therefore to that of the world," Jordan's Deputy Prime Minister
for Services and Minister of Information Affairs Abdullah Ensour
said at a press conference Monday.
</P>
<P>
The kingdom "deserves it," he said, and it is exploring the
possibility of more Japanese loans and grants to finance the
construction of the King Hussein Bridge linking Jordan and the
West Bank, projects in the fields of regional development, water
and road, and its industrial sector.
</P>
<P>
The United States ranked second in terms of aid for Jordan,
followed by Germany and France. The U.S. provided Jordan 1.552
billion dollars in total from 1990 to 1997.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, March 30 (Xinhua) -- Saudi crown prince Monday
called on Hamas spiritual leader Sheikh Ahmad Yassin who is
receiving treatment in Saudi Arabia to show "constant support to
the Palestinian people," reports reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
When visiting Yassin in King Fahd Hospital in Saudi Red Sea
coastal city of Jeddah, Crown Prince and Deputy Prime Minister
Abdullah Ibn Abdul-Aziz "inquired about the health of Sheikh
Yassin and the health care he is receiving," the reports said.
</P>
<P>
The official Saudi Press Agency said the visit came to express
"constant support to the Palestinian people and the Palestinian
cause by the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and its leaders in all Arab,
Islamic and international fora."
</P>
<P>
Sheikh Yassin, who suffered from ear problems, arrived in
Jeddah on March 4 after spending more than two weeks in Cairo for
treatment.
</P>
<P>
Yassin was released from the Israeli jail in last October. His
release was seen as a move to appease Jordan after Israel's
botched assassination of Hamas (Islamic Resistance Movement) Amman
office leader Khalid Mashaal in Jordan and win freedom of the two
Israeli secret agents who performed the attempt and later were
arrested.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia has constantly called on Israel to abide by the
U.N. Security Council resolutions concerning the Middle East peace
process and expressed its firm support to the Palestinian
people's cause.

Mubarak held talks with the U.S. envoy on ways of breaking
deadlock in the Mideast peace process in the Red Sea resort of
Sharm el-Sheikh on Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
"If matters do not move forward, then they will move backward,
and this is what these leaders should know," he added, saying that
the U.S. concern for the peace deadlock reflects the truth.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said Friday to
American Jewish leaders that the process was not moving forward
and that the region could face danger by 1999 if Israel did not
withdraw from the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Ross briefed Mubarak on the outcome of his talks with the
Palestinian and Israeli leaders on the new U.S. plan to reactivate
the deadlocked peace process, Moussa told reporters.
</P>
<P>
But Moussa added he could not say whether the talks Ross held
with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian
National Authority President Yasser Arafat had reached a specific
result.
</P>
<P>
The talks, however, remain ongoing, said Moussa.
</P>
<P>
"Arafat is expected in Egypt, and therefore we consider the
talks ongoing. One can not say that there is anything new so far,
but, certainly there is some kind of activity that can lead to the
progress we hope for," he added.
</P>
<P>
Ross told Mubarak that he would meet Netanyahu later in the
day, and "this is when the Palestinian and Israeli stances, remarks
and actual readiness to honor the commitments will become clear,"
Moussa said.
</P>
<P>
Since last Thursday, Ross has been shuttling between Arafat and
Netanyahu in a bid to win their acceptance of a U.S. plan calling
on Israel to withdraw from 13.1 percent of the West Bank over 12
weeks, linked to Palestinian crackdown on terrorism.
</P>
<P>
But the Palestinians and Israel are cool to the plan. Israel
has said the withdrawal scope is unacceptable and that it would
pull out from no more than 9 percent of the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians insist that Israel carry out three significant
pullbacks by summer this year under U.S.-brokered agreements
signed last year between the two sides.

<HEADLINE> Egypt to Launch NILESAT in April </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 30 (Xinhua) -- Egypt's first satellite, NILESAT,
will be launched into orbit on April 28 from South America, the
Middle East News Agency reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The satellite will be placed in a launching position on the
French rocket Ariane 4 on April 14 before final tests are carried
out on April 24 for launching, Information Minister Safwat Al
Sherif said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Egypt will be the first country in the area to launch its own
satellite, according to the information minister.
</P>
<P>
"From that moment, Egypt will enter the space age and becomes
the 60th member in the world space club," Sherif said in an
interview with the Egyptian news agency.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian satellite was transported on March 23 from the
place of its manufacture and assembly at Tolouse, southwest
France, to Guyana, after a trans-Atlantic nine-hour journey, by a
giant Russian-made Antinov plane.
</P>
<P>
According to press reports, NILESAT will combine 12 channels,
with each airing six programs simultaneously through digital
technology. Some channels will specialize in news coverage, women,
drama and music.
</P>
<P>
Ground facilities necessary for the operation of the NILESAT
have been completed at the October 6 City, in southern Cairo.
</P>
<P>
Egypt's first satellite is run by an Egyptian stock company to
which the Egyptian Radio and TV Union has a 40 percent stake, the
banking industry 15 percent, private enterprises 25 percent and
the public holding 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
The 158-million-dollar project is expected to rake in huge
profits to cover the costs in a span of four to five years.

<HEADLINE> Hamas Car Bomb Causes Ramallah Explosion: TV </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 30 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian officials have
determined that the huge explosion Sunday night in West Bank city
Ramallah was caused by a car bomb perpetrated by Hamas, Israeli
state television reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The conclusion came after Palestinian security forces conducted
initial probe into the blast that ripped through a section of a
building in the industrial zone of Ramallah, killing two
supposedly Hamas members.
</P>
<P>
It was believed that the car bomb exploded accidentally when
two Hamas bombers was heading for Israel to launch a terror
attack. The driver was killed immediately in the huge blast and
the other died of wounds late in hospital. The car they were
driving was reduced to a twisted metal wreckage.
</P>
<P>
The TV report added that the order to carry out the attack was
issued by Hamas leaders in Jordanian capital Amman. There was
limited cooperation between Israeli and Palestinian security
officials in investigating the bombing, Israeli Television Channel
I reported.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian National Authority (PNA) was apparently
embarassed by the incident at a time when the United States peace
envoy Dennis Ross tried to broker a deal on Israeli further
redeployment in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Israel is rejecting a redeployment more than 9 percent in West
Bank, and insisting that a connection must be made between the
implementation of pullout sand the PNA's actions to fight
terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Hamas, or Islamic Resistance Movement, has refrained from
launching terror attacks against Israel since last October when
Israel released its spiritual leader Sheikh Ahmed Yassin from
prison.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian security forces have recently raided and uncovered
seven Hamas bomb factories in Gaza Strip and confiscated a large
quantity of grenades, rockets and explosives.

<HEADLINE> Romanian Premier Resigns Under Coalition Pressure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, March 30 (Xinhua) -- Romania's prime minister Victor
Ciorbea resigned Monday under increasing pressure from coalition
partners on charges of incompetence.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister had already announced his resignation to his
ministers, said private television ProTV broadcasting live from
the government's headquarters.
</P>
<P>
Ciorbea would announce his resignation in a television address
to the nation. President Emil Constantinescu was expected to
accept the resignation in a separate television appearance.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister, whose critics have accused him of
incompetence and laxity, has been in trouble since not only his
coalition partners but a dissident group within his own dominating
Christian Democrats called for his departure.
</P>
<P>
Ciorbea, close to President Constantinescu, has always insisted
he was ready to resign but that the political line of his own
Christian Democrats prevented him from doing so.
</P>
<P>
Ciorbea was elected mayor of the capital, Bucharest, in 1996,
before taking over as premier in November of the same year.

</P>
<P>
Clintons's special assistant, Joseph Wilson, who is

He said that the U.S. government urged the Angolan government
and the former rebel National Union for the Total Independence of
Angola (UNITA) to continue their efforts for the final peace in
the country, and open wider prospect for U.S.-Angola relations.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Welcomes U.N. Position on Cyprus Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, March 30 (Xinhua) -- The Cyprus government welcomed
the U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan's position that talks for a
peaceful settlement in Cyprus should be achieved within the
framework of bi-communal negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Government spokesman Christos Stylianides told a news briefing
that a statement by Annan's spokesman Saturday contained many
positive points especially "the reaffirmation that the basis on
which bi-communal talks are conducted will not change."
</P>
<P>
He was reacting to Fred Eckhard's proclamation that "talks
between the two leaders are the only framework within which the
two communities in Cyprus are treated on the basis of full
equality."
</P>
<P>
The statement came after Annan met with Turkish Cypriot leader
Raud Denktash in Geneva on Saturday. During the meeting Denktash
reportedly insisted that future talks for an overall settlement in
Cyprus should be conducted on state-to-state basis, not on
bicommunal basis, as has been the case for years.
</P>
<P>
Eckhard said Annan voiced disappointment over the impasse in
solving the Cyprus problem and urged Denktash to resume talks with
President Glafcos Clerides.
</P>
<P>
Two rounds of talks between the island's Greek and Turkish
communities were conducted under the auspices of Annan's peace
envoy, but were stalled last summer after the European Union was
prepared to start accession talks with the Cyprus government on
March 30, 1998.
</P>
<P>
Denktash upped his ante, refusing to resume peace talks unless
his Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus is internationally
recognized. The breakaway state is now recognized only by Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Stylianides told reporters that the Cyprus government hoped the
international community, the European Union and the United States
will engage with more vigor, conviction and pressure to lead
things to an intercommunal dialog for a correct procedure for a
resolution of the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided since 1974 when Turkey landed its
troops and took over 37 percent of the island following a
short-lived pro-Athens coup in Nicosia.

democracy, and the efforts to development market economies."
</P>
<P>
Wolde Abajifar described the micro-financing as a new venture.
</P>
<P>
He said, "The fact that licro-financial institutions cater to
the needs of low income groups which constitute the vact majority
of the population in our sub-region, and also the fact that
nearly half of these are women who shoulder most of the burden in
maintaining family and society would mean that the efforts of
women's world banking is bound to succeed."
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening ceremony, UNDP representative to
Ethiopia Henrik Obesen stressed the importance to provide finance
services to the poor people in Africa.
</P>
<P>
According to Obesen, more than 50 percent of the African
population lives in poverty with no or very limited access to
basic social and economic services.
</P>
<P>
Millions of poor people in Africa are self-employed, engaged
in small trading or retailing activities or micro-enterprise in
urban areas.
</P>
<P>
In rural areas, many famlies combine very small
micro-enterprise activity with farming and largely depend on it
for family income. The majority of these micro-entrepreneurs have
no access to formal financial services.
</P>
<P>
He said that providing financial services to the poor is
possible indeed with imagination and determinations even at a
very large scale. Women's world banking and UNDP are trying to
bring these successful experiences from all over the world to
African institutions through this initiative of regional
networking of practitioners to build african microfinance
institutions, he added.
</P>
<P>
According to an inventory carried out by women's world banking
and the UNDP in 17 African countries, nearly 80 percent of them
mobilize savings and provide micro-loans which is much higher
than among most Latin American or Asian micro-finance
institutions over 50 percent of the clients are women.
</P>
<P>
These institutions are reaching the rural and urban poor and
the average loan size is under 300 U.S. Dollars and more than 50
percent of these institutions have a repayment rate of 90 percent
or more.
</P>
<P>
Women's world banking was conceived during the first UN World
Conference on Women held in Mexico City in 1975.
</P>
<P>
Today, it is the only women-led global network that aims to
open the world's financial system to low income women. It has 43
affiliates in 35 countries in the world, including 12 African
countries.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Satisfied With Start of EU Accession Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, March 30 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus has expressed
satisfaction with the start of the Cyprus-European Union (EU)
accession talks which was launched in Brussels, Belgium, Monday.
</P>
<P>
Describing the talks as "historic," Cypriot President Glafcos
Clerides said that he expects an unhindered accession course will
proceed and that any existing problems will be solved prior to
Cyprus' EU membership.
</P>
<P>
He said he regrets at the Turkish Cypriots' refusal to
participate in Cyprus' negotiating team. "Unfortunately, there has
been a negative stance by Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash and
Ankara, both for their participation in EU accession talks and
the resumption of talks for a Cyprus solution," Clerides said.
</P>
<P>
He noted "we don't want them to feel there is hostility between
us, because the fact is that such a thing is non-existent."
</P>
<P>
Clerides said the Greek Cypriot side expects that a Cyprus
settlement will be reached that would allow cooperation of the two
communities for the island's entry into the EU.
</P>
<P>
The accession process for Cyprus and five other countries was
launched in Brussels in the presence of the foreign ministers of
the 15 EU member states and the 11 applicant countries.
</P>
<P>
The EU will hold on Tuesday inter-governmental conferences with
the favored six, namely, Cyprus, Poland, the Czech Republic,
Hungary, Slovenia and Estonia.
</P>
<P>
A proposal by Clerides for the participation of Turkish
Cypriots in Cyprus' negotiating team was turned down by Denktash.
</P>
<P>
Denktash has threatened not to attend future U.N.-led peace
talks on Cyprus and to integrate to Turkey his breakaway state in
northern Cyprus if the EU goes ahead with accession talks with
Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided into Greek-Cypriots dominated south
and Turkish Cypriots-controlled north since 1974 when Turkish
troops invaded and took over the northern third of the island
following a failed pro-Athens coup in Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriots unilaterally declared a breakaway Turkish
Republic of Northern Cyprus in 1983, which was only recognized by
Turkey.

UNITED NATIONS, March 30 (Xinhua) -- Governments have decided
to meet again in Montreal in June to start talks on a second
treaty to minimize release of persistent organic pollutants
(POPs), a release from the United Nations Environment Programme
(UNEP) said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The treaty will focus on the release and emission of POPs,
which include some of the most toxic chemicals ever developed,
such as adrin, chlordane, DDT, dieldrin, dioxin, furans,
heptachlor, hexachlorobenzene, mirex, polychlorinated bipheny1
and toxaphene.
</P>
<P>
UNEP said that the negotiations, which will be held under its
auspices, are to be completed in the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
UNEP said that the decision to hold the Montreal negotiations
came just days after the governments had finalized the text of
the Convention on the Prior Informed Consent Procedure for
Certain Hazardous and Pesticides in International Trade, known
as the "PIC Convention".
</P>
<P>
UNEP said the treaty will apply to approximately 27 chemicals,
and in the future, potentially hundreds may be covered.

<HEADLINE> French Rightwing Regional Leaders Defy Protests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, March 30 (Xinhua) -- Two French rightwing regional
leaders who allied with the far-right National Front (FN)
continued to defy protests on Monday, ruling out any possibility
that they will resign from the presidency of regional councils won
with FN votes.
</P>
<P>
The regional president of the industrial base of Rhone-Alpes
Charles Millon, who was re-elected with 35 votes from the FN, said
that he is the executive of the region, no matter people like it
or not.
</P>
<P>
Millon, who is defense minister under the former conservative
government, has failed to select vice-presidents of the regional
council because of boycott by leftwing and other rightwing
deputies.
</P>
<P>
From 150,000 to 180,000 people demonstrated in a dozen major
cities in France to protest the alliance between the rightwing
politicians and FN.
</P>
<P>
The president of French Catalonia Jacques Blanc, who was also
elected with FN votes, Monday rejected the protests and said he
has begun working "in service of this region which I love."
</P>
<P>
"The republic, it is not in the streets or in great
declarations. It is the decision of the polling boxes," he said in
Montpellier, capital of French Catalonia, where 10,000 people
protested his alliance with FN on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The other three regional presidents elected with FN votes have
resigned.

<HEADLINE> Ranariddh's Return Is a Step Forward: Annan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 30 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan hoped that the return to homeland of Cambodian Prince
Norodom Ranariddh will assist in the holding of free and fair
elections in the country.
</P>
<P>
"The Secretary-General welcomes the return of Prince Norodom
Ranariddh on March 30 after an absence of nearly nine months,"
Annan said in a statement issued here by his spokesman on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The event is a result of efforts led by the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and supported by the United
Nations to help Cambodia find a satisfactory solution to its
political crisis, Annan said.
</P>
<P>
While Ranariddh's return "is a significant step forward, much
work still remains to be done to ensure that the elections fully
do justice both to the terms of the Paris Agreement and to the
gains of Cambodia during UN Transitional Authority in Cambodia
(UNTAC) and since," Annan added.
</P>
<P>
UNTAC was formed in 1992 with a mandate to implement the Paris
Agreement signed on October 23, 1991, to end Cambodian conflicts
through a comprehensive political solution.
</P>
<P>
Ranariddh won a 1993 election and agreed to a power-sharing
coalition with Second Prime Minister Hun Sen.
</P>
<P>
The Prince was overthrown by Hun Sen last July when he
travelled abroad. He returned under a peace plan aimed at ensuring
that he take part in the elections due in July.

<HEADLINE> France to Investigate Rwanda Policy Under Mitterrand Era </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, March 30 (Xinhua) -- Faced with charges that it played a
negative role before and during the 1994 genocide in Rwanda,
France has decided to investigate its policy toward the African
state under former President Francois Mitterrand.
</P>
<P>
Following a much publicized visit by U.S. President Bill
Clinton to Rwanda on March 25, the role France once played in that
tiny central African state is being more and more debated by the
local media.
</P>
<P>
The local dailies of Le Monde and Le Figaro are publishing
investigative reports on the 1994 genocide, in which about one
million Tutsis were killed by Hutus.
</P>
<P>
The Socialist government under Prime Minister Lionel Jospin
decided last week to cooperate with a parliament commission,
headed by Socialist deputy Paul Quiles, which is specialized in
investigating the policy of France toward Rwanda during the
Mitterrand era.
</P>
<P>
The commission, established after two French college scholars
accused the former government of supporting the Hutus, will have a
second hearing on Tuesday on the possible French implication in
the Hutu conspiracy in the killings.
</P>
<P>
But the French authorities are divided over how much power
should be given to the Quiles commission.
</P>
<P>
The Communist parliamentary group,supported by the Greens, has
proposed giving the commission some legal power, while the more
conservative parties prefer restricting the commission to "a
mission of information."
</P>
<P>
The revelations to come out could oblige some French officials
serving under the former government to testify at the
International Tribunal in Arusha, Tanzania, established by the
United Nations to punish those who committed the genocide.
</P>
<P>
The French National Assembly will vote soon on the Communist
proposal.
</P>
<P>
Four years after the genocide, some key questions about the
French role in Rwanda remain unclear.
</P>
<P>
Who shot down the French military helicopter which carried
Rwanda President Juvenal Habyarimana and Burundian President
Cyprien Ntaryamira on April 6, 1994, still remains a mystery.
</P>
<P>
The death of President Habyarimana triggered the massacres in
Rwanda.

BEIRUT, March 30 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Iranian Foreign Minister
Kamal Kharrazi on Monday denied his country is studying a United
States proposal to base an American government official in Tehran.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a news conference after talks with his Lebanese
counterpart Farez Boueiz, Kharrazi said Iran did not receive any
offer of this kind and the U.S. did not make any change in its
hostile policy against Iran.
</P>
<P>
His words contradicted a Sunday report that the two arch rivals
are moving toward each other by making tentative overtures to
improve ties after a lapse of nearly two decades.
</P>
<P>
Iran's Culture and Islamic Guidance Minister Ataollah
Mohajerani was quoted as saying Sunday that "a proposal has been
sent to the Iranian government in written form regarding the
setting up of an American office at the Swiss embassy (in Tehran),
which is being examined now."
</P>
<P>
The New York Times also reported that the U.S. has offered to
appoint an official from the U.S. Information Agency to be
stationed at the Swiss embassy, which has been taking care of
American interests in Iran.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi said that as long as the U.S. does not change its
hostile policy, Iran will not "waste time with it".
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Iran broke off diplomatic ties after Iran's
radical students stormed the U.S. embassy in Tehran in 1979,
taking American diplomats hostage for 444 days.

Addressing a human rights conference here in which governors

concerning human rights, but several people and international
institutions always talk about the bad things in Turkey."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Turkey's Interior Minister Murat Baseskioglu also
denied there exists a human rights problems in the country. "Other
countries claim that Turkey is faced with the problem of human
rights, this is not true," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Terrorism is also an international problem, which Turkey
faces. Turkey does not give any concessions from human rights
while struggling with terrorism," he added.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that "there are several elements which threaten
our state and constitutional order, such as terrorism and
fundamentalism."
</P>
<P>
"The security forces also have to struggle with fundamentalism,
but we are well aware of the fact that we have to act within the
framework of the principles of a democratic society and a legal
state as they are foreseen in the Constitution," Baseskioglu added.

BONN, March 30 (Xinhua) -- Gerhard Schroeder, candidate of
Germany's main opposition Social Democrats (SPD) for chancellor in
the country's September general elections, was Monday formally
reelected for a third term as premier of Lower Saxony state.

Schroeder, 53, has been leading the 67-year-old Kohl in opinion
polls for months.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 30 (Xinhua) -- Egypt, Syria and Saudi Arabia are
to hold a high-level meeting within a few hours in Saudi capital
Riyadh to examine the outcome of intensive efforts to restart the
stalled Mideast peace process.
</P>
<P>
Egypt' Middle East News Agency Monday quoted informed sources
as saying that the gathering will focus on possible contacts and
proposals to help keep the momentum of American mediation in the
peace process.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa and his Syrian counterpart
Farouq al-Sharaa reportedly have arrived in Riyadh Monday evening
for the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian-Israeli peace talks have been stalled since the
Israeli government began construction of a new Jewish settlement
in Arab East Jerusalem in March 1997. The two sides are also
wrangling over the scope and schedule of an overdue Israeli
pullback from the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
U.S. peace envoy Dennis Ross is currently on a Middle East
mission in an attempt to dissuade the Palestinians and Israelis
from their bottom lines on the long-delayed West Bank redeployment.
</P>
<P>
Washington wants Israel to withdraw from 13.1 percent of the
West Bank in exchange for Palestinian security cooperation as part
of a package deal to end a year-long Mideast peace stalemate. But
Israel so far refused to accept the U.S. proposal.

<HEADLINE> Over 20 Palestinians Injured in Clashes in West </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 30 (Xinhua) -- Clashes erupted on Monday
between Palestinians and the Israeli troops in the West Bank and
over 20 palestinians were injured, according to the Jerusalem
Media and Communication Center (JMCC).
</P>
<P>
The clashes occurred while the Palestinians held demonstrations
and strikes in different cities and towns and villages in the West
Bank and Gaza Strip to mark the 22nd anniversary of the Land Day
to protest the land confiscation policy of the Israeli government.
</P>
<P>
In Bethlehem, a large number of Palestinians clashed with
Israeli troops near the Rachel's Tomb in the city and the Israeli
troops fired tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse the
protesters. During the clashes, 20 Palestinian students were hit
by rubber bullets, JMCC said.
</P>
<P>
Three Palestinian youths were reportedly injured by rubber
bullets fired by Israeli troops during clashes which erupted at
the Maloufuyeh check-point near Ramallah Monday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Six Israeli Arabs lost their lives on March 30, 1967, in
northern Galilee, in clashes with Israel soldiers over a land
dispute erupted following the confiscation by then Israeli
government of land owned by Arab villagers in Galilee. Both
Israeli Arabs and Palestinians mark the incident each year to
protest against the land policy of the Israeli government.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian National Council has called on all
Palestinians, inside Palestine and elsewhere to mark the
anniversary on Monday with popular and mass demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
Israeli police and defense forces are on high alert on Monday
on both sides of the 1967 ceasefire line, the Green Line, as
Israeli Arabs plan a series of strikes, marches and demonstrations
to mark the occasion.
</P>
<P>
In Israel, thousands of the Israeli Arabs held protest
marches and demonstrations in Galilee and Negeve areas. The
residents of unrecognized Arab villages, whose lands are
threatened with confiscation, also spent the day of planting
olive trees to mark the Land Day anniversary.

KUWAIT CITY, March 30 (Xinhua) -- Foreign ministers of Egypt
and Syria arrived in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, Monday on an
unannounced three-day visit to meet with their Saudi counterpart
on efforts to push ahead the stalled Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Egypt's Amr Moussa and Syria's Farouq Al-Sharaa will hold talks
with Saudi Prince Saud Al-Faisal during their stay in Riyadh. The
talks are "part of a joint Arab drive to counter the anti-peace
policies" of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the Kuwait
News Agency (Kuna) said.
</P>
<P>
Israeli hardline policies on the peace process have sparked
wide-spread criticism from Arab countries and the international
community.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian-Israeli talks have been deadlocked for a year
over Israel's construction of a Jewish neighborhood in Arab East
Jerusalem in March last year.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, Syria and Saudi Arabia, the three heavy weights in the
Arab world, have urged the Israeli government to reverse its
current hardline policy and abide by the agreements it signed with
the Palestinians in order to rescue the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic sources in Riyadh was quoted by Kuna as saying that
the Egyptian capital Cairo would host a mini-Arab summit in May to
coordinate positions on the latest developments in peace-making.
</P>
<P>
But both Moussa and Al-Sharaa declined to speak to reporters
about their mission in Riyadh upon their arrival, Kuna said.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 30 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Middle East peace envoy
Dennis Ross made no breakthrough at his final meeting on Monday
with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in advancing the
Israeli-Palestinian peace process.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio quoted a senior political source as saying that
after four rounds of talks with Netanyahu, Ross still does not
know the exact scope of the territory Israel is willing to hand
over to the Palestinians in its next troop pullback from the West
Bank.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai, who just ended his
visit to the United States, also attended the meeting.
</P>
<P>
But Infrastructure Minister Ariel Sharon refused to meet Ross
in protest against the American peace initiative, which calls on
Israel to hand over 13.1 percent of the West Bank in the second
redeployment.
</P>
<P>
Sharon, the leading hawk in Netanyahu's government, has
insisted that a redeployment of more than 9 percent will damage
the national security interest of Israel.
</P>
<P>
After his meeting with Uruguay's President Julio Maria on
Monday, Netanyahu denied that any agreement has been made between
Israel and the U.S. on the extent of next withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu also reiterated that Israel should determine its
security needs by itself. But he indicated he did not want
confrontation with the U.S. administration, which he called as
Israel's "old friend."
</P>
<P>
Ross, who arrived in the region last Thursday in an attempt to
break the deadlock in the Israeli-Palestinian peace talks, also
has held three meetings with Palestinian National Authority
President Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
The peace envoy has said that he is going to report the
development to U.S. President Bill Clinton and Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright, who will decide the next move to push forward
the peace process.

<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, March 30 (Xinhua) -- There could be no development
without economic reforms, Yugoslav Deputy Prime Minister Banko
Junic said in the northern Greek port city of Thessaloniki Monday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a business forum called "Greece and the Balkans: the
Emerging Market of Southeast Europe," Junic stressed that without
economic reforms, there could be no development, and without
development, the conditions for real democracy, freedom of
expression and all the other factors considered the primary
characteristics of contemporary democracies could not exist.
</P>
<P>
Without the cooperation of Yugoslavia, he added, cooperation in
the Balkans in any sector could not succeed.
</P>
<P>
Junic criticized the economic sanctions imposed by the
international community on Yugoslavia, saying that the sanctions
had cost the country's economy some 100 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Direct economic damage from the embargo amounted to 6 billion
dollars over the past six years, he said, adding that the amount
will increase dramatically in the coming years.
</P>
<P>
He said that the sanctions also had repercussions upon the
sectors of education, health and social stability.
</P>
<P>
Attending the forum were government officials, entrepreneurs
and business representatives from the Balkan countries.

<HEADLINE> US, Romania Sign Pact on Weapons of Mass Destruction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 30 (Xinhua) -- The United States signed a
pact on Monday with Romania, agreeing to provide Romanian border
guards with equipment, training and other services to help
interdict any smuggling of weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was signed by U.S. Defense Secretary William
Cohen and Romanian Defense Minister Constantin Ionescu at the
Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
Under the accord, the U.S. will provide Romania with items that
range from binoculars to equipment to detect potential transfers
of chemical, biological or even nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
Cohen said that the spread of deadly chemical and biological or
nuclear weapons pose a serious threat to the United States and to
all peace-loving countries.
</P>
<P>
"Romania and the United States realize that we have to do all
that we can to prevent terrorists or rogue nations from acquiring
and using such weapons, and this agreement is going to make us
partners in that campaign," he added.
</P>
<P>
Cohen thanked Romania for its support in the United Nations,
where Washington sought Iraqi compliance with U.N. inspection
requirements on weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
On Romania's potential membership of the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization (NATO), Cohen said the nation "remains a
strong candidate" if the country continues its reforms.
</P>
<P>
However, he stressed, "No one can predict at this point when
there will be a future decision made on future countries coming
in."
</P>
<P>
Ionescu said, "For Romania, the NATO membership is a strategic
goal, and we'll fight for membership. I believe that in the
moment there will be some decision to be made, we'll be invited to
join NATO."
</P>
<P>
The defense minister stressed that " the strategic partnership
with the United States, which is for Romania a very important
partnership."
</P>
<P>
Ionescu hailed the agreement as "a step forward" in bilateral
cooperation between his country and the United States.
</P>
<P>
When NATO leaders decided last July to accept new members,
France and Italy insisted Romania should also be accepted together
with Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic. But Washington
opposed it and Romania's bid failed.

<HEADLINE> Missiles That Downed Rwandan President Come from France: Figaro </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, March 31 (Xinhua) -- The two Soviet-made missiles which
shot down a French military helicopter carrying Rwandan President
Juvemnal Habyarimana and Burundian President Cyprien Ntayamira in
1994 were from France, said the influential French daily Le
Figalo.  .
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro made the revelation on Tuesday by quoting two French
officers who spoke on condition of anonymity, and a pamphlet
written by Filip Reyntjens, a professor of the University of
Antwerp in Belgium who is specialized in African affairs and the
Great Lakes region.
</P>
<P>
In his 1996 pamphlet, "Rwanda: Three Dates Which Rocked
History," published by L'Harmattan publishing house, Reyntjens
said that the two SAM 16 Gimlet missiles that shot down the Falcon
50 helicopter "could be part of the pack sold in 1988 to Iraq" by
the then Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
"In the wake of the Gulf War, these missiles could have been
seized by the French contingent in the multinational force and
brought to France," said Reyntjens.
</P>
<P>
But he said that he has "never been in a position to verify
these crucial reports."
</P>
<P>
However, the speculations by Reyntjens were half-confirmed by
two unidentified French officers interviewed by Le Figaro.
</P>
<P>
"Within the framework of my duties in Rwanda, I can testify
that France actually retrieved these missiles during the conflict
with Iraq," said one of the officers, who did not say whether the
missiles were later used in Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
Another officer said he knew that "there was an order
formulated between November 1993 and February 1994 asking for the
provision of two ground-to-air missiles."
</P>
<P>
He said he learned about the order from a French businessman
who died in 1997, and that the order "seemed to come from someone
close with former Captain (Paul) Barril," a former security
officer of the Elysee Presidential Palace in the era of President
Francois Mitterrand.
</P>
<P>
Barril was in charge of an anti-terrorist cell group for the
presidential security. After his retirement, he runs a security
business.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the French Defense Ministry has rejected a request
by Le Figaro to interview Commander de Saint-Quentin, a French
army officer who inspected the scene of the crash of Falcon 50 in
Rwanda the next day after it was shot down on April 6, 1994.
</P>
<P>
The death of President Habyarimana immediately triggered the
massacres in Rwanda.

<HEADLINE> United Nations Seeks for Humanitarian Aid to Somalia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, March 31 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations launched an
appeal here on Tuesday for 79 million U.S. dollars to ensure the
continuation of urgently-needed humanitarian and rehabilitation
assistance for Somalia throughout 1998.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the appeal is a separate request for 15.3
million dollars to meet the most pressing needs through June,
1998, in the wake of the massive floods in the country, according
to the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.
</P>
<P>
Nearly the entire Somali population lacks access to education
and basic health services, the UN office said. Repeated outbreaks
of cholera, malaria, and one of the world's highest incidences of
tuberculosis have drastically lowered life expectancy.
</P>
<P>
The short-term objectives outlined in the 1998 Consolidated
Inter-Agency Appeal are:
</P>
<P>
-- To prevent a recurrence of widespread humanitarian
emergencies, including through the development of effective
monitoring and response capacities for humanitarian emergencies,
</P>
<P>
-- To strengthen rehabilitation and governance efforts which
represent the most minimal and essential needs required for
Somalia to exit the current state of crisis,
</P>
<P>
-- And to create a socio-economic environment conducive to the
return of refugees and the internally displaced by working with
local communities and administrative structures.
</P>
<P>
Activities include ensuring the provision of essential health
services through the supply of drugs and pharmaceuticals, training
of health personnel, ensuring access to safe drinking water,
preventing communicable diseases, and rehabilitating schools.
</P>
<P>
The UN office requested the international community to respond
generously to both appeals, to relieve the protracted suffering of
the Somali people and to provide a basis for the longer-term

<HEADLINE> New Strategic Road Project Takes Shape in HK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 31 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Highways
Department Tuesday awarded consultancy assignments to a company
for the investigation and preliminary design of a new road project
called Route 10.
</P>
<P>
The proposed 17.5 KM-long route will stretch from north Lantau
to Yuen Long in "New Territories."
</P>
<P>
Works on the route are scheduled to commence in 2002 and will
be completed in 2007. The estimated cost for the project is around
22 billion HK dollars (2.82 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The Mott Connell Limited will be responsible for examining the
engineering and environmental feasibility of the route.
</P>
<P>
The consultancy, at a lump sum fee of 89 million HK dollars
(11.41 million U.S. dollars), will help determine a single route
alignment as well as the preferred structural forms together with
their preliminary designs.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference here Tuesday, Director of
Highways Leung Kwok-sun said this section of Route 10, together
with Deep Bay Link, Route 10 - Hong Kong Lantau Link and Route 7
(Belcher Bay to Aberdeen), would form part of the strategic
Western Highway between Hong Kong and Shekou in Shenzhen.

<HEADLINE> China's Tian'anmen Rostrum Getting Better Maintenance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 31 (Xinhua) -- The rostrum at Beijing's
Tian'anmen Square, which has been the site of many momentous
events over the past half century, is going to be given better
maintenance as part of the preparations for the People's
Republic's 50th anniversary celebrations.
</P>
<P>
No major repairs are needed, since the ancient building is
still in good condition and there has been routine maintenance
about once a year on the old brick-wood structure, according to
Lin Bingkui, of the Beijing government's Tian'anmen Area
administrative board.
</P>
<P>
For many Chinese, the rostrum is more than just an old building
left over from the imperial age. It's the site where the late
Chairman Mao Zedong announced the birth of the People's Republic
on October 1, 1949, and a place where important leaders mingled
with the ordinary people.
</P>
<P>
It was made a cultural relic with state protection in 1961,
and, since 1988, when it was opened up to tourists for the first
time, more than 15 million people have visited it.
</P>
<P>
Recently, a group of cultural relics and building specialists
were invited to have a closer look at the building to prepare for
the coming anniversary. They came to the conclusion that the
rostrum had been well preserved, nevertheless that there were
certain problems. Moisture, the decay of some wooden structures,
the old wiring, and the age of the power equipment all meant that
maintenance needed some attention.
</P>
<P>
The 34.7 meter-tall rostrum was first built in 1417, or the
15th year under the rein of Emperor Yong Le during the Ming
Dynasty (1368-1644), and bore the name Chengtianmen. It was
destroyed twice by fire, and the present building was built in
1651, at which time the name was changed, Lin said. It then became
a sacred place where emperors held ceremonial events for issuing
imperial edicts.
</P>
<P>
For the past several decades, there has been only one major
repair job, Lin recalled, and that was in 1970. During that
refurbishing, the pattern of tiles was changed, with dragons being
replaced by sunflowers, but the main structure of the building was
maintained and reinforced, he said.

KUNMING, March 31 (Xinhua) -- The Red Cross Society of the Hong
Kong Special Administrative Region and Yunnan Province signed an
agreement here today for helping Yunnan set up a disaster-relief
network.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong side will provide 5.29 million yuan for the work, all
of it coming from local donations, according to official sources.
</P>
<P>
Disaster-relief centers will be set up in 13 administrative
areas in Yunnan, which will function as storage, training,
information, and medical centers designed to ensure timely and
efficient rescue work in the case of various types of disasters.
</P>
<P>
Yunnan's Vice-Governor Liang Gongqin, who spoke at the signing
ceremony, placed emphasis on the need for these relief centers
because the many calamities in the province last year caused more
than 10 billion yuan in losses.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong has been a major source of donations for Yunnan when
it has suffered from calamities.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, March 31 (Xinhua) -- China's Hebei Province
joined the nationwide spindle smashing campaign today by
destroying 41,000 outdated cotton spindles at local textile mills.
</P>
<P>
So far, 781,000 spindles have been destroyed in various parts
of China. The central government strategy is intended to shrink
the size of the inefficient, giant textile industry and is part of
the first efforts to restructure the state enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Hebei is one of the coastal provinces and municipalities that
have led the smashing drive and plans to get rid of 710,000 cotton
spindles and lay off 48,000 workers from its textile mills in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The province is the fifth largest textile base in China. In the
1950s and '60s, it had more than 20 large state-owned textile
factories.

ABU DHABI, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese President Elias Hrawi
arrived here Tuesday afternoon on a two-day state visit to the
United Arab Emirates (UAE), the official Wam news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
During the visit, he is to meet his UAE counterpart Sheikh
Zayed Bin Sultan Al-Nahyan to discuss bilateral relations and the
current situation in the Gulf and the Middle East region.
</P>
<P>
Their talks will especially focus on the Israel-Syrian and
Israel-Lebanese peace talks, which have been frozen for nearly
two years after Israel rejected to withdraw its troops from
occupied Golan Heights of Syria and southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Wam said Hrawi will also confer with the UAE government the
Palestine-Israel peace process, which was stalled last March due
to Israel's decision to build Jewish settlements in Arab East
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The UAE and other Gulf Arab states have repeatedly urged
Israel to change its hardline polices and resume the Arab-Israeli
peace talks.

<P>
PARIS, March 31 (Xinhua) -- President of the French Liberal
Democratic Party (LDP) Alain Madelin Tuesday vowed to be loyal to
the centrist Union for French Democracy (UDF), which is faced with
a possible break-up in the wake of the regional elections.
</P>
<P>
The LDP is an affiliate party of the UDF, and so is the
Democratic Force Party headed by former minister Francois Bayrou,
who has declared breakaway from the UDF.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting of the UDF National Assembly deputies, Madelin
agreed to the proposal by UDF president Francois Leotard to
"recast" the centrist movement, rather than abandon it.
</P>
<P>
Madelin set up the LDP in a bid to revamp the centrist movement
following the defeat of the center-right in the legislative
elections last year.
</P>
<P>
In the election of presidents of regional councils on March 20,
several UDF regional deputies allied with the far-right National
Front.

<P>
PHNOM PENH, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Cambodia's Second Prime
Minister Hun Sen on Tuesday expressed welcome to Prince Norodom
Ranariddh's return and agreed to meet him in early May.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to Ranariddh, Hun Sen said, "With happiness I

<P>
SHANGHAI, March 31 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese drama, which is
referred to as the Chinese "Romeo and Juliet", will appear on
stage in New York in July.
</P>
<P>
The work, "Peony Pavilion", was written almost 600 years ago by
Tang Xianzu (1550-1616), and depicts a young woman who struggled
for her freedom and love and defies society, leading to her death.
</P>
<P>
The 21-hour drama will be performed over three days at the
Lincoln Center by the Shanghai Kunqu Opera Troupe. It will also be
performed in Paris, Sydney, and Hong Kong later this year.
</P>
<P>
The drama is in the Kunqu opera style, which is similar in
costume and staging to Peking opera but has music that is more
subtle and delicate. Most later dramatic forms, including Peking
Opera, were influenced to a varying degree by the Kunqu.

<TEXT>
<P>
This proposal was presented Tuesday by Li Yuanchao, head of the
Chinese cultural delegation to the Intergovernmental Conference on
Cultural Policies for Development held here from Monday to
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The conference, organized by United Nations Educational,
Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), was aimed at
promoting cultural development in the world.
</P>
<P>
Li Yuanchao, a vice minister of culture, said at the conference
that cultural heritages and resources in the developing countries
are being threatened with damage and diminishment as a result of
unscrupulous plundering, robbing and buying at high prices by big
powers.
</P>
<P>
"We should strengthen our efforts to protect all the tangible
and intangible heritage," he told government representatives from
more than 100 countries.
</P>
<P>
He added that the developed countries should commit themselves
to assisting developing countries to promote their national
cultures for the realization of a harmonious cultural development
among regions.
</P>
<P>
Li also appealed for consultations and communications among
different cultures in order to apply the principles of cultural
diversity in a broader context.
</P>
<P>
In an action plan presented at the Conference on Monday, UNESCO
urged all nations to spend an equivalent of at least 0.5 percent
of their economic output on cultural development within the next
10 years.
</P>
<P>
Federico Mayor, Director General of the UN cultural agency,
urged that national spending on culture recommended by the
organization should be included in government budgets.

<HEADLINE> Some of China's Elderly Showing Preference for Old Folks' Homes (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Zhao Xiuge, a 74-year-old
retired middle school teacher in Shenyang, capital of northeast
China's Liaoning Province, got a room in a local "Senior Citizens
Apartment" despite strong opposition from four sons and a daughter.
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to live with my children and add to their
troubles," she said in explaining her actions, "I'm well looked
after by doctors and nurses here and always have the company by
other senior citizens."
</P>
<P>
Many of China's senior citizens, either in response or reaction
to social progress, have gradually abandoned the traditional
practice of spending the remaining years of their lives with their
children, and have opted for life in an old folks' home,
especially in the cities.
</P>
<P>
According to a Civil Affairs Ministry official, there are about
1,500 old folks' homes in China caring for nearly 100,000 senior
citizens, 30 percent of whom are paying for their stay. In some
developed coastal regions, all senior citizens living in old
folks' homes pay for their accommodations.
</P>
<P>
Before the 1980s, these kinds of homes in China were a sort of
government-funded welfare institution that was only open to the
helpless aged who either had no income or could not work and had
no children to rely on.
</P>
<P>
But now, with a growing demand from senior citizens with decent
incomes or financial support from their families, some old folks'
homes have become more market-oriented and are now running their
own business.
</P>
<P>
Wang Baolin, the head of the Shenyang Old Folks' Home, said
that his home has started running advertisements in the local
media.

<HEADLINE> HK Announces Five-Year Land Disposal Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 31 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong government
announced Tuesday that it is able to provide a total of 650
hectares of land for housing in the five years from 1998 to 2003.
</P>
<P>
The 650-hectare land is estimated to produce 345,400 flat
units, said Bowen Leung, secretary for Planning, Environment and
Lands of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR), when
announcing the government's Five-Year Land Disposal Program (LDP)
Tuesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Five-Year LDP covered two parts -- land
disposal in 1998/99 and 1999/2000 and the projected land supply
for the following three years between 2000/2001 and 2002/2003.
</P>
<P>
Leung said that a total of 286 hectares of land would be
disposed of in the first two years, which have the potential to
produce 158,900 units for housing.
</P>
<P>
As regards the second part of the LDP, he forecast that the
land supply for housing for the following three-year period will
be 364 hectares which are expected to produce 186,500 units.
</P>
<P>
Leung said that among the various needs of the community,
housing has been accorded the top priority on the SAR government's
agenda.
</P>
<P>
The government would make available sufficient land for
achieving the long-term housing target of producing not less than
85,000 flats a year, he said.
</P>
<P>
The sufficient provision of land will help stabilize property
prices in Hong Kong, Leung said.
</P>
<P>
"The government is fully aware that stable property prices are
important to the economy of Hong Kong. We do not wish to see a
sharp price increase, nor a collapse in the property market," he
added.

<TEXT>
<P>
Other homes for the elderly, to increase competitiveness and
attract more paying customers, are making an effort to improve
their facilities and their services. One survey has shown that
most old folks' homes in major Chinese cities now function as
multi-purpose centers with everything from medical care and
rehabilitation to entertainment.
</P>
<P>
China now has 130 million people above the age of 60, and much
of the country has seen the dawn of the aging society. There is at
the same time a shortage of facilities to care for senior
citizens, and only an average of six beds for every 10,000 elderly
people, according to existing conditions.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government is welcoming investment in the area, and
is encouraging the existing homes to expand by taking in more
paying customers, says Zhang Zhong, a Civil Affairs Ministry
official.
</P>
<P>
Xia Chuanling, a research specialist on senior citizens,
attributes the sharp increase in the number of the people willing
to pay for urban old folks' homes to China's rapid economic growth
in the past two decades and the family planning policy, and says
that, "As time goes by, more and more Chinese families will face
the heavy burden of having to support several senior citizens at
the same time."
</P>
<P>
It is important that the government establish a social system
that can help deal with this burden, Xia said.

<HEADLINE> Germany's VAT Up One Percent From April 1 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, March 31 (Xinhua) -- The value-added tax will be raised
by one percentage point to 16 percent in Germany up from Wednesday
to help finance the country's expensive social welfare system.
</P>
<P>
The VAT increase was decided last December as a compromise
between the German government and the main opposition Social
Democratic Party (SPD) to avoid raising pension contributions to a
record of 21 percent of wages from the current 20.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
The compromise, however, has provoked sharp criticism from
German business leaders who say it would curb retail demand while
increasing inflation by about 0.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Challenging that view, the Berlin-based German economic
research institute DIW said on Tuesday that although the VAT
increase would somehow dampen the economic growth, an increase in
pension contributions could be even more harmful.
</P>
<P>
DIW also said it did not see any serious inflation danger
coming from the VAT increase because the inflation rate in Germany
is now at a record low of 1.1 percent.

<HEADLINE> Minister: Malaysia No Base for Rebel Groups </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia does not want to
become a base for any rebel groups from neighboring countries as
it wants to maintain good relations, Deputy Home Minister Tajol
Rosli Ghazali said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The deputy minister made the remarks when asked to comment on
Monday's incident where 14 Indonesian illegal immigrants from
Acheh forced their way into the compound of the U.N. High
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) office here to seek sanctuary.
</P>
<P>
The 14 Indonesians, who reportedly fled from the Lenggeng
immigration detention camp in the eastern state of Negeri Sembilan
last Thursday, claimed themselves as political refugees and
refused to be deported together with other illegal immigrants.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia views those who entered the country illegally as
illegal immigrants, irrespective of whether they are Acehnese or
from other provinces in Indonesia, he said when met by reporters
at the lobby of the Parliament House here.
</P>
<P>
"We don't differentiate one group of Indonesian illegal
immigrants from another. They are all the same," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We also don't want Malaysia to become the base for rebel
groups from the Philippines, Thailand and Indonesia. We want to
maintain good relations with our neighbors," he added.
</P>
<P>
Tajol Rosli said Malaysia was still waiting for confirmation
from the UNHCR office as to whether the 14 Indonesians were
political refugees as claimed.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, according to the Malaysian national news agency
Bernama, Malaysia has agreed to a request from the UNHCR here for
time to determine if the 14 Indonesians still camping in the
compound of the UNHCR office here are legitimate asylum-seekers.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Deputy Inspector-General of Police
Norian Mai told reporters here Tuesday police would only act on
the 14 Indonesian illegal immigrants once they leave the UNHCR
compound.
</P>
<P>
The group faces action for not having valid travel documents
and for escaping from the Lenggeng detention camp, Norian said at
a news conference here, adding police were prepared to evict them
from the UNHCR premises upon request from the agency.

<P>
WASHINGTON, March 31 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading U.S. newspapers Tuesday:
</P>
<P>
The New York Times
</P>
<P>
-- In one of its most ambitious undertakings, the Japanese
Government plans this week to set in motion a far-reaching program
that it hopes will infuse the country's financial landscape with
the prowess of its manufacturing industries.
</P>
<P>
-- The American mediator for the Middle East, Dennis B. Ross,
concluded a four-day shuttle in the area apparently without
breaking the year-old deadlock in Israeli-Palestinian
negotiations. After Ross held a fourth and final meeting with
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, a senior Israeli official said
that the American proposal for a partial withdrawal from the West
Bank was flatly rejected.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post
</P>
<P>
-- A team of scientists is zeroing in on a mysterious
AIDS-fighting substance distilled from a distinctly unlikely
source -- the urine of pregnant women. The existence of the
substance has been suspected for several years, but its precise
chemical identity has proved elusive.
</P>
<P>
-- The House on Monday night emphatically rejected the
Republican leadership's campaign finance bill as angry Democratic
and GOP critics decried the voting process as a "fraud" and "sham"
that barred consideration of their bipartisan plan to curb
fund-raising abuses.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal
</P>
<P>
-- OPEC agreed to cut crude oil production by 1.25 million
barrels a day, after a meeting that yielded specific pledges about
how much each country will now produce. Still, the cuts, about 1.5
million including cuts by non-OPEC producers, fall short of
amounts promised March 22 and likely won't boost oil prices
immediately.
</P>
<P>
-- U.N. weapons inspectors have searched six of the eight Iraqi
presidential sites covered by the recent access agreement between
Baghdad and U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan. The inspections
should be completed this week, a U.N. official said.

BEIJING, March 31 (Xinhua) -- The UN High Commissioner for
Human Rights Mary Robinson has postponed a China visit,
Vice-Premier Qian Qichen told journalists this evening, after
talks with UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan.
</P>

"We hope Mrs. Robinson can visit China at an early date, but
the originally proposed date was early and not quite to her
convenience", Qian explained.
</P>
<P>
He said that China will sign the International Covenant on
Civil and Political Rights as it has announced and abide by its
rules, but that China is now studying it to see whether there are
some contradictions between it and China's laws.
</P>
<P>
Annan said that he was encouraged to hear that China has
invited Mrs. Robinson for a visit although the date has not been
fixed and that he and Mrs. Robinson are expecting to continue
cooperating with China in the field of human rights.
</P>
<P>
Annan arrived here this morning on a two-day official visit to

BEIJING, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Vice-Premier Qian Qichen, in a
meeting today with former British Defense Secretary Michael

Rongji attend the second Asia-Europe Meeting.
</P>
<P>
It will give him an opportunity to exchange views on
multilateral issues with the heads of Asian and European nations,
Qian said.
</P>
<P>
Zhu was elected premier at the first session of the Ninth
Chinese People's Congress this month. He left early today for
London, where the meeting will be held April 3-4. This is his
first trip abroad in the new post. He will take part in the second
Asia-Europe meeting and make an official visit to Britain and
France.
</P>
<P>
Zhu's visit to Britain and Prime Minister Tony Blair's visit to

<P>
China has always underlined its friendship with Britain and
bilateral ties have gone smoothly in recent years, said Qian, who
is a long-time diplomat who recently quit his job as foreign

begun to disappear after Hong Kong's smooth transfer of power, and

instead of an obstacle between the two countries.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Total deposits in Hong Kong
recorded an increase of 1.4 percent in February this year based on
a modest growth of 0.2 percent in the previous month.
</P>
<P>
The latest statistics published by the Hong Kong Monetary
Authority show that HK dollar deposits rose by 1.9 percent,
reversing a decline of 2.2 percent in January while foreign
currency deposits grew by 0.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
During the month, HK demand deposits rose by 3.8 percent while
savings deposits increased sharply by 14 percent.
</P>
<P>
The rises reflected partly the return of "lai-see" cash to the
banking system in the form of demand and savings deposits after
the Lunar New Year, with cash held by the public declining by 13.5
percent.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, time deposits dropped by 1.5 percent in February,
along with falling interest rates and reduced volatility in
regional financial market.
</P>
<P>
Analyzed by currency, U.S. dollar deposits rose by a modest 0.1
percent, having increased strongly by 4.8 percent in January,
while non-U.S. dollar foreign currency deposits rose by 1.6
percent, following a growth of 1.8 percent in the previous month.
</P>
<P>
Figures also show that total loans and advances fell by 2.9
percent in February due to the slowdown in economic activities
across Hong Kong.

major cities this year.
</P>
<P>
Li Yongjia, the deputy-general manager of BOC's information

<HEADLINE> Kenya, S. Africa to Enhance Bilateral Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 31 (Xinhua) -- The governments of Kenya and
South Africa are resolved to work towards enhancement of
bilateral ties in the economic, scientific, technical and
cultural fields.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference held here Tuesday, a joint communique
was issued at the end of a three-day official visit to Kenya by
South African Foreign Minister Alfred Nzo who arrived here on
March 29.
</P>
<P>
Nzo and his Kenyan counterpart Bonaya Godana said in the
communique that cooperation between the two countries would be
strengthened with the conclusion of the Trade Agreement under
consideration.
</P>
<P>
The two ministers agreed that the Agreement on the Avoidance
of Double Taxation and Prevention of Evasion with Respect to
Taxes on Income and the Protocol on Protection of Investment
should be concluded as quick as possible.
</P>
<P>
According to the communique, the two ministers also discussed
the possibility of establishing a Joint Commission aiming at
enhancing mutual relations and the signing of a Memorandum of
Understanding on cooperation in various fields.
</P>
<P>
After signing the communique, Nzo pointed out that all these
draft documents discussed during his visit would provide legal
basis for the promotion and consolidation of relations between
South Africa and Kenya.
</P>
<P>
The South African minister described his visit to Kenya as "of
very great significance in consolidating relationship between our
two countries."
</P>
<P>
He announced that one of the highlights in the two-day talks
with his counterpart Godana is to propose a date for a state
visit by Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi to South Africa.
</P>
<P>
If everything goes well, the visit is possibly to take place
on August 13 this year, said Nzo, adding that Godana has accepted
his invitation to visit South Africa before August.

MOSCOW, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
indicated Tuesday that he would reappoint two senior ministers to
the new government.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin said after talks with Namibian President Sam Nujoma
that he would reappoint Yevgeny Primakov and Mikhail Zadornov as
foreign and finance ministers respectively.
</P>
<P>
However, the Kremlin said that Yetsin's intention is not a
decree, as under the constitution Yeltsin cannot appoint ministers
while his choice for government prime minister has not been
confirmed by the State Duma, lower house of parliament.
</P>
<P>
But Kremlin spokesman Sergei Yastrzhembsky added that the
president's intention was clear.

ISLAMABAD, March 31 (Xinhua) -- The Karachi Stock Exchange

The blasts took place in a busy market and thoroughfare Tuesday
morning, killing two and leaving 24 injured.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan President Daniel
arap Moi has accepted an invitation to visit South Africa later
this year, South African Foreign Affairs Department said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
This will be the first official visit by Moi to South Africa,
South African Press Association quoted department spokesman Marco
Boni as saying.
</P>
<P>
The invitation was extended on behalf of President Nelson
Mandela by Foreign Minister Alfred Nzo, who was in Kenya to
discuss bilateral issues with his counterpart Bonaya Godana.
</P>
<P>
Nzo, who ended his three-day visit to Nairobi Tuesday, had
successful talks with Moi on the "consolidation of the
relationship" between the two countries, Boni said.
</P>
<P>
A joint communique issued Tuesday said the two countries were
preparing a trade agreement aimed at boosting trade and
investment ties.
</P>
<P>
Kenya was South Africa's largest trading partner on the
continent outside of the Southern African Development Community
(SADC). Exports to Kenya in 1996 totaled 954 million Rand (190
million U.S. dollars) while imports from Kenya came to 123
million Rand (24.5 million dollars), according to Boni.
</P>
<P>
South Africa was the biggest direct foreign investor in Kenya
last year, he said.
</P>
<P>
Official relations between the two countries were resumed in
1992 after a 29-year break.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania's Exports Drop 17.4 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania's export earnings
in February recorded 60 million US Dollars, down 17.4 percent
from January's figure, according to the Bank of Tanzania (BOT).
</P>
<P>
Earnings from both traditional and non-traditional exports
have declined, says a latest bank report reaching here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The report also notes that the trade deficit in February
reached 49.3 million US Dollars compared with a deficit of 25.7
million US Dollars recorded a month earlier.
</P>
<P>
Earnings from traditional exports reached 35 million Dollars,
a decrease of 23.9 percent from January.
</P>
<P>
The decrease has been attributed to a decline in both volume
and prices of exported commodities.
</P>
<P>
All traditional exports recorded decreases in prices except
for cotton and tea whose unit prices increased by 13.0 percent
and 7.6 percent respectively, the BOT report said. As for export
volume, only coffee and tobacco recorded increases in February.
</P>
<P>
On non-traditional exports, the BOT report notes that earnings
from this sector decreased by 5.9 percent from 26.9 million
Dollars to 25.3 million Dollars during the period under review.
</P>
<P>
The decrease has been attributed to low earnings from cotton
yarn, manufactured coffee, fish and fish products.
</P>
<P>
On an annual basis, export earnings for the year ending
February 1998 decreased by 11.5 percent to 686.6 million Dollars
from 775.9 million Dollars recorded in the same month last year.
</P>
<P>
The report says that for the year ending February 1998
receipts from traditional exports decreased to 350 million
Dollars from 426.9 million Dollars recorded in the same period in
1997.
</P>
<P>
The yearly decline in export earnings is largely due to a
decrease in volumes of all traditional exports except for sisal
whose volume soared by 60.4 percent.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian, Syrian FMs End Visit to Saudi Arabia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Foreign ministers of Egypt
and Syria left Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, Tuesday after holding
intensive talks with their Saudi counterpart in a bid to revive
the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa, Syrian Foreign Minister
Farouq al-Sharaa, who arrived in Riyadh Monday on an unannounced
visit, and Saudi Foreign Minister Saud Al-Faisal focused their
talks on the peace process in light of latest U.S. efforts to
revive the peace talks, according to Kuwait News Agency (KUNA)
reports from Riyadh.
</P>
<P>
Israeli insistence on building a new Jewish settlement in East
Jerusalem last year and its intransigency over Israeli
redeployment in the West Bank stalled the Middle East peace
process and so far international efforts in reviving the process
have failed to bring any positive results.
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic sources were quoted by the KUNA as saying that the
three foreign ministers made a comprehensive review of the
current situation in the stalemated Mideast peace process.
</P>
<P>
Moussa presented full details of U.S. Middle East Peace
Coordinator Dennis Ross's talks Monday with Egyptian leaders over
the U.S. initiative to salvage the deadlocked peace process. Ross
Monday ended his shuttle diplomacy with Israeli and Palestinians
leaders, which failed to find any solution.
</P>
<P>
The three ministers stressed that the Middle East would never
enjoy ever-lasting peace and stability without a just,
comprehensive and balanced peace.
</P>
<P>
The ministers' talks are part of a joint Arab effort to counter
the intransigency policies of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu, diplomatic sources in Riyadh said while speculating
that they might have agreed on holding a mini-Arab summit next
month that could also include the Palestinian National Authority,
Lebanon, Jordan and Morocco.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, Syria and Saudi Arabia, the three heavy weights in the
Arab world, have frequently urged the Israeli government to
reverse its current anti-Arab policies and abide by the agreements
it signed with the Palestinians in order to rescue the peace
process.
</P>
<P>
The sources said the Egyptian capital of Cairo would play host
to a mini-Arab summit to coordinate positions on the latest
developments regarding the Middle East peace process.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Vice-Premier Meets with UN Secretary-General (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Vice-Premier Qian Qichen, in a
meeting with the UN's Secretary-General Kofi Annan here this
afternoon, said that China will continue to support his work in
the years to come and take an active part in UN work and make a
contribution to safeguarding world peace and promoting development.
</P>
<P>
Qian said that there have been many positive changes in the UN
since Annan took office, and the UN's active participation in
international affairs is conducive to the development of
multi-polarization in the world.
</P>
<P>
He congratulated Annan on his successful mediation during his
Iraqi visit and said he appreciates Annan's courage and wisdom in
handling the Iraqi weapons inspection crisis, saying that it was a
difficult mission which ended with very good results and
satisfaction in the international community because of Annan's
persistent efforts.
</P>
<P>
This shows that the UN's role in safeguarding world peace and
security and in easing regional tensions is important, Qian said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Chinese hope that Iraq can cooperate with the
inspection group and implement the Security Council resolutions in
a down-to-earth manner, and that the inspection group should
continue to carry out rational inspections in a constructive way.
</P>
<P>
Annan praised China's positive role in the UN and thanked it
for its strong support and help during the recent Iraqi weapons
inspection crisis. He said that the agreement reached with the
Iraqi government is being implemented and the inspection work is
going smoothly and that he hopes the Security Council members and
the international community will continue to offer support on this
issue.

<HEADLINE> India to Look Into Japan's Concern Over Auto Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, March 31 (Xinhua) -- India is looking into Japan's
concern over its restrictions on imports of auto spare parts, a
senior government official said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"We have received the communication from the Japanese
government about the automobile policy and are looking into it,"
said N. N. Khanna, Special Secretary of the Ministry of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
Reports from Tokyo said that Japan urged India to remove its
"local content requirement" for foreign automakers because it
violates fair trade rules set by the World Trade Organization
(WTO).
</P>
<P>
Japan is particularly peeved with India's regulation that
requires foreign automobile manufacturers to raise the
indigenization level of their auto parts to 50 percent in three
years and 70 percent in five years.
</P>
<P>
Officials from the Japanese Ministry for International Trade
and Industry said that the United States, European Union and South
Korea were expected to join Japan to press India to justify these
requirements at the WTO.
</P>
<P>
Khanna declined to comment on the threat by Japan, saying that
it is nothing unusual for developing countries to protect their
own market by imposing certain conditions to get products at a
cheap price.
</P>
<P>
Major Japanese car companies including Toyota Motors, Honda and
Suzuki have their manufacturing bases in India.

<HEADLINE> HK to Promote Tourism by Staging World-class Events </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 31 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong government said
Tuesday that it plans to promote the tourism industry by staging a
series of world-class events in the next five years with the
support of a 100-million HK dollar (12.82 million U.S. dollar)
International Events Fund (IEF).
</P>
<P>
Announcing details of the use of the fund, Amy Chan, executive
director of the Hong Kong Tourist Association (HKTA), told a press
conference Tuesday afternoon that a steering committee will be set
up to oversee the fund.
</P>
<P>
The committee will include representatives from the Finance
Bureau, the Economic Services Bureau and the HKTA itself, as well
as professional experts from related fields, Chan said.
</P>
<P>
The HKTA noted that the IEF, which was first announced by Hong
Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) Chief Executive Tung Chee
Hwa in his policy address late last year and approved by the
Provisional Legislative Council on March 23 this year, will be
used solely to facilitate the staging of international,
world-class events in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The staging of world-class events in such fields as sports,
art, culture, entertainment, dining, and conventions and
exhibitions, as well as tourism-related activities, can help
create job opportunities and enhance the cultural and living
standards of local residents, Chan said.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that this will help attract an additional
150,000 visitors to Hong Kong, thereby bringing in an extra one
billion HK dollars (128 million U.S. dollars) in tourism receipts.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, extra consumption and commercial investment by
overseas organizations will also be induced through the staging of
events here.
</P>
<P>
Chan said that other social benefits brought by major events
include the enhancement of Hong Kong's international reputation,
the promotion of cultural exchanges and an increase in job
opportunities.
</P>
<P>
The SAR administration has taken concrete measures to help
underpin the efforts of Hong Kong's tourism industry.
</P>
<P>
Announcing the financial budget last month, Financial Secretary
Donald Tsang said that apart from providing funding for tourism
facilities and attractions, the government will make two tax
concessions on tourist industry.
</P>
<P>
The first is to reduce the rate of Hotel Accommodation Tax from
five percent to three percent and the second is to reduce Air
Passenger Department Tax from 100 HK dollars (12.82 U.S. dollars)
to 50 HK dollars (6.41 U.S. dollars) when the new airport at Chek
Lap Kok opens on July 6.
</P>
<P>
The administration also assigned 7.85 million HK dollars (one
million U.S. dollars) to the HKTA to develop a tourism data bank
to enable it to disseminate information to local and overseas
travel agencies.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Proposes to Fund Iraqi Oil Sector: Iraqi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Trade Minister Mohammed
Mehdi Saleh said on Tuesday that United Nations oil experts have
proposed that funds be allocated for Iraq to buy spare parts for
its oil sector, the Iraqi News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Saleh, however, complained that the money suggested by the
experts, who visited Iraq a week ago, is less than what Iraq needs
to upgrade its capability to pump more oil, the news agency said.
</P>
<P>
But he did not say how much money the experts have suggested
and the amount Iraq needs for its oil sector.
</P>
<P>
Iraq is barred from exporting oil under U.N. sanctions imposed
in 1990 after its invasion of Kuwait. But an oil-for-food deal
between the two sides has granted it an exception to sell 2
billion U.S. dollars worth of oil over six months to buy food and
medicine.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council approved a resolution last month to
increase the amount of oil Iraq can sell to 5.2 billion dollars in
the third phase of the deal starting from December.
</P>
<P>
But Iraq has said it can pump no more than 4 billion dollars
worth of oil due to the shortage of spare parts and equipment in
the oil sector.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Iraqi minister said that a U.N. delegation will
arrive here soon to discuss with Iraqi officials the distribution
plan for the third phase of the oil-for-food program.
</P>
<P>
Iraq, however, insists that the new plan be left to itself
rather than the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Saleh said that Iraq has given and will give priority to
friendly countries which have positive stance on lifting the
embargo when it seeks suppliers of humanitarian materials.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has minimized its imports from Australia in response to
its negative position in the recent U.S.-sparked crisis, he said.
</P>
<P>
He expressed hope that the Australian government will take
positive stance and pull back its troops from the Gulf region to
resume economic relations with Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The United States threatened to take military actions last
month to force Iraqi compliance with the U.N. resolutions.
Australia sided with the U.S. and sent troops to the Gulf.
</P>
<P>
Saleh accused the U.S. of continuing to block its companies
from carrying out contracts signed with Iraq for the second phase
of oil-for-food deal.

and Industry Alec Erwin said in a press conference here today that
he satisfied with his Beijing visit.
</P>
<P>
The government officials and businessmen of South Africa and China

trade cooperation during the visit, Erwin said, adding that more than
five hundred businessmen participated in the South
Africa Investment and Products seminar held by South Africa here

Bilateral trade between China and South Africa was worth nearly
1.6 billion US dollars last
year, he said, and that it is likely to increase with joint
efforts.
</P>
<P>
Erwin noted that, as developing countries, South Africa and
China face many similar problems in improving their economies,
which complement each other a great deal. He said his country is
willing to play a positive role in bilateral economic and trade
cooperation and increase bilateral cooperation in minerals and
construction.
</P>
<P>
He said that China's development has impressed him deeply and
that its reform of the economic system will have great influence
on other countries.
</P>
<P>
Erwin will leave for Shanghai this evening.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Canada will enhance its economic
and trade cooperation with China and other Asian partners,
according to its International Trade Minister Sergio Marchi, who
spoke at a Canada-China Business Council luncheon here today.
</P>
<P>
Marchi said that this year is the Council's 20th anniversary,

understand the many opportunities in Canada-China trade and
investment.
</P>
<P>
He said that this ministerial delegation is the largest ever, a
clear demonstration that Canada values economic and trade ties
with China.
</P>
<P>
Many Canadian ministers are planning China tours in the coming
weeks, he said.
</P>
<P>
The key to expanding trade between the two countries is greater
participation by mid-sized and small enterprises, he said, and a
third of this delegation is made up of representatives of these
companies.

But, some people said that the baht is trading at levels higher
than its fundamentals. They argued that the Thai economy hasn't
recovered sufficiently to justify the currency's current level.
</P>
<P>
After the "thunderstorms" in the past, it is really hard to
predict exactly what level the baht should stand. The direction of
the currency may remain a myth, which needs to be closely watched.

<HEADLINE> BMW: Rolls-Royce to Remain Independent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, March 31 (Xinhua) -- German carmaker BMW, winner of the
bid for British luxury carmaker Rolls-Royce, said on Tuesday in
Munich that Rolls would remain independent after the takeover.
</P>
<P>
Rolls would continue to base in Crewe, Britain, and its
workforce would be left unchanged, Bernd Pischetsrieder, BMW
managing board chairman, said.
</P>
<P>
"BMW will continuously develop the range of Rolls-Royce and
Bentley models," he added.
</P>
<P>
BMW, which makes the V12 engine for Rolls-Royce, offered 340
million pounds (570 million U.S. dollars) last Wednesday in the
bidding for the luxury carmaker, beating Germany's largest
carmaker, Volkswagen, and a group of Rolls-Royce fans.
</P>
<P>
The deal is yet to be approved by a conference of shareholders
of Vickers engineering group, the parent company of Rolls.
</P>
<P>
Rolls-Royce was put up for sale by Vickers earlier this
year. The deal with BMW will let Britain's last carmaker be taken
over by foreign companies.
</P>
<P>
Rover is now owned by BMW, and Jaguar and Aston-Martin were
acquired by Ford Motor Company in the 1980s.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Denies Failure of Ross's Peace Mission </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAALE ADUMIM (West Bank), March 31 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu Tuesday denied that the United State
Middle East Peace Envoy Dennis Ross failed in his mission to break
the deadlock in Israeli-Palestinian peace talks.
</P>
<P>
During his tour in a Jewish settlement in Maale Adumim of the
West Bank, Netanyahu told reporters it was not true that Ross
returned to Washington "empty-handed" as local media reported.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu noted that Ross presented to him "very good" ideas
over the peace process during their four rounds of talks in
Jerusalem. He said that they discussed these ideas and will
continue the talks in the near future.
</P>
<P>
During his visit from Thursday till Monday, Ross reportedly has
present to Israeli and Palestinian leaders an American peace plan,
which calls on Israel to withdrawal from 13.1 percent of the West
Bank in the second redeployment, linked to the fulfillment of the
Palestinian commitment to Israel's security.
</P>
<P>
Early reports said that Ross did not succeed in reaching an
agreement with Israel on the scope of the next pullback, and also
failed in getting the Palestinians to make a detailed plan on
fighting terrorism.
</P>
<P>
According to a consensus passed by Israeli Cabinet, any
redeployment of more than 9 percent will damage the national
interests of Israel.
</P>
<P>
And the right-wingers in the ruling Likud coalition have
declared that they will topple Netanyahu's government if the
prime minister carries out the redeployment without the
Palestinian guarantee to Israel's security.
</P>
<P>
But Netanyahu also denied that there are "problems" in his
coalition government, noting that he also doesn't think that the
Palestinian National Authority (PNA) has made efforts to fight
terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Ross, who wrapped up his four-day visit in the region Monday
night, is going to report the development to the U.S. president
Bill Clinton and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, who will
decide the next move to advance the peace process.
</P>
<P>
On Israeli-Lebanese peace talks, Netanyahu said he believes
that the Lebanese Army has the ability to maintain the
security in south Lebanon. He stressed that Israel is willing
to withdraw from Lebanon if the Lebanese government renews its
authority in south Lebanon.

BEIJING, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Jacques Dondoux, French Secretary
of State to the Ministry of Economy, Finance and Industry in
charge of external trade, in a press conference in Beijing today,
said that Premier Zhu Rongji's visit to France will serve to
increase the existing good ties in politics, the economy and trade.
</P>
<P>
He said he believes that meetings between Zhu and French
leaders will result in some very good agreements and help
relations between the European Union and China.
</P>
<P>
France hopes that the EU and China can forge a close
partnership, Dondoux said.
</P>
<P>
The fact that China has kept its currency stable during the
recent Asian financial crisis has left a good impression on
Europe, and this is not an easy job, he said, and China's
promise not to devalue the yuan has brought stability in Asia.
</P>
<P>
He said that France has a very positive attitude about
supporting China's entry into the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
During his two-day stay in Beijing, Dondoux met with Chinese
ministers. He has now gone to Wuhan and Shanghai to continue to
promote economic and trade ties between China and France.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Foreign Investment Decreases Sharply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Foreign investment in Indonesia
is expected to reach only 20 billion U.S. dollars this year, a
sharp drop from the previous years' annual average investment of
32 billion dollars, a senior official said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian government decided to offer more incentives to
investors to curb the decline of the foreign investment, State
Minister for Investment Sanyoto Sastrowardojo said after meeting
with President Soeharto.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the foreign investment in the first quarter
of 1998 reached 5.1 billion U.S. dollars spread in 307 project
proposals.
</P>
<P>
In the same period in 1997, the foreign investment reached 6.5
billion dollars but the number of projects was only 221.
</P>
<P>
Most foreigners invested in gas and electricity, housing and
industrial estates, agriculture, chemical and metal industries,
the minister said.
</P>
<P>
On domestic investments, Sanyoto said that in the first quarter
of this year, some 17.8 trillion rupiah (one U.S. dollar equals
8,500 rupiah at present) have been invested in 94 projects, a
sharp fall compared to the same period last year when the figure
reached 36.9 trillion rupiah in 165 projects.
</P>
<P>
Sanyoto said President Soeharto instructed him to consult other
ministers before announcing the government's plan to give
additional incentives to new investors.

MANILA, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel Ramos

In his recommendation to Ramos, Defense Secretary Fortunato

weapons are carried by them," Ramos said.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: What Supports The Stronger Baht? (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
 by Xu Haijing
</P>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Like a thunderstorm, the Thai
baht devalued sharply overnight after it was set floating on July
2, 1997, hitting the record low of 57 baht against the greenback
on January 12 this year.
</P>
<P>
Again like a tropic thunderstorm, the currency quickly enjoyed
a clearing sky after that and has been stabilized at about 38
against the U.S. dollar in the recent two weeks.
</P>
<P>
What can be the explanation of the myth of the baht
thunderstorms, it is wondered.
</P>
<P>
A review at the activities at the political stage may provide
some of the answers.
</P>
<P>
First, the Thai House of Representatives vetoed the
no-confidence motion submitted by the opposition parties against
the government on March 21.
</P>
<P>
Thus, the government, headed by Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai,
was provided with a stable political environment for its efforts
to bring the economy back onto the right track.
</P>
<P>
Second, the highly-evaluated visit to the United States by
Prime Minister Chuan was also seen as a big push for the baht to
go up.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Chuan's U.S. trip between March 11 to 17 was
hailed both domestically and internationally as a move which
successfully improved Thailand's image and boosted confidence
among foreign investors in the Thai economy.
</P>
<P>
Western countries, including the United States, and
international organizations such as the International Monetary
Fund (IMF) and the World Bank, gave thumb-up to the Thai
government's work since it took office last November.
</P>
<P>
The Chuan government has followed the IMF prescription of
financial reform by closing 56 of the 58 suspended financial
institutions. It also kept a high interest rate in a bid to
stabilize the currency.

<HEADLINE> HK's Telecommunications Industry Enters New Era </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 31 (Xinhua) -- The telecommunications industry
of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) entered a new
era on Tuesday morning, after the Hongkong Telecom International
Limited surrendered its exclusive external licence to the SAR
government.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a ceremony following the formal surrender of the
exclusive licence, Secretary for Economic Services of the SAR
government Stephen Ip said the early termination of the
exclusivity in external telecommunications was of great
significance for Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
"Not only will Hong Kong consumers gain direct benefits
amounting to 17 billion HK dollars (2.18 billion U.S. dollars),
the liberalization of the international telecommunications market
will bring in a large amount of investment, stimulate the economy
and create employment opportunities -- not just in
telecommunications but in the service industries," he said.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that "it will eliminate the hindrance caused by
the exclusivity in the introduction of new technology and will
help maintain Hong Kong's position as the pre-eminent
telecommunications hub in the region."
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> HK's Exchange Fund Reports Results in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 31 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Monetary
Authority (HKMA) Tuesday announced the audited results of the
Exchange Fund at end-1997 with total assets up 19 percent to 636.6
billion HK dollars (81.61 billion U.S. dollars) and a 10 percent
growth in accumulated surplus.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the HKMA said that growth in the accumulated
surplus is a reflection of the performance of HKMA's steady
management of the Exchange Fund.
</P>
<P>
The 10 percent increase in a year of volatility and the most
serious financial crisis in Asia can be considered satisfactory
under difficult conditions, he said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman noted that the HKMA has continued to undertake a
prudent approach and pursued largely a defensive bond and currency
strategy in the first half of last year as markets were volatile.
</P>
<P>
In the second half of last year, the HKMA extended the duration
of the bond holdings as markets improved.
</P>
<P>
"The HKMA will continue with its prudent management of the
Exchange Fund in 1998 to achieve consistent returns and high
liquidity with minimum volatility, in full compliance with the
guidelines set down by Exchange Fund Advisory Committee," the
spokesman said.

<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, March 31 (Xinhua) -- The peace talks in Burundi
may soon resume following the release of two former leaders of
the central African nation, a Tanzanian newspaper report said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The international mediator in the Burundi political conflict,
Tanzania's former president Julius Nyerere, has sent his envoy
Judge Mark Bomani to Burundi for discussions with warring parties
before the resumption of peace talks, the Guardian paper here
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Secretary General of the Organization of African
Unity (OAU) Salim Ahmed Salim has arrived in Dar es Salaam for
the talks with Nyerere and Tanzanian President Benjamin Mkapa on
the Burundi issue.
</P>
<P>
Nyerere insisted that one of the conditions to resume Burundi
peace talks is the release of former Burundi presidents,
Jean-Baptiste Bagaza and Sylvestre Ntibantunganya, and also
Speaker of the Burundi National Assembly Leonce Ngendakumana.
</P>
<P>
Nyerere said that the conditions, set during the last Great
Lakes summit in Kampala last year, should be respected first.
</P>
<P>
"We will act only when the conditions are met," he told the
Independent Television (ITV) Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Bagaza and Ngendakumana were freed from house arrest recently,
paving the way for the Resumption of peace talks.
</P>
<P>
The move shows that "there are signs that could make the talks
resume soon," a government official was quoted by the Guardian as
saying.
</P>

The Burundi peace talks were stalled last year after the
Burundi military junta led by Pierre Buyoya said it had no faith

Burundi.
</P>
<P>
East and central African nations, backed by OAU, have imposed

<HEADLINE> Junta Members on Trial in S. Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 31 (Xinhua) -- The trial of former Koroma junta
members charged with treason started Monday in Freetown, media
reports from Sierra Leone said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
According to the reports available here, some 21 former
ministers and top officials of the ousted military junta of
Sierra Leone were arraigned before the Freetown Magistrate Court
No. 1, all charged with treason.
</P>
<P>
If convicted, they would face death penalty or long terms of
imprisonment, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
Those appeared before the court Monday include five civilians
who acted as ministers and deputy ministers under the Koroma
junta, which was overthrown in mid-February by the West Africa
peace-keeping force, ECOMOG.
</P>
<P>
Others are former head of state Sankow Philip George, popular
broadcaster Dennis First, former spokesman of the junta Jibrin
Massaquoi and arms dealer Steve Bio.
</P>
<P>
President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah's former secretary, Bakut Bayo,
was also brought before the court.
</P>
<P>
Bayo worked briefly with the junta and later fled to Ghana. He
returned to Freetown after President Kabbah was reinstated on
March 10, nine months after he was toppled by Koroma's military
coup last May.
</P>
<P>
ECOMOG declared a fortnight ago that about 1,400 persons loyal
to the Koroma junta were being held as Prisoners of War in
Freetown.
The hearing of Monday's trial was adjourned.

<P>
SINGAPORE, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Singaporeans have been asked by
the authorities to use water wisely as Singapore's water stock has
gone down within the last month from 85 to 73 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Public Utilities Board (PUB) said on Tuesday that the
country's water levels are expected to drop further in the dry
months ahead.

It also noted that in March, the average daily demand for water
was 1.3 million cubic meters, which is 3.2 percent higher than the
same period last year.

The PUB therefore has appealed to the public to use water
wisely to help conserve the country's water stock.

It suggested avoiding the use of drinking water to water lawns,
wash cars and fill swimming pools, for example.
</P>
<P>
The PUB also said that it is monitoring the water situation and
will implement more conservation measures if the dry weather
persists.

problems.
</P>
<P>
"There are still points to be discussed ... corporate debt,
that is still an issue," he said.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last year, Indonesia's foreign debt totaled 137.4
billion U.S. dollars, 73.9 billion dollars of which were incurred
by the private sector. The huge private sector debt has been
blamed as one of the causes of the economic crisis in the country.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian rupiah has lost more than 70 percent of its
value against the U.S. dollar since July last year. As a result of
the monetary crisis, the country has been facing with spiraling
inflation, growing unemployment and other serious economic and
social problems.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia signed an agreement with the IMF at the end of
October last year in exchange for a bailout package of more than
40 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, Indonesia promised to conduct wide ranging
economic, financial and trade reforms in the country.
</P>
<P>
IMF gave its first 3 billion U.S. dollars tranche to Indonesia
in December last year.
</P>
<P>
However, the Fund withheld the second tranche worth 3 billion
dollars earlier this month because of the so-called lack of
reforms in the country.
</P>
<P>
In the past 13 days, both sides discussed monetary policies,
banking sector, state budget, structural reform and external
corporate debt.
</P>
<P>
Neiss refused to specify the outcome of his meeting with the
central bank governor, saying the two sides wanted to have good
discussions, with no single point to be left undiscussed.
</P>
<P>
"We want all issues to be discussed fully and completely. Only
after this could we say that the discussions have been completed,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, PR. Narvekar, IMF senior adviser to Indonesia, said
there will still be another round of talks between Indonesia and
the IMF.

<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Share prices continued to
decline on the Singapore market as the benchmark Straits Times
Industrials Index (STII) lost another 19.38 points to close at
1629.18 points on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said that stock prices weakened after a thin session
amid slight profit-taking in the absence of leads to spur the
market. They noted that the STII posted gains early in the day,
but a lack of follow-through by investors reversed the market's
direction.
</P>
<P>
They also pointed out that as the reporting season had come to
an end, therefore, little news was expected in the short-term to
move the market.
</P>
<P>
The total market volume shrank further to 206.68 million units,
valued at 304.4 million Singapore dollars (about 189.07 million
U.S. dollars). Declines overwhelmed advances by 242 to 91, while
253 other counters remained unchanged.
</P>
<P>
Ber Group was the most actively traded counter as it registered
a turnover of 11.34 million units. It was followed by Renong which
had 11.23 million shares traded. Easyknit was next with 10.93
million shares changed hands.
</P>
<P>
Jurong Shipyard led the gainers of the day as it rose by 25
cents to finish at 8.4 Singapore dollars. ASEAN increased by 20
cents to end at nine U.S. dollars. WTK was up by 15 cents to close
at 2.58 Singapore dollars.
</P>
<P>
On the downside, Creative 50 was the biggest loser as it
declined by 70 cents to end at 35.6 Singapore dollars. Bukit
Sembawang fell by 60 cents to close at 12.6 Singapore dollars.
City Developments Warrant98 and UOB (United Overseas Bank) Foreign
lost 50 cents each to finish at 5.3 and 8.95 Singapore dollars
respectively.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Slumps on Japanese Yen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, March 31 (Xinhua) -- The falling Japanese yen
overshadowed Australia's trade figures and pushed the Australian
dollar lower Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"The Australian dollar has largely been a puppet of yen trading
in recent days, as the time draws near for the end of Japanese
financial year, and speculation grows as to the year-end
valuations of the Nikkei (share market index) and yen," said
Citibank chief economist Stephen Koukoulas.
</P>
<P>
The local currency closed at 66.34 U.S. cents, from 66.68 U.S.
cents Monday.
</P>
<P>
The yen again took center stage Tuesday, despite market
sentiment that the release of February's balance of goods and
services data may swing the focus back to the domestic front, said
SBC Warburg Australia Foreign Exchange Director John Radinoff.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Bureau of Statistics said the balance on goods
and services was an adjusted deficit of 321 million Australian
dollars (211.85 million U.S. dollars) in February, a narrowing
from a 556 million Australian dollars (367 million U.S. dollars)
deficit in January.
</P>
<P>
Exports rose two percent, adjusted, during the month while
imports remained virtually steady.
</P>
<P>
Radinoff said the Australian dollar pushed up to its highs for
the day after the data release.
</P>
<P>
On the cross-rates, the Australian dollar closed the local
session at 87.03 from 87.65 against Japanese yen and at 1.2294
from 1.2104 against Deutsch marks.

<P>
SEOUL, March 31 (Xinhua) -- South Korea is betting on the
Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM) to help bring the country out from its
financial crisis starting late last year.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Affairs and Trade Minister Park Chung-soo also voiced
Tuesday his hope that the meeting, the second of the kind, could
help South Korea take another leap in economic growth.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, of 10 Asian countries and their 15 European Union
counterparts, is scheduled to open Wednesday in London to further
their course launched in 1996 for an Asia-Europe partnership.
</P>
<P>
President Kim's trip to London bears economic importance, in
addition to political and diplomatic significance, said Kim
Taedong, senior secretary of economic affairs for the president.
</P>
<P>
For South Korea, now amid the financial crisis caused by
corporate bankruptcies and bad loans of financial institutions,
the three-day event is a chance to mobilize support and help.
</P>
<P>
President Kim Dae-jung will meet, in the first overseas trip
since he was sworn in as the head of state last month, with heads
of government from Britain, China and Japan, Park said.
</P>
<P>
He will meet Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji for a bilateral fishery
agreement and on China's constructive role in the ongoing
four-nation meeting over a permanent peace in the Korean
peninsula, said Park.

TOKYO, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Stock prices rallied in Tokyo with
the key Nikkei index ending just above the 16,500 line Tuesday,
the last day of fiscal 1997, after the apparent injection of
public funds into the market.
</P>
<P>
The Nikkei average of 225 selected issues on the First Section
on the Tokyo Stock Exchange rose 264.13 points or 1.62 percent
from Monday's close to 16,527.17.
</P>
<P>
But the benchmark index fell far short of the 18,003.40 mark
hit at the end of the previous fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
The Tokyo Stock Price Index (TOPIX), covering all First Section
issues, added 10.43 points or 0.34 percent to 1,251.70.
</P>
<P>
Volume on the First Section increased to an estimated 650
million shares from Monday's 360 million shares.
</P>
<P>
Nippon Steel was Tuesday's most heavily traded issue.
</P>
<P>
Brisk buying of Nikkei index futures in the last 30 minutes of
trading triggered arbitrage-buying in the cash market, helping the
key index rebound to some extent, traders said.
</P>
<P>
The Nikkei index, however, failed to recover all of Monday's
476.22 point plunge to 16,263.04.
</P>
<P>
Of the 1,327 issues listed on the First Section, losers
outnumbered gainers 678 to 477, with 103 remaining unchanged.

<P>
ABU DHABI, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Qatar has officially dissolved
the Information Ministry in a bid to promote press freedom, the
Qatari News Agency (QNA) reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The move came in a decree issued by Qatari Emir Sheikh Hamad
Bin Khalifa al-Thani on Monday, the QNA said.
</P>
<P>
The decree ordered to transfer the department of foreign
publicity and publication and the government-owned QNA under the
Information Ministry to the Foreign Ministry, according to the QNA.
</P>
<P>
A new body will be set up to take over the department of
culture, art and heritages of the outgoing ministry.
</P>
<P>
Qatar began considering the dissolution of the Information
Ministry in 1996 when the ruler of the Gulf island country had the
idea to free the media of government curbs.
</P>
<P>
The Qatari emir has introduced a number of liberal policies,
including lifting press censorship and allowing newspapers to
criticize cabinet ministers and government policies, since he took
power from his father in a bloodless coup in June 1995.

<HEADLINE> Iraqi Minister Concludes Visits to Oman, UAE </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Iraq's Justice Minister Shabid
al-Maliki left here Tuesday, wrapping up week-long visits to Oman
and the United Arab Emirates (UAE), the UAE's official Wam news
agency reported.
</P>
<P>
During the visits, Shabid met with Oman's Sultan Qaboos Bin
Said and UAE's President Sheikh Zayed Bin Sultan Al-Nahyan and
briefed them the latest developments in Iraq, in particular the
implementation of a deal between Baghdad and the United Nations
(U.N.) on arms inspections, Wam said.
</P>
<P>
The agreement signed late February provided Baghdad must
unconditionally allow U.N. arms inspectors access to all sites
suspected of containing weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
Omani and UAE leaders told Shabid during his visits that
Baghdad should continue complete cooperation with the U.N. to
avert a possible use of force by the United States and Britain,
who keep strong military presence in the region to monitor a test
of the implementation of the U.N.-Iraq deal.
</P>
<P>
The two Gulf countries also pointed out that Baghdad's full
compliance with the U.N. resolutions related on dismantling of
weapons of mass destruction could help step up international
efforts to put an end on the Iraqi people's misery caused by the
U.N. trade sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Tens of thousands of Iraqi children and women have died
of shortage of food and medicine caused by the trade sanctions
imposed by the U.N. since the 1991 Gulf war against Iraq's
invasion of Kuwait.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Israel's Intransigency Leads to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Indicating the depth of the
Israeli-Palestinian peace deadlock, United States peace envoy
Dennis Ross returned home empty-handed Tuesday without
compromising Israel's intransigency on its redeployment in the
West Bank.
</P>
<P>
During his four-day shuttle mission between Israel and the
Palestinian National Authority (PNA), Ross held four meetings
with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and three meetings
with PNA President Yasser Arafat in a bid to find a solution.
</P>
<P>
He also traveled to Egypt to hold talks with Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak to seek his support in breaking the
one-year deadlock in the Israeli-Palestinian peace talks due to
Israeli construction of Jewish settlements.
</P>
<P>
Top on Ross' agenda was to persuade both sides to accept a
new U.S. proposal on Israel's second troop redeployment in the
West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Washington was proposing a 13.1 percent Israeli pullout as a
compromise idea to patch up the sharp difference between the
Israeli and PNA's own plans. Israel is willing to hand over no
more than 10 percent of the West Bank in the second pullout, but
the PNA is demanding for at least 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
However, Ross failed to lay even the groundwork for presenting
the U.S. plan following a series of intensive talks. The
reason: Israel's opposition to any plan calling for more than 10
percent pullout and its stalling over the obscure conception of
"reciprocity."
</P>
<P>
In fact, in his first two meetings with Netanyahu, Ross even
could not discuss the U.S. proposal because the Israeli leader
was only willing to talk about the so-called principle of
"reciprocity." Namely, Israel was demanding the PNA confiscate
illegal weapons, extradite murder suspects and revise the
Palestinian Covenant that calls for extermination of Israel.
</P>
<P>
Many people argue that Israel's demands for security have no
justification for further delaying the second redeployment which
was expected to have been completed last September. Indeed,
observers noted that the security demands have been used
repeatedly by the hardline Israeli government as a ploy to
placate its disgruntled rightwing members.
</P>
<P>
Undoubtedly, Israel's intransigency is largely due to the
inner pressure exerted by the powerful right-wingers within the
Netanyahu-led government. Netanyahu is well aware that he would
be ousted if he dares to alienate any ruling partner because his
government has only one-seat slim majority in the Knesset
(Parliament).
</P>
<P>
And it is obvious that the rightwingers will not hesitate to
rebel against Netanyahu if he succumbs to the U.S. pressure by
accepting the 13.1 percent pullout. The right-wingers have made it
clear that they would accomondate only a 9 percent pullout at the
most.
</P>
<P>
This was demonstrated in the boycott by the influential
National Infrastructure Minister Ariel Sharon of the last
Netanyahu-Ross meeting on Monday following reports that Netanyahu
was considering to accept a 11 percent pullout. Sharon warned at
the Sunday Cabinet meeting that a redeployment of more than 9
percent would endanger Israeli security.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the rightist camp also warned Netanyahu against
making any compromise on the redeployment issue.
</P>
<P>
Leading rightist coalition party, the National Religious Party,
formulated Sunday a list of demands for the Netanyahu-Ross
meeting, saying it would topple the government if Netanyahu
accepts the U.S. plan. The Land of Israel Front formed by 10
rightist lawmakers also threatened to topple Netanyahu if he
makes any compromise.
</P>
<P>
Israel's intransigency aside, the U.S. reluctance to exert
more pressure on Israel was another main reason for the failure
of Ross' mission.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian officials noted that Ross was making refinements to
the U.S. proposal to accommodate Israeli demands, even though the
proposal had already taken into account Israeli security.
</P>
<P>
In the coming days, Ross is to report to U.S. President Bill
Clinton and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright on his shuttle
diplomacy with the Palestinian and Israeli leaders before the
White House decides on the next move.
</P>
<P>
Albright has sent out clear warnings that Washington is losing
patience and the situation could fastly deteriorate unless the
concerned parties take hard decisions to move forward. But only
warning is not enough, and no immediate breakthrough is expected
as long as Washington still refuses to exert more pressure on
Israel.

<HEADLINE> Romanian Interior Minister Named Acting Premier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, March 30 (Xinhua) -- Romanian President Emil
Constantinescu appointed Interior Minister Gavril Dejeu as acting
prime minister Monday night.
</P>
<P>
Constantinescu's decision was made after Prime Minister Victor
Ciorbea resigned from his post.
</P>
<P>
Before there is a new cabinet in two weeks, his team will only
handle routine administrative affairs and stay away from
legislative procedures, Dejeu said after the appointment.
</P>
<P>
Ciorbea announced his resignation earlier in the day in an
televised address to the nation.
</P>
<P>
The pressure for Ciorbea's step-down had been constant from
parties within the ruling coalition, which accused him of
incompetence and laxity in carrying out promised economic reforms.
</P>
<P>
By constitution, his resignation meant the dissolution of the
cabinet. Therefore, President Constantinescu has reportedly begun
consultation with leaders of parliamentary parties on a new
cabinet.

<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, March 31 (Xinhua) -- The losses of the
three-month-long fires in Indonesia's East Kalimantan province
have reached about 3 trillion rupiah (353 million U.S. dollars), a
local government official said.
</P>
<P>
Fires continued to raze forests in the province and envelop
large parts of Kutai National Park and Great Soeharto Hill Forest
Park on Monday, reports reaching here Tuesday quoted a Kutai
regency official Soebianto as saying.
</P>
<P>
Soebianto said the fires, which started in January this year,
had already burned at least 131,000 hectares of East Kalimantan
forests.
</P>
<P>
He said the fires during the first three months of 1998 had
caused as much material damage as the total losses from sporadic
forest fires in the province over the past 15 years.
</P>
<P>
If the value of the wood was calculated with the exchange rate
of 10,000 rupiah to the U.S. dollar, total losses of the
three-month-long fires stood at 10 trillion rupiah (more than one
billion U.S. dollars), he said.
</P>
<P>
The forest fires, he added, have not only affected East
Kalimantan but also neighboring Central Kalimantan, which has been
blanketed in haze from East Kalimantan for the past few days.
</P>
<P>
The haze has affected air transportation to and from Tjilik
Riwut airport, in Palangka Raya, Central Kalimantan, while
motorcyclists have already complained about eye irritations and
headaches.
</P>
<P>
Last year, at least 300,000 hectares of forests was ravaged by
fires in Sumatra and Kalimantan islands in Indonesia. In East
Kalimantan province fires destroyed 37,092 hectares of forest.
</P>
<P>
The disaster sent smog all over Southeast Asia, inflicting more
than 1.3 billion U.S. dollars in smog damage to Indonesia,
Malaysia and Singapore, 90 percent of which was attributed to
short-term health costs.

<HEADLINE> Angola Paving Way for Completing Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, March 31 (Xinhua) -- The warring sides in Angola are
paving way for completing the peace process, an official of the
United Nations observation mission to Angola has said.
</P>
<P>
The government and the opposition National Union for Total
Independence of Angola (UNITA) were "creating all necessary
conditions" for completing the peace process on the scheduled
date, said spokeswoman Laura Melo Monday after a meeting of the
Joint Committee for Peace Process.
</P>
<P>
According to her, eight of the 12 tasks in the new agenda
passed on March 6 by the joint committee have been finished.
</P>
<P>
She said as a major part of the rest, UNITA is scheduled to
move its leadership to the Capital Luanda Tuesday and that its
private radio station will also be turned into an independent
business radio.
</P>
<P>
On April 1, state administration will be re-established by
UNITA in such sensitive areas as Bailundo and Andulo, its former
two headquarters.
</P>
<P>
As to the current political and military situation in Angola,
Laura said that the joint committee expressed its worry over a
flurry of bloodshed caused by violation of the peace accord
across the country and condemned those few people who impede the
peace process.
</P>
<P>
Government spokesman Higino Carneiro said he is satisfied that
UNITA has pledged to complete the outstanding tasks before the
set deadline.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the government also said it will confiscate weapons
from citizens and take action to insure that UNITA move its
headquarters to Luanda on the predetermined date.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Government Endorses New 3-year Deregulation Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, March 31 (Xinhua) -- The Japanese cabinet Tuesday
approved a three-year deregulation plan to revive the country's
ailing economy, specifically 15 industrial sectors.
</P>
<P>
The plan, as described by officials, calls for liberalizing the
airline industry, the retailing of electric power, and allowing
foreign firms to enter Japan's digital broadcasting industry.
</P>
<P>
The plan will be effective from fiscal 1998 starting Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The government hopes the new plan, along with the 16 trillion
yen (about 123.1 billion U.S. dollars) worth of economy-spurring
measures unveiled by the ruling Liberal Democratic Party last
week, will help the ailing economy recover, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, the government will remove a rule restricting
the number of airlines operating on a single route. The
supply-demand balance of each route will not be taken into account
any more, allowing new carriers freely compete with their rivals.
</P>
<P>
The government will also end the monopoly on retail of electric
power by allowing companies which hold power generation facilities
to freely sell electric power.
</P>
<P>
As for broadcasting, the government will consider easing
regulations in fiscal 1998 to give foreign companies chances to
provide digital broadcasting services in the Japanese market using
their own communications satellites.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the plan, Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto told a
government meeting "We need to proceed with the deregulation in
order to comply with the people's demands, even though we know the
process may be painful for the time being."

<HEADLINE> Hainan Ranks Second in Per Capita Overseas Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAIKOU, March 31 (Xinhua) -- The island province of Hainan has
utilized 7.4 billion U.S. dollars of overseas investment since
becoming a province in April of 1988.
</P>
<P>
This ranks the province second in the country in per capita
overseas investment after Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
The province, which is also the country's largest
special economic zone, has also established 8,134 overseas-funded
enterprises during the last 10 years. Investors are from more than
20 countries and regions including the United States, Japan, the
Republic of Korea, Hong Kong and Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
As the investment structure has been constantly rationalized,
tropical high-efficient farming and energy development have become
new focuses for overseas investment. In 1997, 68 percent of the
overseas investment went to the agricultural sector, while the
proportion in real estate development declined.
</P>
<P>
In earlier years, overseas investment mainly was concentrated
in the cities of Haikou and Sanya, but now investors have been
active in 19 cities and counties.
</P>
<P>
And many leading multinational corporations have explored
business opportunities in Hainan.

<HEADLINE> S.Korea's Financial Watchdog to Start Operation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, March 31 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's Financial Supervisory
Commission, a watchdog of overseeing management of financial
institutions and directing reforms of conglomerates will go into
operation from Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The commission composed of three bureaux and five task forces,
has been authorized to approve, supervise, restrict and review the
country's financial institutions except the three state-run banks
-- Export-Import Bank, Korea Development Bank and Industrial Bank.
</P>
<P>
The commission, which consists of officials and experts from
Finance and Economy Ministry, Bank of Korea, Deposit Insurance
Corp., will also serve as top financial policy-maker of the
economic crisis-engulfed country and will reform its financial
structure.
</P>
<P>
Under an agreement signed with the International Monetary Fund
last December for a bailout loan of 57 billion U.S. dollars, South
Korea has to restructure its economy and open its markets this
year.
</P>
<P>
The commission is expected this week to order the top 30
family-owned conglomerates to reduce their debt ratio to 200
percent by the end of this year from current 400 percent.
</P>
<P>
The top 30 conglomerates are blamed for devouring bank loans
and shirking responsibility for producing the ongoing financial
crisis with their high debts build-up and over-expansion.
</P>
<P>
The loans extended by banks to the conglomerates in 1997
accounted for 25.1 percent of the entire credit of 442.59 billion
won (some 5.5 billion U.S. dollars), a surge of 43 percent over
previous year's 77.81 won.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Forest fires in some western and
southern provinces in the Philippines are expected to worsen as
southwest monsoon winds intensify, the Philippine News Agency
reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Firefighters and forest rangers are placed on red alert as
forest fires continue to threaten the remaining forests in five
provinces of northern Luzon and have started to encroach into the
fringes of timberlands of Palawan, the country's last ecological
frontier, and the famous Mt. Apo, the home to the endangered
Philippine eagle.
</P>
<P>
Rosalio Goze, director for operations of the Department of
Environment and Natural Resources, has ordered all fire fighters
to intensify their fire fighting programs, especially in the
drought-stricken areas which are highly vulnerable to forest
fires.
</P>
<P>
The limited number of forest firefighters and the increased
incidence of rest fires due to negligence and bad practices have
posed a serious problem to the government, Goze said.
</P>
<P>
Goze said the cultural practices among indigenous peoples of
using fire as a farm tool has not been fully regulated, thus
increasing the incidence of wild fire occurrences, especially
during a drought episode.
</P>
<P>
A total of 60 forest fires, excluding the wild fire still
raging in the province of Palawan, have already hit the country
since January this year, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The Palawan fire which started last week has so far burned some
2,000 hectares of grasslands contrary to the earlier reports of
burned 15,000 hectares of timberland, it said.

<HEADLINE> More Urban Families See Decline in Income </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 31 (Xinhua) -- China's urbanites have to face a
tougher budget for family finance. Thirty-nine percent of Chinese
families in urban areas experienced a decrease in income last
year, according to the latest data from the State Statistical
Bureau (SSB).
</P>
<P>
The proportion of families in which incomes dropped in 1997 is
3 percent higher than the 1996 figure.
</P>
<P>
The SSB report indicated that the proportion of victims of the
income slump is bigger in low-income groups rather than in
high-income ones. Among the low-income families, which account
for one-fifth of those covered by the bureau's random survey, 60
percent reported an income decline last year. This ratio is 6.3
percent higher than the 1996 figure.
</P>
<P>
However, only 20 percent of the high-income families, who
account for 20 percent of those covered by the survey, reported an
income decrease. This ratio is 3.8 percent less than the 1996
figure.
</P>
<P>
The incomes of urban families started a small-margin increase
since the beginning of this year. The SSB statistics show that
per capita income reached 777.8 yuan (93.71 U.S. dollars) in
families of 35 major Chinese cities in February, representing a
year-on-year increase of 1.2 percent in real terms.

<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, March 31 (Xinhua) -- A tree-planting project launched
in 1995 has turned Tianjin, a north China port city, into a land
of greenery.
</P>
<P>
During the last three years, the city planted 42,400 hectares
of trees and completed 5.37 million square meters of landscaping,
with the greenery coverage rate reaching 21 percent. Per capita
grass land increased by 0.9 square meters, reaching 3.6 square
meters.
</P>
<P>
The city has established a greenbelt surrounding the urban area
and more than 90 scenic spots in nearby suburbs.
</P>
<P>
An agricultural greenbelt has been planted in five major
suburban counties including Jixian, Wuqing, Baodi, Jinghai and
Ninghe. To date, five counties in Tianjin have 106,700 hectares of
shelter forest and commercial forest.
</P>
<P>
Jixian County has turned all 40,000 hectares of its barren
hills green; four of the five counties have achieved greenery
targets set by the state; 80 townships have completed
criss-crossing tree planting and and 1,100 villages are up to the
greenery standard.

<HEADLINE> Elections Defer Formal Talks Between Manila, Muslim </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA March 31 (Xinhua) -- The forthcoming May 11 local and
national election will delay the start of the formal talks between
the Philippine government and rebel Moro Islamic Liberation Front
(MILF).
</P>
<P>
This was the statement made by Catholic Priest Eliseo Mercado,
chairman of the Quick Response Team, a peace body created by the
government and the MILF negotiators to oversee low-level conflicts
between their parties while peace process is ongoing.
</P>
<P>
Speaking over a local radio station Tuesday, Mercado disclosed
some members of the government negotiating panel are busy in their
political campaign and "that's why they could no longer perform
their task."
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports cited that President Fidel Ramos urged the
government and MILF panel to come up with a final peace accord
before the end of his term on June 30.
</P>
<P>
But Mercado described the president's wish as "unrealistic"
citing time constraint.
</P>
<P>
However, Mercado, who is also majority floor leader of Southern
Philippines Council for Peace and Development, hailed the
president's vision on eliminating "disunity" among Filipinos.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, MILF Vice Chairman for Political Affairs
Ghadzali Jaafar, shared the same opinion as that of Mercado.
</P>
<P>
Jaafar said in the first place, they already anticipated the
deferment of the peace process due to the forthcoming political
exercise.
</P>
<P>
However, he said that the MILF could still afford to wait for
the resumption of talks "as peace agreement cannot be done
overnight."
</P>
<P>
The MILF, the biggest Muslim rebel group in the country, has
been engaging in low-level peace talks with the government since
January 1997, but the two sides have not yet reached an agreement
on the start of the formal peace talks.

<HEADLINE> New Vegetation to Attract Migrant Birds Away from New Airport </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Chinese flight safety experts
and ecologists can heave a sigh of relief as a vegetation program
at an islet adjacent to the Pudong International Airport in
Shanghai is near completion.
</P>
<P>
Eleven kilometers east of the airport that is under
construction, Jiuduansha island is now covered by reeds and grass
planted since last year with a view to attracting migrant birds to
stop for a rest. These birds' usual stop is what is now the
international airport.
</P>
<P>
To avoid possible aircraft accidents caused by birds colliding
with flying planes after the new airport is operational at the end
of next year, experts are trying many ways to make migrant birds
change their flight paths as well as places of rest.
</P>
<P>
Workers have eliminated everything that could possibly become
food for birds in and around the airport while driving birds to
the nearby Jiuduansha islet.
</P>
<P>
In addition to planting reeds and grass, workers are also
enlarging the silt coverage on the island which is located at the
mouth of the Yangtze, China's longest river.
</P>
<P>
Each year, large flocks of birds from Australia fly over Pudong
in the western part of Shanghai on their way to and from their
breeding places in Japan, the Korean Peninsula and Siberia. Bird
watchers have found more than 150 kinds of birds among thousands
of taking a break at Pudong.
</P>
<P>
Experts are confident that by the end of next year, Jiuduansha
Island will become an ideal resting place for the migrant
birds.

<HEADLINE> U.S., Thai Officials Cooperate in Solving Traffic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 31 (Xinhua) -- More than 200 U.S. and Thai Auto
Industry Officials Met here Tuesday to find ways of easing
Bangkok's transport problems and planning a future strategy.
</P>
<P>
The conference came after academic findings indicated that
Thailand could boost its slumping economy by easing the traffic
chaos.
</P>
<P>
The officials would work together with technical and industry
policy experts to hammer out recommendations for the Thai
government on how to develop its auto and transport policies.
</P>
<P>
The three-day conference will deal with four major policy
areas, including transport infrastructure, fuels and energy,
vehicle emission and air quality, national automotive strategies
and policies.
</P>
<P>
Ford Motor Company Vice-President John Mctague said it was
important to find out practical solutions to traffic congestion
and the management of energy resources -- issues which are common
stumbling blocks in expanding markets.
</P>
<P>
Ford and another U.S. auto giant, General Motors, are the two
main sponsors of the conference organized by the U.S.-based
Society of Automotive Engineers Incorporation and its Thai
counterpart.
</P>
<P>
Mctague said in a statement that U.S. studies had showed that
traffic congestion -- a feature of sprawling Bangkok -- has a
negative effect on the country's economy.
</P>
<P>
"Thailand could increase its gross domestic product output by
as much as 30 percent by eliminating gridlock," he quoted a study
from Massachusetts Institute of Technology as saying.
</P>
<P>
Both Ford and General motors have production plants in
Thailand. Ford plans to begin producing a new compact pickup truck
in May, while GM is launching a passenger car.
</P>
<P>
Kenneth Baker, GM vice-president for global research and
development, said the conference would help the Thai government
develop strategy and policy guidelines for planning and
implementation of a more efficient transport system to take the
country into the 21rst century.
</P>
<P>
Thailand became a Southeast Asian hub for auto manufacturers
during the booming 1980s, but the economic slump which began to
hit the country last year has left thousands unemployed.
</P>
<P>
Decreased consumer spending power at home and shrinking export
markets have hit the industry hard with most producers slashing
production and almost abandoning the local market.

<HEADLINE> Minesweeping Operation on Sino-Vietnam Border Goes Smoothly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Chinese troops in the Guangxi
Zhuang Autonomous Region have cleared mines from three million
square meters of land in an operation that began Nov. 28 along the
Sino-Vietnamese border.
</P>
<P>
Qiu Daxiong, deputy commander of the Guangxi Military Area
Command, said the minesweeping operation, the second since the
early 1990s when China and Vietnam restored relations, has removed
or exploded 21,260 mines of more than 20 types in four months.
</P>
<P>
The official said the first-phase work includes the clearing of
44 mine zones on nearly 7.78 million square meters of ground by
this May.
</P>
<P>
More than 500 engineers are engaged in the minesweeping
operation.
</P>
<P>
The second minesweeping operation is expected to clear 120
zones on nearly 20 million square meters of ground within three
years.
</P>
<P>
China's minesweeping operation has helped open 25 border trade
areas and mine ports of entry for trade between the two
countries.

<HEADLINE> Strawberry Hometown Supplies Market During All Seasons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANTAI, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Mouth-watering Longkou
strawberries can now be bought year-round in fruit markets as far
north as China's Heilongjiang Province and as far south as
Guangdong Province,
</P>
<P>
Longkou, a small village in east China's Shandong Province,
was named "Strawberry Hometown" by the Ministry of Agriculture
last year, when it harvested 36 million kilograms of strawberries.
</P>
<P>
The village has a decade-long strawberry-growing history, but
only in recent years it introduced new strains and planting
technology from Japan to engage in large-scale production.
</P>
<P>
Now, 90 percent of the village people are specialized
strawberry growers whose greenhouses cover 800 hectares of
land. They earned 100 million yuan last year from growing
strawberries.
</P>
<P>
The Longkou strawberry has gained in popularity because of its
sweet taste and plump flesh, longer preservation period and
brilliant red color. Each Longkou strawberry weights more than 100
grams.
</P>
<P>
Apart from occupying domestic markets, the Longkou strawberry
is also sold overseas to such countries as Japan and the Republic
of Korea.

<HEADLINE> Tian'anmen Rostrum to Be Repaired </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Concerned departments in Beijing
have started preparations for repairing the 300-year-old
Tian'anmen Rostrum and plan to complete the project before the
50th anniversary of the founding of new China on Oct. 1, 1999.
</P>
<P>
Overall examination and evaluation of the Tian'anmen Rostrum
and nearby buildings are going on smoothly, according to today's
Beijing Youth Daily.
</P>
<P>
Tian'anmen (the gate of heavenly peace) was first built in 1417
during the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644) and was originally named
Chengtianmen. It was destroyed twice by fire and was rebuilt in
1651 during the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911) and renamed Tian'anmen.
</P>
<P>
After the founding of the new China in 1949, Tian'anmen became
its symbol. The State Council made Tian'anmen a site under state
special protection in 1961. In 1988, the rostrum of Tian'anmen
opened to visitors.
</P>
<P>
The special structure of ancient Chinese buildings, mostly
built of brick and wood, has made the repair of Tian'anmen a
long-term task.
</P>
<P>
Examinations have disclosed that some of the wooden pillars
split open because of the arid climate and some were rotten, in
addition to water seepage at the roots of some golden pillars.
</P>
<P>
Experts also pointed out that electric equipment used there is
also out-of-date and needs to be replaced.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing Youth Daily reported that there were 17 registered
repairs of the Tian'anmen Rostrum between 1971 and 1997.

CANBERRA, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Mark Philippoussis has
threatened not to play for Australia in the Davis Cup until team
captain John Newcombe makes a public apology to him, local reports
said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Philippoussis accused Newcombe and Australia Davis Cup coach

</P>
<P>
Philippoussis, 21, was unavailable for Australia's World Group

<P>
In his stand, Newcombe said he had nothing to apologise for,
saying that "you can only apologise if you've got something to
apologise for."
</P>
<P>
When Philippoussis was absent from the tie against Zimbabwe,
Australia could miss its number one singles player Pat Rafter, who
is struggling to overcome a virus.

<HEADLINE> China Tightens Reins on Subterranean Water Tapping </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 31 (Xinhua) -- East China's Shangdong and
Jiangsu provinces have begun efforts to prohibit the overuse of
subterranean water when groundwater abuse is prevalent nationwide.
</P>
<P>
Today's Guangming Daily quoted statistics from the Ministry of
Water Resources showing that China has used more than 90 billion
cubic meters of subterranean water, while the total resources are
290 billion cubic meters.
</P>
<P>
Groundwater extraction provides 17 percent of the country's
total water supply, with 12.66 million hectares of farmland and 35
percent of industrial and urban water supplies dependent on
subterranean sources.
</P>
<P>
The most serious problem is in the dry northern parts of the
country, where 17 provinces and autonomous regions use 88 percent
of the groundwater extraction. In this area, half of the water
supply for industrial production comes from subterranean sources.
</P>
<P>
Random overtapping has caused drastic drops in groundwater
levels and funnel-like zones, resulting in abandoned motor-pumped
wells, salt seawater penetration, land desertification, and
surface sinking.
</P>
<P>
A survey conducted in the coastal areas of Liaoning, Hebei and
Shangdong provinces indicate that an area of 1,433 square
kilometers has been affected by saltwater intrusion, which has
made more than 200 million cubic meters of local groundwater
resources useless, and made it difficult for more than a million
people and 400,000 head of livestock to find drinking water.

<HEADLINE> January Light-Industry Exports Hit New High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 31 (Xinhua) -- China exported 3.892 billion
U.S. dollars in light-industry products in January, up 10.31
percent from the same period last year, according to customs
statistics.
</P>
<P>
Of the total, 21.2 percent are products processed from imported
materials with a value of 825 million U.S. dollars, a decrease of
2.84 percent over last January.
</P>
<P>
Exports of light industry, machinery and electronics products
reached 1.054 billion U.S. dollars, a year-on-year increase of
12.5 percent. In this category, all exports made substantial gains
in January except machinery for daily use, lighting equipment, and
machinery for light industry.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the 14 major export-oriented
light-industry products earned 2.576 billion U.S. dollars in the
first month of this year, 8.47 percent more than 1997. Hardware,
electrical appliances and plastic products grew rapidly.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics released by the State Statistics
Bureau, the industrial production value of light industry in
January reached 172 billion yuan based on 1990 prices, an increase

</P>
<P>
Statistics show that, the production of five out of 25 major
light-industry products increased. The five were vacuum cleaners,
dairy products, machine-made paperboard, beer and machine-made
paper.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi Export Earnings Fall in February </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh earned 326.60 million
U.S. dollars from export in February this year, a decrease of
about 20 percent from 408.68 million dollars in January, press
reports said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The figure, however, demonstrates a rise of 17.5 percent over
export earnings in February last year, the reports said, quoting
the latest statistics from the Export Promotion Bureau.
</P>
<P>
The country's export earnings during the first eight months of
the current fiscal year (July 1997-June 1998) were recorded at
3.33 billion dollars, slightly short of the targeted 3.34 billion
dollars. Bangladesh has set its export target for the current
fiscal year at 5.02 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Some analysts said the devaluation of currencies in some
Southeast and East Asian countries, which export similar items as
Bangladesh does, may be partly responsible for the fall in
Bangladesh' export in February.
</P>
<P>
The European Union (EU), the largest importer of Bangladesh
products, has relocated its import sources from Bangladesh to some
East European countries, such as Romania and Poland. This has
affected the nation's export, they said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the effect of EU's ban for half a year on
Bangladeshi frozen food, which ended earlier this year, would
linger for some time, according to the analysts. The country's
export earnings from frozen food fell to about 8 million dollars
in February as against the average monthly earnings of some 27
million dollars before the ban was imposed in July.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Signs Bill to Lease Kazakh Military Testing Sites </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 30 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
has agreed to lease four military testing sites based in
Kazakhstan, the Itar-TASS news agency reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The sights include the 929 National Flight Testing Center, the
4th National Testing Site, Imba Testing Site and Sarei-Shagan
Testing Site.
</P>
<P>
Russia will pay an annual rent of 27.5 million U.S. dollars for
leasing these sites. It will pay an additional separate annual
rent of 115 million U.S. for leasing the Baikonur Cosmodrome, one
of the largest launching and testing sites of the former Soviet
Union based in southwestern Kazakhstan.
</P>
<P>
Sarei-Shagan Testing Site is designed to test missile defense
systems. Russia does not possess similar testing sites.
</P>
<P>
Imba Testing Site is designed to test air-defense missile
systems.
</P>
<P>
The agreements on leasing the testing sites were signed by the
Russian and Kazakh governments on January 20, 1995. Because they
were not approved, Russia did not pay the rent.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Government Approves New National Development Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto's cabinet endorsed a new national land plan Tuesday
aimed at easing the concentration of population and industries in
Tokyo and Osaka, Kyodo News Service reported.
</P>
<P>
The government will start formulating guidelines to promote
strategies under the "grand national design for the 21st century
plan," which will be launched this year with completion dates for
its various phases ranging from 2010 to 2015, the Japanese news
agency quoted government officials as saying.
</P>
<P>
The plan, the fifth of its kind, proposes establishing multiple
axes of development in four regions -- "northeast," "the Sea of
Japan coast," "the Pacific coast" and "western Japan" -- in a bid
to diffuse the country's population and industries now lining a
narrow corridor running from Tokyo to Osaka.
</P>
<P>
It also calls for the creation of a "regional cooperation axis"
system, under which several municipal governments would share
administrative functions beyond their present jurisdictions.
</P>
<P>
The plan includes six projects to build highways and bridges
over bays and straits across the country, while calling for
studies on the technology development and cost-efficiency aspects
of the projects.

<HEADLINE> Round-up: Chinese Premier's Visit to Strengthen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 30 (Xinhua) -- Britain is hoping to establish a
basis for its relationship with China next century during the
forthcoming visit by China's new Premier Zhu Rongji.
</P>
<P>
British Minister of State of Foreign Affairs Derek Fatchett
told Xinhua that his government was looking forward to Zhu's
official visit from Tuesday to Thursday, his first trip abroad as
premier.
</P>
<P>
The visit by the new Chinese premier, who was appointed earlier
this month, has aroused great interest in various circles in
Britain.
</P>
<P>
Fatchett said that the visit "is bound to further promote our
relations".
</P>
<P>
John Beyer, director of the China-Britain Trade Group, said
Zhu's visit was of "great importance."
</P>
<P>
"He (Zhu) enjoys a high reputation of handling economic problems
with his abilities of clarity and decisiveness among British
economic circles. His visit will undoubtedly further develop the
relations between our two countries, so as to strengthen our
people's confidence in doing business in China," said Beyer.
</P>
<P>
Experts on Sino-British relations have expressed the belief
that Zhu's visit will play an important role in establishing and
developing Sino-British relations into the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
According to Fatchett, relations between the two countries have
been going smoothly since China resumed the exercising of
sovereignty over Hong Kong last July.
</P>
<P>
British Prime Minister Tony Blair has repeatedly expressed the
hope that Hong Kong should become a "bridge" between Britain and
China after its handover.
</P>
<P>
Margaret Becket, chairman of the Board of Trade, said during
her visit to China last January that "the British government very
much hopes to create a new kind of relationship with China".
</P>
<P>
In its bid to cement relations with China, the British
government has been taking a series of positive measures,
including repudiating its support for the human rights motion
against China at the United Nations' annual human rights
conference in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
London has also increased visits to China by its high-ranking
officials and put special emphasis on economic and trade
cooperation with China.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Secretary Robin Cook visited China in January while
Prime Minister Blair and Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott are
scheduled to do so later this year.
</P>
<P>
The improvement in bilateral relations has lead to an
inevitable impact on their cooperation in international affairs.
</P>
<P>
"The cooperation between our two countries on global affairs
such as the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and environmental
protection has reached a new level. Being permanent members of the
U.N. Security Council, Britain and China should strengthen their
cooperation, so as to play an even more important role in the U.N.,"
Fatchett said at a recent seminar.
</P>
<P>
The improvement of Sino-British political relations has
provided favorable conditions for developing economic and trade
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The bilateral trade volume reached 5.8 billion U.S. dollars in
1997. Britain is now the largest investor in China among the
European Union countries. It has set up more than 1,800 joint
ventures in China with a total value of 12 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
"Those who have visited China were all deeply impressed with
its economic dynamics and the ambition shown by its government and
people," Becket told British businessmen at a gathering after her
visit to China.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji left
here today on an official visit to Britain from March 31 to April
2 at the invitation of British Prime Minister Tony Blair.
</P>
<P>
The premier is also scheduled to attend the second Asia-Europe
Meeting (AEM), which will be held from April 3 to 4 in London, and
take part in the first China-EU Summit during his stay in Britain.
</P>
<P>
Then, Zhu will pay an official visit to France from April 5 to
7 at the invitation of French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin.
</P>
<P>
Zhu's entourage includes his wife Lao An, Chinese Foreign
Minister Tang Jiaxuan and Minister Shi Guangsheng of Foreign Trade
and Economic Cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Among those seeing the premier off at the Great Hall of the
People were Chinese vice-premiers Li Lanqing, Qian Qichen, Wu
Bangguo and Wen Jiabao, vice-chairperson Peng Peiyun of the
Chinese National People's Congress Standing Committee, and
State-Councillor and Secretary-General of the State Council Wang
Zhongyu.
</P>
<P>
Local observers point out that China-EU relations have made
noteworthy progress in recent years.
</P>
<P>
In January this year, the EU proposed holding the first
China-EU Summit during the Second AEM and called for establishing
a regular meeting system thereafter.
</P>
<P>
The February EU Foreign Ministers Meeting ended with a decision
that the presidency and member countries would refrain from
tabling or cosponsoring a draft resolution against China in the
next session of the U.N. Commission on Human Rights.
</P>
<P>
The latest development centered on the EU's March 25 adoption
of a new policy document entitled "Build a Comprehensive
Partnership with China".
</P>
<P>
The EU's wise decisions concerning China have been welcomed and
greatly appreciated.
</P>
<P>
Premier Zhu's current European trip is expected to add impetus
to a long-term, stable and mutually beneficial Sino-European
relationship well into the 21st century.

worsening condition in the disruptions of public order and other
criminal cases, official statistics revealed.
</P>
<P>
The country registered 41,700 criminal cases during the first
month of this year, an increase of 32 percent compared with the
same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Hungarian Central Statistics bureau announced Monday that in
one year ending in January, economic criminal cases in the country

The west states of Fejer, Gyor-Moson-Sopron and Vas, and the
north state of Heves are areas in which criminal cases occur with

<HEADLINE> Clinton Criticizes Republicans on Campaign Finance Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 30 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
criticized Republican leaders in the House of Representatives
Monday for setting up a system viewed as guaranteeing the defeat
of campaign finance legislation.
</P>
<P>
In a written statement from Africa, where Clinton is on a tour,
he rejected the only reform alternative allowed by House
Republican leaders and said the Republican leaders appeared
"determined to thwart serious reform."
</P>
<P>
Clinton reiterated his support for a bipartisan bill proposed
by Representative Christopher Shays, a Republican, and
Representative Martin Meehan, a Democrat, the provisions of which
include banning unlimited and unregulated contributions to
political parties known as "soft money."
</P>
<P>
Despite a majority of House members supporting the bill, House
Republican opponents succeeded in crafting rules for floor action
that would sharply limit debate and require a two-thirds vote for
passage.
</P>
<P>
The House Republican leaders then put forward alternatives with
provisions that include limiting political activity by labor
unions and taking steps to crack down on the participation in
elections by non-citizens.
</P>
<P>
Clinton called such provisions "harshly partisan and plainly
unacceptable."
</P>
<P>
Clinton described the Shays-Meehan bill as "the best chance in
years to reduce the role of special interests, give voters a
louder voice and treat fairly incumbents and challengers of both
parties."
</P>
<P>
The president said, "this measure has the support of a majority
of the Senate, and I believe that if it were allowed to come for a
vote, it would have the support of a majority of the House as
well."

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka Launches Credit Scheme For Small, Medium </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, March 31 (Xinhua) -- The Sri Lankan government has
launched a new credit scheme for small and medium enterprises
(SMEs), according to an official news release Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The National Development Bank, with assistance from the Asian
Development Bank, will invest 3,410 million Rupees (55.9 million
U.S. dollars) in the project.
</P>
<P>
The Central Bank will provide credit guarantees worth 2,360
million Rupees (38.69 million dollars) to the participating credit
institutions as additional collateral for loans granted.
</P>
<P>
The release said the objective of the Central Bank's credit
guarantee scheme is to help small scale entrepreneurs, including
self-employed persons who could not raise loans from the banking
sector because of their inability to offer additional collateral
to support their loan applications other than project assets.
</P>
<P>
About 4,000 SMEs in Sri Lanka are expected to benefit from the
scheme.
</P>
<P>
Seven commercial banks, three regional banks and three
development banks in the country are participating in the project.
The loans, which are long term loans, are repayable within two to
ten years with a grace period from three months to two years
depending on the purpose of the loan, the release added.

<HEADLINE> Money Counterfeiting Shop Uncovered in Poland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WARSAW, March 30 (Xinhua) -- Polish police uncovered an
underground shop recently which had been engaged in forging coins
of zloty, the polish currency, for years, the Polish Press Agency
reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The illegal shop turned out millions of coins with the face
value of five zlotys (1.5 U.S. dollars), the agency said.
</P>
<P>
According to police sources, 1 in every 50 of the five-zloty
coins in circulation in Poland is a bogus one forged by the
factory. It is believed to be one of the biggest counterfeiting
shops ever found in the country.
</P>
<P>
Some Ukrainians are also involved in the counterfeiting, police
said. They are suspected of having provided special machinery and
equipment to the shop based in Wolka Podlacka in the southeastern
province of Rzeszow.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that 10 million five-zloty coins may have been
sent to Ukraine.

<HEADLINE> Thai Police Gets Tough on Drunk Driving </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Thai police vowed to take tough
action against drunk driving, particularly during the Songkran
Festival on April 13-15, the Bangkok Post said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Motorists found to have more than 50 milligrams of alcohol per
liter of blood would be punished, the police said.
</P>
<P>
That means two cans or small bottles of beer, or two glasses of
wine could lead a driver to jail.
</P>
<P>
Checkpoints would be set up on all main highways for random
tests using breathalysers, a senior police officer said.
</P>
<P>
Under the Land Transport Department's 1994 regulation against
drunk driving, which had been ignored until recently, offenders
are liable to a fine of 2,000-10,000 baht (52-263 U.S. dollars)
and/or a jail term of not more than three months.
</P>
<P>
The senior police officer said that from October 15 last year,
when the police started to enforce the law strictly, until
February this year, legal action had been taken against 128 drunk
drivers in Bangkok.
</P>
<P>
Without serious action, the country's losses due to road
accidents, most of which are caused by high alcohol consumption,
could reach 300 billion baht (7.9 billion dollars) per year
compared to the current estimate of 106 billion baht (2.8 billion
dollars) annually, the Public Health Ministry said.

<HEADLINE> Romanian President Accepts Premier Resignation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, March 30 (Xinhua) -- Romanian President Emil
Constantinescu accepted Prime Minister Victor Ciorbea's
resignation Monday, but asked him to stay in office until the
nomination of his replacement Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, Ciorbea yielded to pressure and announced
his resignation in an televised address to the nation.
</P>
<P>
Ciorbea has been under constant pressure to resign from most
parties within the ruling coalition, with many accusing him of
incompetence and laxity in carrying out promised economic reforms.
</P>
<P>
The Romanian government was plunged into crisis earlier this
year in a clash between the two major parties in the governing
coalition, the Democratic Party and Ciorbea's National Peasant
Party.
</P>
<P>
The Democratic Party withdrew from the coalition in January and
asked Ciorbea and his government to step down by the end of March,
but the National Peasant Party refused.
</P>
<P>
The crisis dragged on for months, causing havoc to the
country's political life, economy and social order and triggering
disturbances in various areas.
</P>
<P>
Ciorbea's popularity as prime minister of the country has
dropped sharply in the face of growing calls from both within and
outside the parliament to quit office.
</P>
<P>
Ciorbea was elected mayor of the capital, Bucharest, in 1996,
before taking over as premier in November of the same year.

<HEADLINE> Ups and Downs of China's "King of Roasted Seeds" (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HEFEI, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Nian Guangjiu, in his 60s, has
never been as busy as he is now. Since the second half of last
year, he and his assistants have shuttled between China's large-
and medium-size cities to sell his "Shazi" (idiot) brand roasted
seeds.
</P>
<P>
In less than six months he has set up 96 shops across
China. Nian has become China's "king of roasted seeds" again.
</P>
<P>
"It's the prime time for private business," said Nian. "I have
to catch my last opportunity."
</P>
<P>
Nian was called "Shazi" (idiot) for his simple, honest face. A
recent documentary by Zhejiang TV Station cited his ups and downs
as an unique barometer of China's private economy.
</P>
<P>
In the late 1970s Nian, then a common street peddler with fine
seed-roasting skill, set up a firm to challenge the state
roasted-seed producers.
</P>
<P>
Soon, Nian's "Shazi" brand took over a big share of the market
because of the delicious taste and low price. Nian became one of
the first millionaires in China. Wuhu, Nian's hometown in east
China's Anhui Province, also became known to nearly every Chinese
as the "hometown of roasted seeds."
</P>
<P>
During the first stage of China's reform and opening-up
process, the private economy was considered only as a useful
supplement to the public sector.
</P>
<P>
Some people, still clinging to the dream of all "eating from
the big rice pot," were jealous of Nian. On his part, Nian found
it difficult to move forward. In the last 10 years, Nian was fined
several times. He said his unsatisfying experience resulted from
his poor management abilities and the overall environment which
had a bias against the private economy.

<TEXT>
<P>
But things have changed. In due time, the Chinese government
has attached bigger importance to the private sector implementing
a policy of "encouraging and guiding the development of private
and self-employed businesses."
</P>
<P>
China now has 960,000 private firms employing 13.5 million
laborers with an annual output of 390 billion yuan. In some
coastal provinces with higher economic growth rates, the private
economy contributes more than 10 percent to the local GDP (gross
domestic product).
</P>
<P>
In 1995, after 10 years of silence and learning, Nian decided
to stage a comeback. To his satisfaction and surprise, his "Shazi"
roasted seeds still attracted lots of consumers.
</P>
<P>
Rather than continuing his former family management style, Nian
set up the Shazi Seeds Co. Ltd and got support from
shareholders. He also established a national marketing network and
developed 20 new varieties of roasted seeds. He even exported 17
tons of roasted seeds to the United States.
</P>
<P>
A production line with an investment of 30 million yuan is also
under construction.
</P>
<P>
More important, Nian employed lawyers and specialists. In the
past, Nian only wrote down his name on contracts, paying no
attention to the terms. But now, he signs contracts only after
consulting with his lawyers.
</P>
<P>
"He (Nian) has improved greatly with regards to both management
and education standards," said Yu Qing, Nian's consultant. "It's
not easy for a 60-year-old man."
</P>
<P>
Yu said that with improvement in the overall environment and
better management, Nian is able to do more.

BEIJING, March 31 (Xinhua) -- The Civil Aviation Administration
of China will adopt a new air route control measure for its two
airlines starting at midnight today to reduce flight delays,
according to today's Wenhui Bao.
</P>
<P>
Management through radar will replace former program control
over airlines from Beijing to Shanghai and from Shanghai to
Guangzhou in south China's Guangdong Province.
</P>
<P>
The new measure will shorten the spacing between two planes to
75 kilometers, or about five minutes, which is equal to doubling
the air route. It also helped raise the utilization and turnover
rates of civil planes.

TAIYUAN, March 31 (Xinhua) -- China has tightened its
management of state-monopolized tobacco marketing by intensifying
its law-enforcement efforts in 1997.
</P>
<P>
It dealt with 34,000 cases involving the use of fake trademarks
for 470,000 cartons of cigarettes, and discovered 37,000 tobacco

operations for making illegal cigarettes, and confiscated 2,405
cigarette-making machines in addition to raw material and
accessories.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, which was convened for the purpose of setting

<HEADLINE> OPEC Agrees to Cut Production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, March 31 (Xinhua) -- OPEC oil ministers agreed Tuesday
to cut production by 1.245 million barrels a day from in a bid to
lower global supplies and stabilise falling prices.
</P>
<P>
The output cuts, the first in years, will take effect
Wednesday, said a statement issued at the end of a six-hour
meeting at Vienna-based headquarters of the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries.
</P>
<P>
"Reflecting their serious desire to stabilize the market in the
interests of all oil producers, OPEC member countries have agreed
to voluntarily cut" production until the end of 1998, the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
Iraq is the sole member of OPEC exempt from the production cuts
accord due to its "exceptional" circumstances, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The cuts will be on the basis of February output by members,
rather than on the official quota levels, it added.
</P>
<P>
A total of 15 OPEC and non-OPEC countries have announced plans
in the past week to cut output by a total 1.5 million barrels a
day to try to stabilize oil prices.
</P>
<P>
Prices have plunged by up to 40 percent after OPEC agreed at a
meeting in Jakarta in late November to raise the ceiling
production by 10 percent to 27.5 million barrels a day.
</P>
<P>
The slump was also caused by weak demand in Asian countries, a
mild northern hemisphere winter and increased Iraqi exports.
</P>
<P>
The OPEC group consists of Algeria, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq,
Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab
Emirates and Venezuela.

<HEADLINE> China's Per Capita Vegetable Availability Outstrips World Average </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 31 (Xinhua) -- The availability of vegetables
per person in present-day China is 250 kilograms (kg), exceeding
the world average, according to information from the Ministry of
Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
Business at the vegetable markets in Beijing is just as brisk
as that in southern Chinese cities with a great variety ranging
from fresh tomatoes and cucumbers to green hyacinth beans.
</P>
<P>
Vegetables had been in short supply in some Chinese cities
because of temperature changes in a vast area which ranges from
temperate and subtropical zones to tropical zones. A decade ago
radishes, Chinese cabbage and potatoes dominated meals in the
homes of China's northern urbanites during the winter.
</P>
<P>
The central government launched a program across China in 1988
to improve and increase the supply of non-staple food in the
country's urban areas.
</P>
<P>
During the last decade, the state allocated 3.03 billion yuan
for the construction of vegetable markets. Up to now, five major
open-market centers have been built in eastern and southern
Chinese areas for growing vegetables to supply northern Chinese
areas when fresh vegetables become scarce in winter.
</P>
<P>
More farmers in north China also have turned to greenhouses to
grow vegetables in the winter to supply urban markets.
</P>
<P>
The vegetable-growing area in China amounts to 740,000
hectares, and the total vegetable output was 313 million tons last
year. That represents an increase of 90.4 percent in growing area
and 102.4 percent rise in output, according to comparable figures
in 1988.
</P>
<P>
The vegetable market in China has a plentiful supply with a
great variety. Statistics show that about 50 kinds of vegetables
are being traded on the market in many major Chinese cities each
day. For medium- and small-size cities, the number is 30.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Equity Inflow to Philippines Surges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Foreign equity inflows into the
Philippines grew by 23.85 percent to 11.4 billion pesos (308
million U.S. dollars) during the first two months of 1998, from
9.2 billion pesos (249 million dollars) recorded for the same
period last year.
</P>
<P>
The increased foreign equity inflows further boosted
investments registered with the Philippine Board of Investments
and the total amount of investments surged by an impressive 65
percent to 79.09 billion pesos (2.1 billion dollars) during the
same period from its year-ago level of 47.88 billion pesos (1.3
billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
The data from the board said on Tuesday that the increase in
foreign equity inflows were partly due to the appreciation of the
peso against the dollar, which reached as high as 46 pesos to one
dollar but has now scaled down to 37 pesos.
</P>
<P>
Records showed that energy-related projects topped the list of
major investments, accounting for 37.21 billion pesos (1 billion
dollars) of the total volume registered.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong emerged as the top foreign investor in the
Philippines during the period with 6.42 billion pesos (174 million
dollars) in equity infusion, followed by Japan with 2 billion
pesos (54 million dollars) and Virgin islands with 1.9 billion
pesos (51 million dollars).

<HEADLINE> More Stone Age Relics Discovered in Central China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Chinese archeologists have
discovered three sites of Stone Age relics in Yunxian County in
central China's Hubei Province. Pieces of picks, axes and
stone-sharpening tools were unearthed.
</P>
<P>
The find increases the evidence that the Hanjiang River Valley
is one of the major birthplaces of Chinese civilization.
</P>
<P>
The 1,500 kilometer Hanjiang River is the longest tributary of
the Yangtze River, China's longest.
</P>
<P>
Yang Honglin, associate professor from Hubei Province's Yunyang
Normal School, pointed out that the middle and upper reaches of
the Hanjiang River, with a great number of archeological
discoveries, can be called an "early man corridor" where people
lived 200,000-to-1.5 million years ago.
</P>
<P>
Yang said Chinese archeologists have discovered a series of
cultural relics in the Hanjiang River Valley since the
mid-1970s. These discoveries include: four fossilized teeth of
early men dating 800,000-to-one million years ago, in addition to
stone tools and more than 20 kinds of fossilized animals; seven
teeth of early men dating 400,000 years ago; and fossilized living
beings and stone tools.
</P>
<P>
Yang said the most important discovery was in 1989 and 1990
when fossilized head bones were unearthed in Yunxian County, in
addition to 44 stone tools and 10 species of fossilized animals.
</P>
<P>
Rice, tools made of stone and bone, and daily life utensils
dating 5,000-to-7,000 years ago have also been unearthed in the
region in recent years.

capital of central China's Hunan Province.
</P>
<P>
The curved stone picture is made of a computer-controlled

"Riverside Scenes on Qingming Festival," a well-known Chinese
painting made in the Song Dynasty (960 to 1279 A.D.).
</P>
<P>
The picture is believed to be a representative work of
introduction of Chinese custom.
</P>
<P>
The picture shows crowds of people, a prosperous ancient
capital, running carts on streets, and boats on rivers.
</P>
<P>
With the computer-controlled machine developed by Changsha
Liming Computer Research Institute, the stone picture was
completed in several months.
</P>

<P>
BEIJING, March 31 (Xinhua) -- The "Vegetable Basket Project,"
launched by the Chinese government in 1988 has produced bountiful
results, according to statistics provided by the Ministry of
Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
China's annual output of vegetables now exceeds 250 billion
yuan (30.01 billion U.S. dollars), second only to that of grain
and higher than forestry and fishery.
</P>
<P>
The acreage cultivated for vegetables in China reached 740,000
hectares in 1997, with output at 313 million kilograms (kg). The
per capita output stood at 250 kg, higher than the world's average.
</P>
<P>
During the past decade, China set up a group of vegetable
seed-breeding centers and seedling bases in addition to five
commodity vegetable centers in south China's Hainan Province, the
Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region and the eastern Chinese provinces
of Jiangsu and Anhui.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that in major Chinese cities such as Beijing,
Shanghai and Tianjin, more than 50 kinds of vegetables are sold
every day, and in medium- and small-size cities, the number
exceeds 30.
</P>
<P>
Planting vegetables has become an effective way for farmers to
escape poverty. The number of counties with 6,000 hectares planted
in vegetables exceeds 500, three times the figure a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
In northeast China's Liaoning Province, the average annual
income for 1 million rural families engaged in the cultivation of
vegetables has surpassed 5,600 yuan (674.6 U.S. dollars).

UNITED NATIONS -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan hoped that
the return to homeland of Cambodian Prince Norodom Ranariddh will
assist in the holding of free and fair elections in the country.
</P>
<P>
"The Secretary-General welcomes the return of Prince Norodom
Ranariddh on March 30 after an absence of nearly nine months,"
Annan said in a statement issued here by his spokesman on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The event is a result of efforts led by the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and supported by the United
Nations to help Cambodia find a satisfactory solution to its
political crisis, Annan said.
</P>
<P>
While Ranariddh's return "is a significant step forward, much
work still remains to be done to ensure that the elections fully
do justice both to the terms of the Paris Agreement and to the
gains of Cambodia during UN Transitional Authority in Cambodia
(UNTAC) and since," Annan added. (UN-Cambodia)

WASHINGTON -- The United States on Monday expressed its
disappointment over failure of a mission by its special envoy
Dennis Ross for reviving the deadlocked peace process in the
Middle East.
</P>
<P>
"We have been unable to bridge the gaps on the hard questions,"
State Department spokesman James Robin told reporters. He said
the peace process "is in dire straits."
</P>
<P>
Ross has asked Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to
back Washington's proposal that Israel withdraw from 13 percent of
the West Bank in several stages within 12 weeks with each stage
accompanied by Palestinian security gestures.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli leader, however, said he did not expect a
last-minute breakthrough. He said only Israel will decide its
security needs and from that the scope of a long-delayed pullback.

<HEADLINE> Barkley Fined for Abusing Referee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 30 (Xinhua) -- Houston Rockets forward
Charles Barkley was fined 10,000 U.S. dollars on Monday for
abusing a referee following his ejection from Friday's 100-75 loss
to the Orlando Magic.
</P>
<P>
After a technical foul in the second quarter, Barkley was
ejected by referee Jack Nies for refusing to hand in the ball in
the fourth quarter. Barkley said he was unjustly ejected.
</P>
<P>
"I would like to say one thing about Jack Nies, I think he's a
gutless offical who holds grudges," Barkley said after the game.
</P>
<P>
Barkley was arrested in Orlando last time when the Rockets
visited in October for allegedly tossing a bar patron through a
plate-glass window.
</P>
<P>
The ejection was the sixth of the season for Barkley.
</P>
<P>
Barkley was averaging 15.7 points and was fourth in the league
in rebounding with 11.8 per game this season, his 14th in the
NBA.

<HEADLINE> China's Volcanic Hot Springs Attract Tourists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Tengchong County in southwest
China's Yunnan Province has been making a promising tourist
industry out of its volcanic hot springs.
</P>
<P>
The county, bordering Myanmar, has preserved some extinct
volcanos of the Cenozoic Era. As a result, it now has more than 80
steam and hot springs, 11 with temperatures as high as 90 degrees
Celsius, higher than the local water boiling point.
</P>
<P>
Of all the springs, the nine-square-kilometer "hot sea" is the
best-known. It has countless holes, gushing steam and hot water.
</P>
<P>
Another one is the "big boiling pot" spring, with a diameter of
6.12 meters and a stable temperature of 96-to-97 degrees
Celsius. A head of cattle reportedly fell into the spring and
cooked in about 10 minutes. Local women boil eggs atop on steam
holes and sell them to tourists.
</P>
<P>
The county has received nearly 500,000 visitors over the past
five years. And local hospitals also use the hot springs to treat
certain diseases.

<HEADLINE> Minnesota Tornadoes Destroy 635 Homes, Kill One </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 30 (Xinhua) -- Rare March tornadoes have
destroyed an estimated 635 homes in southern Minnesota of the
United States, killing a 6-year-old boy and injuring at least 38
people.
</P>
<P>
Over two hours Sunday, the tornadoes cut a swath of destruction
through nine communities, pulverizing much of St. Peter and
Comfrey, The Associated Press reported today.
</P>
<P>
Governor Arne Carlson cut short a trip to Washington so he
could tour the damaged areas, and sent National Guard troops to
help.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Emergency Management Agency made available some of
the trailer houses used last year to house victims of disastrous
flooding along the Minnesota-North Dakota state line.
</P>
<P>
St. Peter, a town of 10,000 residents, was hardest hit Sunday.
State officials said more than 500 homes were destroyed and 1,700
others were damaged.
</P>
<P>
People who were able shoveled glass and other debris into the
streets Monday and plows and front-end loaders deposited the
wreckage in state trucks.
</P>
<P>
Gustavus Adolphus College, where most students were away on
spring break, was a disaster. Many campus buildings were damaged,
including the chapel, which lost its 137-foot spire. A campus
parking lot looked like a junkyard, with about 50 cars tossed
around and their windows blown out.
</P>
<P>
In Comfrey, a town of about 550 people, the fire station, the
city liquor store, a cafe and a church were all demolished, and
the school had heavy damage. Fifty homes were destroyed and gas
leaks forced residents to evacuate.
</P>
<P>
Comfrey was without water, sewer or electricity, and power
company crews weren't expected to reach the town until Thursday.
</P>
<P>
It was only the seventh time Minnesota has recorded tornadoes
in March. Craig Edwards of the National Weather Service said
unseasonably warm weather produced by El Nino seemed the most
logical explanation for Sunday's tornadoes.

<HEADLINE> Iranian National Wrestling Team to Leave for U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, March 30 (Xinhua) -- The Iranian Wrestling Federation
Monday announced that the Iranian national wrestling team would
leave Tuesday morning for an international free-style wrestling
tournament to be held in Stillwater, Oklahoma of the United States.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian official news agency IRNA reported that the Iranian
team would have a one-day stop in Frankfurt, Germany to obtain
U.S. visas before heading for the wrestling competition in the U.S.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian team consists of Behnam Tayebi and Gholamreza
Mohammadi in 54 kg, Mohammad Talaie and Alireza Dabir in 58 kg,
Abbas Haj-kenari in 63 kg, Masood Jamshidi in 69 kg, Majid Khodaie
and Pejman Rastegar in 76 kg, Alireza Heidari and Fereydoun
Qanbari in 85 kg, Abbas Jadidi in 97 kg and Alireza Rezaie in 130
kg.
</P>
<P>
Iran, Japan, Germany, Russia, Cuba and the U.S. will compete in
the tournament in Oklahoma. Iran will face Japan, Germany and the
U.S. on April 5 before going against Russia and Cuba on the last
day of the competitions.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian Wrestling Federation decided to send the Iranian
national wrestling team to the U.S. after an American free-style
team bagged one gold and two silver medals from an international
wrestling tournament held in Tehran last month.
</P>
<P>
Political analysts claimed that the two countries tried to
follow a "wrestling diplomacy" in order to pave the way for
normalization of their relations which were severed in 1980 after
the Iranian students occupied the U.S. embassy in Tehran.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Urges House to Lower Drunk Driving Limit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 30 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton on
Monday urged the House of Representatives to lower the
blood-alcohol content standard for drunken driving to 0.08 percent.
</P>
<P>
Clinton called on the House to follow the Senate's example,
which voted by a 62-32 margin March 4 to urge states to set the
0.08 percent level.
</P>
<P>
Currently, 15 states have that standard while 35 states use a
more lenient 0.10 percent.
</P>
<P>
"It is my fervent hope that the majority of the House will join
the large bipartisan majority in the Senate, and send me
legislation that will make our streets safe, our drivers sober and
our laws more sensible," Clinton said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The president, who is touring Africa, also said the .08
provision could save as many as 600 lives a year.
</P>
<P>
Donna Shalala, the health and human services secretary,
speaking at an event Monday at the White House, urged the House to
bring the bill with the .08 provision to the floor before
recessing.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Disappointed over Failure of Ross's Mission </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 30 (Xinhua) -- The United States on Monday
expressed its disappointment over failure of a mission by its
special envoy Dennis Ross for reviving the deadlocked peace
process in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
"We have been unable to bridge the gaps on the hard questions,"
State Department spokesman James Robin told reporters. He said
the peace process "is in dire straits."
</P>
<P>
Ross has asked Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to
back Washington's proposal that Israel withdraw from 13 percent of
the West Bank in several stages within 12 weeks with each stage
accompanied by Palestinian security gestures.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli leader, however, said he did not expect a
last-minute breakthrough. He said only Israel will decide its
security needs and from that the scope of a long-delayed pullback.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether the United States would stop mediation for the
Middle East peace process because of Ross's failure, Rubin said
Washington had not made a decision to walk away from its role as
Middle East mediator, although that remained "an option."
</P>
<P>
Ross ended a diplomatic offensive in the region on a bleak note
on Monday, citing diminishing hopes for the Middle East peace.
</P>
<P>
Rubin said Ross was expected back in Washington on Tuesday,
when he would report to Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and
President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
Rubin said Washington had worked hard to develop negotiating
proposals that could be accepted by Israelis and Palestinians
but "in the absence of decisions by those leaders to bridge the
gaps themselves, there isn't that much the United States can
do."

<HEADLINE> U.S. Says no Proposal to Base Diplomat in Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 30 (Xinhua) -- The United States has no
proposals "on the table" to base a U.S. diplomat in Tehran, State
Department spokesman James Rubin said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
He was dismissing as groundless a report from the New York
Times, which said last week that Washington had offered to
appoint an official from the U.S. Information Agency to be
stationed at the Swiss mission in Iran.
</P>
<P>
Asked about the newspaper report at a regular briefing, Rubin
said: "It sounds to me like the reporter was talking to someone
who wasn't in the know."
</P>
<P>
"When I saw that story, I asked the people who do know. And
they indicated to me that that particular proposal was not on
the table," he added.
</P>
<P>
The Swiss embassy in Tehran has handled all U.S. diplomatic
correspondence with Iran since the United States and Iran cut
ties in 1979.
</P>
<P>
Relations between the two countries have gradually begun to
improve since the election last year of a new Iranian president
Mohammad Khatami.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Defense Secretary Reviews Report on Cuba </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 30 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Defense Secretary William
Cohen said Monday he will take the next few days to review an
intelligence report that reportedly contends Cuba poses little
threat to America's national security.
</P>
<P>
"My understanding is that it is completed, and it should arrive
at my desk today and then I'll have an opportunity to review it in
the next several days and then make comment on it," Cohen told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
Cohen made the remarks at the Pentagon at a photo session when
meeting with Romanian Defense Minister Constantin Ionescu.
</P>
<P>
The study, conducted by the Defense Intelligence Agency,
concludes that Cuba poses no significant threat to U.S. national
security, the Miami Herald reported.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the Pentagon intelligence portrays Cuba's
Revolutionary Armed Forces as a severely diminished military and
downplays the risks posed by chemical or biological weapons.
</P>
<P>
Some analysts believe that such a report may lead to a gradual
lift of the embargo against Cuba imposed by the U.S. 36 years ago.
</P>
<P>
However, some legislators in the Congress oppose lessening
sanctions against the Caribbean nation.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, the U.S. administration decided to soften
the sanctions by allowing humanitarian airplanes to fly directly
to Cuba and Cubans in the U.S. to mail cash to their relatives in
Cuba.

<HEADLINE> Madcow Disease Forecast to Dwindle Significantly by 2001 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 30 (Xinhua) - Britain's Agriculture Ministry said
Monday that the epidemic of madcow disease in the country's cattle
herds will decline to an insignificant level by the year 2001.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said in a progress report on the fight against the
disease that the number of cases was continuing to fall sharply.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the number of suspected madcow disease
reached its peak in 1992 to stand at 44,846, with the confirmed
cases at 36,682.
</P>
<P>
However, the number of suspected and confirmed cases fell to
10,701 and 8,016 respectively in 1996 and dropped further down to
5,547 and 3,410 respectively in 1997.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that thousands of cattle which have been
exposed to infection with the disease has been slaughtered in an
effort to get the European Union (EU) ban for UK beef exports to
be lifted.
</P>
<P>
The EU beef export ban was introduced two years ago when
scientists found evidence that madcow disease, or Bovine
Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE), could be transmitted to humans
who ate infected meat.
</P>
<P>
The report pointed out that these measures "will accelerate the
decline of the disease, but are not expected to advance the date
of final eradication, and forecasts that the BSE epidemic will
decline to an insignificant level by the year 2001...remain
unchanged".

WASHINGTON, March 30 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright will visit Haiti on Saturday to show support
for the country's elected government, and then will go to Trinidad
for a meeting of Caribbean foreign ministers.
</P>
<P>
In Haiti, Albright will appeal to authorities to bring about an
end to the prolonged political crisis there, State Department
spokesman James Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
Because of a legislative impasse, the country has not had a
prime minister since last June.
</P>
<P>
In Trinidad, Albright will confer on Sunday with Prime Minister
Baseo Panday on bilateral and regional issues.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, she will meet with representatives of the nations
that participated in the May 1997 Caribbean summit with U.S.
President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
Caribbean countries complain their concerns about trade and
other issues have largely been ignored by the United States, but
Rubin said the U.S. remains committed to the region.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman added that both the Caribbean and the U.S. have a
great deal in common, and face many of the same threats from drug
trafficking and other international problems.

<HEADLINE> Tanzanian Govt Seeks Final Solution to Religious </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, March 30 (Xinhua) -- The Tanzanian government
vowed to take measures to deal with the fundamentalists who
incited riots in the country which enjoys stability over the past
three decades.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Home Affairs Ali Ameir Mohamed on Monday told
reporters that strategies to curb commotion are being worked out.
</P>
<P>
"We are serious to find a lasting solution to the problem, "
he said, adding that measures to stop the recurrence of religious
riots at the Mwembechai Mosque might be presented to the cabinet
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday afternoon, hundreds of rioters near the mosque
burned two government vehicles and attacked offices of the
Tanzanian ruling party Chama Cha Mapinduzi (CCM) here. They have
also looted shops and used loudspeakers to summon their
colleagues.
</P>
<P>
Two people were killed during the riot, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
One three-year-old girl, Semeni Shabani, was stoned and burnt
to death by a group of fundamentalists who emerged from the
mosque. The bereaved mother, whose right arm and face are badly
burnt, said in the hospital bed of the Muhimbili Medical Center
(MMC).
</P>
<P>
"I escaped into a CCM office to take shelter, with my baby on
back, but the group arrived in several minutes. They rained
stones on the roof of the office, poured petrol into the room and
set fire on it," she said. Earlier, one of the stones hit her
child on head.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the mother, four other seriously injured people
have been admitted to the hospital, said MMC's public relations
officer, McDonald Mwaijande.
</P>
<P>
Police and the Field Force Unit used tear gases to disperse
the mob who were armed with clubs, stones, and helped to restore
the social order till 7:45 pm.
</P>
<P>
The riot is suspected to have a political nature and
foreigners may have laid hand in it, the minister point out.
</P>
<P>
They wanted to disrupt the peace and tranquility the east
African country has been enjoying since its independence in 1963,
he noted.
</P>
<P>
"Such kind of things have never taken place until recently.
There must be a force behind it and we will deal with the
situation accordingly," he said.
</P>
<P>
The riot, the second in seven weeks, is reported to have
happened after the police banned a meeting of the Committee of
Moslem Women last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Sixteen Moslem women, acquitted of charges in the Mwembechai
riot case last month, have recently demanded an apology from the
government, claiming they were maltreated in custody by the
police.
</P>
<P>
The women were held during a riot near the Mwembechai Mosque
in mid-February, in which two people, including a Moslem school
teacher, were killed, and more than 200 hundred people were
arrested.

King Hussein's stands" on the peace process and trusted the
"wisdom and smartness" of the king and attached importance to his
advices and experiences, said Majali.
</P>
<P>
"The American administration pledged (to the king) to offer 225
million U.S. dollars aid to Jordan in 1999," said Majali.
</P>
<P>
For the special role Jordan plays in the Middle East peace
process, the U.S. provided the kingdom with a total of 1.552
billion dollars aid from 1990 to 1997.
</P>
<P>
The king discussed with the U.S. officials the developments of
the peace process on the Syrian and Lebanese tracks in a bid to
deal with the obstacles hindering the peace process, said Majali
who attended most of the king's the discussions with U.S. leaders.
</P>
<P>
"The American side expressed their view point regarding the
Lebanese-Israeli track and think that it is a step in the
way of solving issues on the other tracks," he added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the king proposed to President Bill Clinton during
their meeting in Washington on March 19 to open direct political
dialogue with Iraq in order to iron out their differences,
according to the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
"The Americans did not show full rejection to conducting a
dialogue with Iraq," Majali said.

<HEADLINE> Portuguese Official Visits Mozambique </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, March 30 (Xinhua) -- Portugal and Mozambique must find
out a way, through constructive dialogues, to solve problems
arousing from the Cahora Bassa Hydro-Electric Power station
(HCB), a senior Portuguese official said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Luis Amado, Portugal's Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs
and Cooperation, who arrived here Monday afternoon, said that the
power project should no doubt serve the development of
Mozambique.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his confidence that Portugal and Mozambique can
find out the way to make the HCB, the project jointly constructed
by te two countries, to serve Mozambique in a "unquestionable
way".
</P>
<P>
HCB was jointly built by Mozambique and Portugal in the 70s in
northwestern Mozambique. The 1,400 km transmission lines link the
power dam with South Africa's Appolo substation, from there power
is transmitted to the Mozambican capital city Maputo.
</P>
<P>
Its high-voltage towers, destroyed during the 16-year long
civil war in Mozambique, were repaired by the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
But the dispute over the power price between Portugal and
South Africa, the biggest foreign buyer of the power from HCB,
stopped the power station from supplying electricity to South
Africa, and hence no power to Maputo.
</P>
<P>
Mozambican Prime Minister Pascoal Mocumbi had expressed the
hope last Friday that people in southern Mozambique could be
electrified with power from HCB, despite of the price dispute.
</P>
<P>
He hoped that the Portuguese official who would stay in the
country for a five-day visit, could help find out a way for the
issue.
</P>
<P>
Mocumbi said that he was shocked to find that Portugal had
unilaterally raised the power price for customers in northern and
central Mozambique.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Official Inaugurates Water Pipe Plant in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 30 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Transport Secretary Rodney
Slater Monday inaugurated a water pipe plant in Gaborone, capital of
Botswana, South African Press Association (SAPA) reported.
</P>
<P>
The plant belongs to Owens Corning of Botswana, a joint venture
between the U.S.and Botswana.
</P>
<P>
The plant is to manufacture glass fiber pipes to link the Gaborone
Reservoir to the terminal of Botswana's 360 kilometer north-south
water carrier.
</P>
<P>
Slater, who is with U.S. President Bill Clinton for a visit in
Botswana, said: "The venture is a good example of how we can support
the broad goals of the president's (Africa trade) initiative."
</P>
<P>
The U.S. mission is touring Africa to advocate its U.S.-Africa
Growth and Opportunity Act, which is basically aimed at replacing aid
to Africa with trade and opening the African market for American
goods.
</P>
<P>
"U.S. exports to Africa support 100,000 American jobs and in
Africa, projects like this create new jobs, spur growth and improve
the quality of life," Slater said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. bill was welcomed by Botswanan President Ketumile Masire.
In a speech to welcome Clinton on Sunday, Masire described the bill as
"America's solemn bond to Africa."
</P>
<P>
However, the legislation encountered harsh criticism in South
Africa. South African President Nelson Mandela said the bill was
"unacceptable" to his country.
</P>
<P>
Clinton and his wife Hillary are at a game reserve in the northern
town of Kasane to enjoy safari. They will return to Gaborone Tuesday
en route to Senegal, the last leg of their six-nation African tour.
</P>
<P>
The Clintons have visited Ghana, Uganda, Rwanda and South Africa.

<HEADLINE> China Calls for More U.N. Procurement from </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 30 (Xinhua) -- China hopes that the
United Nations will increase peace-keeping procurement from
developing countries.
</P>
<P>
Sheng Guofang, Deputy Permanent Representative to the U.N. made
the point at the Special Committee on Peace-Keeping Operations
here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
He said the fact that U.N. procurement is unfairly over
concentrated to a small number of countries have not been changed
and rather aggravated.
</P>
<P>
While Asian developing countries are taking a bigger and bigger
share in the world economy, U.N. procurement at those countries
accounted for no more than one percent of its total in 1997, he
said.
</P>
<P>
He further took China as an example. China, the world's tenth
largest trading country with a GDP representing the world's 2.5
percent, accounted for only 0.04 percent of U.N. procurement.
</P>
<P>
What's more, he said, "this tiny amount has all gone to
payment of printing cost, which means that the U.N. did not spend
a nickel in China," he said.
</P>
<P>
developing countries from other regions are in similar plight,
he added.
</P>
<P>
Sheng said China hoped that peace-keeping procurement, part of
U.N. procurement, will be conducted in a more transparent manner
and the U.N. will formulate more preferential policies to
developing countries in this regard.
