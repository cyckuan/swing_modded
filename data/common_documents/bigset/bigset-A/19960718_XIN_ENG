<HEADLINE> China Eyes One Weightlifting Gold at Atlanta Olympics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, July 17 (Xinhua) -- With two world title holders, the
Chinese weightlifting team is aiming at at least one gold medal at
the Centennial Olympic Games due to open Friday.
</P>
<P>
At the last two Olympics in Seoul and Barcelona, gold medals
seemed to elude Chinese lifters who brought home nothing more than
silvers and bronzes.
</P>
<P>
"We hope to take one gold this time," said Yang Hanxiong, head
coach of the Chinese national weightlifting team.
</P>
<P>
Yang made the claim with good reasons. At the last world
championships last November in South China's Guangzhou, Chinese
lifters battling on their home soil collected five gold medals
including two in the total,to the surprise of the weightlifting
world.
</P>
<P>
"That was a great improvement for Chinese weightlifting," said
Yang. "But we have to keep our eyes to the Olympic Games now."
</P>
<P>
China will feature ten lifters in six categories, with two each
in the 54kg, 59kg, 64kg and 70kg divisions and one each in the
76kg and
</P>
<P>
108kg categories.
</P>
<P>
The head coach figured out Zhang Xiangsen as the top favorite
to help China reach the target in the gold bonanza in Atlanta.
Zhang Xiangsen, who made his debut at world championships last
November, defeated world record holder Halil Mutelu of Turkey by a
slim margin to win the total gold in the 54kg category. Both
lifted 285 kilograms from snatch and jerk, but Zhang finished
first with lower bodyweight.
</P>
<P>
A neck-to-neck tussle is expected between Zhang and Mutelu here
Saturday. According to a ranking list released by the
International Weightlifting Federation, Zhang and Mutelu were both
ranked first at the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
The two lifters took part in the European and Asian
Championships respectively early this year, and claimed the
regional title with the identical score of 275 kilograms.
</P>
<P>
"Zhang can lift 290 kilograms from snatch and jerk in
training," said his coach Tan Xiaochuan. That weight equals to the
existing world record set by Mutlu in late 1994.
</P>
<P>
Zhan Xugang may be another medal hopeful for China. Zhan, who
took the total title in the 70kg category at the world
championships, suffered a setback at the Asian Championships in
April.
</P>
<P>
Little-known Kim Myong-Nam from the Democratic People's
Republic of Korea gave a shocking performance in Japan, with three
record-breaking lifts for the title, beating Zhan to the second
place by 7.5 kilograms.
</P>
<P>
"There is a hard way before Zhan in the Olympics," said Yang
Hanxiong. "What we could do is to help him relax as much as
possible during lifts."
</P>
<P>
As for other four categories which are dominated by East
European lifters, it could be regarded as victories if Chinese
strongmen could steal one medal from them.
</P>
<P>
Team manager Liu Fengyan said: "Our lifters are young. They can
face any challenges. And also because they are young, they still
need major competition experience to improve their performance."

<HEADLINE> Chinese Olympic Offical Hits Back at Doping Accusation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Chinese swimmers are wrongly
accused for drug-taking and "a few people" should mind their own
business before more doping cases come out of their backyards, a
senior Chinese Olympic offiical said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"Accusation was again made against Chinese swimmers even though
the incidents were instigated by a few people," Wei Jizhong,
secretary general of the Chinese Olympic Committee and deputy
mission chief of the Chinese sports delegation to the 26th Olympic
Games, said at a press conference.
</P>
<P>
Respoonding to a question from an Australian Broadcasting
Corporation reporter, Wei said that Australia and the United
States, which registered one positive case each in the swimming in
the run-up to the Olympic Games, should mind their own business
before more doping cases emerge.
</P>
<P>
Australian Olympic hopeful Samamtha Riley tested positive for a
banned drug in the world short-course championships in December,
1995, and she was only given a stern warning from the world
swimming body FINA.
</P>
<P>
American swimmer Jessica Foschi, who was caught using steriods
last year, received a two-year ban from FINA in June. She didn't
qualify for the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
The lastest doping controversy came from Australia as its
sprinter Dean Capobianco tested positive for the steriod
Stanozolol.
</P>
<P>
"I hope this is only an individual case, without anything to do
with the Australian Olympic Committee and Athletics Australia,"
Wei commented.

</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- A brief rise in the Wall Street did not save the trading
sessions of major European stock exchanges Tuesday. The Paris
Bourse fell by 1.97 percent, London Stock Exchange by 1.8 percent
-- the biggest in two years -- and Frankfurt Exchange by 3.17
percent.
</P>
<P>

Liberation:
</P>
<P>

radioactive waste.
</P>
<P>
-- Jacques Chirac is now visiting Gabon and Congo, two central
African countries burdened with heavy foreign debts despite their
rich oil resources. They are also two strongholds of the French
oil group Elf-Aquitaine, which has become a state within the state

<HEADLINE> US Housing Starts Up by 1.3 Percent in June </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 17 (Xinhua) -- U.S. housing starts rose by 1.3
percent in June despite the highest mortgage rates in more than a
year, the U.S. Commerce Department reported today.
</P>
<P>
The department said construction of new homes and apartments
totaled 1.48 million at a seasonally adjusted annual rate, up from
a revised 1.46 million in May and higher than many analysts had
expected.
</P>
<P>
The increase of housing starts in June was led by a surge of
construction of single-family houses. The single-family starts,
about 80 percent of the total, shot up 7.4 percent to a 1.225
million rate. It was the highest rate since 1.23 million in April
1994. It dropped by 5.6 percent in May.
</P>
<P>
Construction of apartments and condominiums, often volatile and
not as sensitive to interest-rate changes, plunged 20.3 percent to
a 255,000 rate.
</P>
<P>
Regionally, housing starts rose by 4.6 percent in the West and
3.8 percent in the South. But they fell 6.2 percent in the
Northeast and 4.4 percent in the Midwest.
</P>
<P>
Housing starts in the U.S. during the first six months of the
year were 13.5 percent above those of the same period of 1995.
</P>
<P>
Starts have bounced up and down in recent months as builders
attempted to gauge the market in the face of rising financing
costs.
</P>
<P>
According to the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp., 30-year,
fixed-rate mortgages averaged 8.32 percent in June, up from 8.09
percent in May and matching the average in April 1995.
</P>
<P>
Although demand has remained strong with new home sales in May
hitting a 10-year high, a survey by the National Association of
Home Builders suggests the market is leveling off.
</P>
<P>
Applications for building permits, a gauge of builder
confidence and future activity, slipped 2.5 percent in June to a
1.42 million rate. It was the second straight decline.

<HEADLINE> Europe's Reactions to U.S. Gesture on Anti-Cuba Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 17 (Xinhua) -- The European Union today welcomed
U.S. President Bill Clinton's announcement of a six-month
moratorium on part of the controversial Helms-Burton Act.
</P>
<P>
But President of the UE Commission Jaques Santer mentioned that
European companies were already suffering from the
extraterritorial nature of the act. Santer made the remarks in a
statement today as a response to Clinton's last-minute attempts to
placate international opposition.
</P>
<P>
The commission "welcomes the decision made by Clinton as far as
it goes, but the damaging extraterritorial reach of the
Helms-Burton law remains intact," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"The EU will therefore continue urgently to consider how best
to defend its interests."
</P>
<P>
It said, the EU had made it clear that it shared America's
desire for reform in Cuba, although it did not believe that
threatening sanctions against Washington's trusted allies was the
best way to achieve it.
</P>
<P>
The EU foreign ministers on Monday demonstrated their
willingness to introduce counter-measures and urged Clinton to
suspend Title III of the Act, which allows U.S. citizens to sue
foreign companies for damages in US courts for "trafficking" in
expropriated property.
</P>
<P>
But Clinton, who signed the notorious anti-Cuba trade law in
March, did not decide to scrap Title III, but only to suspend the
right to bring an action under it for six months.
</P>
<P>
While most countries welcomed Clinton's decision to suspend the
practical effects of Title III, many continued their attacks on
the legislation itself.
</P>
<P>
"It's not a satisfactory solution," said an EU official, "On
Monday the Helms-Burton Act was not law and on Wednesday it is. Is
that supposed to be good news for us?"
</P>
<P>
French Foreign Minister Herve De Charette, who welcomed
Clinton's action, stressed that France would pay much attention to
other titles of the law besides Title III, especially Title IV,
under which businessmen and their families can be barred from the
U.S.

<HEADLINE> 5,200 School Children Hit By Food Poisoning in Japan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, July 17 (Xinhua) -- School children hit by mass food
poisoning topped 5,200 today in the western Japanese city of Sakai.
</P>
<P>
At the latest count, some 420 children were still hospitalized
by the recent outbreak, caused by the virulent O-157 colon
bacillus which contaminated school lunches at Sakai, Osaka
Prefecture.
</P>
<P>
The food poisoning has affected the largest number of children
since the bacillus triggered another outbreak among school
children in late May, and is the worst such incident involving
school lunches.
</P>
<P>
According to the Health and Welfare Ministry, the number of
people falling victim to the O-157 strain of E. Coli bacteria
totalled 7,109 nationwide as of 6:00 p.m. today. Of these, four
had died, ministry officials said.

<HEADLINE> Israeli FM Expects to Meet Arafat Soon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Foreign Minister David
Levy said today that he expected to meet with Palestinian
National Authority (PNA) President Yasser Arafat "in the coming
days."
</P>
<P>
Addressing the Economic Leadership Conference in Caesarea, in
northwest Israel, Levy said that real results would come out with
such a meeting.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Palestinian sources said that the PNA would decide
on a possible meeting in the near future between Arafat and the
Israeli Foreign Minister.
</P>
<P>
This came after Levy told reporters earlier this week that his
office was preparing for a meeting between himself and Arafat,
but then he added that such a meeting would still require
examinations of the subjects and frameworks.
</P>
<P>
In a related matter, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's
foreign policy advisor Dore Gold held a meeting today with top
Palestinian negotiator Mahmoud Abbas.
</P>
<P>
Sources said that in the meeting Gold did not convey any
information about easing the closure imposed on the West Bank and
the Gaza Strip since February following a wave of suicide bombing
attacks in Israel.
</P>
<P>
During a cabinet meeting today, Netanyahu, Levy and Defense
Minister Yitazhak Mordechai decided that steps would be taken
imminently to ease the closure.
</P>
<P>
However, an official in prime minister's office said that
he did not think that specifics had been decided upon yet,
and that this would be left to Mordechai and the Israeli
security forces.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, diplomats in Israel conveyed greater skepticism
about whether the Netanyahu government is serious about engaging
substantively with the Palestinians or rather wants to merely
reap public relations gains.
</P>
<P>
They pointed out that there is a pattern of the premier
dispatching his foreign policy advisor to meet with top
Palestinian officials on the eve of a major event such as the Arab
Summit held in Cairo last month and Netanyahu's visit to the
U.S. earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
"The Palestinians feel like they are being manipulated by
Netanyahu," said one diplomat, "there is a single meeting with
the Palestinians before a big event which appears designed to
take the heat off Israel."
</P>
<P>
"To say there will be some unspecified easing of the closure
before you meet (Egyptian President Hosni) Mubarak looks like a
public-relations exercise, unless there are specifics," he added.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli prime minister is scheduled to travel to Egypt
Thursday to meet with Mubarak, their meeting will be Netanyahu's
first meeting with an Arab head of state since his election
victory on May 29.
</P>
<P>
Other diplomats insisted that it was precisely because of the
concern over being manipulated that Arafat rebuffed a meeting with
Gold on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian Officials have expressed their belief that a
meeting between Arafat and Netanyahu was essential before any
serious talks can begin on the future of the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Israeli security sources also expected that such a meeting
would be necessary before any Israeli army's redeployment in the
West Bank town of Hebron.
</P>
<P>
However, Netanyahu, while not ruling out such a meeting, has
so far given no indications when and under what conditions he
would meet with the Palestinian leader.

<P>
PARIS, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Jean-Marie Le Pen, head of France's
ultra-rightist Front National, said today that President Jacques
Chirac and Defense Minister Charles Millon are "gravediggers" of
the French armed forces.
</P>
<P>
In a communique issued after Millon announced a cut of 38
regiments of the French army, Le Pen said Chirac and Millon are on
the way of "selling off the army, and therefore our national
independence, to the profit of the new world order."
</P>
<P>
He said that this policy gravely harms the internal and
external security of the country.
</P>
<P>
Describing the army as a "great mute," Le Pen said that it is
unacceptable to cut the army out of a desire to realize economic
objectives.

<HEADLINE> US to Seek Binding Agreement to Stop Global Warming </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, July 17 (Xinhua) -- The United States announced in
Geneva for the first time that it will seek a legally binding
agreement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions after the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Undersecretary of States Timothy Wirth made the
announcement today at a ministerial meeting intended to jump-start
the ongoing negotiations on preventing global warming.
</P>
<P>
The current convention on climate change, signed at the 1992
Rio Earth Summit, contains only a voluntary target for the
industrialized countries to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions
to 1990 levels by 2000, a target that most of the countries will
not achieve.
</P>
<P>
Last year in Berlin, parties of the convention concluded that
even the present commitment of developed countries is not
adequate. New negotiations were therefore launched in a bid to
reach a "protocol or another legal instrument" containing stronger
commitments for developed countries after the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
In a statement made to the meeting this morning, Wirth said,
"The United States recommends that future negotiations focus on an
agreement that sets a realistic, verifiable and binding
medium-term emissions target."
</P>
<P>
He stressed that only through the surety of a binding target
that government will take their obligations seriously.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he said the U.S. believes that an agreement on the
issue should also be economically viable and realistic.
</P>
<P>
He rejected a proposal submitted by the Alliance of Small
Island States calling for a 20 percent reduction in carbon dioxide
emission within 10 years.
</P>
<P>
"Any of the proposals that have very early target dates are not
possible," he said at the news conference after the morning
meeting.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. position, however, remains vague on the level and
timetable for the emissions target. Wirth said the issue is
subject to further analysis in Washington.
</P>
<P>
In her statement to the meeting this morning, German
Environment Minister Angela Merkel called for 15 to 20 percent
reductions in carbon dioxide emission by 2010. Germany is
reportedly one of the few developed countries that could meet the
target of reducing greenhouse gas emmisions to 1990 levels by
2000.

<HEADLINE> Uganda Prepares for UPTC Privatisation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, July 17 (Xinhua)-- A contract was signed here today
between the Ugandan government and the Nepostal Consultancy B.U.
Netherlands to prepare the Postal Division of Uganda's
Posts and Telecommunications Corporation (UPTC) for possible
privatisation in future.
</P>
<P>
The contract was signed by Lawrence Muganwa, Executive
Director of Enterprise Development Project, on behalf of the
Ugandan government and Tiddo Brester, senior consultant with
Nepostal on behalf of his company.
</P>
<P>
The contract, which starts next week, will cost 407,000 US
Dollars and will take 11 months to complete.
</P>
<P>
Nepostal's first task is to split the state-owned UPTC into
two separate entities, namely the Uganda Posts Limited (UPL) and
the Uganda Telecommunications Limited (UTL). The UPL will remain
in government hands before privatisation.
</P>
<P>
Nepostal was chosen after considering its vast experience in
the restructuring and commercialisation of postal companies.

<HEADLINE> US Envoy Fails to Progress in Ousting Karadzic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, July 17 (Xinhua) -- U.S. peace envoy Richard
Holbrooke made no progress in removing Bosnian Serb leader Radovan
Karadzic from office after four-hour talks with Serbian President
Slobodan Milosevic here today.
</P>
<P>
Following the meeting, Holbrooke told reporters that he had
achieved little in getting any promise from the Serbian leaders to
oust Karadzic and arrest him for trial.
</P>
<P>
He said the United States was deeply concerned at the
non-compliance of the Dayton agreement in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
"In our view, Republika Srpska is in non-compliance in most
political part of the Dayton agreement," he added.
</P>
<P>
Holbrooke arrived here earlier today from Sarajevo to discuss
with Milosevic with focus on the removal of Karadzic out of public
life.
</P>
<P>
"I am here to convey a message of my government to Serbian
President Milosevic concerning the implementation of the Dayton
peace accords," he told reporters upon his arrival in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
After the talks with Milosevic, Holbrooke went to Zagreb to
continue his current Balkan shuttle diplomacy. He will hold talks
with Croatian President Franjo Tudjman later today and return to
Belgrade for more talks with Milosevic Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The international community has been tightening screws on
Karadzic, the indicted war criminal who still holds the presidency
of the ruling Serb Democratic Party, or SDS. Western countries say
Karadzic's stay in office poses a strong threat to the fair and
free elections in September.
</P>
<P>
Bosnian Muslim leader Alija Izetbegovic said Tuesday the Muslim
side would boycott the upcoming elections if Karadzic still hung
on the SDS presidency.

<HEADLINE> Zambian Opposition Urges For Round-Table </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, July 17 (Xinhua) -- The National Democratic Party of
Zambia (NDP) today urged for round-table dialogues among the
political organisations to solve the present political stalemate
in the country.
</P>
<P>
NDP leader Derrick Sinjela said in a statement that his party
is ready for inter-party talks to discuss the eligibility of the
presidential candidature of former President K. Kaunda.
</P>
<P>
Sinjela said the round-table talks should be attended by
representatives of all the political parties, trade unions,
farmers associations, churches, non-governmental organizations,
the Law Association of Zambia, and student organization.
</P>
<P>
The controversial constitution amendment bill, signed by
President Frederick Chiluba in May, had resulted in the
suspension of the inter-party talks two months ago.
</P>
<P>
According to the new constitution, only second indigenous
Zambians are qualified to be the president of the country.
</P>
<P>
This prevents K. Kaunda, former president and current leader
of the opposition United Independence Party, from contesting in
the forthcoming general elections scheduled later this year, as
his parents were immigrants from Malawi before Zambia won
independence.
</P>
<P>
The ruling party maintains that the constitution amendment is
a law that everybody should abide by.
</P>
<P>
However, the opposition parties stand that it is unjust and
they are making efforts to try to repeal it.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: West Mounts Pressure to Oust Karadzic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, July 17 (Xinhua) -- U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke flew
into Belgrade today in an attempt to press Serbian leaders to
comply with the Dayton peace accord by ousting Bosnian Serb leader
Radovan Karadzic from political life and arresting him for trial.
</P>
<P>
"I am here just to convey a message of my government to the
Serbian leaders concerning the implementation of the Dayton peace
accords," he told reporters upon his arrival in Belgrade from
Sarajevo.
</P>
<P>
Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic signed the peace agreement
last December and assumes responsibility of fully implementing the
peace deal.
</P>
<P>
At his meeting with Milosevic, Holbrooke, a key architect of
the Dayton agreement, was expected to deliver a tough warning to
Milosevic, who has strong influence on Bosnian Serbs, and ask him
to remove Karadzic and Serb army commander Ratko Mladic from
political life and send them to the Hague for trial.
</P>
<P>
Under the Dayton agreement, Karadzic, twice-indicted as a war
criminal by the international war crimes tribunal, must step down
and stand trial in the Hague.
</P>
<P>
Though he transferred his presidential duties to his deputy,
Biljana Plavsic, last month, Karadzic still clings to the
chairmanship of the ruling Serb Democratic Party, or SDS, in
defiance of international pressure.
</P>
<P>
Holbrooke's Balkan visit is part of the West's effort to seek
to oust Karadzic from the influential political position and
thwart his chance of influencing the first postwar elections which
the West views as crucial for the future of Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
To make sure that the September elections in Bosnia will be
fair and free without possible disturbance from the Serb
hardliners, the international community has been tightening the
screws on Karadzic over the past few months.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. criminal tribunal for former Yugoslavia issued
international arrest warrants against Karadzic on July 11,
charging genocide and war crimes, which means the Serb leader can
be arrested anywhere.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Robert Frowich, the mission head for the Bosnian
elections on behalf of the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe, postponed the election campaign till Friday
(July 19) to force Karadzic out of position in the SDS.
</P>
<P>
"By definition, if this campaign starts on Friday, you can be
sure that things must be strengthened by that date," he told
reporters in Sarajevo, hinting that Karadzic must be out of
political life before the campaign starts or the SDS must be
banned from participating in the elections.
</P>
<P>
To add to the pressure, Bosnian Muslim leader Alija Izetbegovic
warned Tuesday after meeting with Holbrooke that the Muslims might
boycott the elections if war criminals were allowed to take part.
</P>
<P>
"I've conveyed the message to Holbrooke that if the SDS under
Karadzic's leadership takes part in the elections, then there
could be a boycott of the elections by our side," Izetbegovic said.
</P>
<P>
In another effort to bring Karadzic to justice, the French
Foreign Ministry announced Tuesday that the French ambassador to
the United Nations would consult other members of the Security
Council on measures to arrest the war criminals by force.
</P>
<P>
French Defense Minister Charles Million, who has just ended a
trip to Bosnia, said on Monday the Security Council "must take its
responsibilities seriously and decide that the procedure of
arresting war criminals must be defined exactly and strengthened."
</P>
<P>
Pressure has been mounted recently on Milosevic, the patron of
the Bosnian Serbs, as the NATO-led Implementation Force (IFOR) in
Bosnia has been reluctant to use force to arrest Karadzic in fear
of military confrontation with the Serb army and police.
</P>
<P>
The West has threatened that if the Serbian leader fails to
take action to comply with the peace accords there will be a
reimposition of economic sanctions against Yugoslavia. The
U.N.-imposed sanctions, which devastated the Yugoslav economy,
were suspended last December but the complete lifting will take
place only after the Bosnian elections are successfully held in
September.
</P>
<P>
However, the stakes for Holbrooke's mission in Belgrade are
high because Milosevic seems unlikely to detain Karadzic. This
would risk his own political stability at home. Sending the
so-called "Serb patriot and hero" to the Hague might cause a
backlash by nationalists in Serbia and reduce Milosevic's chance
of winning the Serbian elections in December.

<HEADLINE> Washington "Regards Lebanon as Dangerous": </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, July 17 (Xinhua) -- A U.S. envoy to Lebanon said here
today that Washington "still regards Lebanon as dangerous" since
the "networks" which had threatened the American interests in the
past years have not been removed.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on a recent State Department communique regarding
Lebanon, U.S. Charge d'Affaires Ron Schlycher said, "Clearly, we
still regard Lebanon as dangerous because the personalities who
abused the American interests in the past years are still there
and their networks are active."
</P>
<P>
He described the issue of the statement as "an routine
administrative work" not tied with a travel ban on U.S. citizens
to Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
In the communique, the U.S. State Department warned the
American citizens against traveling to Lebanon, claiming that the
situation in Lebanon was "extremely dangerous where any American
citizen can not regard himself as aloof from terrorist
operations."
</P>
<P>
All the Beirut newspapers reprinted the communique this
morning.
</P>
<P>
Schlycher was summoned today by Lebanese Foreign Minister Farez
Boueiz to his office.
</P>
<P>
At the end of the 90-minute meeting with Boueiz, the U.S. envoy
denied that the U.S. State Department had taken a decision to
renew the travel ban and Secretary of State Warren Christopher
"is still reviewing the decisions related to the ban on traveling
to Lebanon."
</P>
<P>
The ban went into effect following a series of attacks on
American targets in Beirut in the middle of the 1980s and was
reaffirmed in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. diplomat also denied a link between the State
Department communique and a recent U.S. call for the Lebanese's
participation in the approaching parliamentary election in
Lebanon, stressing that the timing of the two matters were "only
coincident."
</P>
<P>
Angered by the communique, Lebanese foreign ministry officials
were quoted by the Beirut daily Ad-Diyar as saying that the
warning was "an attempt to increase the pressure on Lebanon to
enter peace negotiations with Israel."
</P>
<P>
They added that Lebanon "couldn't be bothered" following the
failure of repeated Lebanese efforts to convince Washington that
security now prevailed in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The conservative daily An-Nahar strongly lashed out at the
communique, saying the "hand which wrote it is undoubtedly the
hand of an enemy motivated by a deep hatred for our country for no
obvious or understandable reason."
</P>
<P>
"If Washington considers the State Department's communique as
a routine administrative measure, the Lebanese consider it as a
routine attempt to harm their country and their reputation," the
paper added.

<TEXT>
<P>
PESHAWAR, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Five Afghan parties have formed a
new anti-government alliance in Tashkent, capital of Uzbekistan
which borders Afghanistan, Afghan sources told Xinhua here today.
</P>
<P>
The new alliance, named "the National Islamic Front of
Afghanistan for Peace", was formed last week, and an six-point
agreement to this effect was signed, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
However, the content of the agreement has not been disclosed so
far.
</P>
<P>
The five parties' leaders include Junbush-i-Melli's Rashid
Dostum, Shore-ye-Melli's Sayed Gailani, Harkat-i-Islami's Sheikh
Mohisini, Hezb-i-Wahdat's Karim Khalili and governor of Afghan's
Nangarhar province Abdul Qadeer.
</P>
<P>
Gailani was quoted as saying that the new alliance will frame a
strategy for transfer of power from Afghan President Burhanuddin
Rabbani.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that the new alliance will get support
from more groups and factions which want Rabbani to step down.

<HEADLINE> China Hopes to Win 10 Gold Medals at Atlanta Olympics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, July 17 (Xinhua) -- China may collect 10 gold medals
at the Centennial Olympic Games, said Li Furong, deputy mission
chief of the Chinese sports delegation, here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
According to Li, who is director of the Training Bureau of
China's Sports Commission, 309 Chinese athletes will take part in
153 events and they have the possibility to win medals in 60
events.
</P>
<P>
China began to select its Olympians two years ago from among
more than 1,000 athletes and the group was reduced to some 300
after this year winter training.
</P>
<P>
"We have our best athletes here after selection trials," he
said.
</P>
<P>
At a pre-Olympic Games press conferfence, Li Furong said that
China has great possibilities to win gold medals in the sports of
table tennis, diving, shooting and gymnastics on the strength of
such elite athletes as world champion paddler Deng Yaping, divers
Xiong Ni and Fu Mingxia, sharpshooter Wang Yifu, gymnasts Li
Xiaoshuang and Mo Huilan.
</P>
<P>
As for other sports, Li said that China may shine in the events
of women's 5,000 and 10,000 meters in athletics, women's singles
in badminton, 48kg category in women's judo, and 50m, 100m
freestyle and 4x100m freestyle relay in swimming at the Games.
</P>
<P>
"We have world champion runner Wang Junxia, world champion
shuttler Ye Zhaoying, world champion swimmer Le Jingyi in our
team," he added.
</P>
<P>
At the Atlanta Games, the United States, Russia and Germany are
listed as the first group by the Chinese delegation. "It will be
very hard for other teams to beat those three in the medal
standings," said Li. "China will try to its best to keep its
leading position in the second group which consists of about a
dozen teams including Britain, South Korea, Hungary, Italy and
Australia."
</P>
<P>
In the Barcelona Olympic Games four years ago, China finished
fourth after the Unified Team, the United States and Germany with
16 golds in the final team rankings.
</P>
<P>
Since the Chinese sports delegation arrived here last Monday,
"we have met with some difficulties," said Wei Jizhong, deputy
mission chief and secretary general of the Chinese delegation.
</P>
<P>
"The weather here is hot and humid, although it is better than
what we expected. The food at the Olympic Village is quite
different from what we have in China and the time difference is 12
hours," said Wei.
</P>
<P>
"Despite these problems, our athletes are serious in training
and they will do their best at the games," he added.

<HEADLINE> EU Could Still Impose Sanctions Upon US: UK Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 17 (Xinhua) -- A senior British government
official said today that the European Union (EU) could still
impose sanctions on the United States despite Washington's
decision to suspend suing foreign companies with business links
with Cuba.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether the EU would still impose sanctions on
Washington, British Trade and Industry Secretary Ian Lang said in
a BBC television interview, "I think that's quite possible. We're
looking at various options at present."
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton announced Tuesday that he ordered a
six-month suspension of the right to sue foreign companies under
the controversial Helms-Burton Act.
</P>
<P>
Under the Helms-Burton Act, American citizens are allowed to
file lawsuits against foreign companies which have business links
with Cuba.
</P>
<P>
Lang noted that Britain and its EU partners could impose visa
sanctions upon American citizens and take other measures against
American firms operating in Europe.
</P>
<P>
"It's not the kind of range of activities one seeks to get
involved in but we cannot leave our own interests unprotected and
we must bring home to the Americans the unacceptable nature of
what they have been doing," Lang said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed, "It's not an acceptable way for international
trading relationships to be conducted. We expect our allies to
behave in a proper way with their trading partners."

<HEADLINE> Swiss Banks May Expose Wartime Activities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, July 17 (Xinhua) -- The Swiss parliament is considering
publicizing the financial activities of Swiss banks during World
War Two.
</P>
<P>
The proposal would help clarify the banks' role in managing the
fortunes of Jews and the loot of German Nazis during the war, and
could return to legal claimants money left behind by Holocaust
victims.
</P>
<P>
If the parliament gives the go ahead for proposed legislation,
to take effect in 1997, it would allow access by experts like
historians, sociologists and even politicians to bank files from
1933 to 1945.
</P>
<P>
It would help verify whether Swiss banks had exploited the lost
fortunes left by Holocaust victims, and had accepted the deposits
of Nazis' looted assets.
</P>
<P>
Switzerland enacted its famous bank secrecy laws in the 1930's
to gain deposits from people, especially Jews, seeking a safe and
neutral haven to hide their assets from Nazis.
</P>
<P>
In May 1996, the Swiss banking industry and Jewish
organizations agreed to set up a joint committee to launch an
unprecedented search for funds deposited in Switzerland by
Holocaust victims.
</P>
<P>
The Swiss Bankers Association said it had found 775 accounts
with 34.1 million U.S. dollars that had lain dormant since 1945,
and were believed to belong to Holocaust victims. But Jewish
organizations suspected the total figure might be billions of
dollars.

<HEADLINE> China Urges Developed Countries to Reduce Greenhouse Emission </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, July 17 (Xinhua) -- China is urging developed countries
to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and to assist developing
countries technically and financially to improve their capacity to
cope with climate changes.
</P>
<P>
Developed countries "bear unshirkable responsibilities" for the
problems of climate change, said Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Li
Zhaoxing.
</P>
<P>
He was addressing a two-day ministerial meeting on Wednesday of
a session of the Conference of Parties to the UN 1992 Framework
Convention on Climate Change. The July 8-19 session, the second of
the conference, aims to further strengthen the convention and
review global progress in controlling greenhouse gases emissions.
</P>
<P>
"More than 70 percent of the present concentrations of
anthropogenic greenhouse gases in the atmosphere originates in the
developed countries," Li said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that over the past 200 years since the beginning of
the Industrial Revolution, the developed countries' practice of
unsustainable patterns of production and consumption, and their
excessive and even destructive exploitation of natural resources,
had led to heavy pollution and the continuous deterioration of the
global environment.
</P>
<P>
Developed countries should face their historical
responsibilities, Li said. They should, as written in the
convention, work out and carry out measures to control their
greenhouse gas emissions at the level of 1990 by the end of the
century.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese vice foreign minister also stressed that timely and
effective provision of funds and technology by developed countries
would help developing countries fulfill commitments under the
convention.

<P>
PARIS, July 17 (Xinhua) -- International creditor countries
today decided to cancel two-thirds of Congo's foreign debts, which
totals 4.6 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
"The representatives of the creditor countries have taken note
of the fact that very low per capita income of Congo and very high
charge for the debt justify efforts to make important adjustments
and offer therefore an exceptional treatment for the first time,"
said a communique issued here by the creditors, also called the
Paris Club,
</P>
<P>
The decision was made when French President Jacques Chirac was
paying a visit to Congo. He wound up a visit to Gabon today.
</P>
<P>
Seventy percent of Congo's debts are owed to France.
</P>
<P>
Chirac announced Tuesday the cancellation of 400 million francs
(80 million U.S. dollars) of debts owed by Gabon.
</P>
<P>
France has large investments in Gabon and Congo to develop the
rich oil resources of the two central African states.

<P>
TOKYO, July 16 (Xinhua) -- The Okinawa Prefectural Assembly of
Japan today voiced opposition against a proposed relocation of a
U.S. military heliport in the prefecture.
</P>
<P>
The Assembly unanimously adopted a protest statement and a
resolution on this issue, the Kyodo News Service reported.
</P>
<P>
The Assembly expressed its opposition to the moving of a
heliport from the U.S. Marine Futemma air base to another
U.S. base on Japan's southernmost main island, Kyodo said.
</P>
<P>
"The proposed sites for the shift would cause an increase in
accidents, river pollution and destruction of the environment, and
the shift would simply strengthen the U.S. military presence in
the prefecture," the Assembly said in the statement.
</P>
<P>
The statement will be sent to both Japanese and U.S. government
leaders, including Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto and President
Bill Clinton, the news service said.

<HEADLINE> Syria Committed to Full Peace for Israeli </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 17 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Ambassador to Israel
Martin Indyk said today that Syria is committed to making full
peace with Israel in exchange for its withdrawal from Golan
Heights.
</P>
<P>
Indyk made the remarks at a symposium held at the Tel Aviv
University, which was also attended by Egyptian Ambassador
Mohammed Bassiouny, Jordanian Ambassador Omar Risai, and
Palestinian and Israeli officials.
</P>
<P>
He said Syria is willing to make full peace with Israel along
the lines of the Israeli-Egyptian and Israeli-Jordanian peace
frameworks.
</P>
<P>
"In fact, Syria is prepared to normalize relations with Israel
in terms of the kind of requirements we have seen established in
the Egyptian peace treaty and Jordanian peace treaty (with
Israel), that is ... borders for flow of people and goods, and
(establishment of) embassies," Indyk said.
</P>
<P>
He said that Syria is ready to take the high price for peace
if Israel agrees to withdraw back to the border before the war in
1967.
</P>
<P>
"It's wrong to suggest that Syria is not prepared to pay the
price in terms of normalization of relations with Israel. But,
probably in public, they are not prepared to do that, they just
want the high price in return," Indyk said.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed not to
relinquish the Golan Heights Israel occupied in the 1967 Middle
East war, casting heavy doubt on resuming the Israeli-Syrian
peace talks crucial to comprehensive peace in the region.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the symposium, Egyptian Ambassador Bassiouny urged
Israel to "waste no time" to resume talks with the Arabs. He said
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak will make the demand to Netanyahu
when the Israeli prime minister travels Thursday to Egypt to hold
their first meeting.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that Israel should accept the commonly recognized
principle of land-for-peace, saying "the key to comprehensive
peace is land for peace."
</P>
<P>
Commenting on Netanyahu's statements to seek a secure peace,
he said that no true peace could be achieved or lasting through
the use of force. "You can maintain the status quo by force, but
it won't bring peace and security. It will only bring tension and
violence," he said.
</P>
<P>
Jordanian Ambassador Risai echoed Bassiouny's call to get the
peace talks back on track, pledging Jordan would use its "special
relation" with Israel to help resume the Israeli-Arab peace
talks.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Ranks Low In Human Development: UNDP </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 17 (Xinhua) -- South Africa, with a Human
Development Index (HDI) of 0.649, was ranked 100th out of 174
countries, according to a report from the United Nations
Development Program (UNDP) today.
</P>
<P>
Canada was ranked the first of the 174 countries with a HDI of
0.951, followed by the Untied States, 0.940, and Japan, 0.938.
</P>
<P>
HDI is calculated according to a number of factors such as the
Gross Domestic Product (GDP), literacy rate and life expectancy,
said the UNDP 1996 Human Development Report, which examined the
links between economic growth and human development around the
world.
</P>
<P>
The report, the seventh since its introduction in 1989 by the
UNDP, was aimed to provide valuable information and proposals for
policy makers and private organisations.
</P>
<P>
It found that almost one third of the world's population or
100 countries became poorer over the past 15 years.
</P>
<P>
While the proportion of the world's population, whose annual
income increased by more than five percent, grew from five to 18
percent between 1980 and 1993, those who earned less jumped from
12 to 27 percent, said the report.
</P>
<P>
Virtually all African countries saw a decline in per capita
income.
</P>
<P>
South Africans' average income was no more in 1993 than in the
1960s.

<P>
ULAN BATOR, July 16 (Xinhua) -- A big increase in the number of
fires in Mongolia's capital, Ulan Bator, is blamed mainly on
people breaching fire regulations.
</P>
<P>
In the first half of this year there were 430 fires, which
caused seven deaths and injured six, a local newspaper reported
today.
</P>
<P>
The number of disastrous fires increased by 123 and the
casualties almost doubled over the same period of last year, the
People's Rights said.
</P>
<P>
The fires caused a loss of 98.7 million tugrik (about 200,000
U.S. dollars), more than double that in the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Pointing out the cause, the paper said up to 8,400
regulation-breaking cases were reported in the capital in the
first half of this year, and 392 people were fined or penalized.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Britain Needs More Transport Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Investment in Britain's transport
infrastructure needs to rise to over 11 billion pounds (16.5
billion U.S. dollars) a year over the next 10 years, Confederation
of British Industry (CBI) repored today.
</P>
<P>
The report was discussed today at a CBI conference on
transport. It says the extra investment will help reduce the
economic and environmental costs of congestion, create jobs,
attract inward investment and stimulate regeneration.
</P>
<P>
The CBI needed ll.25 billion pounds (16.875 billion dollars)
each year. The annual average was only 8.75 billion pounds (13.125
billion dollars) in the past decade. Nearly half the proposed
investment would be devoted to maintenance and renewal of existing
road and rail networks.
</P>
<P>
Adair Turner, Director-General of the CBI, said a decent
transport network is vital to the life of all people as well as to
the country's economy.
</P>
<P>
Better planning, more efficient use of the existing network,
fiscal reform and a greater emphasis on investment in public
transport are all key elements of an effective transport strategy.
</P>
<P>
But the director warned that transport service and business
competitiveness will not be improved and the environment not
effectively protected without increased investment.
</P>
<P>
The report says that investment in all transport modes needs to
be increased. Strategic and local roads would still account for
most of the investment in the sector.
</P>
<P>
Private financing would account for one third of future
investment, with the public sector remaining the main source of
most investment in transport infrastructure.

<HEADLINE> Eritrea Makes Late Olympic Bid, IOC Hesitant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 16 (Xinhua) - East Africa's tiny nation of
Eritrea has made a last-minute appeal to join the rest of the
world at the Atlanta Olympic Games to be started on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
But the International Olympic Committee (IOC) said Eritrea, the
only United Nations member outside the Olympic movement, did not
fulfill IOC's entry requirements.
</P>
<P>
Eritrea became the 182nd U.N. member in 1993 after gaining
independence from Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say that Eritrea's exclusion leaves Atlanta short of
its desire for being the first host to welcome the entire world to
the games. All 197 IOC members accepted the invitation to come.
</P>
<P>
"Over the last 30 years Eritrea was at war and it did not have
time to take part in sport. It is very important for them to take
part in the Olympics," said a supporter of Eritrea's bid.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Olympic Offical Calls for Cooperation Against Drugs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, July 17 (Xinhua) -- A senior Chinese sports official
called here Wednesday for international cooperation in the
struggle against drug abuse.
</P>
<P>
"All international sports federations and Olympic committees
should work together for a clean sports world," said Wei Jizhong,
secretary general of the Chinese Olympic Committee, at a press
conference two days before the 26th Olympic Games open here
Friday.
</P>
<P>
He said it is unfortunate that some international sports
organizations are applying double standards in the fight against
doping.
</P>
<P>
Since 1995, the International Swimming Federation has conducted
a series of drug tests on Chinese swimmers at international and
domestic competitions without notice. The Chinese Olympic
Committee and Chinese Swimming Association have cooperated in each
and every drug test.
</P>
<P>
According to Wei, the number of out-of-competition tests for a
Chinese swimmer is ten times as many as for swimmers in other
countries. "I do not think it is fair," he said.
</P>
<P>
"International rules should be applied universally. It won't do
to apply this standard to this country and another standard to
another country," he noted.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the drug accusations made against China are
out of "ideological discrimination". Some Western media reported
that China learned to take drugs from an Eastern German swimming
coach. "The coach worked in China only for eight months in 1986,"
Wei said. "After him, we had athletics and swimming coaches from
West Germany. Why is it that the Western media don't think West
German coaches have prohibited drug substances?"
</P>
<P>
Wei further said that some people should mind their own
business before more doping cases come out of their backyards.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Australia and the United States each registered one
positive case in swimming in the run-up to the Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
Australian Olympic hopeful Samamtha Riley tested positive for a
banned drug in the world short-course championships in December,
1995, and she was only given a stern warning from the world
swimming body FINA.
</P>
<P>
American swimmer Jessica Foschi, who was caught using steriods
last August, received a two-year ban from FINA in June. She
didn't qualify for the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
The lastest doping controversy came from Australia as its
sprinter Dean Capobianco tested positive for the steriod
Stanozolol.
</P>
<P>
"I hope this is only an individual case, without anything to do
with the Australian Olympic Committee and Athletics Australia,"
Wei commented.

<P>
ATLANTA, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia has sent 42 athletes to
the Centennial Olympic Games which begin here Friday.
</P>
<P>
According to high jumper Loo Kum Zee, Malaysia will compete in
eight sports including athletics, boxing, canoeing, swimming and
badminton.
</P>
<P>
Loo, bronze-medalist at last year's Asian athletic
championships, would try his best in Atlanta. "I do not know which
place I would be in, but I will do my best here," he said.
</P>
<P>
He has a personal best performance of 2.24 meters out of his
four in the event.
</P>
<P>
Eleven Malaysian athletes had been sent abroad on a
three-month, pre-Olympics training program and four of them
including Loo qualified for the Atlanta Games.
</P>
<P>
Among them is Anastasia Karin, 20, winner of the women's 10 km
walk at last year's Southeast Asia Games.

<HEADLINE> Solid Foundation of Human Development Essential: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Investment in basic health and
education is a necessity for creating a "virtuous circle," which
means economic growth spreads benefits more equitably among
people, according to the Human Development Report 1996 released
here today.
</P>
<P>
That is to say it takes a combination of government and private
steps to turn economic growth into human development, including
employment opportunities. And it takes the right kind of
employment and human development to create growth.
</P>
<P>
Nothing shows the value of education more than the stories of
the two countries A and B, the report said. Both countries had
similar incomes in 1960, but A had a primary school enrollment
ratio of 30 percent While B was 94 percent.
</P>
<P>
That is one reason that the per capita gross domestic product
(GDP) of B grew to three times that of A over the next 25 years.
If the enrollment ratio of B had stayed the same as that in A, its
per capita GDP would have been about 40 percent lower than it is
now, it added.
</P>
<P>
"The idea is to help people and countries climb the ladder of
wage and productivity increase through skill improvements while
expanding the higher-productivity sectors of the economy," said
Richard Jolly, the chief author of the report and special adviser
to the Administrator of the United Nations Development Program
(UNDP).
</P>
<P>
To make this happen, formal education must be supplemented by
further skill training in vocational institutions and on the job.
"No country that started with fast economic growth and slow human
development was able to sustain its growth rate and accelerate its
human development," said Jolly.
</P>
<P>
The best use of skills is vital to make economies grow, and one
of the best uses is in research and development. The report took
fast-growing Asia as an example, saying: "It now has 1.23 million
scientists engaged in R&AMP;D, more than Europe's l.l million or North
America's 900,000."
</P>
<P>
Health and nutrition, no less than education, have a direct
impact on jobs and economic growth, as well as helping people lead
better lives. One study cited in the report shows that a l0
percent increase in life expectancy (equal to 5.7 years in 1970)
raises the economic growth rate by an estimated one percentage
point a year.
</P>
<P>
Urging education, vocational training and other government
interventions to help people and countries climb the skills
ladder, improve employment opportunities and boost economic
growth, the Human Development Report warned rich and poor country
alike: "No country undergoes a structural transformation of the
economy without raising basic education levels."

ADDIS ABABA, July 17 (Xinhua) -- The International Olympic

tiny East African country of Eritrea to compete at the forthcoming
Atlanta Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
According to a report reaching here today, the IOC maintained
that Eritrea did not fulfill the requirements of entry, adding
that the Eritrean National Olympic Committee (ENOC) was not
recognised by the IOC, making it impossible for Eritrea's

A team consisting of two cyclists and an official

If allowed, this will be the first delegation sent by the new
African country to attend the Olympic Games since Eritrea gained
independence and became a member of the United Nations in May,
1993.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Japan Aims at Five Gold Medals in Atlanta </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Japan's 310-athlete strong
delegation to the Atlanta Games will try to take home at lease
five gold medals, two more than they did four years ago at the
Barcelona Games, head of the Japanese delegation said here today.
</P>
<P>
Hironoshin Furuhashi, president of the Japanese Olympic
Committee, said the Japanese Olympic team, also including 189
officials, was the largest sports delegation Japan had ever sent
abroad.
</P>
<P>
"Japanese athletes are expecting a total of 25 medals from the
Atlanta Games," he said. At the Barcelona Games, they took home
22 medals, including three gold, eight silver and 11 bronze medals.
</P>
<P>
Furuhashi, also a professor of physical culture at Nihon
University, said Japan has a very good chance at the Atlanta Games
to capture the gold in women's 100 meter butterfly, women's
marathon, men's wrestling and at least two combined in women's and
men's judo competition.
</P>
<P>
Japanese teenage swimmer Ayari Aoyama had the fastest time of
the year when she clocked 58.83 seconds in 100-meter butterfly
during the Olympic trials. Marathon runner Yuko Arimori, a silver
medalist of the Barcelona Games, is also a top contender for the
gold with a new Japanese record time of 2 hours, 29 minutes and 17
seconds.
</P>
<P>
Yukimasa Nakamura, Kenzo Nakamura and Yoshio Nakamura, kin
brothers from a famed judo family, are expected to catch at least
one gold medal during the games. Yukimasa was the silver medalist
at the 1995 World Championships, Kenzo was the gold medalist of
1996 French Open and Yoshio, the first place in 1995 Korean Open.
Hidehiko Yoshida is anther judo medal prospect.
</P>
<P>
In women's judo, Ryoko Tamura is the top favorite, who won both
1993 and 1995 world championships. Wrestler Hiroshi Kado will
also have a shot at the medal.
</P>
<P>
Furuhashi said about 100 Japanese athletes have arrived at the
Olympic Village. Other athletes are either still training at home
or in other parts of the United States.
</P>
<P>
He said eight Japanese swimmers are now doing high altitude
training in Arizona, the United States, because Japan dosen't have
such training camps that could also prepare the athletes for the
heat in Atlanta. He said his marathon runners are training on a
northern island in Japan.
</P>
<P>
Despite the tight security at Olympic venues here, including
the Olympic Village, Furuhashi said his athletes were not
concerned about their safety in Atlanta at all. "They are only
worry about that Atlanta's heat and humidity might prevent them
from doing their best during the Olympic games," he said.

<HEADLINE> Wang's Poor Health Could Sway China's Shots at Gold </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Olympic gold medalist Wang Yifu's
health tops the concerns of the Chinese shooting team which has
promised to take home at least one gold medal.
</P>
<P>
Wang, who finished first in the men's air pistol and second in
the free pistol at the 1992 Olympic Games, has been troubled by
ear inflammation and hypoglycemia, an ailment which causes
dizziness and lack of concentration.
</P>
<P>
"I feel jaded," said the 36-year-old Wang, one of the two
four-time Olympians in the 495-member Chinese sports delegation to
the Atlanta Olympics.
</P>
<P>
"Wang will have recovered before the competition begins on July
20," said Chinese head coach Zhang Heng, who had said back in
Beijing last month that he would resign should Chinese shooters
come back without a gold medal from Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
China sent 26 marksmen and women to compete in all 15 events
with hopes to strike gold in the men's and women's pistol, men's
running target and women's double trap.
</P>
<P>
Given health, Wang will have to overcome a challenge from
Italian Roberto Di Donna who has beaten Wang several times in
recent World Cup competitions.
</P>
<P>
Wang outshot Di Donna to win the air pistol event at the Milan
World Cup, but the Italian took a sweet revenge by winning the
free pistol. Two months later in the World Cup Finals, Wang got
the air pistol while Di Donna took the free pistol.
</P>
<P>
Their latest encounter was in the Atlanta World Cup last April
where Di Donna defeated Wang in both events.
</P>
<P>
"Wang was sick in the Atlanta World Cup and Di Donna made most
of that," said Chinese shooting team leader Gong Liren.
</P>
<P>
Li Duihong, Olympic runner-up at women's sport pistol in 1992,
is tipped to go one notch up here.
</P>
<P>
"Li stands a good chance to win her first Olympic gold," said
coach Zhang Heng.
</P>
<P>
But Li begged to disagree with her mentor. "I don't expect a
gold medal since I don't feel in form," she said.
</P>
<P>
Yang Ling and Xu Xiang are the other title hopefuls for China.
</P>
<P>
Yang, who jumped out of oblivion after taking the men's
10-meter running target title in the Munich World Cup last year,
set the world record of 585 and world final record of 687.9 in the
Milan World Cup in June.
</P>
<P>
Clay shooter Xu, who equalled the women's double trap world
record of 149 in the World Cup Finals last year, has joined world
champion Deborah Gelisio of Italy as hot favorites for the Olympic
title.

<HEADLINE> France to Close 14 Military Garrisons in Germany </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 17 (Xinhua) -- France will close 14 garrisons in
Germany in 1997 and 1999, in conformity with the military reform
program launched by President Jacuqes Chirac.
</P>
<P>
Agence France Presse quoted German officials in the states of
Rhenani-Palatinat, Sarre and Bade-Wurtemberg as saying today that
17,000 French soldiers and civilian employees from a total of
20,000 will leave before the end of 1999.
</P>
<P>
French Defense Minister Charles Millon today officially
announced that 38 regiments of the French army will be disbanded,
three air force bases closed and about 40 other military
institutions dissolved by 1999.
</P>
<P>
The French troops in Germany are among the regiments to be cut
in the first phase of restructuring of the armed forces.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, some navy bases in France will also be closed in the
period, and the Clemenceau aircraft-carrier will be out of service
in 1997.
</P>
<P>
French troops were stationed in Germany's French Occupation
Zone after World War II. The largest two French garrisons in
Germany are located in Treve with 3,650 men, and Baden-Baden with
4,200 men. Both of them will be closed in 1999.

<HEADLINE> EU Resorts to WTO Arbitration Over Helms-Burton </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Despite the semi-concession made by
U.S. President Bill Clinton on the dispute over the Helms-Burton
Act, the European Union (EU) is still weighing the possibility of
letting the World Trade Organization (WTO) arbitrate the issue.
</P>
<P>
Agence France Presse (AFP) today quoted diplomatic sources in
Geneva as saying that two rounds of EU-U.S. consultation within
the WTO in May and July did not produce any satisfactory result.
</P>
<P>
It is still possible that the two sides could resume
consultation in Geneva soon, since other articles of the act in
dispute remain in force, said the AFP report from Geneva.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the EU permanent representatives' committee will
decide on guiding principles over the issue at its session
Thursday in Brussels, said the sources.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton announced Tuesday a moratorium on
Article III of the Helms-Burton Act, which allows U.S. citizens to
sue foreign companies which sell and buy properties that used to
belong to them in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
The French government, which sharply criticized the act,
reacted "favorably" to the decision, but had reservations.
</P>
<P>
"This is incontestably a gesture moving nearer to the European
Union and other big partners of the United States which have
expressed their common concern over this sensitive subject," said
French Foreign Minister Herve Charette after Clinton made his
announcement.
</P>
<P>
"France has noted other articles of the Helms-Burton Act,
especially Article IV, which denies free movement of people and
remains in application," said the foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
Article IV of the act bans from U.S. territory leaders of
foreign firms doing business with the Cuban government and making
profits from the properties that used to belong to Cubans now
living in the United States as U.S. citizens.
</P>
<P>
Informed sources said that the U.S. government could quote
Article 21 of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade which
allows individual countries to protect their "essential interests
of security."
</P>
<P>
A EU official in Geneva told AFP that if the U.S. cited this
article, it would be a very peculiar interpretation of the
article, since there are many more obvious cases that are relevant
to the article.

<HEADLINE> US Senior Diplomat Arrives for Cyprus Problem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, July 17 (Xinhua) -- U.S. permanent representative to
the United Nations Madeleine Albright arrived here this afternoon
on a 24-hour visit for discussions about a Cyprus settlement.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. diplomat refrained from making any statements upon
her arrival. When asked what proposals she had brought with
her, she said, "We will discuss them with the appropriate
people. I just want to say I am really glad to be here."
</P>
<P>
Albright, who is a member of U.S. President Bill Clinton's
cabinet, is heading a 16-member delegation. The group includes
military officers and U.S. Presidential Emissary for Cyprus
Richard Beattie, State Department special coordinator for Cyprus
James Williams, the Director of the State Department's Office for
Southern European Affairs, Carey Cavanaugh, and specialists from
the Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
Albright is expected to have talks Thursday with Cyprus
President Glafcos Clerides at the Presidential Palace and Turkish
Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash in the Turkish-controlled northern
part of Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. delegation will also have a meeting with Cyprus'
National Guard Commander Lieutenant-General Nicolaos Vorvolakos
and a separate meeting with the commander of the Turkish
occupation army Hasan Kundaksi.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus is the second stop of Albright's current regional tour
of Athens, Nicosia and Ankara.
</P>
<P>
After Cyprus, Albright will fly on to Ankara for talks with
Turkish officials.
</P>
<P>
Before her trip to the region, U.S. State Department
spokesman Nicholas Burns said Albright was bringing with her
specific suggestions and ideas for discussion with leaders in the
three countries.
</P>
<P>
According to reports reaching here today from Athens, where
she met Greek Prime Minister Costas Simitis and Foreign Minister
Theodoros Pangalos, Albright said "because we recognize that the
Cyprus problem cannot be viewed in isolation, we have also focused
discussions here in Athens on improving relations between our two
important NATO allies, Greece and Turkey."
</P>
<P>
She noted that "assisting the parties to seize this opportunity
as long as it exists is now our diplomatic goal."
</P>
<P>
"Our message today is a simple one. The Clinton
administration is ready to assist those who are prepared to
take the risks for peace," the U.S. diplomat said.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkish troops
invaded and seized the northern third of the island following
a short-lived coup by Greek Cypriots seeking union with
Greece.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. and international community's peace efforts have
failed to bring the two communties, the Greek and Turkish
Cypriots, on the island closer to a settlement for the past 22
years.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton has pledged to do his utmost in
seeking an end to the division of this east Mediterranean
country.

<HEADLINE> Jordanian PM Holds Talks with Saudi FM over Phone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Prime Minister and Foreign Minister
Abdul Karim Kabariti today held a telephone conversation with
Saudi Arabian Foreign Minister Prince Saud al-Faisal al-Saud on
the latest developments of the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Kabariti and Prince Saud discussed ways to make more efforts to
resume peace talks with Israel on all tracks so as to reach a just,
comprehensive and lasting peace in the region.
</P>
<P>
Analysts believe that Kabariti briefed Prince Saud on the
outcome of his Tuesday's visit to Cairo and his talks with
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and other senior Egyptian
officials, as well as Syrian Foreign Minister Farouq al-Shara, who
was also in Cairo Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Kabariti was also believed to have briefed the Saudi foreign
minister on the outcome of his Tuesday's surprise visit to
Israel, where he met his Israeli counterpart Benjamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
Observers and diplomats here believe that Jordan is making
efforts to play an important role of middleman between Arabs and
Israelis by making use of its special relationship with Israel
which it has fostered since it signed the peace treaty with the
Jewish State in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Israel's Arab neighbors fear that Netanyahu's hardline policy
on the issues of Jerusalem, establishment of an independent
Palestinain state, return of the Golan Heights Israel seized in
1967 Middle East war and expansion of Jewish settlement in the
occupied territories may lead the peace process to collapse.
</P>
<P>
A diplomatic source here told Xinhua that Jordan has tried hard
to narrow the gap of differences between Arabs and Israelis and
restore the Arab-Israeli peace talks.

<HEADLINE> China Aims at More Diving Golds in Atlanta Olympics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Chinese officials have never
uttered a word about the Olympic medal prospects of their divers,
but China is tipped to make a clean sweep of the four gold medals
at stake in the upcoming Olympic Games here.
</P>
<P>
China returned to the Olympic arena in 1984 and their divers
achieved immediate success at Los Angeles when Zhou Jihong dived
for China's first ever Olympic diving gold in the women's 10-meter
platform.
</P>
<P>
Four years later in Seoul, South Korea, Chinese divers asserted
their talent by bagging two golds in the women's events. But the
real hero on that occasion was Xiong Ni, who fully extended
diving's all-time great Greg Louganis of the United States before
losing by a mere 1.14 points.
</P>
<P>
At the 1992 Barcelona Olympics, three out of the four golds
went to Chinese divers with Amercian Mark Lenzi standing in the
way of a Chinese clean sweep.
</P>
<P>
This time in Atlanta, although Lenzi managed to make the
American team again, he can hardly stop his Chinese opponents.
</P>
<P>
In the four years in between, China has produced a group of
young diving stars to take the limelight of international
competitions.
</P>
<P>
Chinese divers are due in Atlanta this Sunday without world and
Olympic champion Sun Shuwei and some other big names of the past
two years.
</P>
<P>
Sun was eliminated at the Chinese Olympic trials, the first of
its kind in China's diving history.
</P>
<P>
Sun, who was called "a great boy" by American diver Scott Donie
at the 1992 Olympics, had an eye operation early this year. He had
been training hard to regain his form in time for the Olympic
trials.
</P>
<P>
He could have been an automatic entry to the Olympic Games if
China didn't introduce the Olympic trials system. Unfortunately,
though he put up a good performance at the trials, he was still
beaten due to the obvious fact that his two rivals proved to be
better divers.
</P>
<P>
The two, Tian Liang and Xiao Hailiang, will represent China in
the men's 10-meter platform. Though they are not familiar with
the atmosphere of the Olympics, they can boast of their World Cup
experience at Atlanta Aquatic Center and the fact that they won
defeated world and Olympic champion Sun.
</P>
<P>
They are serious contenders of the platform title, joined by
more experienced Dmitriy Sautin of Russia.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese combination of Xiong Ni and Yu Zhuocheng in the
men's 3-meter springboard is also formidable. The two would be
happy to add Olympic gold to their collection.
</P>
<P>
As for the women's competitions, Chinese divers are in a more
advantagous position with world and Olympic champion Fu Mingxia
out to shoot a double gold.
</P>
<P>
Fu, who took the platform title in ease at Barcelona, will be
joined by Guo Jingjing in the platform at Atlanta and will team up
with Tan Shuping in the springboard.
</P>
<P>
Fu was known for her ready smile and elegence on the platform
four years ago. And she has developed herself to a springbaord
expert as well.
</P>
<P>
Though Fu said her biggest rival was herself at the Olympics,
Chinese officials have hinted that Fu's real threat will come from
her compatriots.
</P>
<P>
Guo Jingjing, who surged to stardom at the 1995 Diving World
Cup in Atlanta, beat Fu in the platform at the Chinese Olympic
trials while Tan Shuping gained an upper hand over Fu on the same
occasion.
</P>
<P>
The three seem to have a tight grip on the two gold medals of
the women's events, though they should also fight off challenges
from Russian, German and American divers.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus to Adopt Package of Measures to Boost </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, July 17 (Xinhua) -- The Cyprus government decided
today to adopt a package of measures to promote and upgrade
tourism on the island.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made by the Council of Ministers following a
series of meetings of a committee comprising the ministers of
finance, labor and social affairs and insurance, interior, and
communications and works.
</P>
<P>
Announcing the measures at a press conference, Minister of
Commerce, Industry and Tourism Kyriakos Christofi said the
problems faced by the tourist industry in Cyprus are not
characteristic to the island but observed in the whole of the
Mediterranean as well as other tourist destinations which are
competitive to Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
The minister was referring to problems facing the Cyprus
tourism, such as cost of tourist product, quality and fierce
competition from other tourist destinations.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the package includes measures aiming to control
the further construction of new hotels, to provide low-interest
loans for renovation of existing ones, and measures concerning the
operational cost of hotels.
</P>
<P>
Christofi said the government will attempt to hold back labor
costs for the next three years and has asked for the cooperation
of trade unions in this direction.
</P>
<P>
The measures to promote tourism also include the construction
of some costly infrastructure projects as well as marinas, casinos
and golf fields.
</P>
<P>
The minister also stressed the need to protect the environment,
and to preserve archeological sights on the island.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus' tourism accounts for 21 percent of the country's gross
domestic product (GDP) and more than 40 percent of foreign
exchange earnings.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, about 2.1 million foreign tourists visited Cyprus,
earning the country 1.7 billion U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Urges Neighbors Not to Support PKK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Turkish President Suleyman Demirel
today strongly urged neighbors not to support the rebels of the
outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK).
</P>
<P>
Demirel issued the warning during a lightning visit to an army
outpost recently attacked by the PKK rebels on the Iranian border.
</P>
<P>
He said, "This visit has a special meaning. As the head of the
Turkish Republic, I want to say this to everyone at home and
abroad that these lands are ours. They were ours in the past, are
so now, and will be ours in future."
</P>
<P>
The border post was attacked last week by the PKK rebels, who
have been fighting a 12-year separatist guerrilla war in southeast
Turkey since August 1984. The fighting has claimed over 20,000
lives so far while hundreds of thousands of local Kurds were
forced to abandon their villages.
</P>
<P>
Five soldiers were killed and two others wounded in the attack
on the border post by a group of PKK rebels, who crossed from
Iran.
</P>
<P>
The clash between Turkish security forces and the PKK rebels
was followed by charges by Iran that Turkish armed helicopters had
also hit an Iranian village and caused civilian casualties. But
the Turkish General Staff of the Armed Forces denied the charges.

<HEADLINE> Bashir on Sudan's Foreign Relations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KHARTOUM, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir
has disclosed that Sudan's foreign relations are good,
particularly with most neighboring countries, adding that serious
dialogue is under way with Egypt at various levels, and with
Ethiopia of late.
</P>
<P>
On Sudan's relationship with Uganda, he said that both Libya
and Malawi were exerting good offices for the resolution of
outstanding problems between them (Sudan and Uganda).
</P>
<P>
In an interview today with the Spanish television at his office
in the Republican Palace, the Sudanese president hailed the
distinguished relations between Sudan and certain Asian countries
as well as with Russia, particularly in the economic domain.
</P>
<P>
On Sudan's ties with Europe, President Bashir said that
dialogue was under way with several European countries, and that
efforts were being exerted with the United States for the
restoration of Sudanese-U.S. relations to normal.
</P>
<P>
Asked about the recently held Cairo Arab summit, the Sudanese
president praised the results of the summit, saying that the
meeting constituted a good beginning for the restoration of Arab
solidarity.
</P>
<P>
On the U.N. Security Council resolutions against Sudan, Bashir
pointed out that his country was dealing with them very seriously.
</P>
<P>
He hailed the positive developments which accompanied the
signing of the peace convention to end war in Sudan, saying that
it had led to ensuring security of large areas in southern Sudan.
</P>
<P>
He said a number of leaders of the John Garang group were being
convinced with the peace convention, and that efforts were being
exerted by some African states and other friends for the
resumption of negotiations with the Garang faction for the
promotion of the peace process in Sudan.
</P>
<P>
Bashir also dealt in his interview with domestic issues,
particularly in the economic field, giving an account of the steps
taken by the government for the establishment of peace in Sudan.
</P>
<P>
Sudan, which has a population of about 25 million, is split by
conflicts between the Moslem-dominated government in the north and
the animist and Christian south.
</P>
<P>
The rebel Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA) led by John
Garang has been fighting against the government since 1983,
seeking more autonomy and economic reforms in the south.

<HEADLINE> Chinese, British Scientists Make Major Discovery: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, July 17 (Xinhua) -- The Earth inner core is rotating
faster than the planet itself, which has never before been
detected or measured.
</P>
<P>
This major discovery has been made by Chinese scientist Song
Xiaodong and his British counterpart Paul Richards, both
seismologists at Lamont-Doherty, Colombia University's earth
sciences research institute in New York, the United States.
</P>
<P>
The fundamental discovery indicates that the inner core -- a
solid iron crystal whose mass is comparable to the size of the
moon -- is spinning independently from the rest of the solid
earth. It is driven by magnetic and electrical effects within the
near-frictionless liquid outer core that surrounds it, the two
scientists explained at a news press conference today on the major
discovery, at which a color computer animation of the core's
movement was shown.
</P>
<P>
Song and Richards gave basic points about the Earth core:
</P>
<P>
-- The Earth core was formed very early in the Earth's
evolution as heavier molten iron sank toward the center of the
planet;
</P>
<P>
-- As the nascent Earth cooled and dissipated its internal heat
toward the surface, some molten iron began to solidify to create
the dense, solid inner core;
</P>
<P>
-- Enormous pressure keeps the inner core solid in a region of
temperatures in the range of 7,000 degrees Fahrenheit and possibly
much higher;
</P>
<P>
-- The inner core is surrounded by a fluid iron ouster core;
</P>
<P>
-- Fluid iron has continued to solidify the boundary between the
two cores, so that over a billion years, the inner core has grown
steadily to the present diameter of 1,500 miles;
</P>
<P>
-- The inner core's diameter is about thee-quarters of that of
the moon, but its mass is about 30 percent more than the moon. The
inner core's mass is 100 million million million tons;
</P>
<P>
-- Pressure at the inner core surface is millions of times
higher than the atmospheric pressure at the Earth's surface. The
enormous pressure has aligned iron atoms in a distinctive
crystalline structure;
</P>
<P>
-- This crystalline structure creates a relatively north-south
pathway through which seismic waves travel fastest through the
inner core;
</P>
<P>
-- This seismic wave "fast-track" is not exactly north-south but
is tilted slightly from the axis around which the Earth is
rotating.
</P>
<P>
The discovery marks the first time the motion of the core has
been measured and opens a window on how the Earth's magnetic field
is created and why it reverses periodically, how heat flows
through the planet and how the Earth's multi-layered interior has
evolved.
</P>
<P>
Song and Rechards studied seismic waves from 38 earthquakes
that occurred between 1967 and 1995 near the South Sandwich
Islands at the bottom of the globe. They measured the speed of
waves that traveled up through the inner core to receiving
seismographs in Alaska at the top of the globe and found that the
waves arrived about 0.3 seconds sooner in the 1990s than they did
in the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
They calculated that over a year, the inner core rotates about
one longitudinal degree more than the Earth's mantle and crust.
The inner core makes a complete revolution inside the Earth in
about 400 years.

<P>
ATLANTA, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Athletes to the 26th Olympic Games
due to open Friday are offered or promised a huge sum of money or
other lucrative incentives by their national sports governing
bodies or governments if they can bring home medals, preferably
gold ones.
</P>
<P>
Gold medal winners are reportedly to receive cash rewards
ranging from several thousand to hundreds of thousands of U.S.
dollars.
</P>
<P>
On top of cash rewards, Olympic medalists may get a sedan car
and a new house or an apartment.
</P>
<P>
This has led to a contraversy with quite a few people
criticizing this practice as running counter to Olympic amateurism
and linking the Olympic Games too much with commercialism.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines is reportedly offering the most attractive
incentives to an Olympic gold medal winner -- a check of 10
million pesos or 400,000 U.S. dollars in addition to a new house
and a car.
</P>
<P>
Next come Italy and Thailand -- an equivalent of 120,000 U.S.
dollars for a gold medal.
</P>
<P>
Mexico and Russia are each offering 100,000 U.S. dollars to the
winner of an Olympic gold while Spain promises to give 80,000
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The United States, Germany, Chile, Georgia and Khazakistan will
award 50,000 dollars to the Olympic gold medal winner, 30,000
dollars to the silver medal winner and 20,000 dollars to the
bronze medal winner.
</P>
<P>
But a Kenyan gold medalist will receive a relatively slim sum
of 3,300 dollars while a Frenchman is only offered an equivalent
of 2,000 dollars.

PARIS, July 17 (Xinhua) -- French Prime Minister Alain Juppe
announced today in Ajaccio, Corsica, that the central government

<P>
Juppe, who arrived in Corsica today on a working tour, also
said that those assassins and law-breakers must be "relentlessly
hunted, arrested and brought to the justice."

The financing package will be mainly used to build a free
economic zone in Corsica, which will allow enterprises to take
advantage of "some fiscal exemptions and alleviated social
charges," Agence France Presse quoted Juppe as saying.
</P>
<P>
However, the plan to build the zone, which was announced in
March by the French government, will have to be agreed upon by the
European Union, which reportedly has some reservations over the
plan.
</P>
<P>
Corsica has been plagued by violences originating from
separatist activities for 20 years.

A spokesman of the ministry said that except for the

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu to Hold Talks with Mubarak on Mideast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu will arrive here Thursday on his first visit to an Arab
state since he took office to lead the new Israeli government
last month.
</P>
<P>
During his brief working visit, he is to meet with Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak for talks on the stalled Middle East
peace process.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak will urge Netanyahu, who has vowed to take a hard-line
policy on Arab-Israeli peace negotiations, to stick to the
land-for-peace principle, which has been the basis for the Middle
East peace process since its inception five years ago, Egyptian
Foreign Minister Amr Moussa said today.
</P>
<P>
Moussa met here today with Dore Gold, advisor to Netanyahu,
to discuss the arrangements for the visit.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak is also to call on Netanyahu to honor all agreements
Israel has signed with the Arabs and resume peace talks with the
Palestinians, Syria and Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, which has been playing an active role in the peace
process as a mediator between the Jewish state and the Arabs,
particularly the Palestinians, recently has been leading an Arab
campaign to save the peace process and press Israel to change its
tough stance.
</P>
<P>
Egypt hosted last month the Arab summit, the largest
gathering of Arab leaders in six years, to close Arab ranks and
forge a unified Arab stance toward the new Israeli government.
</P>
<P>
The summit sent a strong message that the land-for-peace
principle will continue to be the basis for the peace process and
Israel's political and trade relations with the Arab world will
be tied to progress in the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, Syrian Foreign Minister
Farouq al-Shara and Jordanian Premier and Foreign Minister Abdul-
Karim al-Kabariti came to Cairo this week to coordinate stances
with Mubarak prior to Netanyahu's visit.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians and Syria have expressed special concern
that Netanyahu's tough line may destroy the whole peace process.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli prime minister has opposed the return of the
Golan Heights to Syria and ruled out the establishment of an
independent Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
He has also refused to discuss the future of Arab east
Jerusalem, which the Palestinians want as the capital of their
would-be state.
</P>
<P>
On many occasions, Netanyahu said that Jerusalem would remain
Israel's eternal and undivisible capital. He also vowed to build
and expand Jewish settlements in the Gaza Strip and West Bank.
</P>
<P>
He has put off a decision on Israel's promised withdrawal
from most of Hebron, the last West Bank town still under the
Israeli occupation, and suggested that Israel is unlikely to give
up much, if any, more land to the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Despite all these tough statements, Netanyahu is still talking
about peace and concerned about Egypt's diplomatic efforts for
forging a strong and unified Arab stance on the Mideast peace
drive.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu said recently that he wants good relations with
Egypt because it has an important role to play in brokering
Israel's relations with Syria, the Palestinians and Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Through his Cairo visit, Netanyahu may offer Egyptian
President Mubarak a bigger role in the peace process so as to
dampen the brewing confrontation between Israel and the Arab
world, The Israeli newspaper The Jerusalem Post said.
</P>
<P>
Signs show that the Israeli government has come to realize it
is in its interest to keep Cairo "inside the tent" by offering it
a role, rather than to risk a potentially hostile axis between
Egypt and Syria, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Egypt will listen to the views of Netanyahu during his visit
to Egypt, Moussa said today, indicating that Egypt will not
prejudge Netanyahu's policy.

<HEADLINE> Buthelezi Refutes IFP's Merge With ANC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 17 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's third largest
party Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) today officially refuted rumors
that it would either withdraw from the government or merge with
the African National Congress (ANC).
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued here today, IFP chairman Mangosuthu
Buthelezi assured the public that the neither of the issues would
be on the agenda of the IFP national conference scheduled for
July 26.
</P>
<P>
"As the president of the IFP, I am very concerned about the
spreading of these speculations which have no basis within the
internal political debate taking place in the IFP's national
council and other IFP policy structures," he said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Monday, IFP's deputy Chairman, Sipo Mzimela, said
the party is considering a possible merge with South Africa's
largest party ANC, or withdrawal from the Government of National
Unity.
</P>
<P>
Mzimela said the IFP is also weighing options such as forming
alliance with the National Party (NP), the country's second
largest party, which had earlier in June backed out of the
government and become an official opposition party.
</P>
<P>
The NP had said the new constitution did not provide a
power-sharing mechanism in the executive branch.
</P>
<P>
Buthelezi also accused the ANC of not showing sincerity in
making reconciliation with the IFP.
</P>
<P>
"While the ANC ostensibly talks the language of peace and
spreads rumors about reconciliation with the IFP, it continues to
do everything in its power to crush IFP structures and undermine
our actions of government in Kwazulu/Natal," he said, referring
to the heart-land of the IFP's power base Zulus.
</P>
<P>
The ANC, according to him, still opposed the certification of
Kwazulu/Natal's provincial constitution and took no steps to seek
reconciliation on issues such as the forming of the local
government and remuneration of traditional leaders.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Consortium Formed to Develop Shanghai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, July 18 (Xinhua) -- The Economic Development Board
(EDB) of Singapore said today that a Singapore consortium of
companies and the Shanghai Kaicheng Comprehensive Development
Corporation have reached agreement on a housing project in
Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
In accordance with the agreement, the two sides will form a
joint venture to implement an Integrated Housing Community (IHC)
project in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
In the first phase of the project, a total of 400,000 square
meters of gross floor area will be built, involving a total
investment of 200 million Singapore dollars (about 142.86 million
US dollars), the EDB said.
</P>
<P>
The IHC project was first mooted during the official visit of
Singapore Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong to Shanghai in May last
year. During his meeting with Shanghai Mayor Xu Kuangdi, Mr. Goh
proposed for Singapore to co-operate with Shanghai in its public
housing development.
</P>
<P>
Under the proposal, Singapore would share with Shanghai its
experience in public housing and facilitate foreign capital inflow
for public housing development, thereby enabling the Shanghai
Municipal Government to free up its funds for other infrastructure
projects.
</P>
<P>
The EDB said that the signing ceremony for the IHC project is
scheduled for next Monday in Shanghai. The Minister for
Information and the Arts and Minister for Health, Mr. George Yeo,
will sign the Co-operation Agreement for the implementation of the
IHC project on behalf of the Singapore Government. The Mayor of
Shanghai, Mr. Xu Kuangdi, will sign the agreement on behalf of
Shanghai.

<HEADLINE> Greece Bears No Responsibility for Plane Crash: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Greek government spokesman Dimitris
Reppas said today that the Greek side bore no responsibility for
the crash of the Paris-bound TWA airliner off New York.
</P>
<P>
Replying to questions connected with the fact that the airliner
had previously flown from Athens to New York, Reppas said that the
aircraft had undergone an exhaustive check in Athens "as happens in
all cases."
</P>
<P>
Asked if any responsibility had been attributed to the Greek
side for the accident, Reppas replied that no such position or
even insinuation had been officially expressed. It would be
inconceivable for such an insinuation to be made, he added.
</P>
<P>
Reppas noted that after leaving Athens and before its fateful
last flight, the Boeing 747 had remained at Kennedy International
Airport for five hours where, the spokesman said, it must have
undergone a detailed check.
</P>
<P>
Reppas added that there had been no communication between the
Greek and U.S. governments other than that which is routine.
</P>
<P>
According to the government's information, he said, there were
no Greek passengers aboard the TWA airliner when it crashed.
</P>
<P>
All 229 passengers and crew of the Boeing 747 are feared to
have died in the crash, the cause of which is as yet unknown.

<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Japan's trade surplus in the first
half of 1996 dropped by 40.1 percent compared with the same period
the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The Finance Ministry said on Thursday that the drop was mainly
caused by increasing imports.
</P>
<P>
The trade surplus in the January-June period decreased to
3,111.16 billion yen (31.112 billion U.S. dollars), representing a
drop for the sixth consecutive half-year period and the largest
decline in the past 16 years, the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
It said Japan's trade surplus with the United States fell 34.6
percent to 1,505.42 billion yen (15.054 billion dollars) in the
six-month period.
</P>
<P>
The decline in the trade was expected because of the
devaluation of the yen, changing crude oil prices and increasing
imports of electronic products.

<HEADLINE> AT&AMP;T Partner Confident About Chinese Business </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, July 18 (Xinhua) -- AT&AMP;T Shanghai, Ltd., a joint
venture of the Shanghai government and Lucent Technologies,
formerly AT&AMP;T's network and system business, says it will keep its
leading position in China's telecommunications market.
</P>
<P>
Cees van Hoog, general manager of AT&AMP;T Shanghai, expressed his
optimism in a recent interview with Xinhua, saying that the
venture's present advantage will be buttressed by its outstanding
research staff and capital supply.
</P>
<P>
With sales of more than 80 million US dollars, the venture has
a market share of 30 per cent in China, and is the largest
supplier of optical fiber transmission equipment in China.
</P>
<P>
According to van Hoog, AT&AMP;T Shanghai got big orders for five
state-level optical trunk projects, including the
Shanghai-Nanjing, Shanghai-Hangzhou,
Beijing-Tianjin-Jinan-Nanjing, Xining-Lanzhou, and Guangxi-Haikou
cables, over the past five years.
</P>
<P>
Altogether, 22 state-level cable projects were launched by the
central government during the 1991-1995 period.
</P>
<P>
But, he admits, the competition is getting more severe, with
all major foreign companies entering China's telecom market and
bitter price wars beginning.
</P>
<P>
To cater to increasing demand for high-speed transmission from
the nation-wide upgrading of optical cables, the venture began
manufacturing synchronous digital hierarchy products instead of
pelsio-synchronous digital hierarchy ones, its main products in
the beginning.
</P>
<P>
"Only the technical advantage can ensure a steady expanding of
the market," van Hoog said.
</P>
<P>
With registered capital of 18 million US dollars, AT&AMP;T Shanghai
was jointly founded by the AT&AMP;T network and system business and
three local companies in March 1990. It is now the biggest
Sino-foreign joint venture in the telecommunications field.
</P>
<P>
Although it has a prestigious research and development branch
in Bell Laboratories in the US, van Hoog said the venture will
look for more local technicians to "cater to China's situation."

KATHMANDU, July 18 (Xinhua) -- The Nepali government today
urged employees of the state-run telecom corporation to end their
nearly two-week-long strike campaign in protest of the
government's privatization policy.
</P>
<P>
In an open letter issued today, the Ministry of Information and
Communications said that the long-time disruption of the vital
telecom services made a negative impact on the country, especially
when several parts were hit by floods in the last few days.
</P>
<P>
The ministry asked all workers of the Nepal Telecom Corporation
(NTC) to go to work.
</P>
<P>
Two workers' union of the NTC, who launched the nationwide
strike campaign, demanded that the government reconsider its
earlier decision to allow private companies to open new telecom
services like radio paging and mobile phones.
</P>
<P>
They warned that the privatization move would put in question
the national security and jeopardize the entire structure of the
telecom network in the country.
</P>
<P>
The government today promised that the evaluation work on the
privatization policy would be completed within one year and that
it would give full autonomy to the NTC, which is monopolizing the
country's telecom industry at present.
</P>
<P>
A consumer organization issued a statement here today urging
the government to hold direct talks with the NTC workers' unions
to solve the problem.

Shanghai this afternoon for Yu Chunshun, a Shanghai explorer who
died from dehydration and exposure on a trek through northwest
China's Lop Nur Desert last month.
</P>
<P>
The 46-year old Yu was a worker in the Shanghai Electric

their respect for the explorer. Three of them even walked ten hours
in the city's unseasonal heat to attend the service.
</P>
<P>
Yu Jinshan, the explorer's father, announced that a memorial
donation of 100,000 yuan (about 12,000 US dollars), collected from
his son's life insurance benefits, will be used to establish a

prepared to export wheat to Malaysia because the good trade and
diplomatic relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
He said China produced about 200 million tons of wheat a year
but it still had to import from Australia, the United States,
Canada and France.
</P>
<P>
But, he said, during a bumper crop like last year, China would
have enough stock to sell to Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
Abu Hassan said that China's offer would help Malaysia tackle
any future problem of wheat flour shortage, and urged Malaysia's
private sector to take the initiative to implement the barter
trade.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia is recently hit by flour shortage because millers cut
down on production due to the high price of wheat on the world
wheat markets.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu: Israel Ready to Resume Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu said here today that Israel is ready to resume peace
negotiations with Syria.
</P>
<P>
"It is our desire to negotiate a formal peace with Syria and
I've prepared to enter these negotiations right way," he told a
joint press conference with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
following their two-hour meeting.
</P>
<P>
But he did not say whether he would change his stance that
Israel opposes the return of Golan Heights to Syria because the
strategic plateau is "too important to Israel's security."
</P>
<P>
Once again, he stressed that Israel's security is the most
important issue in any peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
To have lasting peace region, he said, "we must have security
as the base." But he added that durable peace agreements will also
"contribute to the enhancement of stability and security."
</P>
<P>
Asked whether he accepts the land-for-peace principle,
Netanyahu said that there are "different interpretations" on the
formula and the way to apply it.
</P>
<P>
The land-for-peace principle has been the basis for the Middle
East peace process since its inception five years ago.
</P>
<P>
But Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu pledged here
today that Israel will keep its commitments to peace, and said
that he hopes other parties involved in the peace march also keep
their commitments.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu somewhat softened his tough stance by saying that he
believes the Middle East peace process would be based on "the
ideas of fulfilling existing commitments."
</P>
<P>
"All existing treaties are made to be fulfilled," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that Israel will implement the agreements signed with
the Palestinians by increasing the level of contacts with the
Palestinian side.
</P>
<P>
He said that Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy will meet with
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat next week, describing the
upcoming meeting as "an important step."
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu also did not rule out the possibility of holding a
meeting between him and Arafat.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister, on his first visit to an Arab state since
he took office last month, praised Egypt's role in the regional
peace process.
</P>
<P>
"I view Egypt as the most important country in our breakthrough
for peace," he told reporters.
</P>
<P>
He described his meeting with Mubarak as a "very good beginning
for the renewal of relations" between Israel and Egypt. "I think
we cleared the air. It's a very good air indeed," he added.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Mubarak expressed his satisfaction with his talks
with Netanyahu, saying that there are great hopes that the peace
process will continue.
</P>
<P>
"I can tell you that I am very relaxed now," he said.
</P>
<P>
At the press conference, Mubarak reiterated that peace
negotiations must be based on relevant U.N. Security Council
resolutions and the land-for-peace principle.
</P>
<P>
He said the principle is unnegotiable and peace negotiations
must be resumed without delay. "It will be a waste of time to
negotiate what has been agreed upon," he noted.
</P>
<P>
"It should not be impossible to reach an agreement on the
formula agreed upon," he added.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu, who on many occasions vowed to take a tough line on
Arab-Israeli talks, said that efforts must be intensified to
establish peace because it is important for the entire region
including Israel and Egypt.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu arrived here earlier today and was met by Egyptian
Prime Minister Kamal el-Ganzouri at the Cairo International
Airport. The two then left for Egypt's Tomb of the Unknown
Soldiers and the burial site of late President Anwar Sadat, who
became the first Arab leader to make peace with Israel in 1979.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians, Syria and Lebanon have especially concerned
that the whole peace process may be destroyed because of
Netanyahu's threat to abandon the land-for-peace principle,
embodied in relevant U.N. resolutions.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, which has played an active role in the peace process
as a mediator between Israel and the Arabs, particularly the
Palestinians, has been recently leading an Arab campaign to save
the peace process and press Israel to change its tough stance.
</P>
<P>
Last month, Egypt hosted a pan-Arab summit which sent a
strong message that the land-for-peace principle will continue to
be the basis for the peace process and Israel's political and
trade relations with the Arab world will be tied to progress in
the peace talks.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Women Cagers Eye Bronze Medal in Atlanta Olympics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, July 18 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese women's Olympic
basketball team, silver medalists in Barcelona, keeps a low
profile for the upcoming Olympic Games, aiming to strike a bronze
medal here.
</P>
<P>
"Our two-sponged goal at the Atlanta Olympics is to secure the
sixth place and then move on to strike the bronze medal," said
coach Chen Daohong.
</P>
<P>
"The current squad, composed of veterans and debutants, differs
from the team that won the silver medals at the previous Olympics
and the world championship," he added.
</P>
<P>
Although weaker than their predecessors, the Chinese women are
gearing up to firing their shots through one of the world's
dominating powers Zheng Haixia.
</P>
<P>
The 2.04-meter center, one of the two four-time Olympians in
the Chinese delegation, was named the Most Valuable Player at the
1994 world champioship after averaging 26.4 points and 13.1
rebounds per game.
</P>
<P>
Apart from two budding cagers Liang Xin and Miao Bo, the
current squad recruits five 1992 Olympians Li Xin, Li Dongmei,
Zheng Dongmei, Liu Jun and He Jun.
</P>
<P>
"While most veterans are not in their top form and our
newcomers lack experience in major international competitions, we
are in dire need of an expert passer," lamented Chen who took the
helm of the national squad two years ago.
</P>
<P>
"However, Haixia is excellent in her game despite the injuries
to her back and right knee," said the coach.
</P>
<P>
In the upcoming Centennial Games, China is expected to join the
top eight along with world champions Brazil and Eroupean bronze
medalists Russia from Group A where Japan is a certain outsider.
</P>
<P>
The return of Hortencia Marcari Oliva after her birth-giving
months ago is surely a spur to Brazil to the victory podium.
</P>
<P>
Hortencia, best line-up at the 1994 world championship, retired
early last June when she was pregnant.
</P>
<P>
Brazil's hope is also magnified through guard shooter Paula
DaSilva, forward scorer Janeth Arcain and center threater Lelia De
Souza Sobral.
</P>
<P>
Russia, who lost to the Americans 89-90 in an away game in
mid-June, was spearheaded by members of the Unified Team that
upset the Americans en route to its victory in Barcelona four
years ago.
</P>
<P>
Among the veterans were point guard Irina Sumnikova and Natalia
Svinukkhova, member of the 1995 European championship All-Star
team.
</P>
<P>
Host America is the farovite for both the gold medal and the
top leader of Group B which brackets European champions Ukraine,
Australia, Cuba, South Korea and Zaire.
</P>
<P>
"We hope we can win the gold medal this time," said coach Tara
VanDerveer who anchored his disciples last October to win all 51
warm-ups.
</P>
<P>
While those from Asia and Africa see no hopes in the group
preliminaries, Ukraine, also a medal candidate with the presence
of several members of the Unified Team, is strong inside with its
three-point performance.
</P>
<P>
Under the Olympic format which stipulates cross knockouts after
the group preliminaries, China has to secure the third spot in
Group A at least in order to skip an early encounter with the
United States, or it has little chance for a medal.
</P>
<P>
"All depends on our players' performance on the court," coach
Chen said. "We may win a bronze if we play well. Otherwise, we may
be away from the top eight."

<HEADLINE> Chinese Gymnasts Ready for Olympic Men's Team Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, July 18 (Xinhua) -- The gymnastics men's team finals
at the Centennial Olympics here next Monday will be a two-side
confrontation between current world champion China and Russia, the
main stake of the United Team which won the gold medal in the 1992
Barcelonal Games.
</P>
<P>
"I think Russia would be our top rival in the men's team
event," said Qian Kui, China's head coach who guided the team to
the victory podium last year in Sabae of Japan.
</P>
<P>
Since the break-down of the former Soviet Union, China has
emerged as the dominant force in men's gymnastics, winning its
first world championships in Dortmund in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The 23-year-old Li Xiaoshuang is the leading star for China. He
captured China's first ever all-around title in Sabae world
championships. Li was also the gold medalist on the floor in the
1992 Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
"This is my second and last Olympic Games. I'll do all I can to
bring the team the gold medal and fulfill our dream of being both
world and Olympic champions," said Li.
</P>
<P>
Li has just recovered from his year-long back injury and showed
his top form in Wednesday's podium training in the Gerogia Dome,
where China also sent their world champion team members Zhang
Jingjin, Huang Liping, Fan Hongbin, Shen Jian, Fan Bin as well as
two-time Olympian Li Jing.
</P>
<P>
"China has a well balanced team in all the events. We would
have a very good chance for the gold if we make no mistake in our
performence," said head coach Qian Kui.
</P>
<P>
From early April to late June, the Chinese Olympic selection
squad staged four qualifying tournaments and tests to choose its
final line-up for Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
"We had eight to 12 gymnasts at the same level, so we had to be
stringent with our qualifying standerds to choose our best," said
Qian.
</P>
<P>
But the Chinese head coach also pointed out that Russia had
been looking for a comeback after finishing a humilinating sixth
place in the Sabae World Championships.
</P>
<P>
"Russia was only 0.137 points behind China in the optionals and
the main reason for their fall-down was a poor performence in the
compulsories," Qian recalled. "But after a year of intensive
training in the compulsories, they'll be the top challenger for
China in Atlanta."
</P>
<P>
Behind China and Russia, there will be three or four teams
fighting for the bronze medal.
</P>
<P>
Spearheaded by Vitaly Scherbo, the only gymnast in history who
won six gold medals at one single Olympics, Belarus will head
Germany, Japan, Romania and Ukrain in the chase for the third
place.

The new Israeli prime minister have voiced objection to a

state and talks over the future of Arab east Jerusalem, which the
Palestinians want as the capital of their future state.
</P>
<P>
He has also vowed to build and expand Jewish settlements in the
Gaza Strip and West bank.
</P>
<P>
All these met with strong criticisms in the Arab world,
including Egypt.
</P>
<P>
Ali Ibrahim, editor-in-chief of Egypt's sole English language
newspaper the Egyptian Gazatte, urged Netanyahu to "speak to our
minds" in a front-page byline story story.
</P>
<P>
In the story, Ibrahim criticized the Israeli leader for his
short-signed vision concerning the Arab Israeli ties and the
Middle East peace process at large.
</P>
<P>
"Netanyahu's short-signed vision and lack of political
experience made him blind to obvious facts," he said.

<P>
FREETOWN, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Sierra Lenone rebel leader
Foday Sankoh has rejected peace overtures from the civilian
government, an official source said here today.
</P>
<P>
According to the source, the civilian government has offered
Sankoh the post of Adviser to President Tejan Kabbah or he would
the head of a state commission dealing with the rehabilitation of
former war combatants.
</P>
<P>
However, Sankoh turned down both offers and insists that he
would like the post of vice president while the key members of
his Revolutionary United Front (RUF) should be given cabinet
positions of RUF's choice, the source said.
</P>
<P>
The authoritative weekly Eastern Post newspaper also carried
the news today, quoting sources in Ivory Coast to confirm the
story.
</P>
<P>
The paper said the turn by Sankoh ''baffles everyone as Sankoh
has always insisted he had no political ambition.''
</P>
<P>
Sankoh's demands have put the government in a dilemma as it
would have to amend the constitution if it wants to bow down to
Sankoh's advances, a western diplomat said. enditem

<HEADLINE> Chinese Ship Classifier becomes Chairman of IACS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 18 (Xinhua) -- China Classification Society
(CCS), the ship check organization in the country, becomes the
Chairman of the International Association of Classification
Societies (IACS) this month.
</P>
<P>
It is the first time that CCS was elected chairman of this
world organization for major ship check societies since it joined
IACS in 1988, according to Dong Jiufeng, CCS's chairman and
president.
</P>
<P>
During its tenure of the post from July 1, 1996, to June 30,
1997, CCS will submit to the International Maritime Organization
amendments to the International Convention for the Safety of Life
at Sea (SOLAS) on the issue of safety for bulk carriers, set new
standards to improve the quality of ship inspectors, and try to
organize in Shanghai the first symposium on the latest
requirements for bulk carriers.
</P>
<P>
With its headquarters in Beijing, CCS has 49 branches and check
centers around the world. By the end of 1995, about 1,800 ships
were registered at CCS, with a total of 15.14 million tons, and 10
percent of these ships fly the flags of nations other than China.
</P>
<P>
By the year 2000, the number of CCS-class ships is expected
to reach 2,100, with a total of 17 million tons, and 20 percent of
them will fly the flags of other countries.
</P>
<P>
In 1994, the highest class notation of CCS was included in the
classification clauses of the Institute of London Underwriters
(ILU), which means that CCS-class ships can enjoy the same
preferential treatment of insurance premium as those classed by
other prominent classification societies.
</P>
<P>
CCS has signed co-operation agreements with 20 overseas
classification societies including all the members of IACS, and
has been entrusted by the governments of 12 countries and regions
to check ships that fly their flags.

considering its decision to allocate 60-million-U.S.-aid to
Somalia as a means to discredit his government.
</P>
<P>
In a press statement issued here, the leadership council of
General Aidid's government characterized the Europeans'
assistance to Somalia as "discriminatory policy meant to divide
Somalia."
</P>
<P>
This was referring to a recent announcement by the European
Union in Brussels that the target areas for the assistance will
include the regions of Northeast and Northwest (Somali Land),
Gedo and Middle Shabelle. All the designated areas are beyond the
control of Aidid's government.
</P>
<P>
The EU said long-term projects cannot be implemented in some
areas of the country owing to insecurity. It said the money will
be used for rehabilitation and public buildings.
</P>
<P>
In the statement, General Aidid accused the EU of targeting
its assistance to secessionist entity of Northwest Somalia and
other enclaves which advocate for the U.N. trusteeship.
</P>
<P>
He once again charged that it was the "naked policy" of EU
representative Sigurd Illing to discredit "the Somali
Transitional Government".
</P>
<P>
Aidid said his leadership council resolves to alert, mobilize
and inform the Somali people of the allocated "inimical
neo-colonialist policy of the EU" but will maintain friendly
relations with all nations in the world which accord "genuine
assistance with no strings attached."

<HEADLINE> Chinese Anti-Quake Technology Out In Front </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Minister of
Construction Hou Jie said today in Tangshan City, Hebei Province,
today that China has some very advanced anti-earthquake science
and technology.
</P>
<P>
The minister was speaking at an international symposium on
anti-quake technology in the northern Chinese city that was hit by
a strong earthquake on July 28, 1976.
</P>
<P>
Hou said that China has applied 4.4 billion yuan (540 million
U.S. dollars) to quake-resistant new buildings and reinforcement
of old ones.
</P>
<P>
China is frequently hit by earthquakes and 60 percent of its
big cities are located in earthquake zones.
</P>
<P>
Over the past 20 years, China had more than 260 quakes, which
killed 480,000 people and caused 35 billion yuan in losses.
</P>
<P>
Studies have shown that the casualties and losses were mainly
the result of buildings being destroyed.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that, after the Tangshan earthquake, the
government's policy became prevention first and it developed
anti-quake measures and technical standards for new buildings. It
also got more scientists to do research on earthquakes, building a
number of experimental bases and offering courses in universities.
</P>
<P>
New designs have been proven effective in earthquakes in recent
years, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
Some 100 Chinese and foreign experts and scientists are
attending the symposium, which is sponsored by the Ministry of
Construction and Hebei Province.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Concerned over Misallocation of Resources </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Vice-President Godfrey Miyanda
today expressed his concern at misallocation of resources and
blamed it for the poor economic performance in Zambia.
</P>
<P>
"We have so much resources at our disposal and Zambia would
not borrow if they were properly utilized," said Miyanda when
receiving the first copy of the 1996 U.N. Development Program
(UNDP) human development report from UNDP representative Gary
Davis at his office here.
</P>
<P>
The report indicates that economic growth has failed in many
countries and poverty has not been alleviated even where growth
has taken place.
</P>
<P>
It shows that Zambia is among 19 countries in the world with
per capita income remaining as low as when they were in the 1960s
or before.
</P>
<P>
The report also shows that economic decline or stagnation has
hit 89 countries over the past 10 years, reducing the incomes of
more than a quarter of the world's population.
</P>
<P>
Davis warned that no country could sustain high levels of
economic growth without a strong foundation of human development.

<HEADLINE> Obscene Word in Ads Creates Uproar in Jerusalem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 18 (Xinhua) -- A Jerusalem restaurant owner
paid dearly only to learn that extreme advertising could run counter
to his desire, because he used the obscene word "fuck" in street
advertisement.
</P>
<P>
Many Jerusalem residents were stunned Wednesday morning when
they woke up to see ads blaring the message "Who the fuck is
Chacko? " springing up overnight on street stand posters across
the city.
</P>
<P>
Chacko is the name of a new downtown fast-food restaurant
owned by Avi Rosenboim, who paid dearly for the ads designed by a
private advertising agency.
</P>
<P>
In the morning, the Jerusalem municipality was flooded with
phone calls from angry residents who strongly demanded the
removal of the obscene ads. Within hours, the municipality ordered
the advertising agency, Voeder Sigawi, to remove all the signs
from the streets.
</P>
<P>
The city spokesman's office stated that the municipality did
not approve every billboard or poster that goes up in the city,
but did reserve the right to remove any advertisement it deemed
offensive or inappropriate.
</P>
<P>
Rosenboim expressed regret for the affair. "We put a lot of
thought into this campaign and it obviously hasn't fulfilled our
expectations. We are changing the ads and are paying dearly for
this blunder," he said.
</P>
<P>
But Meni Sigawi, the agency director, defended his handling of
the advertisements, claiming that it professed only pure motives.
</P>
<P>
"What we intended to say was "Who the hell is Chacko? "
said Sigawi."I am baffled by the uproar. The word is
broadcast regularly on the radio and on television."
</P>
<P>
However, English-speakers in the city apparently interpreted it
 only one way. David Clayman, Israeli director of the American
Jewish Congress, expressed outrage and disgust at the ads.
</P>
<P>
"A new depth of vulgarity has been reached in a society
with a long, painful record of tastelessness," he said.
</P>
<P>
"It is not simply a matter of extreme ultra-Oxthodox
objection. This is offensive to everyone," he added.
</P>
<P>
Foreign tourists speaking English also found the ads
extremely offensive, and shocking, citing that Jerusalem as a
holy land should keep a special character, an extra dimension.
</P>
<P>
"It is doubly wrong to have such unseemly displays here,"
one said.

<TEXT>
<P>
The expert said that the idea of double layers of
oil-and-gas-bearing structures was developed by China in 1985 and
led to the discovery of a group of major oil fields in Bohai
Bay. Also, exploratory breakthroughs in the Sichuan Basin, Tarim
Basin, and Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Basin laid a good foundation for
methods in marine facies of oil and gas deposits dating back to
the Palaearctic Era.
</P>
<P>
According to Li Tianxiang, head of the Scientific and
Technological Commission of the China National Petroleum Corp
(CNPC), oilfields at Shengli, Liaohe, Zhongyuan, Huabei, and
Dagang in Bohai Bay have also developed better practices and
technology.
</P>
<P>
By using these, oilfields in Bohai Bay have found a total of
7.28 billion tons of geological oil resources and developed an
annual crude output of 61 million tons, the country's second
largest after Daqing.
</P>
<P>
Chinese petroleum geologists are still classifying structural
types of oil-and-gas-bearing basins in the eastern, central and
western parts of China.

Experts say that China's unique oil and gas exploration
practices have proven the abundance of oil and gas resources in
the vast areas of China.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu: No Redivision of Jerusalem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu repeated his stance on Jerusalem here today, saying that
the holy city must never be divided again.
</P>
<P>
He added that it is the "current principle for us that the
rights of the three faiths should be fully protected in the city."
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu, who arrived here earlier today on a brief working
visit to Egypt, made the remarks at a joint press conference with
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak following their two-hour meeting.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu, who took office to lead the new Israeli government
last month, has voiced objection to holding talks on the future of
Arab east Jerusalem, which the Palestinians want as the capital of
their future state.
</P>
<P>
He has time and again said that Jerusalem will remain Israel's
eternal and undivisible capital.
</P>
<P>
But the prime minister, on his first visit to an Arab state
since his election late May, seemed to have somewhat softened
his tough stance on the Middle East peace talks.
</P>
<P>
At the 30-minute press conference, Netanyahu pledged that
Israel will keep its commitments to peace, saying that he hopes
other sides also keep their commitments.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters that he believes the Middle East peace would
be based on "the ideas of fulfilling existing commitments."
</P>
<P>
"All existing treaties are made to be fulfilled," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that Israel will implement the agreements signed with
the Palestinians by increasing the level of contacts with the
Palestinian side.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu also said that it is important to alleviate the
economic burdens of the Palestinians, adding that Israel will ease
the closure imposed on the Palestinian self-rule areas and
allow an additional 10,000 Palestinian workers to enter Israel.
</P>
<P>
"Our intention is to make life easier for the Palestinians and
to open economic relationship with them," he said.
</P>
<P>
On the delayed redeployment of Israeli troops in Hebron, the
last West Bank town still under Israeli occupation, Netanyahu said
that the issue of Hebron is a very complicated one. But he added
that a satisfactory solution will be found to the issue.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak expressed his satisfaction with his talks with
Netanyahu, saying that there are great hopes that the peace
process will continue.
</P>
<P>
"I can tell you that I am very relaxed now," he said.
</P>
<P>
At the press conference, Mubarak reiterated that peace
negotiations must be based on relevant U.N. Security Council
resolutions and the land-for-peace principle, which have been the
basis for the peace process since its inception in Madrid, Spain,
five years ago.
</P>
<P>
He said the principle is unnegotiable and peace negotiations
must be resumed without delay. "It will be a waste of time to
negotiate what has been agreed upon."
</P>
<P>
"It should not be impossible to reach an agreement on the
formula agreed upon," he added.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu, who on many occasions vowed to take a tough line on
the Arab-Israeli talks, said that efforts must be intensified to
establish peace because it is important for the entire region
including Israel and Egypt.

<P>
HARARE, July 18 (Xinhua) -- The southern African branch of a
continental bank that will provide finance to support import and
export activities in Africa, was launched here today with the
signing of an agreement between Zimbabwe and Afreximbank.
</P>
<P>
Afreximbank is thus added to the increasing number of
multi-national and indigenous financial institutions in Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
Signing on behalf of Zimbabwe, Foreign Affairs Minister Stan
Mudenge said the establishment of the bank would ensure that
trade finance would be extended to exporters.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe is a major shareholder in Afreximbank with 2,500
shares worth 250 million Zimbabwe Dollars (25 million US
Dollars).
</P>
<P>
''Afreximbank provides financing through eligible trade
finance intermediaries, such as commercial banks, merchant banks,
export-import agencies and other designated institutions,'' said
Mudenge.
</P>
<P>
The idea to establish the bank was mooted by the board of
governors of the African Development Bank in 1987 to promote
economic development and support intra and extra African trade
activities, with its headquarters in Cairo, Egypt.
</P>
<P>
Afreximbank President Christopher Edordu, who signed on behalf
of the bank, said the institution would help foster integration
in Africa through the provision of short and medium-term finance.

CAIRO, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu pledged here today that Israel will keep its commitments
to peace, and said that he hopes other parties involved in the
peace march also keep their commitments.

At a joint press conference with Egyptian President Hosni

He said that Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy will

<P>
Netanyahu did not rule out the possibility of holding a meeting

</P>
<P>
For his part, Mubarak expressed his satisfaction with his talks

</P>
<P>
Netanyahu arrived here earlier today on his first visit to an
Arab state since he was elected prime minister late May.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians, Syria and Lebanon have especially concerned
that the whole peace process may be destroyed because of
Netanyahu's threat to abandon the land-for-peace principle,
embodied in relevant U.N. resolutions.
</P>
<P>
The new Israeli prime minister have voiced objection to a
return of the Golan Heights to Syria, an independent Palestinian
state and talks over the future of Arab east Jerusalem, which the
Palestinians want as the capital of their future state.
</P>
<P>
He has also vowed to build and expand Jewish settlements in the
Gaza Strip and West bank.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, which has played an active role in the peace
process as a mediator between Israel and the Arabs, particularly
the Palestinians, has been recently leading an Arab campaign to
save the peace process and press Israel to change its tough
stance.
</P>
<P>
Last month, Egypt hosted a pan-Arab summit which sent a
strong message that the land-for-peace principle will continue to
be the basis for the peace process and Israel's political and
trade relations with the Arab world will be tied to progress in
the peace talks.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Women Spikers Climb Cliff for Olympic Medals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Ten years ago, the Chinese women
spikers peaked by winning five world titles in a row. But now
their successors are only tempted to mount a prickly cliff en
route to their hopeful bronze medals at the Centennial Olympic
Games in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
A dire situation confronts the new squad which is coached by
Lang Ping, former ace spiker who had orchestrated her peers to
reap five world titles from 1981 to 1986.
</P>
<P>
"We have to topple either world champions Cuba or World Cup
runners-up Brazil or the hosts the United States to clinch a berth
on the ceremony podium," said the 35-year-old woman coach.
</P>
<P>
Pooled in Group A, China is tipped to advance together with the
United States into the semifinals where Cuba and Brazil are
expected to secure the other two spots.
</P>
<P>
"Although our girls have no upper hand in technical skills or
in experience, they are young and full of hopes and will surely
stage serious threats against the leading trio in Atlanta as well
as in the world," said Lang Ping.
</P>
<P>
After the intensive training in their home camp prior to the
Olympics, ace attacker Sun Yue, 23, is full of confidence. "There
is enough pressure for us to beat one of the top three," she said.
"But we are going to reap a good harvest through our unremitting
efforts."
</P>
<P>
That may be achieved by the Chinese women who have not tasted
the juicy title for 10 years after their predecessors bid farewell
to the world champion at the 1988 Seoul Olympics.
</P>
<P>
In May last year, China outwitted stars-absent Cuba twice on
the home turf and became the Asian champions before winning four
straight victories against the United States this year.
</P>
<P>
However, the Chinese women are still rough in both skills and
teamwork which justify their fourth finish at the so-called
mini-Olympics last month in Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
"We're in a position to challenge the top trio, and any merit
can only be achieved through performances on the spot," said the
Chinese head coach.
</P>
<P>
For years, Cuba, led by Mireya Luis, is still the dominant
force in the women's volleyball after making its Olympic debut in
the 1964 Tokyo Games, and it comes to Atlanta as the heavy
favorite for a second consecutive gold medal after reaping its
third successive World Cup win in Japan last November.
</P>
<P>
Both Brazil and the United States are sure to vie for the
medals offered at the Games to be opened Friday evening.
</P>
<P>
In the men's version, Italy appeares certain to continue its
winning streak that includes two World Leagues, two European
championships and one world title.
</P>
<P>
And fans can look for both Brazil and the Netherlands to fight
out for the silver and bronze medals through masculine jump
serves.
</P>
<P>
As beach volleyball is introduced for the first time into the
Olympic agenda, Brazilian pair Sandra Pires and Jackie Silva are
hot favorites for the top honor.
</P>
<P>
Other contenders include another Brazilian duo of Monica
Rodrigues and Adriana Samuel, American Holly McPeak and Nancy
Reno, and Australian Natalie Cook and Kerri Ann Pottharst.
</P>
<P>
Karch Kiraly, two-time Olympic court volleyball champion, and
his American partner Kent Steffes are the prime candidates for the
first Olympic men's title from the beach.

<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Zhou Xingqi used to share the
dream of many villagers in China - that life in the big cities was
best.
</P>
<P>
So 30 years ago he bid farewell to his wife and children, left
his poor village in east Chian's Jiangsu province, to seek his
fortune in China's biggest city Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
Every month for years he sent home money to his family in
their faraway village, as he toiled in the big city.
</P>
<P>
When asked what he would do if he had his time over again, the
62-year old retired worker's reply is firm and resolute: If he
could be born again he would stay in his hometown as a farmer, and
would not become an urban dweller.
</P>
<P>
A year ago, Zhou Xingqi retired from the Dalong Machinery Plant
in Shanghai at the age of 61. He returned to his hometown of
Changjiang Village, Zhangjiagang City, Jiangsu Province, to live
with his son and family.
</P>
<P>
It was the village where three decades earlier he had bid his
farewell to his wife and children, and left for Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
Changjiang Village covers an area of only one square
kilometer, but has a population of 3,200. It has become
increasingly prosperous since China initiated the policies of
reform and opening up to the outside world in 1979.
</P>
<P>
Last year factories run by the village manufactured 410 million
yuan's worth of machinery, electrical products, clothing and
building materials. The average per capita net income of villagers
was 7,000 yuan.
</P>
<P>
Zhou Xingqi showed reporters around his son's two-story house
built two years ago. With a floor space of 380 sq m, the house has
such household electric appliances as an air-conditioner, a gas
water heater, a TV set and a telephone set.

"I don't think there is any difference between my village and a
city in any way. Believe me, so far as housing conditions are
concerned, my village is far better than big cities like
Shanghai," Zhou said.
</P>
<P>
Changjiang Village serves as an example of the narrowing gap
between town and country in the Yangtze River Delta and other
developed areas in China.
</P>
<P>
Marked differences between town and country, a big problem
confronting China, are vanishing gradually in some areas of
China. These areas include the Pearl River Delta in south China's
Guangdong Province bordering Hong Kong, the Minjiang River Delta
facing Taiwan region, the Yangtze River Delta in Jiangsu and
Zhejiang provinces, the Yellow River Delta in north China, the
Shandong Peninsula in coastal Shandong Province and the Liaodong
Peninsula in north China's Liaoning Province.
</P>
<P>
While visiting rural areas in coastal areas, reporters found
that many villages provide old-age pensions and free education to
villagers, who also enjoy free medical care. Many villages are
becoming towns with running water and heating facilities available
and the sports, cultural and entertainment services as well.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that Zhejiang Province on the southern part of
the Yangtze River now has 2,200 towns, up from 181 in 1978, and
that nine million farmers, a quarter of Zhejiang's rural
population, have become urban residents.

<P>
Becoming a factory worker in a big city used to be a dream for
farmers. But since the 1980s, large numbers of farmers have become
factory workers in their own villages, as a result of the
mushrooming of township enterprises. Moreover, more urban
residents now work in township factories in rural areas.
</P>
<P>
A sample survey indicates that one third of workers in township
factories in Xishan, Jiangyin and Yixing cities in Jiangsu
Province come from nearby urban areas.
</P>
<P>
Many university students are beginning to take working in
township factories as their first choice of employment upon their
graduation.
</P>
<P>
But in the past, rural children looked to studying in a
university as the best way to leave the countryside.
</P>
<P>
The Hongdou Group, a well-known clothing company based in a
village 40 km from downtown Wuxi, Jiangsu province, employs 6,000
people, including 600 college graduates from all parts of the
country.
</P>
<P>
Gao Nengbin, a villager in Jinjiang Village in the suburbs of
the Zhejiang provincial capital of Hangzhou, said that the village
has bought pension and medical care policies for all villagers.
</P>
<P>
He said that the village, which turned out 500 million yuan
worth of manufactured goods and farm produce last year, also
finances physical checks-up and travel for villagers over the age
of 60.
</P>
<P>
Economists agree that so far as material life is concerned,
rural residents in developed coastal areas have almost everything
that urban dwellers have. But these areas are still behind cities
in terms of quality of life in areas such as education,
recreational activities and medical care.
</P>
<P>
One economist said that the further narrowing of the gap
between towns and villages will find expression primarily in the
improvement in educational and cultural standards of rural
residents, and the changes in their life style.

<HEADLINE> Advancing Implementation of AFTA Impossible: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 18 (Xinhua) -- An ASEAN official has stated that
it is impossible to advance the implementation of the ASEAN Free
Trade Area (AFTA) from the year 2003 to 2000 since its members
have different levels of development.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press briefing here today after an ASEAN steering
committee meeting, Director General of the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Rahardjo Jamtono said "We are very
serious in trying to speed up the implementation of the AFTA."
</P>
<P>
However, he ruled out the prospects of advancing the
implementation of the trade liberalization scheme which would
reduce tens of thousands of tariffs among member countries, saying
that the development levels of the member countries should be
considered.
</P>
<P>
He cited that for Vietnam, the ASEAN's newest member which has
just started liberalizing its trade and investment, the AFTA takes
effect in 2006.
</P>
<P>
Some ASEAN countries are keen on reducing tariffs down to zero
to five percent levels by 2000, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, the ASEAN official said that different economic levels
among the member countries would not affect plans to expand the
grouping's membership to include Myanmar, Cambodia and Laos over
the next two years.

<HEADLINE> Liberia Seeks Nigeria's Help to Restore Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Liberia has called on nigeria to
help end its six-year-old war by enthroning a credible
government, saying it is determined to get its dignity back by
forming a good government.
</P>
<P>
Liberians would have to take the initiative to ensure peace in
their country, but the support of west African nations, Nigeria
in particular, is necessary in ending the crisis, said Victoria
Reffel, Liberia's Minister of Culture and Tourism on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with Nigeria's Information and Culture Minister
Walter Ofonagoro in Abuja, capital of Nigeria, Reffel said she
and the delegation were in Nigeria to appeal for the country's
support in Liberia's democratic initiatives, the Guardian paper
reported today.
</P>
<P>
Reffel said normalcy can only return to Liberia when peace and
good governance are enthroned.
</P>
<P>
''Only the enthronement of an elected government would
increase the credibility of the Liberian nation, because a
country without an elected government is no country,'' she noted.
</P>
<P>
According to the Abuja peace accord signed by the warring
factions of Liberia last August, general elections are scheduled
in late August this year. But the renewed factional fighting
since this April has cast doubts on whether elections can be held
as planned although a ceasefire has been reached recently.
</P>
<P>
Despite the seeming peace following the suspension of
hostilities, the Liberian capital of Monrovia remains unsafe and
the current peace in the country is fragile as no group has
attained military superiority in the factional fighting recently,
observers here considered.
</P>
<P>
According to ofonagoro, a round table conference is necessary
for the warring factions to negotiate peace. ''Lasting peace
could not be fostered amid fighting. The war must be stopped,''
he added.
</P>
<P>
''Disarmament is very necessary before peace can be achieved
because nobody can negotiate when a gun is pointed at him,'' the
Nigerian minister noted.
</P>
<P>
Ofonagoro's view is slightly different from that of Reffel,
who said last week that total disarmament is not necessary for
elections in countries like Liberia.
</P>
<P>
Sierra Leone, South Africa and Cambodia have set an example in
this regard, observers said.
</P>
<P>
At present, the Nigeria-led peacekeeping force of the Economic
Community of West African States (ECOWAS) operating in Liberia,
known as ECOMOG, is monitoring the disarmament of ethnic factions
in Monrovia.

<P>
MACAO, July 18 (Xinhua) -- The Macao Productivity and
Technology Transfer Center was formally opened today as a
non-profit organization aiming to improve the productivity level
and competitiveness of Macao's industry and products.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Eric Yeung, president of the center, said at the opening
ceremony that the center will offer such services as training,
consultation and technology transfer to help upgrade the local
industry.
</P>
<P>
Co-established by the Macao government and entrepreneurs, the
center will conduct wide-range exchange and cooperation with other
productivity organs around the world and help introduce advanced
technology and management to Macao, Yeung said.
</P>
<P>
Officials of the Chinese side and the Portuguese side sent
congratulation messages on the establishment of the center,
calling it a major event in the economic life of Macao.
</P>
<P>
Wang Jinxiang, deputy director of the Xinhua News Agency Macao
Branch, said at the ceremony that he expects the center to play an
active role in improving the productivity and management level of
Macao's industry.
</P>
<P>
He said he hoped that the center would enhance Macao's exchange
and cooperation with scientific institutions on China's mainland,
which has plenty of talented people and scientific achievements.

<HEADLINE> China's Profitable Exploratory Work in Oil and Gas  (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 18 (Xinhua) -- China's petroleum industry has
benefited from forty years of research and experience, developing
its unique practices in oil and gas exploration.
</P>
<P>
According to oil specialists in Beijing, this mainly involves
studies of oil formations in continental facies, double layers of
oil-and-gas-bearing structures, structural analysis of Chinese
oil-and-gas-bearing basins, and deposits in sedimentary basins
dating back to the Mesozoic and Cenozoic Eras.
</P>
<P>
Li Desheng, an academic with the China Academy of Sciences,
said that the ideas about oil formation of continental facies
first developed in China led to the discovery of the Daqing Oil
Field in northeast China, the country's largest, in the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
The practices there enabled China to take its place in the
world, no longer a country that was poor in oil resources. The
discovery and development of a series of major oilfields in the
Junggar Basin, at Daqing, and in the Shengli Oilfield between the
1950s and 1970s not only demonstrated the sense of the methods,
but also revealed the existence of large or extra-large oilfields
in structures of continental facies.
</P>
<P>
Some 95 percent of the country's annual oil output and 44
percent of gas output now come from oilfields in continental
facies.

<HEADLINE> Multi-million-dollar Contracts For Chinese Dam Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 18 (Xinhua) -- After nearly a year of bidding,
three contracts worth a total of 87.6 million yuan (about 10.6
million US dollars) were signed here today for equipment for
construction of the gigantic Three Gorges Dam Project.
</P>
<P>
The China Yangtze Three Gorges Project Development Corporation
(CTGPC), which is in charge of the project, signed the contracts
for the second phase of the dam project, which will begin after
the Yangtze is dammed in November 1997, and be finished in 2003
when the powerhouse of the project starts generating electricity.
</P>
<P>
Under the terms of the contracts, the company will buy
high-mounted portal cranes from the Shanghai Port Machinery Plant,
side dumpers from North Haulers Ltd Liability Company, and
concrete buckets from the Liujiaxia Hydraulic Equipment Plant.
</P>
<P>
A company official revealed that the French company Potain is
still negotiating with CTGPC for supplying equipment for the
second phase of the project, but have not come to terms yet.
</P>
<P>
A total of 11.5 million cubic meters of concrete and 130,000
tons of steel are needed for the second phase, which involves a
great deal of difficulty and labor, with peak annual use of
concrete of as much as four million cubic meters and peak monthly
use of 400,000 cubic meters. This is a world record for
hydro-electric construction projects.
</P>
<P>
He Gong, vice-president of CTGPC, explained that the major
feature of this round of international bidding is that the
companies not only provide equipment but also come up with
construction plans for CTGPC's reference.
</P>
<P>
Since last August, documents were bought by 13 companies or
consortia from China, France, Japan and elsewhere. Seven submitted
tenders, which were opened on January 15.
</P>
<P>
In order to oversee construction work on the dam and powerhouse
during the second phase, CTGPC asked more than 20 experts, over
the past half year, to assess the bids and study bidders'
proposals, as well as technical performance of their equipment.
</P>
<P>
The bidding, which lasted nearly one year, was open to
competition, and completely fair, said the vice-president, who
went on to say that the purchasing is not yet completed, because
the equipment will be procured in phases. Therefore, bidders still
have the right to come up with better construction designs.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that manufacturers keep their competitive edge while
continuing to cooperate with CTGPC in an honest way," he said.

<HEADLINE> China Barters Wheat for Palm Oil from Malaysia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, July 18 (Xinhua) -- China today agreed in
principle to barter wheat for palm oil from Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
This agreement was signed at a meeting here by Malaysian
Minister of Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs Abu Hassan Omar
and visiting Chinese Vice Minister of Internal Trade Luo Zhiling.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after their meeting, Luo Zhiling said China was
prepared to export wheat to Malaysia because the good trade and
diplomatic relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
He said China produced about 650,000 million tons of wheat a
year but it still had to import from Australia, the United States,
Canada and France.
</P>
<P>
But, he said, during a bumper crop like last year, China would
have enough stock to sell to Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
Abu Hassan said that China's offer would help Malaysia tackle
any future problem of wheat flour shortage, and urged Malaysia's
private sector to take the initiative to implement the barter
trade.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia is recently hit by flour shortage because millers cut
down on production due to the high price of wheat on the world
wheat markets.

<HEADLINE> China to Aid More Big Garment Companies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 18 (Xinhua) -- China will help more large-scale
garment companies improve their production scale and capital
supply and enhance their competitive edge both in the domestic and
overseas markets.
</P>
<P>
According to Dong Binggen, a senior official with the China
Garment Association (CGA), the country's clothing industry
watchdog, one of the major targets of China's garment business
will be accelerating the management reform in state-owned
enterprises over the next five years.
</P>
<P>
Dong, chairman of the CGA working council, made the remarks
during an address at a national clothing conference.
</P>
<P>
In order to establish an economy of scale to supersede the
traditional labor-intensive one, the large and medium-sized
enterprises, most of which are debt-ridden and face challenges
from foreign competitors, should be given more preferential access
to the state's technical innovation investment, Dong said.
</P>
<P>
However, the country's 40,000 small garment plants should be
leased or transformed into stockholding companies, he added.
</P>
<P>
Over the past five years, China injected 2.3 billion yuan into
the technical renovation projects of garment enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Several large-scale garment conglomerates have formed, whose
business capacities maintain double-digit growth every year.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1995, more than 40 garment firms reported an
annual sales volume in excess of 100 million yuan each, with
profits surpassing 10 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the profits and taxes of the 40 leading
firms account for one-third of the entire industry.
</P>
<P>
Dong said that the state's aid program will begin in
enterprises along the Yangtze River and Pearl River Deltas, where
the clothing industry is more developed than in the rest of the
country.
</P>
<P>
In addition to approving licenses for exports and imports,
which in the 1980s belonged only to the state-run foreign trade
companies, the Chinese government will also help the firms improve
their technology and design standards, and expand sales channels.
</P>
<P>
The government will encourage the firms to launch chain stores
and speciality shops, as well as overseas businesses.

<P>
LANZHOU, July 18 (Xinhua) -- It was a place where clothes grew
on trees, harvests were plentiful and people lived in magnificent
palaces. They bathed in sweet and refreshing waters in the Pool of
Seven Treasures, and journeyed above the clouds in flying boats.
</P>
<P>
Pillars of gleaming pearl turned night into day along the
brightly lit streets. There were no war, crime or disease, and
treasures could be found everywhere. Doors were never closed and
all creatures lived in harmony.
</P>
<P>
This was the Utopian life dreamed of in China centuries ago -
and caught in graphic detail on one of the world's biggest wall
paintings.
</P>
<P>
People are sitting in the clouds, enjoying dances performed by
beautiful ladies and music played by rare animals, in this faraway
land of dreams.
</P>
<P>
It is part of the ancient Chinese idea of an ideal life,
revealed in China's Dunhuang Grottos.
</P>
<P>
Hu Tongqing, research fellow at the Institute of Dunhuang in
northwest China's Gansu Province, has been studying the topic for

describe an ideal living environment for Chinese people from the
Fourth to 14th Century.
</P>
<P>
Inscribed on the world heritage list by the United Nations, the
Dunhuang Grottos have some 45,000 square meters of wall paintings,
dating from the Northern Wei Dynasty (386-534) to the Yuan Dynasty
(1271-1368).
</P>
<P>
Focusing on Buddhist subjects, the wall paintings depict food,
clothing, housing, travel, entertainment and a social order close
to human life, all of course the very best people could then
imagine.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 18 (Xinhua) -- The following is Philippine
business news in brief:
</P>
<P>
-- The International Monetary Fund (IMF) agreed earlier this
week to the Philippines' economic program highlighting this year's
growth target of between 6.5 and 7.5 percent, an estimated
inflation rate of 7.55 percent and a projected budget surplus of
17.5 billion pesos (673 million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
-- The Philippines' rice stock inventory as of June 1 was
placed at 1.73 million tons, 44 percent higher than the 1.2
million tons recorded a year ago, according to the latest report
by the Bureau of Agricultural Statistics. The report said that
the stock was expected to last 84 days, falling six days short of

<HEADLINE> Grottos Reveal Ideal Life in Eye of Ancient Chinese (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The ancient Chinese dreamed that crops can be harvested seven
times and different kinds of clothes could grow out of trees.
</P>
<P>
Magnificent palaces were a desired residence. The compounds,
decorated with luxury jewels, composed of winding corridors and
pavilions and palaces, with their flying eaves touching each other.
</P>
<P>
Bathing in sweet and refreshing water in the Pool of Seven
Treasures, people were able to adjust the temperature and amount
of water at will.
</P>
<P>
Carts driven by dragons or phoenix were popular modes of
transport in the land that never was. A boat flying over clouds
was also found in a painting from the Five Dynasties. According to
Hu, it might well be the first human image of a spaceship.
</P>
<P>
The streets, bright in the night with pillars of pearls serving
as road-side lights, were kept extremely clean because a
malevolent spirit would let the ground open to swallow dirty
things.
</P>
<P>
No robberies, no wars, no casualties and no diseases. Treasures
were found everywhere, people could sleep with their doors open,
and all the creatures live in harmony.
</P>
<P>
"All these, however, are just part of the idea of an ideal life
craved by the ancient Chinese, " Hu said.
</P>
<P>
He explained that ancient Chinese developed two concepts of
happiness -- Hong Fu and Qing Fu.
</P>
<P>
Hong Fu refers to worldly success based on power, wealth and
pleasure-seeking, while Qing Fu emphasizes mental happiness.
</P>
<P>
In the grottos are also pictures of thatched cottages of a
pastoral flavor. Hu said that this kind of residences were desired
by many ancient intelligent folks, who sought a simple life and an
easy mind.
</P>
<P>
"Perhaps what they were seeking was more close to Buddhism, the
theme of the Grottos, " Hu says. It shows that centuries ago
people had dreams, just like today's population.

<HEADLINE> Asians to Split Badminton Olympic Gold Medals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, July 18 (Xinhua) -- A clean sweep of all three medals
by Indonesian men's singles shuttlers in Barcelona four years ago
is not to be repeated here in Atlanta, but it remains to be Asians
to split the five golds at stake in the Olympic badminton
tournament.
</P>
<P>
China's Dong Jiong, 22, currently ranked first in the world,
stands out as one of the hot favorites to vie for the men's title,
together with compatriot Sun Jun, Danish veteran Paul Larsen and
world championship runner-up Park Sung-Woo of South Korea.
</P>
<P>
Dong, a fleet-footed Chinese, leapt four places to clinch the
top spot in the world ranking one month after the Olympic
qualifiers in April. The budding Chinese whipped Indonesia's
Olympic champion Allan Budy Kusuma and World Cup winner Joko
Suprianto early this year.
</P>
<P>
The 22-year-old Sun is still cherishing his clean 3-0 win-loss
slate against world champion Heryanto Arbi of Indonesia in their
previous head-on-head encounters.
</P>
<P>
Even so, both Suprianto and Arbi still keep Inodonesia in the
medals platform.
</P>
<P>
As badminton remains to be the traditional sport in Southeast
Asia, Larsen, two-time All-England champion who is to celebrate
his 31st birthday on September 20, is counted as the sole European
player capable of challenging the Oriental monopoly in the sport.
</P>
<P>
In the Barcelona Olympic Games, the Asians bagged all but one
bronze medal in the men's singles competition.
</P>
<P>
The women's title in Atlanta is already within the pockets of
the world's leading trio of world champion Ye Zhaoying of China,
reigning Olympic champion Susi Susanti of Indonesia and new
All-England champion Bang Soo-Hyun of South Korea.
</P>
<P>
Susanti, currently coached by Liang Qiuxia of China, retains
her confidence by beating both Chinese Ye and Korean Bang in the
Uber Cup finals in May.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian woman remains a hard nut with steady performance
although she is dropping from her peak form.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, Ye collected five major titles including the World
Championships, the World Cup and the Grand Prix finals, and
dethroned Susanti from her three-year reign at the world top spot
by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
However, the Chinese star is being plagued by the injuries to
her waist which dealt her a blow in the Olympic warm-up when she
lost to teammate world championship runner-up Han Jingna on July
6.
</P>
<P>
Korean Bang, Olympic silver medalist in Barcelona, returned to
the court this year after injuries to take both the Korean Open
and the All-England titles prior to her loss to Susanti in the
Uber Cup finals.
</P>
<P>
In the Olympic doubles events, the women's gold is to be
contested between the world number one Chinese duo of Ge Fei and
Gu Jun, and world champions Gil Young-Ah and Jang Hye-Ock of South
Korea.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia's Ricky Subagja and Rexy Mainaky, the world and
All-England champions, are overwhelming favorites for the men's
doubles, while Park Joo-Bong of South Korea, who comes out of
retirement, is sure to win the mixed title by pairing with Ra
Kyung-Min.

<HEADLINE> Tibetans Craving to Send Children to Inland Cities for Education (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When the classes were first offered, Tibetans were not as
enthusiastic about enrolling their children, said Liu Boqing, an
official with the education commission of the Tibet Autonomous
Region, who organized the classes.
</P>
<P>
Parents worried their children would be unaccustomed to living
with strangers, such as the Han people, or that they would find
themselves helpless in strange circumstances.
</P>
<P>
"When I saw my daughter grow stronger and wear more fashionable
clothes when she came back for the first vacation, my misgivings
were dispelled," a mother said.
</P>
<P>
Liu said he is delighted that increasing numbers of farmers and
herdsmen are encouraging their children to take the entrance
examinations.
</P>
<P>
According to the requests of the State Education Commission,
more than 70 percent of those recruited by inland classes should
be children of farmers and herdsmen. The state pays for traveling
expenses for the poor.
</P>
<P>
"The change in Tibetans' attitude toward their children's
education, from the preference for monasteries to inland classes,
has been remarkable and positive," Liu claimed.
</P>
<P>
Many others believe that the change is a result of increasingly
frequent exchanges between Tibetan people and the rest of the
country.

<HEADLINE> Tibetans Craving to Send Children to Inland Cities for Education (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Tibetans used to be proud when their
children were accepted as young lamas by monasteries. Now they do
whatever they can to send their children to inland city schools.
</P>
<P>
Wangdui and Deng Yuanjun, a middle-aged couple in Lhasa, have
spent more than 10 years building a cozy home.
</P>
<P>
Now, their only expectation is that their 13-year-old son,
Pemba Cering, can pass the entrance examination to enroll in the
Classes for Tibetan Children offered in inland cities.
</P>
<P>
Pemba finished his primary education last year, but failed the
exam that would take him inland. With his relatively high scores,
he could have attended any secondary school in Lhasa, but his
parents decided that he would take another exam this year.
</P>
<P>
Pemba's parents do not blame him for his exam score. "Too many
families want their children to go to the inland cities for better
education, and the competition is too fierce," Wangdui said.
</P>
<P>
Since 1985, the Chinese government has offered classes in
cities, where higher education levels are more common, in order to
provide free secondary and high school education for Tibetan
children.
</P>
<P>
These classes usually are taught by the most qualified local
teachers. Tibetan language lessons are taught and daily lives
managed by Tibetan teachers sent from the Tibet Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
"With a good education, the kids who return from inland classes
will easily land good jobs," Wangdui said.
</P>
<P>
With this in mind, more parents in Lhasa, as well as in the
whole autonomous region, are sending their children to vie for the
chance to attend "inland classes."
</P>
<P>
Among this year's 16,000 primary school graduates, only one out
of 10 will be selected to go to the inland schools.
</P>
<P>
Other parents view the classes as an opportunity for their
children to become more broad-minded and gain added skills and
personal confidence.
</P>
<P>
"I hope my daughter will have the chance to study in an inland
class, where she will learn how to take care of herself alone in
addition to receiving good academic studies," a parent said about
his only child.

TOKYO, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Japan's nine large and second-tier
contractors are expected to report improvements in earnings for
fiscal 1996 on a consolidated basis, Kyodo News Service quoted a
major business daily as reporting Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The nine companies are predicted to post a combined net profit
of 16.3 billion yen for the year ending next March 31, a

BEIJING, July 18 (Xinhua)-- Chinese Premier Li Peng said today
that with the development of China's economy and the improvement
of people's life, the country's insurance industry promises great
development in the future, with a large market for insurance.
</P>
<P>
Li made the statement while meeting in Beijing with Rolf Huppi,
chairman of Zurich Insurance of Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
Li said that with the economic development, and the rise in
people's living standards, China's insurance industry will develop
significantly, and the insurance market is remarkably large.
</P>
<P>
"China is willing to absorb and learn from the successful
experience of large insurance companies in developed countries
which have enjoyed good capital credibility and have a long
history, " he said, adding that China hopes to expand its
cooperation with such companies.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Huppi briefed the Chinese leader on the
operations of Zurich Insurance, saying that it's the largest

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Promises to Abide by Peace Agreements </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu pledged here today to abide by the agreements Israel has
signed with its Arab neighbors, and also said he was ready to
begin talks with Syria.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli prime minister made this pledge at a joint press
conference here with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, with whom
he had held talks for one hour.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that the peace should be based on the idea of
fulfilling existing commitments," Netanyahu said, in an apparent
effort to pacify the angry Arabs who outcried over his previous
hard-line statements on the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu, however, also pointed to "different interpretations"
of the land-for-peace formula, which has served as the basis for
Arab-Israeli negotiations since the Madrid conference held in
Spain in 1991.
</P>
<P>
Despite a strain in Egyptian-Israeli relations which was
described by some Middle East watchers as "cold peace," Netanyahu
praised Egypt's role in promoting the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Egypt spearheaded the Arab-Israeli reconciliation in 1979, and
it has played the role of a mediator between Israel and other Arab
countries ever since.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu arrived here earlier today and was greeted by
Egyptian Prime Minister Kamal al-Ganzouri at the Cairo
International Airport.
</P>
<P>
The two men then went to Egypt's Tomb of the Unknown Soldier
and the burial site of late President Anwar Sadat, who was
assassinated by Moslem fundamentalists in 1981 for his role in
launching the Arab-Israeli reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
This is Netanyahu's first visit to an Arab country as Israel's
prime minister. Observers here believe that his visit is aimed at
diminishing the Arab indignation over his hard-line stances
towards the Arab countries.

<HEADLINE> Taming of Huaihe River Eases Fears in Flood Season </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HEFEI, July 18 (Xinhua) -- As the torrential downpours
continue, water levels in the Huaihe River are rising rapidly.
</P>
<P>
But people in the valley are quietly going about their routine
work and daily life as usual.
</P>
<P>
The market at the Huaihe River in Bengbu city, Anhui province,
is stocked with abundant goods with stable prices, all the shops
are open as normal, and enterprises are operational.
</P>
<P>
"This is attributable to the role played by the newly-built
water conservancy projects on the river," said Zhao Wujing,
chairman of Huaihe River Water Conservancy Committee under the
Ministry of Water Resources.
</P>
<P>
Located between the Yangtze and Yellow rivers, China's two
largest waterways, the Huaihe River runs into the sea via Henan,
Anhui, Jiangsu and Shandong provinces.
</P>
<P>
Its valley covers 270,000 square kilometers, and has a
population of 143 million. It is one of the areas in the country
frequently hit by floods.
</P>
<P>
Soon after a severe flood disaster in 1991, the Chinese
government listed the harnessing of the Huaihe River as a key task.
</P>
<P>
The State Council, or the central government, has invested 10
billion yuan in the construction of 18 key water conservancy
projects along the river during the 1991-2000 period.
</P>
<P>
More than four billion yuan have already been used over the
past five years, in building 13 projects which are now functioning.
</P>
<P>
As a result, flood relief courses along some sections on the
upper and middle reaches of the Huaihe River have been widened to
allow the water to flow much faster to avert flooding. Dams and
dykes have also been strengthened.
</P>
<P>
According to Zhao, the central government will build more water
conservancy projects along the Huaihe River by the end of the
century to form a complete anti-flood system that will ensure the
river to remain a friend, rather than an enemy to the local
residents.

<HEADLINE> Cry for Pure Chinese Comic Books </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 18 (Xinhua) -- China's plans to find its own
home-grown cartoon characters for children has won backing from
the country's president Jiang Zemin.
</P>
<P>
Plans have already been unveiled to seek Chinese rivals for
American favorites such as Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to Shanghai Animation Film Studio, President Jiang
Zemin expressed his hope that Chinese children would soon have
their own cartoon heroes.
</P>
<P>
China has set up five major comic book publishing houses to
meet the needs of children's interests, according to today's
People's Daily.
</P>
<P>
Most of the cartoon heroes on TV screens, and in comic books in
China are foreign, and there are few pure Chinese cartoon heroes
in the toy and comic book market, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
The Propaganda Department of the Central committee of the
Communist Party of China and the State Administration of Press and
Publication jointly initiated a project to set up five children's
cartoon publishing houses, to print 15 key comic books and publish
five children's cartoon periodicals.
</P>
<P>
All these publishing houses have adhered to the principle of
printing purely Chinese comic books, the newspaper said.

<HEADLINE> Sex Education Urged for Chinese Teenagers (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Chinese teenagers need a
scientific and thorough knowledge about sex to ensure their sound
growth before entering adulthood, a Chinese official newspaper
urged today.
</P>
<P>
Education in sexual physiology and psychology, and sex ethics,
should be given to teenagers, who are maturing physically, but
still lack the emotional understanding of the responsibilities of
sex, said "China Youth Daily".
</P>
<P>
The newspaper carried results of a survey showing that three
percent of Chinese youngsters in the 14-16 age group have had
sexual intercourse with their partners, and 15 percent said they
hugged, kissed and touched their girl friends or boy friends.
</P>
<P>
The survey, conducted by a research team specializing in
adolescent education, was sponsored by the State Education
Commission. It also found that 12 percent of teenagers were
dating, and nine percent said they have lovers.
</P>
<P>
However, about 70 percent of pubescents were not well prepared
psychologically for their first periods (menses), the newspaper
quoted the results as saying.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the number of cases involving negligent behavior
in sexual relationships by teenagers is on rise in recent years in
China.
</P>
<P>
Juvenile delinquency cases related to sex have accounted for 45
percent of the total, and such problems have aroused a wide
concern among the whole society, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
"Many of those cases should have been prevented, or would not
have taken place, if the teenage wrongdoers had been educated with
a scientific knowledge and sexual ethics," it said.
</P>
<P>
Although China's educational authority has called for
adolescent education to middle school students for several
decades, sex is still a taboo in many Chinese families, as well as
in school courses at present.
</P>
<P>
But compared with the power of mass media and publications, the
efforts of conservative parents and educators to keep silent in
front of young people seemed too weak in the current climate, the
paper said.
</P>
<P>
The survey found the mass media has greatly affected more than
70 percent of teenagers on their understanding about sex, while
only four percent said they learned knowledge about sexual matters
from school courses.

<P>
AMMAN, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian Prime Minister Abdul Karim
 Kabariti met here today with member of the Executive Committee of
the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) Mahamoud Abbas on the
latest development of the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, the prime minister reiterated Jordan's firm
stands in support of the Arab position vis-a-vis the Middle East
peace process and its efforts to continue the Arab-Israeli peace
negotiations on all tracks so as to reach a comprehensive and
just peace in the region.
</P>
<P>
Kabariti stressed on the importance of coordinating Arab
efforts in this regard, especially at "this particular stage."
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian official, on his part, said his discussions
with the prime minister focused on the meetings recently held
in Cairo and Tel Aviv.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized the Arab positions, especially those of the
Arab countries directly involved in the Arab- Israeli conflict,
are "very clear and specific."

<P>
Another survey in a middle-school in Shanghai showed that 29
percent of sexual knowledge among students came from pop fiction,
and 57 percent from friends of the same age, which however was
mostly incorrect.
</P>
<P>
Pop culture and booming business also played a role in
influencing teenagers to pay much attention to relationships with
opposite sex, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
A survey in south China's prosperous province of Guangdong
found about 32 percent of boy students, and 28 percent of girls
often visited dance halls, karaoke bars, cinemas and other
entertainment places with their girlfriends or boyfriends.
</P>
<P>
"Contradictions between the closed environment at home, and the
opened environment outside, often mean teenagers do not know what
to do," the paper claimed.
</P>
<P>
In Beijing, a middle-school is experimenting with its own
method of adolescent sexual education, aiming at breaking the
mystery of sex, and giving a full introduction of sex knowledge to
students.
</P>
<P>
First-year boy and girl students at the Beijing No. 25
Middle-school attend sex lectures separately, and are allowed to
ask whatever they want to know. Experts explain the question by
question.
</P>
<P>
"Our aim is to let youngsters know that sex is an enjoyable
human behavior," said Liu, principal of the school.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the school has opened courses in physical exercise
and dancing for students every day, aimed at diverting the
excessive energy of young students.
</P>
<P>
"It is no use confining their sexual desire," said Liu, "We are
trying to offer more opportunities to make young people
participate in beneficial activities, and to help them grow up
healthily."

ISLAMABAD, July 18 (Xinhua) -- A spokesman of the Pakistani
Foreign Office today strongly rejected the allegation of
Pakistan's assistance to the Afghan Taliban Militia.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press briefing here this afternoon, the spokesman
said that Pakistan has provided no assistance to any groups in

On Tuesday, a Taliban pilot named Abdul Jalil defected to the
Kabul government with a Mig-21 jet fighter, and disclosed that
Pakistan had provided assistance to Taliban's air force.
</P>
<P>
"The pilot's claim is totally baseless and motivated by some
malicious designs," the spokesman stressed.
</P>
<P>
He said, "The Taliban is using the Russian fighter planes and
Pakistan has no expertise in the Russian technology as it does not
use the Russian weapon systems."
</P>
<P>
Pakistan has been working for the durable settlement of the
Afghanistan problem, he added.

<HEADLINE> First "Hope Project" College Student Goes to Graduate School </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HEFEI, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Zhang Zongyou, the first beneficiary
of the Hope Project who enrolled in college four years ago, will
become the charity's first graduate student when he starts classes
at east China's Nanjing University.
</P>
<P>
"I have been growing up under the care of the whole society,"
said Zhang upon receiving his acceptance notice from the
university.
</P>
<P>
He said he would work even harder in the future to repay all of
the people who have been kind to him.
</P>
<P>
The Hope Project, initiated in 1989 and sponsored by the
Communist Youth League of China (CYLC), was designed to help young
dropouts return to school.
</P>
<P>
An official from the Hope Project office in east China's Anhui
Province said that Zhang is the first beneficiary of the Hope
Project's assistance who will study for a master's degree.
</P>
<P>
Zhang, who lives in Jinzai County in Anhui Province, was an
excellent high school student, but was forced to leave school in
1990 because his family could not afford his schooling.
</P>
<P>
When the Hope Project office in Jinzai heard about Zhang, it
offered financial assistance that allowed the young student to
continue his studies.
</P>
<P>
In 1992, Zhang passed the college entrance examination and was
enrolled by Fuyang Teachers' College in Anhui Province.
</P>
<P>
During his four years at college, Zhang received 800 yuan
(about 96 U.S. dollars) each year from the Anhui Hope Project
office.
</P>
<P>
The Hope Project had collected donations worth nearly 700
million yuan by the end of last year. It has enabled more than
1.25 million dropouts to return to the classroom.

MACAO, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Six private schools have signed
letters of promise with the Macao government to enter the
government-subsidized free education system from next semester,
marking a major expansion of the the free education system in Macao.
</P>
<P>
With the entry of the six schools, which have more than 4,200
students, the number of students in private schools to enjoy free
education will reach 24,800, accounting for 70 percent of all the
students in Macao's non-profitable private schools.
</P>
<P>
Macao now has a total of over 80,000 students, and some 90 percent
of the schools in Macao are privately run. Their teaching facilities
and number of teachers often lag far behind those run by the
government.
</P>
<P>
Macao government adopted a seven-year free education system in
all government-run schools and part of the private schools since
last year. The private schools to join in the free education
system and receive government subsidy must be non-profitable and
bear certain responsibilities such as no charge of tuition.
</P>
<P>
Education officials in Macao said that they expect to extend the
seven-year free education system to a ten-year system before 1999,
and hope more private schools would join in.

ANKARA, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Iranian deputy Foreign Minister
Alaaddin Burujerdi said here today that the formation of a Turkish
coalition government led by the pro-Islamic Welfare Party was
conducive to the strengthening of bilateral relations between
Iran and Turkey.
</P>

a two-day official visit that he would submit messages from Iran
to Turkish President Suleyman Demirel and Prime Minister
Necmettin Erbakan.

He hoped that the exchange of visits by top leaders, agreed
upon two years ago, would be realized at the shortest time.
</P>

"It is expected that Iranian President Ali Akbar Hashemi
Rafsanjani will pay an official visit to Turkey. We hope that
Turkish President Suleyman Demirel will fix the date of his visit
to Iran during my trip," the Iranian official said.
</P>
<P>
" More mutual visits between Iran and Turkey are important for
the strengthening of bilateral ties...We hope the new (Turkish)

On the Turkish bombing of an Iranian village, Burujerdi said
that Turkey had agreed to send a military delegation to Iran to
make investigations and prepare reports to be submitted to the
governments of the two countries.

He added that it was also necessary to investigate the alleged
attacks on Turkish military posts from the Iranian border.

<HEADLINE> Thirty-One Die in Caspian Sea Beach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Thirty-one people lost their
lives in Iran's northern summer resort Caspian Sea shores this
month, a press report said here today.
</P>
<P>
The Persian daily +Jumhuri Islami+ reported that most of
the victims lost their lives for swimming outside specially
delineated safe swimming areas.
</P>
<P>
The local Mazandaran provincial authorities called on local
residents and tourists to swim only within the safe zones.
</P>
<P>
However, some local people attributed the high death toll
to the separation of women and men in the swimming areas due
to the Islamic code.
</P>
<P>
Every year in summer hundreds of thousands of tourists,
particularly from the capital of Tehran, go to the Caspian
Sea coastal areas for a relief.
</P>
<P>
However, the Islamic law prohibits men and women from
swimming together not only in the swimming pools but also in
the sea no matter they are married or unmarried, old or
young.
</P>
<P>
Armed policemen patrol along the breach. Those who swim
together regardless of sex will be detained and punished. Thus, a
couple and a family have to swim in different and distant zones.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, the female can not swim with the swim suit,
they have to swim with long black chadore.
</P>
<P>
Last summer alone, 287 people died as a result of swimming
accidents in the Caspian Sea beach.

<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Some 8,900 smuggling cases have been
uncovered by the Vietnam Customs so far this year following the
decree issued by the Vietnamese Prime Minister to clamp down on
smuggling at sea, according to the latest issue of the Vietnam
Investment Review.
</P>
<P>
The review quoted Nguyen Hoa Lu, chief of the anti-smuggling
investigation bureau under the General Department of Customs as
saying the ringleaders of the sophisticated smuggling operations
have yet to be brought to book.
</P>
<P>
The smugglers are equipped with better, faster crafts fitted
out with multiple high-powered motors and radar, and often change
their tactics, he said.
</P>
<P>
Police and customs ships are slow and often too small to
venture into open water where the larger smugglers' boats can run
freely, the review said.
</P>
<P>
The smuggled goods range from industrial equipment to
television sets. Some of the goods are decanted from larger ships
anchored offshore onto smaller boats which run them to shore.
</P>
<P>
Some are simply carried in containers with false declaration
papers, the review said.
</P>
<P>
The government will take strict measures against smugglers who
are arrested.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan President Ends Visit To Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni
leaves here for home this morning after a four-day state visit to
Kenya.
</P>
<P>

off from Jomo Kenyatta International Airport here around 11:40 am.
</P>
<P>

the already growing momentum of the revived East African
cooperation and reviewing the the problems facing the region.

Nairobi on Wednesday, Museveni called for EPZ to play a more
important role in attracting both international and local
investors.

<HEADLINE> Bilharzia Hits Zambia's Border Town </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, July 18 (Xinhua) -- The epidemic disease Bilharzia is
hitting Chililabombwe, a border town of Zambia's central province
of Copperbelt.
</P>
<P>
A medical team has been sent by the government to the epidemic
area to fight the disease, according to Zambia news agency.
</P>
<P>
The Kanenga and Kawama settlements of the town suffer most
from the disease. Many pupils, especially from the Kawama Primary
School, have been tested positive of bilharzia with their bloody
urine samples.
</P>
<P>
Mohammed Shehata, leader of the medical team, said the
bilharzia epidemic in the two settlement areas were caused by
unsanitary water.
</P>
<P>
He said rivers, pools and a dam in the area where the
residents draw water are heavily infested with snails that carry
miracidium parasites which carry bilharzia germs.
</P>
<P>
"These germs easily pierce through human skin when the victim
steps into the infected water," he explained.
</P>
<P>
Shehata disclosed that a new drug named endod has been
developed from local plants which is effective in fighting
against the disease.
</P>
<P>
Bilharzia affects the brain, liver and spleen, causing anaemia
and cancer to intestines and urinary system if not cured. It also
leads to slow death if not treated quickly.
</P>
<P>
"But there is a cure to the disease," said the medical
official.

<HEADLINE> Tree is a "Home Tweet Home" for 200 Birds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Forget the dawn chorus, people in
a Chinese village are treated every morning to a dawn choir.
</P>
<P>
Over 200 birds perched in an old banyan tree provide the
perfect morning alarm clock.
</P>
<P>
Their singing can be heard from several hundred meters away,
adding a touch of color and music to life in Yayili village, in
Dongshan town, Qujing city i n southwest China's Yunnan province.
</P>
<P>
The village is about 200 kilometers northeast of Kunming, the
capital city.
</P>
<P>
The banyan tree is big enough for two or three persons to
encircle it hand in hand.
</P>
<P>
In the early mornings the singing of the birds can be heard
from far away. Under the tree a thin layer of white bird droppings
cover the ground.
</P>
<P>
The birds' feathers are white, and they have long slim necks.
</P>
<P>
"They seem to be a species of egret", said Wen Xianji, a
researcher from Kunming Institute of Zoology, who commented on
hearing about the birds. "It is really a marvelous natural
phenomenon," he said.
</P>
<P>
Local people know the birds as "Laoguan". The villagers said
that every year the birds arrive soon after the spring festival,
and do not leave until late autumn. After their dawn choir
performance, the birds leave the tree to look for food in the
nearby farmlands, returning to perch in the tree in the evenings.
</P>
<P>
According to an old man in the village, who often counted the
birds, there are more than 200 birds perching on more than 100
nests in the tree during the night.
</P>
<P>
No one in the village can remember when the tree became a
"multi-storey" home for so many birds. But everyone is trying to
protect the birds, so they will always regard the tree as the
birds' "home tweet home".
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year the villagers drove away two people who
strolled under the tree with a gun.
</P>
<P>
For the villagers, the birds are not only their friends, but
also their allies, helping to get rid of insects.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Steps Up Action Against Rising CD Piracy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Singapore has stepped up
enforcement action against the rising CD (compact discs) piracy
with a music industry watchdog group and the police raiding a
major distributor of pirated CDs last Thursday.
</P>
<P>
According to a report in today's Straits Times, more than 3,620
allegedly pirated CDs were found in a house and a car of the man
suspected of supplying street and night-market stalls.
</P>
<P>
Last Thursday's haul was said to be more than the total number
of pirated CDs seized for the whole of last year.
</P>
<P>
The Straits Times report said that it was the 20th raid this
year according to the industry group, the International Federation
of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI).
</P>
<P>
Pirated CDs worth an estimated 6.8 million US dollars or 13
percent of the retail market, were sold here in Singapore last
year, up from the five-percent level of 1992, when the retail pie
was much smaller, the report said.
</P>
<P>
"We are very concerned with the level of CD piracy in Singapore
and are investigating the sources of supply of pirated CDs," Leong
May Seey, IFPI's Hong Kong-based regional counsel, was quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
So far this year, about 6,000 pirated CDs have been seized, up
from 1,390 recovered in 1995, and 551 in 1994, the report said.

realization of an overall and just peace in the Middle East,
together with the international community.
</P>

<HEADLINE> TV Series Calls For Reunification of Motherland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Filming began today in Beijing for
a 20-part TV series called "Li Zongren Back From Overseas," which
reflects the Chinese people's desire for peace and reunification.
</P>
<P>
The series depicts the life of Li Zongren, who once served as
the acting president of the Kuomintang government, lived in the
United States for 16 years and returned to the motherland on July
18, 1965, with the help of the Chinese Communist Party.
</P>
<P>
Cheng Siyuan, vice-chairman of the Standing Committee of the
National People's Congress, who returned with Li in the 1960s, has
been invited to act as a consultant for the production.
</P>
<P>
"Such a series aims to recapture this great historical issue,
which will have a positive impact on the reunification of the
motherland," Cheng said.
</P>
<P>
Luo Qingchang, a member of the former Central Advisory
Commission of the CPC, who helped with Li's return, said that
the situations at home and abroad in the 1960s were complex, and
"the return of Li was full of great danger, but was eventually
successful."
</P>
<P>
He added that working for the reunification of the motherland
while struggling against splittism are still weighty tasks.
</P>
<P>
The TV series, which is being filmed by the Guangxi Film
Studio, will be shown at home and abroad early next year.

<HEADLINE> Analysts See Slowdown in Singapore's Electronics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, July 18 (Xinhua) -- The electronics industry of
Singapore is unlikely to score another year of high growth given
the current slowdown in the disk drive sector, analysts said,
noting that the Singapore government's forecast of 15 percent
growth rate for the industry might turn out to be "overly
optimistic."
</P>
<P>
Many of the analysts, quoted by the Straits Times today, said
they believed a more realistic figure would be a 12-14 percent
increase, although some said that the projected 15 percent jump in
output might still be achieved if there was a strong pick-up in
demand in the fourth quarter of the year.
</P>
<P>
The downward revision in forecast was in sharp contrast to
analysts' projections in December, when the Government Economic
Development Board (EDB) first announced its 15 percent growth
target for the sector.
</P>
<P>
The analysts noted that disk drive output, which was last
year's biggest contributor to the total electronic output, is
showing signs of a slowdown. It accounted for 23 percent of the
1995's 40.1 billion US dollar output.
</P>
<P>
Seagate Technology, the first major disk drive company to
announce quarterly results, said Wednesday that its net income for
the three months ended June 28 dropped almost 11 percent to 101
million US dollars, while revenue declined by 60 million US
dollars to 2.01 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
It attributed the earnings drop partly to "a decline in sales
of products for use in portable computer applications as well as
softness in the desktop personal computer market."
</P>
<P>
The analysts said that Seagate's poor performance was expected
to be replicated by other disk drive makers which are due to
release their quarterly results over the next few weeks.
</P>
<P>
They said that it was believed that many disk drive operators
had already scaled down production by as much as 15 percent. And
these cutbacks had in turn led to the downward revision in growth
forecasts.
</P>
<P>
However, they also noted that Trade and Industry Minister Yeo
Cheow Tong said earlier this month that the electronics sector was
still experiencing rapid growth although it was likely to pause
for a "breather" after its strong ramp-up at the end of last year,
when the industry grew by 19 percent to hit 40.1 billion US
dollars.

<HEADLINE> Ukraine not to Oppose NATO's Eastward Expansion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Ukraine will not stand in the way of
NATO's eastward expansion as long as the military bloc does not
deploy nuclear weapons in its neighboring countries, a senior
Ukrainian security official said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Meeting with the visiting U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Strobe
Talbott, National Security Advisor to the Ukrainian President
Vladimir Gorbulin hoped that NATO's expansion will be carried out
step by step.
</P>
<P>
Talbott, who arrived in Kiev on Wednesday for a day-long visit,
said the U.S. will give plenty of consideration to Ukraine's
national security.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. also cared about Ukraine's role in the European
security structure, added the U.S. deputy secretary of state.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that NATO's expansion should not affect either
Russia or Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
Ukraine, a former Soviet republic, has suffered a sharp
economic decline since it declared independence in 1991.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and international financial organizations have taken
the lead in assisting Ukraine, Talbott said at a meeting with
Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that the U.S. and Ukraine were in good terms
since the former Soviet republic is a very important country in
Europe.
</P>
<P>
The U.S., the biggest financial supporter of Ukraine, has
offered Kiev technical assistance worth 1 billion U.S. dollars, in
addition to 700 million dollars in loans.
</P>
<P>
Kuchma said it was important for the U.S. to continuously give
his country political and economic help.

on a sample of 1,794 people of different age groups picked
up from around the Kingdom.
</P>
<P>
The survey aimed to find out how much a family spends a
month on basic and subsidized foodstuff -- bread, sugar, rice
and powdered milk.
</P>
<P>
The government's repeated assurances seems to have failed to
ease the widespread concern that hike in bread prices could
prompt rise in the prices of other commodities.
</P>
<P>
A coalition of nine opposition parties and representatives from
various public interest groups called Wednesday here for a
"peaceful march" next week as part of a campaign against a
government plan to lift subsidies on bread.
</P>
<P>
It said that if the government end the subsidies, the
low-income groups will be hard hit, noting that such a move
would raise the cost of living by 16.5 percent for those
families whose monthly income does not exceed 100 dinars (140
dollars) and by 14.6 percent for those earning 100
to 150 dinars monthly.
</P>
<P>
The survey showed that the families earning up to 300 dinars
(420 dollars) will face an additional cost of living burden
estimated at 7.25 percent.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN Countries to Closer Economic Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 18 (Xinhua) -- The members of the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) will strengthen their economic
cooperation in international fora in order to enhance ASEAN's
capability to deal with new forms of protectionism and to actively
participate in the shaping of the international economic agenda,
Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas said here today.
</P>
<P>
In a closing statement made at the 6th meeting of the 29th
ASEAN Standing Committee (ASC), Alatas said ASEAN's continuing
commitment to market liberalization and maintenance of an open
trading system has once again demonstrated "the determination of
ASEAN to integrate its economy with the world economy."
</P>
<P>
The ASEAN members, namely Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the
Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam, have made remarkable
progress in their economic cooperation in various fields since its
formation in 1967.
</P>
<P>
During the past year, Alatas said, ASEAN economic cooperation
activities were directed towards accelerating and deepening its
common commitments under ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA),
strengthening economic cooperation in other areas, expanding ASEAN
economic cooperation into new sectors and enhancing linkages with
other countries and regional groups.
</P>
<P>
One of the most significant steps that the ASEAN leaders took
during their 5th summit meeting last year in Bangkok was their
decision to accelerate the realization of AFTA before the target
date of the year 2003.
</P>
<P>
At the summit, the leaders also decided to eliminate all
quantitative restrictions and non-tariff barriers. In this regard,
the elimination of the non-tariff barriers was scheduled to start
on January 1996.
</P>
<P>
Alatas said ASEAN members are now harmonizing and simplifying
their customs procedures while the ASEAN director-general of
customs is working on a new ASEAN agreement on customs.
</P>
<P>
Early this year, the green lane which accelerates customs
clearance for the Common Effective Preferential Tariff (CEPT)
products was launched.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he added, the ASEAN also continues to develop
linkage with NAFTA (North American Free Trade Agreement) and other
economic organizations. "This will eventually enhance our trade
and investment linkages with the regions," he noted.

<HEADLINE> Mubarak Meets Netanyahu on Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Mubarak met here today with
visiting Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for talks on
the stalled Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu arrived here earlier today on his first visit to an
Arab state since he was elected prime minister late last May.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak was expected to urge Netanyahu to stick to the land-
for-peace principle, which has been the basis for Arab-Israeli
peace negotiations since the 1991 Madrid peace conference.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak was also to call on Netanyahu to honor all agreements
Israel has signed with the Arabs and resume peace talks with the
Palestinians, Syria and Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
For Netanyahu, the brief working visit may be a good
opportunity for him to appease the Arabs' concern and anger over
his tough line on Arab-Israeli talks, analysts say.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians, Syria and Lebanon have especially concerned
that the whole peace process may be destroyed because of
Netanyahu's threat to abandon the land-for-peace principle,
embodied in relevant U.N. resolutions.
</P>
<P>
The new Israeli prime minister have voiced objection to a
return of the Golan Heights to Syria, an independent Palestinian
state and talks over the future of Arab east Jerusalem, which the
Palestinians want as the capital of their would-be state.
</P>
<P>
He has also vowed to build and expand Jewish settlements in
the Gaza Strip and West bank.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, which has been playing an active role in the peace
process as a mediator between Israel and the Arabs, particularly
the Palestinians, recently has been leading an Arab campaign to
save the peace process and press Israel to change its tough
stance.
</P>
<P>
Last month, Egypt hosted a pan-Arab summit which sent a
strong message that the land-for-peace principle will continue to
be the basis for the peace process and Israel's political and
trade relations with the Arab world will be tied to progress in
the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Israel seems to be concerned, if not too much, about Egypt's
diplomatic efforts aimed at pressing the Jewish state to come to
terms with all its Arab neighbors.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu has said that he wants good relations with Egypt
because it has an important role to play in brokering Arab-
Israeli relations.
</P>
<P>
Osama el-Baz, Mubarak's top political aide, said Wednesday
that Egypt will listen to Netanyahu with open mind if he carries
positive ideas that could help boost the peace process. Egypt has
 said that it will not prejudge Netanyahu's policy.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 18 (Xinhua) -- China's train operators have set a
record of no major rail accidents for 100 days in the first half
of this year.
</P>
<P>
Major accidents refer to those involving human deaths and
causing suspension of train journeys lasting one hour and above,
according to the regulations on railway accidents.
</P>
<P>
A report by the Ministry of Railways shows that safety control
has been enhanced on China's railroads, thanks to the ministry's
efforts to build safer lines and improved railway facilities.
</P>
<P>
China's four top trunk lines, the Beijing-Shanghai,
Beijing-Guangzhou, Beijing-Harbin and Lianyungang-Lanzhou lines,
produced the best safety records, while six other major lines have
also reached safe-line standards.
</P>
<P>
Some 1,000 railway stations and sections throughout the country
were appraised as safety models in the first half of the year.
</P>
<P>
Railway facilities have been improved, which resulted in the
reduction in the equipment stoppage rate compared with the same
period last year.
</P>
<P>
The stoppage rate for locomotives, switches, signals, and
electric drawing equipment on electrified lines, dropped by 36.4
percent, 12.8 percent, 11.9 percent and 67.5 percent respectively.

<HEADLINE> Central China's Hubei Province Closes 13 Illegal Private Schools </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Thirteen private schools operating
illegally in central China's Hubei Province have been closed by a
local court.
</P>
<P>
The private schools, scattered throughout eight villages in
Xiaoling Township, Chongyang County, neither received approval to
operate from the local education administration, nor provided the
basic conditions necessary to run a school, today's "Guangming
Daily" reported.
</P>
<P>
The classrooms, all rented from local farmers, were dark and
damp, and some were near collapse.
</P>
<P>
Most teachers in these schools do not have official teaching
qualifications or the required educational background.
</P>
<P>
On November 16, 1995, the education committee of Chongyang
County ordered the schools be closed in accordance with the
Education Law, but education administrators and local government
officials failed to comply.
</P>
<P>
Consequently, the education committee took them to court.
</P>
<P>
The schools' administrators continued to refuse to shut down,
despite a ruling that they do so issued by the People's Court of
Chongyang County.
</P>
<P>
The Chongyang court ultimately closed the illegally-run private
schools. More than 1,200 of the students were transferred to
nearby public schools, and were not charged transfer fees.

<P>
JAKARTA, July 18 (Xinhua) -- The ASEAN (Association of
Southeast Asian Nations) Standing Committee (ASC) has suggested
ASEAN functional cooperation be elevated, Ali Alatas, chairman of
29th ASC and Indonesian foreign minister said here today.
</P>
<P>
In his closing statement of the 6th meeting of the 29th ASEAN
Standing Committee (ASC), Alatas said ASC has agreed to recommend
to the forthcoming ASEAN Ministerial Meeting (AMM) to consider and
adopt the framework for elevating functional cooperation to higher
plane with the theme of "shared prosperity through human
development, technological competitiveness and social
cohesiveness."
</P>
<P>
The framework also includes prioritizing the programs and
activities in the field of functional cooperation, enhancing
coordination among various sectoral committees and strengthening
the functional cooperation bureau in the ASEAN secretariat.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, the 5th ASEAN summit meeting in Bangkok decided to
raise the ASEAN functional cooperation to the same level as its
political and economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
As a result of this decision, ASEAN cooperation in science and
technology, culture and information, social development and drugs
and narcotics control has been intensified.

<HEADLINE> Fast-Speed Growth Momentum Reported in Harbin's Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, July 17 (Xinhua) -- The economy of Harbin, capital of
the northernmost Heilongjiang province, registers a relatively
fast-growth momentum in the first half of this year.
</P>
<P>
According to Vice-Mayor Wang Guangtao, gross domestic product
and financial income of his city over the past six months went up
11.3 percent and 26.1 percent respectively over the same period of
last year.
</P>
<P>
Its output value of agriculture, industry and service trade
sectors went up by at least ten percent, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
Harbin was one of China's leading old industrial bases built in
the 1950s and early 1960s. However, he added, owing to a fairly
big proportion of the state-owned industrial enterprises with
inadequate input and outmoded and aging equipment, its economy
stagnated or developed at a slow pace over recent years.
</P>
<P>
While citing the major features in its economic growth, Wang
noted that Harbin has increased input in agriculture, adopted the
relevant preferential policies and accelerated the pace for
retooling, merging and regrouping of these enterprise and work to
further improve their management over the past few years.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Arrives in Cairo for Talks with Mubarak </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu arrived here today on his first visit to an Arab state
since he won the Israeli election for premiership late last May.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu was met at the Cairo International Airport by
Egyptian Prime Minister Kamal el-Ganzouri.
</P>
<P>
He is to meet with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak for talks
on the stalled Middle East peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak is expected to urge Netanyahu, who has vowed to take a
hard-line policy on Arab-Israeli peace negotiations, to stick to
the land-for-peace principle, which has been the basis for the
Mideast peace process since its inception five years ago.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak is also to call on Netanyahu to honor all agreements
Israel has signed with the Arabs and resume peace talks with the
Palestinians, Syria and Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
During his one-day working visit, Netanyahu will visit Egypt's
Tomb of the Unknown Soldiers and the burial site of late President
Anwar Sadat, who became the first Arab leader to make peace with
Israel in 1979.
</P>
<P>
A number of Egyptian opposition newspapers today carried
editorials saying that they don't welcome Netanyahu's visit
because of his attitude toward the Arabs.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, which has been playing an active role in the peace
process as a mediator between the Jewish state and the Arabs,
particularly the Palestinians, recently has been leading an Arab
campaign to save the peace process and press Israel to change its
tough stance.
</P>
<P>
Egypt hosted last month the Arab summit, the largest
gathering of Arab leaders in six years, to close Arab ranks and
forge a unified Arab stance toward the new Israeli government.
</P>
<P>
The summit sent a strong message that the land-for-peace
principle will continue to be the basis for the peace process and
Israel's political and trade relations with the Arab world will
be tied to progress in the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, Syrian Foreign Minister
Farouq al-Shara and Jordanian Premier and Foreign Minister Abdul-
Karim al-Kabariti all came to Cairo this week to coordinate
stances with Mubarak prior to Netanyahu's visit.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians and Syria have especially expressed concern
that Netanyahu's tough line may destroy the whole peace process.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli prime minister has voiced opposition to the return
of the Golan Heights to Syria, the establishment of an independent
Palestinian state and talks on the future of Arab east Jerusalem,
which the Palestinians want as the capital of their would-be
state.
</P>
<P>
He also vowed to build and expand Jewish settlements in the
Gaza Strip and West Bank.
</P>
<P>
He has put off a decision on Israel's promised withdrawal
from most of Hebron, the last West Bank town still under the
Israeli occupation, and suggested that Israel is unlikely to give

forging a strong and unified Arab stance on the Mideast peace
drive.

Netanyahu said recently that he wants good relations with

<HEADLINE> MIA-Prisoner Swap Expected Today </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Israel is expecting that the
bodies of two Israeli soldiers abducted in a south Lebanon ambush
a decade ago will finally be returned to rest today.
</P>
<P>
In a deal brokered by Germany to swap Hezbollah prisoners for
the two soldiers' bodies appeared imminent late Wednesday night, but
last minute snags and revelations of the deal to the media
threatened to postpone or even negate it.
</P>
<P>
Reports from Lebanon said that German security officials had
examined the remains of the two corpses to verify their
identities and sealed the deal.
</P>
<P>
According to the reports, Israel is to swap 200 Shi'ite
prisoners and the bodies of slain Hezbollah gunmen for the bodies
of Yosef Find and Rahamim Alsheikh.
</P>
<P>
However, reports from Beirut late Wednesday night quoted one
Hezbollah official as saying that the whole deal may be off,
since it had been leaked to the media.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in Israel, the defense establishment steadily
refused to confirm or deny the reports, even as details emerged
throughout the day on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli media reported that the army helped military
chaplains on Wednesday to remove the bodies of at least 14
Hezbollah gunmen killed in clashes in south Lebanon and buried in
Israel.
</P>
<P>
Using tractors, the army exhumed the bodies from numbered
graves at a special cemetery, near Kibbutz Galot along the banks
of the Jordan River, and loaded them onto trucks and then
apparently moved to the Lebanese border for the impending swap.
</P>
<P>
The deal reportedly also calls for Israel to hand over 200
prisoners in Khiam detention center in the Israeli self-declared
security zone in south Lebanon and two other Shi'ite leaders.
</P>
<P>
Former Prime Minister Shimon Peres confirmed to reporters
Wednesday that negotiations, mediated by Germany, have been under
way since the end of Operation Grape of Wrath, an Israeli military
operation against Hezbollah targets in Lebanon in last April.
</P>
<P>
"I spoke to Chancellor (Helmut) Kohl (on this issue) during my
trip to Germany," Peres told Israel Radio.
</P>
<P>
In Beirut, Lebanese government sources said the secret
negotiations were being carried out by Bernd Schimidbauer, Kohl's
security adviser, and a six-man German delegation, with Israeli
army's dental charts and other records on Fink and Alsheikh,
arrived in Beirut on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Reports said that the deal had been delayed by snags, and it
is expected to take place today.
</P>
<P>
This is not the first time that Israel has tried to bring back
the two bodies, but it is the first time it has reportedly
removed the link between the two MIAs and Ron Arad, a missing
navigator of the Israeli Air Force whose Phantom was shot down on
October 17, 1986 in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Hezbollah Deputy Secretary-General Naim Qassem said
that previous attempts to arrange swap had failed, because Israel
insisted it obtain firm word on the fate of Arad.

<HEADLINE> India to Cut Fiscal Deficit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, July 18 (Xinhua) -- India's Finance Ministry is
expected to restrict the fiscal deficit to 4.5 to 5 percent of GDP
and to introduce the concept of zero-base budgeting this year,
economists here said.
</P>
<P>
The government's new budget is to be presented to the
parliament for approval in the next few days.
</P>
<P>
Under the concept of zero-base budgeting, each department will
be required to justify the spending on each program. The annual
allocation for each department will not be based on the previous
year's allotment.
</P>
<P>
Expenditure cuts will be a key feature of the government's
effort to reduce the fiscal deficit. The Finance Ministry is
examining a proposal to further reduce the budget deficit from the
interim budget target of 50,000 million rupees (1,492.54 million
US dollars) to 30,000 million rupees (895.52 million US dollars),
they quoted officials as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Finance Ministry is also expected to introduce incentives
to boost the dwindling savings levels and ensure better tax
compliance. This will include widening the presumptive tax base by
raising income limits and providing tax exemptions on some new
savings instruments, they said.
</P>
<P>
The United Front government's common minimum program announced
here on June 5 commits the government to efforts to bring down the
fiscal deficit to 4 percent of GDP.

<P>
BEIJING, July 18 (Xinhua) -- China is to sponsor the 22nd
Universal Postal Congress and the '99 World Philatelic Exhibition
in Beijing in August 1999, Liu Pingyuan, vice-minister of posts
and telecommunications, announced today.
</P>
<P>
The China Organizing Committee for the congress and exhibition
was founded today in Beijing, with the Chinese President Jiang
Zemin as honorary chairman, Vice-Premier Wu Bangguo as chairman,
and the Minister of Posts and Telecommunications Wu Jichuan as
executive vice-chairman.
</P>
<P>
Jiang Zemin wrote words of encouragement for the event,
saying "Developing modern post to satisfy social needs."
</P>
<P>
Universal Postal is a special organization in charge of
international postal business, under the leadership of the United
Nations. With headquarters in Berne, Switzerland, it has 189
members. It holds a congress every five years, and the last one
took place in Seoul in August 1994.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that 2,000 representatives from member states
will attend the 22nd Universal Postal Congress, which will last
for 24 days.
</P>
<P>
"This will be the last meeting to be held by the Universal
Postal this century, and it will play an important role in
guiding the world's postal affairs in the coming century," Liu
said.
</P>
<P>
Liu disclosed that China will sponsor a comprehensive world
philatelic exhibition during the meeting. The ten-day exhibition
will be the largest of its kind in the world, as well as an

<HEADLINE> More Chinese Depositors Turning to Securities (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Three-year term deposits now only account for 13.6 percent of
all deposits, down 3.8 percent from a previous survey. Short-term
and current deposits are climbing.
</P>
<P>
Experts here still believe that the shift in the deposit
structure will enhance the liquidity of capital and facilitate
business for commercial banks.
</P>
<P>
The survey shows that the index of individual depositors'
intent to deposit in banks fell by 6.6 percent after the interest
rate adjustments last April and May, while that for consumption
went up by the same margin.
</P>
<P>
In May, according to the survey, savings deposits dropped one
percent from the previous month, an indication that individual
deposits had slowed. May deposits were 60.36 billion yuan, down
47.2 billion yuan, compared with the average level of the previous
four months.
</P>
<P>
When answering the survey question that asked what the
depositors' choice would be in case of an interest rate
adjustment, 17.3 percent said that they would buy securities. This
figure is up 2.5 percent from a previous survey.
</P>
<P>
As for cash buying, the survey indicates more citizens are
eyeing securities, an increasingly popular trend.
</P>
<P>
Tradings on the Shanghai Stock Exchange totalled 132.1 billion
yuan in the first three months of this year. But in May, 142.2
billion yuan was traded, far outpacing the total of the first
three months of this year.

<HEADLINE> More Chinese Depositors Turning to Securities (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 18 (Xinhua) -- More Chinese depositors are
shunning banks and turning to securities with the aim of reaping
higher profits, a recent survey shows.
</P>
<P>
This follows the scrapping of a newly-added, index-linked
subsidy on April 1, and a cut in the savings deposit interest rate
on May 1, today's "People's Daily" reported, quoting the results
of the central bank's survey among depositors.
</P>
<P>
The survey, conducted by the Survey and Statistics Department
of People's Bank of China, also indicates that individual
depositors prefer short-term deposits rather than long-term
savings, and that more depositors intend to shift to consumption.
</P>
<P>
However, central bank governor Dai Xianglong told a press
conference on Monday that the cut -- 0.98 percentage points -- in
the interest rate has not affected savings deposits.
</P>
<P>
China's individual deposits as a whole surged in the first half
of this year to hit 3.546 trillion yuan, jumping by 570 billion
yuan, or 170 billion yuan more than the increase over
corresponding period of last year.
</P>
<P>
Traditionally, urban and rural Chinese citizens deposit their
money in banks for safety and the subsequent high interests, and
have keenly followed interest rate hikes in recent years.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait Passes Law on Banning Illegal Weapons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Kuwaiti parliament's Interior
and Defense Affairs Committee Wednesday night approved a law on
prohibiting illegal weapons and explosives in a bid to curb crimes.
</P>
<P>
The move aims to take under control the large quantities of
unlicensed firearms, ammunition and explosives owned illegally by
individuals, said the Kuwaiti government.
</P>
<P>
During the 1990-91 Gulf War, a large number of weapons and
ammunition were left in the hands of many citizens in Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
The unlicensed weapons deteriorated the security situation in
Kuwait, a country among the world lowest in crime rate.
</P>
<P>
Recently, a spate of murders involving weapons in the country
made many Kuwaiti citizens worry.
</P>
<P>
The committee's Chairman Fahad Duhaisan Al-Maie said the law
would authorize the public prosecutor to order policemen to search
individuals, residences, public facilities and public or private
transports for illegal weapons.
</P>
<P>
According to the chairman, the law will be valid for two years
and can be renewed for a similar period by a new law.
</P>
<P>
In another relevant development, Kuwaiti Interior Minister Ali
al-Sabah al-Salem al-Sabah said the Kuwaiti authorities would soon
deal with illegal foreigners in the country. It is reported that
the stateless people in the country, numbering 100,000, also
blamed for the country's worsening security situation.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Handicrafts made of willow trees,
grass, feathers, silk, wheat straw, and other materials in Tai'an
County in northeastern Liaoning Province, have become increasingly
popular with people in over 30 countries and regions.
</P>
<P>
Handicrafts exports from the county for a long time amounted to
only about one million yuan (about 120,000 US dollars) because of
the lack of large enterprises, but they now contribute as much as
one-third of the province's total export value of the same
products.
</P>
<P>
During the Eighth Five-Year Plan (1991-1995), right after the
beginning of the country's economic reform, the county set up
three joint ventures for the manufacture of handicrafts, which got
direct export rights.
</P>
<P>
Consequently, the county's handicrafts exports rose to 23
million yuan in 1995.
</P>
<P>
At present, the production of handicrafts using local materials
available has formed an economy of some extent and the county has
set up still more factories to make 1,200 types of handicrafts.

HARARE, July 18 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwean government on
Wndesday mounted a permanent exhibition here, commemorating the
country's liberation war efforts against colonialism, starting
100 years ago in 1896.
</P>
<P>
The southern African country gained independence from British
settler rule in 1980 after fighting several wars, the first being
the uprising in Matabeleland in March 1896 and in Mashonaland in
June of the same year.
</P>
<P>
''One hundred years have elapsed since the aborted risings
took place and those years have seen many changes, the most
important being that Zimbabwe achieved independence since April
18, 1980'' Home Affairs Minister Dumiso Dabengwa said while
officially opening the exhibition.
</P>
<P>
The exhibition is at the National Archives of Zimbabwe, which
is charged with the responsibility of preserving the country's
history and culture, under the auspices of the Home Affairs
Ministry.
</P>
<P>
It features literature and pictures of the Shona and Matabele
rebellions post-1896, including photographs of people being
tortured or executed by the white settlers.
</P>
<P>
While the national archives' efforts to reclaim and preserve
Zimbabwe's heritage should be applauded, more needed to be done
as a nation, said Dabengwa, adding that plans are underway at an
advanced stage to build a war museum.

Japan, and the United States in the Hefei High-tech Development
Zone, started production after only seven months of construction
work.
</P>
<P>
Its Japanese investor expressed his belief that the development
zone has a better investment environment than in Japan, one which
helped the project, to produce 1.2 million air-conditioners a
year, with an investment of 120 million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Sanyo of Japan and a local investor from Hefei successfully
completed a modern washing machine production base in one year,

<P>
Because of its success, Sanyo has decided to develop micro-wave
ovens and hot-water heaters with the Hefei partner.

<HEADLINE> Export-oriented Economy Taking Shape in Yangtze River Delta Area </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, July 18 (Xinhua) -- The Yangtze River Delta, one of
China's most booming areas, is going all out to build an
export-oriented economic set-up by focusing on developing
enterprise groups, and regional and international cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The area has approved the establishment of more than 55,000
overseas-funded enterprises. Nearly half of the world's top 100
transnational companies have launched projects there.
</P>
<P>
Experts said China's overall open situation, the weaker sense
of administrative division, and still closer regional and
international economic cooperation are conducive to the formation
of an export-oriented economic pattern.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai, the largest city in the delta area and in the
country, has set up 15,000 foreign-funded projects, 70 percent of
which are industrial; many are new and hi-tech.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the sales volume of overseas-funded
enterprises in Shanghai accounted for more than one fourth of the
city's total.
</P>
<P>
Xu Kuangdi, Mayor of Shanghai, said that his municipality will
expand to broader markets for its local products.
</P>
<P>
The proportions of Shanghai-made products sold in other parts
of China and overseas will be raised by about 40 percent, up from
the current 30 percent, Xu said.
</P>
<P>
The city's neighboring Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, both
located in the delta area, each sell up to 70 percent of the
products outside the markets in their own provinces.
</P>
<P>
According to a provincial plan, Zhejiang will have manufactured
60 percent of the products in line with the international
standards by the end of this century. And it is expected to push
25 percent of its products into the world market by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
The Yangtze River Delta area has already forged stable economic
and trade ties with some 160 countries and regions. Its export
value soared to about 30 billion US dollars in 1995, or over 20
percent of China's total exports.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the area has launched some 1,000 enterprises and
trade agencies in over 70 countries and regions throughout the
world.

<HEADLINE> Singapore PM Accepts Invitation to Visit Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Singapore Prime Minister Goh
Chok Tong has accepted an invitation from Philippine President
Fidel Ramos to visit the Philippines, the Straits Times reported
today.
</P>
<P>
The invitation was conveyed in a letter from President Ramos,
which visiting Philippine Foreign Secretary Domingo Siazon handed
to Goh during their meeting on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Siazon said after the meeting that Goh had accepted the
invitation "in principle." As to the date of the visit, he said
that Goh had indicated several preferred time frames but the final
date would have to be worked out mutually through diplomatic
channels.
</P>
<P>
Siazon described the relations between the two countries as
back on "normal track" after they were strained by the hanging of
Filipino maid Flor Contemplacion for murder in Singapore last
year.
</P>
<P>
However, the foreign secretary said that more efforts would
have to be made by both countries to "beef up the relationship,"
which, he commented, had been slow in developing because of
historical reasons.
</P>
<P>
He said that the prospects for future Singapore-Philippine
relations were bright because of strong trade links. Singapore is
the third largest trading partner of the Philippines after the
United States and Japan.
</P>
<P>
Siazon, who is the first high ranking Philippine official to
visit Singapore after the normalization of diplomatic ties in
April with the exchange of ambassadors, was also quoted as saying
that the Contemplacion case had given both countries better
insights to deal with such problems should they arise in the
future.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Business is expected to be good in
China's rural markets during the second half of this year,
according to Monday's "Market News".
</P>
<P>
The Beijing daily said that increased incomes for farmers will
possibly lead to a greater demand for daily necessities and
agricultural equipment, and the clothing business in rural areas
will also increase.
</P>
<P>
A survey made by the State Information Center and the State
Planning Commission showed that 56.5 percent of rural residents
say they intend to spend more on clothing this year.
</P>
<P>
The consumption of durable goods will also increase, said the
newspaper, which predicts higher growth rate in sales of household
electrical appliances in rural than in urban markets.
</P>
<P>
The demand for color TV sets in rural areas, for example, is
expected to reach some three million in the July-December period.
</P>
<P>
The demand for the supplies for agricultural use, such as
chemical fertilizers and farm machinery, will maintain steady
growth.

<HEADLINE> Morocco King Refuses to Meet Netanyahu Before </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 18 (Xinhua) -- King Hassan II of Morocco has
refused to meet with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
before he talks with Palestinian National Authority President
Yasser Arafat, a report said today.
</P>
<P>
When Netanyahu balked at the terms, King Hassan turned down
his request to stop over in Morocco during his return from
the U.S. last week, The Jerusalem Post quoted sources as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The report said that Hassan even refused to speak to
Netanyahu on the phone after the hardline leader won the May
29 Israeli elections.
</P>
<P>
There is speculation that Hassan is interested in hosting a
Netanyahu-Arafat meeting. Israel and Morocco maintain liaison
offices in each other.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu has so far refused to make any firm promise to
talk with Arafat, although Foreign Minister David Levy said
Wednesday that he would meet Arafat next week.
</P>
<P>
Before his election victory in May 29, Netanyahu flatly
ruled out the possibility of his meeting with Arafat, whom
he blamed for harboring terrorism. But he softened this
position after tooking office in June, saying he would
consider such a meeting if "it's essential to the security
of the Israeli people."
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu is leaving for Egypt today for his first meeting
with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak to discuss the peace
process and bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
Reports said that Netanyahu would possibly announce the
Levy-Arafat meeting as a goodwill gesture to alleviate the
anxiety of the Arab world, which is upset about his hardline
policies.

<HEADLINE> Alatas on Expansion of ASEAN </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 18 (Xinhua) -- The ASEAN (Association of
Southeast Asian Nations) Standing Committee (ASC) has established
a working group to look into the applications of Cambodia and Laos
for ASEAN membership, Ali Alatas, Indonesian foreign minister and
chairman of the 29th ASC said here today.
</P>
<P>
In his closing speech at the 6th meeting of the ASC, Alatas
said that the working group has submitted its recommendations to
the ASC after carefully studying the report of its fact-finding
team.
</P>

The fact-finding team led by Indonesia has visited Cambodia and
Laos to observe the preparations of the two countries for ASEAN
membership. The team was impressed by the commitment and
determination of the two countries to become ASEAN members in
1997.
</P>
<P>
However, the team also observed that Cambodia and Laos are
facing serious difficulties in their preparations due to shortage
of human resources and funds needed for the organization and
maintenance of their respective national secretariats and for
their participation in ASEAN activities, Alatas said.
</P>
<P>
Another observation of the team is that the two countries may
also encounter difficulties in familiarizing themselves with the
organizational structures, legal systems and practices in ASEAN
member countries, he said.
</P>
<P>
On Myanmar's status, Alatas said that the country will be
admitted as an observer at the coming 29th ASEAN Ministerial
Meeting which will be held here on July 20-21 and attended by
foreign ministers from all the seven ASEAN members -- Brunei,
Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, the Philippines and

<HEADLINE> Non-state-run Enterprises Vigorous in Taishan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Non-state-run enterprises in
Taishan, the ancestral hometown of many overseas Chinese, have
developed vigorously over the past 17 years.
</P>
<P>
Since China introduced reform and opening-up policies in 1979,
many people in Taishan, in the southern Guangdong Province, have
used money provided by their relatives overseas to operate
businesses.
</P>
<P>
There are currently 23,000 of these enterprises, which employ
more than 140,000 people.
</P>
<P>
The government has extended support in various forms to these
non-state-run enterprises. And they are growing vigorously by
technological upgrading, forming enterprise groups and developing
the export-oriented economy.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the firms earned 266 million US dollars in foreign
exchange, accounting for 64 percent of the city's total.
</P>
<P>
Longjiang Electric Iron Factory, one of the non-state-run
businesses, was a family workshop in the 1980s. In recent years,
the factory has diversified its products by manufacturing
household appliances, batteries and motorcycles.
</P>
<P>
At the beginning of this year, the factory established the
International Baoma Group Company, and has set up an office in
Hong Kong. The group's output value is expected to reach 250
million yuan (about 30 million US dollars) this year.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Universal Primary Education, Major </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, July 18 (Xinhua) -- To universalize primary
education is perhaps one of the greatest challenges Pakistan faces
at the turn of the century.
</P>
<P>
The role of education has been widely considered as a prime
factor for social and economic development because it enhances
productivity directly by increasing the quality of labor through
refined skills.
</P>
<P>
The Pakistani government in recent years has been attaching
great importance to the development of education which didn't
receive due attention in the past.
</P>
<P>
The government of Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, which came to
power in October 1993, has time and again stressed the need for
streamlining primary education as it forms the basis for attaining
higher education in the field of science and technology, which is
a prerequisite for initiating the process of industrialization.
</P>
<P>
A recent report by the World Bank said that Pakistan has
succeeded in sending a growing number of children to primary
schools, and has seen a 4.9 percent annual growth in primary
school enrollment between 1988 and 1994.
</P>
<P>
However, Pakistan's enrollment rate remains relatively low and
trails behind its South Asian neighbors. Although universal
education has been the national policy since the 1950s, government
efforts have not raised the enrollment rate beyond the 60 percent
level.
</P>
<P>
The main reasons responsible for the lower enrollment rate in
Pakistan are believed to be the higher annual population growth
rate and meager allocation of funds for the development of
education. And besides, most of the children belonging to poor
families find it hard to get enrolled in schools due to financial
difficulties.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the quality of education has emerged as a major
obstacle to expanding enrollment for basic education. Female
teachers are in short supply in rural areas, and teachers are not
distributed efficiently according to the need, the World Bank
report said.
</P>
<P>
Official figures show that Pakistan's literacy rate at present
is only 37 percent, one of the lowest in the world. There are only
156,450 primary schools, including mosque schools, with a total
enrollment of 13,530.
</P>
<P>
Although during the last five years primary education
facilities increased by 7 percent and enrollment by 45 percent,
the backlog is yet to be cleared due primarily to the
non-availability of trained staff. The teacher-student ratio has
risen in these years from 1:37 to 1:40 today.
</P>
<P>
The Pakistani government has decided to raise the national
literacy rate from present 37 percent to 48 percent by mid 1998.
</P>
<P>
In order to ensure universal enrollment and a drastic reduction
in dropouts for primary school children in the five to nine year
age group, the government has decided to amend laws by which the
parents should be bound to send their children to school.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan's objective of providing universal primary education
by the next decade is within reach. However, the public sector
cannot do the job alone. Partnership between government, parents,
teachers, the private sector and non-governmental organizations is
necessary to realize this goal.

<HEADLINE> Water Level in Nanjing Rising to Third Highest in History </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Heavy rains over the past month
pushed the water level in China's longest river to 9.8 meters, 1.3
meters above the danger level, at Xiaguan, in Nanjing, capital of
east China's Jiangsu Province, Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Torrential rains have pounded the area since the rainy season
set in from June 3, with the volume of precipitation three times
that of the same period in normal years.
</P>
<P>
On July 15 and 17, the water flow rose from 65,000 cubic meters
per second to 70,000, where ordinary flow during the same period
in normal years is only 20,000 cubic meters.
</P>
<P>
The water level rose by 0.68 meters to 9.8 meters at Xiaguan
today, its third highest level since records have been kept. It is
predicted that with surges in the river the water level will
continue to rise, posing a threat to dykes, cities, and townships
along the river.
</P>
<P>
About 1.1 million people from seven cities including Nanjing,
Zhenjiang and Yangzhou along the river have been called up for
flood-relief efforts and involved themselves in flood control
work, repairing more than 20 vulnerable sites on the dykes, and
550,000 gunny sacks, over one million cubic meters of timber, and
some 160 tons of diesel have been collected for the rescue work.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, more than 500 officials at various levels have been
selected to direct flood control work at the frontlines.

<HEADLINE> "Dead" Villager Wins Lawsuit Against TV Station </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 18 (Xinhua) -- A newscaster's slip of the tongue
during a news broadcast has resulted in a lawsuit against a local
TV station.
</P>
<P>
According to today's Beijing-based "Guangming Daily," the
Jingjiang TV Station in east China's Jiangsu Province has been
ordered by the local People's Court to apologize for its incorrect
broadcast, and offer compensation of 800 yuan (96 US dollars) to
the plaintiff, Tao Jianguo, who the newscaster said was killed in
a traffic accident.
</P>
<P>
According to a TV news report on May 7, Tao Jianguo, who lives
in Beiliu Village in suburban Jingjiang, died in a motorcycle
accident because he had been under the influence of alcohol and
driving without a license -- illegal offenses in China.
</P>
<P>
Tao, who was very much alive at the time of the broadcast, was
shocked at the news. He later learned that the dead man was Tao
Jiankang, a fellow villager.
</P>
<P>
The TV station did not correct the name of the deceased until
May 13, even though Tao immediately contacted local traffic police
and the TV station and informed them of their error, according to
the report.
</P>
<P>
Tao filed a lawsuit against Jingjiang TV because he thought the
mistake, which was widely broadcast, damaged his reputation and
caused him mental anguish.
</P>
<P>
The court found the TV station guilty, and said it must
apologize to Tao, and make a public correction.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Tightens Reins on Transient Population </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 18 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese capital has tightened
the reins on its three million-strong transient population, by
investigating and subsequently prohibiting some of the 21 living
spaces and 179,683 rooms occupied by members of this group.
</P>
<P>
According to reports from a working conference on the local
transient population held in Beijing Wednesday, during the first
half of this year, the city engaged in a strict check of the 21
villages and removed 1,597 rooms that were built without
official permits.
</P>
<P>
The local authorities also strengthened security around the
campuses of about 60 universities, and banned 280,000
illegal peddlers.
</P>
<P>
Meng Xuenong, vice-mayor of the city, required governments at
all levels to improve their management of the floating population
in a bid to maintain a good social order in the capital.
</P>
<P>
The transient population has been problematic in China, as it
causes security and management problems in cities.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Tibet Scores Steady Economic Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, July 18 (Xinhua) -- The Tibet Autonomous Region reported
steady economic growth in the first half of this year, with a
sharp rise in industrial production and a lower price increase
range.
</P>
<P>
According to the Autonomous Regional Statistics Bureau, Tibet's
industrial production amounted to 253 million yuan during the
January-June period, up by nearly 12 percent from the same period
in 1995.
</P>
<P>
A bureau official said that increases were scored in production
of electricity, timber, cement and chromium ore.
</P>
<P>
Tibet invested 1.03 billion yuan in fixed assets, meeting 33
percent of its annual target, the official said.
</P>
<P>
For the first time in three years, the price increase range
fell to less than ten percent during that period, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that a lower price increase range is due largely to the
introduction of the system for reserves of such daily necessities
as food grain, tea, sugar, meat and butter.
</P>
<P>
From January through June, Tibetan farmers upgraded 16,000
hectares of low and relatively low-yield farmland and built 4,250
hectares of terraced fields.

<HEADLINE> IMF Approves $446 Million Credit For Kazakhstan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 17 (Xinhua) --The International Monetary Fund
(IMF) today approved a three-year credit equivalent to 446 million
U.S. dollars for Kazakhstan under the extended fund facility (EFF).
</P>
<P>
The credit is provided to support the Kazakh government's
medium-term economic reform program for 1996-98. Of the total
funding, about 54 million dollars will be available to Kazakhstan
in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The program is aimed at reducing annual inflation from 60
percent in 1995 to 26 percent in 1996, and to ten percent or less
by 1998.
</P>
<P>
According to the program, the decline in output is expected to
stabilize in 1996 before rebounding to at least two percent of
positive growth a year in 1997-98. The external current account
deficit is projected to stay in the range of four to five percent
of GDP and gross international reserves are targeted to rise to
the equivalent of about four months of imports of goods.
</P>
<P>
Kazakhstan joined the IMF in July 1992. Its quota is about 357
million dollars and its outstanding use of IMF credit currently
totals about 553 million dollars.

<P>
PYONGYANG, July 18 (Xinhua) -- The Democratic People's
Republic of Korea (DPRK) today began a "Solidarity with the Cuban
People" month, to demonstrate the Korean people's support for
Cuban people and further strengthen bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
An accompanying editorial in the official Rodong Sinmum
newspaper called "Firm Support, Resolute Support," said the
Korean people "will fully support the just cause of the Cuban
people."
</P>
<P>
Imperialists have tried all contemptible means in an attempt to
strangle socialist Cuba.
</P>
<P>
For the past several decades, imperialists have not only tried
to vilify Cuba internationally, but have also attempted to isolate
it politically, smother it economically, and strangle it
militarily, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
However, none of these plots could make the Cuban people
succumb and they have never retreated from the road they have
chosen themselves, it noted.
</P>
<P>
Despite the vast oceans that separate the two countries, the
two peoples are closely bound together by their friendship, and
the Korean people will always support the Cuban people's just
cause in safeguarding their national independence and sovereignty,
the editorial said.

<HEADLINE> Thai Air Stewardesses May Work Until 60 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 18 (Xinhua) -- The management of the Thai Airways
International (Thai) Wednesday made a compromise and agreed to
allow its air stewardesses to work aboard until 60.
</P>
<P>
The state firm's decision came after the female cabin
attendants complained that the national carrier, which allows male
cabin crew to work until the age of 60, had a gender
discrimination policy against them, the Bangkok Post said.
</P>
<P>
A major concern over the company's decision to extend its air
hostesses' retirement age from 45 to 60 is whether the carrier
with the new regulation would stand to lose in competition with
other airlines, some of which have a policy to retire their air
hostesses at 35.
</P>
<P>
Thamnoon Wanglee, president of the company, said that female
cabin attendants will be hired to work on board as special staff
after they turn 45.
</P>
<P>
They would have to undergo medical check-ups, meet company
requirements on personality and appearance, pass an emergency test
to prove they could still handle passenger safety, Thamnoon said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the company is also consulting with the Finance
Ministry to give pensions to air hostesses who voluntarily retire
at 45.

<P>
KATHMANDU, July 18 (Xinhua) -- A pro-abortion bill has been
registered in the parliament with a view to protecting Nepali
women's rights to decide over abortion, a legislator said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference here Wednesday, Upper house MP
Sunil Kumar Bhandari said that he had registered the 1996 fetus
protection bill at the Parliament Secretariat as a
non-governmental bill for the ongoing parliament session.
</P>
<P>
he said the bill proposes that fetus of upto three months could
be aborted on the request of husband or guardian in the case of
unmarried woman.
</P>
<P>
Under the bill, for rape victims and those women who become
pregnant through incest or whose lives are in danger under
pregnancy, abortion could be done provided that the fetus is upto
18 weeks.
</P>
<P>
Many Nepali women are dying untimely and problems relating to
the health of mother and child is increasing due to lack of proper
 management, said a press release issued at the press conference
held by the Nepal Family Planning Association.
</P>
<P>
Nepal's existing laws prohibit abortion but the activity has
become widespread in urban and rural areas for a long time.
</P>
<P>
A social survey shows that 68 percent women in Nepal are
willing to undergo abortion to avoid big economic burden from the
over-sized family.
</P>
<P>
Another recent survey shows that 34 percent of Nepali women get
married before 15, and of the country's population of nearly 21
million, 19 percent people are actively involved in pre-marital
sex while 16 percent have experiences of extra-marital sex.

BANGKOK, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Gordon Wu, managing director of
Hopewell Co., has assured that his company will complete the
elevated train system in Bangkok in time for the 1998 Asian Games.
</P>
<P>
Wu's promise was made to Deputy Prime Minister Thaksin

give the contractor a three-month reprieve to arrange financing
and continue the long-delayed project.
</P>
<P>
The mass transit project is considered important for easing
Bangkok's traffic problems before the Asian Games, scheduled for
December 1998.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet decision came after Thaksin had strongly criticized
the contractor for allegedly breaking earlier pledges to get the
scheme off the ground.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet had asked Hopewell to show by Wednesday that it had
commitments from lenders to finance the project, but Hopewell
could only provide letters of intent from Japanese and British
banks.

<HEADLINE> Official Urges More Controls over Cashmere Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Beijing, July 18 (Xinhua) -- China should control cashmere
exports both to save the rare resource and also to tap more
effectively into the international market with more finished
products containing the precious wool, China Daily reported today.
</P>
<P>
Chinese traders should cut down exports of raw cashmere, but
should increase exports of cashmere garments, since cashmere
products are far more expensive than the raw material, said an
official with the China National textile Council.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, one ton of cashmere sells for less
than 60,000 US dollars, but a piece of cloth made with 0.4 kg of
cashmere can be sold for 300 US dollars, and the price of a heavy
coat made with 1.4 kg of cashmere is as high as 1,000 US dollars.
</P>
<P>
By shifting the emphasis from raw cashmere to cloth and
clothing made with cashmere, China stands to earn at least twice
as much in foreign exchange, or about three billion yuan (360
million US dollars) annually.
</P>
<P>
Provinces in North and Northwest China are the country's major
cashmere producers.
</P>
<P>
Of the world's annual output of cashmere, less than 10,000
tons, China produces more than half.

<TEXT>
<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, July 17 (Xinhua) -- The new Colombian
Foreign Minister Maria Emma Mejia pledged that she will rebuild
relations between her country and the United States on the basis
of respect and self-determination.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister, who took her oath of office at noon today
before President Ernesto Samper, vowed that she will seek "to
de-narcotize" U.S.-Colombian relations and open up greater flows
in the fields of trade, energy, environment and culture.
</P>
<P>
The minister revealed that she met Tuesday with Myles
Frechette, the U.S. ambassador to Colombia at a meeting which she
described as "a working meeting, not a friendly one".
</P>
<P>
"I proposed to him the possibility of having a bilateral work
agenda," said the minister.
</P>
<P>
"There is no doubt that the topic of drug trafficking is
important and I notified Ambassador Frechette of the Colombian
government's intention to handle the matter of extradition as
another mechanism in the war against the trafficking of
psychotropic substances," she added.
</P>
<P>
Emma Mejia, who served as education minister, was appointed
foreign minister on July 10 to replace Rodrigo Pardo Garcia-Pena
who submitted his resignation to President Samper on July 8.

<HEADLINE> Ukraine May Introduce State of Emergency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Ukraine may impose elements of a
state of emergency to counter threats to national security from
nationalist extremists after the attempted assassination of Prime
Minister Pavlo Lazarenko, a top security official said here today.
</P>
<P>
Right and left-wing radical extremists are threatening the
country's security and very existence, National Security Council
chairman Vladimir Gorbulin said after a council meeting called in
response to Tuesday's car-bomb attack on Lazarenko.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister was shaken but escaped unhurt when the blast
damaged his car as he was heading to Kiev airport.
</P>
<P>
Gorbulin said the government would take firm measures to
protect stability and avoid chaos. He gave no concrete details,
but said they involved better protection for top leaders.
</P>
<P>
"I cannot say this is a state of emergency but elements of a
state of emergency will be introduced."
</P>
<P>
Gorbulin said unless action was taken immediately, Ukraine's
independence would come under threat.
</P>
<P>
"The task before us is not an easy one. But if we do not start
to solve these problems I cannot be sure that by autumn we will be
able to speak of Ukraine as an independent state," he said.
</P>
<P>
Gorbulin said corrupt and radical forces were working to launch
action against economic reforms promoted by President Kuchma and
his close ally Prime Minister Lazarenko.
</P>
<P>
He said the threat came from corrupt politicians who had
infiltrated councils in various parts of the country and extremist
nationalist organizations.
</P>
<P>
He said illegal paramilitary organizations would be eliminated.
</P>
<P>
He mentioned the army set up by the Ukraine Nationalist
Congress, a political organization of ultra-right nationalists in
the west of Ukraine, to "protect Ukraine's independence".
</P>
<P>
A statement from President Kuchma's office after the meeting
said the country was under threat from organized crime, corrupt
officials and extreme right and left-wing anti-government
organizations including paramilitary organizations.
</P>
<P>
These opposed the country's new constitution, adopted last
month, and economic reforms, and were stepping up their activities.
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's attack on Lazarenko, a close ally of President
Kuchma, was the first on a top leader since the former Soviet
republic gained indepedence in 1991.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister was on the way to Kiev airport to fly to the
Donbass coalfield, where up to 200,000 miners have been striking
to demand months of back pay.

<P>
They were urged to cooperate in politics and foreign affairs,
especially in various international organizations, on economic and
trade affairs, science and technology, education and sports.

<HEADLINE> Sustained Economic Growth Forecast For ASEAN </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 18 (Xinhua) -- The Association of Southeast Asian
Nations (ASEAN) is expected to achieve sustained economic growth
and maintain macroeconomic stability for the year 1996, according
to a forecast prepared by the ASEAN Secretariat.
</P>
<P>
The macroeconomic forecast available here today said that the
average gross domestic product (GDP) growth rate for the ASEAN
region is forecast to be 7.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
On economic performance of the ASEAN countries, the forecast
said, Singapore's growth is expected to moderate slightly in
1995-1996 compared to the year before. The high performing
economies of Malaysia and Thailand are expected to sustain their
vigorous economic performance of the past year.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia will enter another year of very strong growth and the
 Philippines will continue its economic turnaround.
</P>
<P>
Brunei will improve its economic performance as a result of the
continuing diversification of its economy.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, exports will continue to lead the way for ASEAN
countries. According to the forecast, exports of the region will
grow by more than 20 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
The total ASEAN trade (exports and imports) in 1996 would
amount to nearly 600 billion US dollars, making the region the
fourth largest trading region in the world after the US, Japan and
the European Union.
</P>
<P>
According to the forecast, inflation will continue to be low
for most countries in the region. However, Indonesia and the
Philippines may have to struggle to keep inflationary pressures
down and below the double-digit level.
</P>
<P>
It is also forecast that gross domestic investment will make up
a big proportion of the region's GDP. The range is from 30 percent
for the Philippines to nearly half of GDP for Singapore.
</P>
<P>
Gross domestic investment in the region is expected to reach
235 billion US dollars in 1996.

<P>
BEIJING, July 18 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese capital plans to build
more infrastructure facilities to improve the city's ability to
collect and dispose of garbage, which amounts to 10,000 tons per
day.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing municipal government is co-operating with Germany
to build five garbage disposal projects with a total investment of
39 million deutsche marks (25.5 million US dollars) in Chaoyang
and Fengtai districts and Tongxian and Daxing counties.
</P>
<P>
A garbage incinerator, built with domestic technology and
capable of burning 500 tons of garbage daily, will go into
operation in Changping County this month, according to the Beijing
Sanitation Administration (BSA),
</P>
<P>
Haidian District also plans to build a 33-hectare rubbish
landfill with a low-interest loan from Spain, today's "China
Daily" reported.
</P>
<P>
"As Chinese begin to consume more, residential garbage disposal
is becoming a bigger problem", the report said, "The country
produces about 100 million tons of domestic garbage annually."
</P>
<P>
More than two-thirds of Chinese cities are now surrounded by
smelly rubbish dumps, including Beijing, it said.
</P>
<P>
Big cities such as Beijing and Shanghai have set a target of
raising the percentage of processed garbage to 60 percent by the
year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Several attempts to turn rubbish into treasure at a low cost
are underway in scientific labs or in makeshift workshops.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing Shijingshan Rubbish Treatment Demonstration Center
has started to use a new technology to turn 95 percent of domestic
trash into organic compound fertilizer and bricks.
</P>
<P>
The center is listed by the city government as one of the
city's ten major environmental protection projects to be completed
this year.
</P>
<P>
With a first-phase investment of 13 million yuan (1.56 million
US dollars), it can now treat 250 tons of domestic rubbish each
day and is able to turn out five tons of organic compound
fertilizer an hour.

BEIJING, July 18 (Xinhua) -- After coming early, staying late,
and dumping record rainfalls on Shanghai, the plum rain season is
expected to quit Shanghai this week, said today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
Residents can look forward to a subtropical front headed for
Shanghai, which should push temperatures up sharply, according to
the Shanghai Meteorology Bureau.
</P>
<P>
This year's rainy season, also known locally as plum rain
season since it coincides with the plum harvest, was longer and
wetter than usual.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai entered plum rain season on June 3, about 13 days
earlier than usual. The rainy season usually ends around July 7,
but this year it lingered a few more days, leaving behind record
levels of precipitation, the bureau said.
</P>
<P>
As of July 14, total precipitation measured 559.5 millimeters,
one of the three biggest rainfalls in Shanghai's 124-year
meteorological history.
</P>
<P>
Only in 1875 and 1919 did plum rains exceed 500 millimeters.
</P>
<P>
There were four major downpours during the period, and rainfall
in downtown areas was much heavier than rural areas.
</P>
<P>
The heavy rain challenged the city's anti-flood systems, which
were fully developed to ensure the industrial production and
safety of citizens.

The Venezuelan commission arrived in Nicaragua on Monday to
exchange information with the Nicaraguan General Auditor's Office,
the Central Bank and the Ministry of Transportation and
Construction.
</P>
<P>
The 30 million dollars had been granted by FIV to Nicaragua for
the building of the Boaco-Muy Muy highway in central Nicaragua.
</P>
<P>
Abnormalities in the use of the money was first revealed last
month by Jose Vicente Rangel, a well-known Venezuelan journalist.
</P>
<P>
Sources close to the investigation said that at least one third
of the 30 million dollars may have been siphoned off via juicy
commissions.
</P>
<P>
Antonio Gremli, FIV's internal deputy controller and head of
the Venezuelan commission, told the local press that he is
satisfied with his initial contacts with the Nicaragua authorities.
</P>
<P>
He said that the conduct of some Venezuelan officials in the
highway project will be investigated.
</P>
<P>
The highway project is being carried out by a Venezuelan
consortium, which is suspected of having presented a padded budget
to the Nicaraguan Ministry of Transportation and Construction.
</P>
<P>
Construction work is behind schedule, Nicaragua sources said,
adding that only seven kilometers have been completed instead of
the planned 40 kilometers.

<HEADLINE> Namibian Foreign Minister Rejects U.S. Blockade Against Cuba </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Namibia rejects U.S. sanctions
against Cuba with the same vigour it fought for its independence,
Namibian Foreign Minister Theo Ben Gurirab said here today.
</P>
<P>
Gurirab, on his second visit to the island, condemned
the U.S. Helms-Burton law which penalizes foreign companies doing
business with Cuba, labelling it as a relic of the Cold War era.
</P>
<P>
The main aim of Gurirab's five-day visit to Cuba is to
strengthen and intensify the "excellent relations" that already
exist between their two countries.
</P>
<P>
These relations date back more than 30 years when Cuban and
Namibian blood was shed jointly "in the quest for the most noble
ideals of man," said the minister.
</P>
<P>
The two countries established diplomatic relations on March 21,
1990 when the South African country celebrated its first
independence day.
</P>
<P>
He said his government, together with other sovereign states,
were making great efforts toward democratization and general
reform of the United Nations and the Security Council.
</P>
<P>
Gurirab said Namibia supports the re-election of
U.N. Secretary-General Boutros Boutros Ghali, whose bid has
already been supported by the member countries of the United
African Organization (UAO).
</P>
<P>
The minister, whose visit ends tomorrow, signed an agreement on
air transport services with his Cuban counterpart Roberto
Robaina. Cuba has already signed similar accords with some 50
countries.

<HEADLINE> Former Paraguayan President Accused of Cocaine Trafficking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Former Paraguayan President
Andres Rodriguez was charged on Tuesday with alleged participation
in drug trafficking six years ago when he was the head of state.
</P>
<P>
Telam, the official Argentine news agency, quoted Paraguayan
judicial sources as saying that two charges were filed against him.
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez was supposedly involved in a 343 kilogram cocaine
shipment that was discovered nearly six years ago in a light plane
in Chaco near the Bolivian border.
</P>
<P>
The authorities said at the time that the drug was used as a
bait in a failed "undercover operation" to trap important drug
traffickers operating in the region.
</P>
<P>
But witnesses insisted that it was a genuine cocaine deal
because there was no undercover work in that operation.
</P>
<P>
A witness said that he was hired at the time by Rodriguez to
substitute the cocaine with English salt before the shipment was
destroyed.

The newspaper Ardyn Erh (People's Power) quoted Puntsagiyn

He said that thanks to trade surpluses in the past two years,
the country boasts a foreign exchange reserve of 57 million
U.S. dollars as of July 1 this year.

<P>
Jasray was addressing the last session of the current
parliament.

<HEADLINE> NATO Not to Tolerate Attacks on Peace-keepers in Bosnia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, July 17 (Xinhua) -- The NATO-led multinational
implementation force (IFOR) in former Yugoslavia will not tolerate
any attack on its personnel or any interference in the performance
of their duties, NATO Secretary General Javier Solana said here
today.
</P>
<P>
The NATO chief made the remarks amid growing threats that IFOR
soldiers or personnel working for international organizations in
Bosnia would be attacked or kidnapped if the international
community went ahead with the arrest of war criminals.
</P>
<P>
"I repeat clearly that NATO has the capability and rules of
engagement to carry out its missions and to defend itself in those
missions," Solana told a news conference at the NATO Headquarters,
together with George Joulwan, the Supreme Allied Commander,
Europe, and Leighton Smith, commander-in-chief of IFOR and NATO's
Allied Forces of Southern Europe.
</P>
<P>
Responding to the increasing criticism that NATO had not been
working hard enough to help arrest the war criminals, especially
Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic and Serb commander Ratko
Mladic, Admiral Smith said that his force was not authorized to
carry out the task.
</P>
<P>
"I do not have the authority to arrest anyone, but we can and
we will detain those with whom we are coming in contact during the
normal course of our duties," he said.
</P>
<P>
Solana refused to say whether NATO is in favour of a proposal
from some member countries to seek a U.N. Security Council
authorization to arrest Karadzic and Mladic.
</P>
<P>
He said, however, that "all options are open" and that "the
distance between Pale (where the two Serb strongmen stay) and The
Hague (where the International War Crime Tribunal is based) is
becoming shorter and shorter."
</P>
<P>
General Joulwan said the most important task is to guarantee
the Bosnia election in September, which is crucial for the peace
process.
</P>
<P>
Before the press conference, Solana presented Admiral Smith,
who is going to retire in a few days, the NATO medal and bid him
farewell with a brief ceremony outside the main entrance of NATO
headquarters.
</P>
<P>
The Secretary General praised his great contribution to NATO
and to the Alliance's largest ever military operation outside its
territory.
</P>
<P>
"His name will be long remembered by all parties involved in
implementing the Dayton Accord," he said.
</P>
<P>
Admiral Smith will be replaced by U.S. Rear-Admiral Joseph
Lopez.

<P>
CARACAS, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Venezuela's 17 national
universities went on a 48-hour strike today, demanding the
government abide its promises to settle a pay dispute.
</P>
<P>
The stoppage, organized by the Federation of Venezuelan
University Professor Associations (FAPUV), is in protest at the
government's refusal to honour the retroactive payments agreed
between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
FAPUV President Jose Rafael Casal Heredia warned that if the
government failed to take notice of the strike, the national
university unions will be forced to take further action.
</P>
<P>
The strike is part of a long-running dispute with the
government over university funding and follows a 24-hour stoppage
organized by the union in May this year in protest over the
government's failure to fulfill its financial obligations to the
country's universities.

TEGUCIGALPA, July 17 (Xinhua) -- A ring of smugglers of illegal
immigrants in which Herby Dennis Weizemblut Oliva, the Honduran
Consul in Hong Kong and Jerry Stuchiner, who is in charge of
immigration services in Honduras, are involved, was discovered
by the Hong Kong commission for fighting against corruption.
</P>

The information was made public through a fax sent to the

According to the source, the accused had a well-established
network of false Honduran documents that were sold to Chinese
citizens so they could go to the United States.
</P>
<P>
Stuchiner was arrested in the Hong Kong airport and was in
possession of five Honduran passports, as the U.S. embassy in that
country confirmed and whose spokesperson Paul Koselzka commented
that "not all the Americans who work in embassies are angels."
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong authorities announced that the Honduran diplomat will
be deported in the next few hours since he was only given house
arrest due to the diplomat immunity he enjoys under the Geneva
Treaties.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Alexander Lebed, secretary of
Russia's powerful Security Council and national security aide to
President Boris Yeltsin, hailed today the appointment of Colonel
General Igor Rodionov as Defense Minister.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued tonight, Lebed said, "I think the
President acted wisely (in appointing Rodionov), the whole Russia
will benefit from this appointment."
</P>
<P>
Russian President Boris Yeltsin named Rodionov, 59, the new
defense minister earlier Wednesday to replace much-disliked Pavel
Grachev, who was dismissed a month ago.
</P>
<P>
Lebed has actively lobbied for Rodionov's candidacy despite
harsh attacks from the entourage of Grachev, experts here said.
</P>
<P>
A career officer, Rodionov, who was born on December 1, 1936,
made his way from platoon commander to Defense Minister.
</P>
<P>
Rodionov, just as Lebed, is an Afghan war veteran. After
serving in Afghanistan, he commanded the Caucasian military
district in 1988-1989 and was the military commandant of the
Georgian capital of Tbilisi.
</P>
<P>
Rodionov, in an interview with the Itar-Tass news agency, said
that he would mostly focus on Chechnya and other "hot spots" as
well as the army reform.

<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, July 17 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese men's basketball team,
who arrived here Wednesday after three warm-up games in the United
States, is ready for the battle against Angola in its group A
opener Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"It's very important for us to beat Angola in the group
competition," said coach Gong Luming after a two-week training in
Portland, Phoenix and Los Angeles where the Chinese cagers lost to
the Dream Team by 61 points, Magic All-Stars by 24 points and Los
Angeles selected team by 20 points.
</P>
<P>
"Though we lost all these exhibition matches, we learned a lot
and improved physically and psychologically," Gong said. "I know
our fight with African champions Angola will be very tough but my
players are well prepared and confident."
</P>
<P>
China was drawn with the United States, Lithuania, Croatia,
Argentina, Angola and two other teams in group A of which the
first four will advance to the quarterfinals. China is no match
for the hosts, Lithuania and Croatia but may hopefully overcome
Angola and Argentina. If so, China will be among the top eight in
the Olympic basketball tournament for the first time.
</P>
<P>
China went down to Angola at the last Olympics in Barcelona and was
ranked 12th.
</P>
<P>
"The Angolan team is quick with several experienced players
moving about the court in Barcelona," Gong said. "But we have
improved both offensively and defensively since then."
</P>
<P>
Comparatively speaking, Gong said that his team is strong in
frontline with good shooters Hu Weidong, Sun Jun and Liu Yudong
but weak inside. "As long as we play a balanced game at the two
ends, I'm sure we can beat Angola."

<HEADLINE> Colombia: Court Denies Extradition of Italian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, July 17 (Xinhua) -- The Supreme Court of
Justice in Colombia denied the Italian government the extradition
of Augusto Salgaredo, an Italian citizen now in jail for drug
trafficking, said judicial sources today.
</P>
<P>
Salgaredo's extradition was requested last year by Italian
authorities who also charged him for trafficking narcotic between
America and Europe.
</P>
<P>
The same court denied bail to the Italian who is serving a
40-month sentence in Modelo, a federal prison here.
</P>
<P>
August Salgaredo was sentenced by the 19th Criminal Court of
the Cartagena circuit for violating law 30 of 1986 or the
narcotic drug statute.
</P>
<P>
On denying his extradition the Supreme Court of Ordinary
justice pointed out the charges against Augusto in Italy and
Colombia are not equivalent.
</P>
<P>
Since his extradition was denied, the Italian will remain in
Colombia to serve out his sentence, according to the sources.

<P>
BUCHAREST, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Romania will punish local
officials who have officially received the wife and daughter of
the former king, a government statement said here today.
</P>
<P>
Former King Mihai's wife Ana and his daughter Margareta arrived
in the country last week for an 11-day private tour and have
visited several counties in western Romania.
</P>
<P>
Romania's constitution, passed in 1991 after the collapse of
the Soviet Union, stipulates that the country is a republic. But
the government alleges that during a visit by the two women to the
city of Timosoara, the county assembly held activities akin to a
constitutional monarchy.
</P>
<P>
The assembly held a special meeting to welcome the former
king's wife and daughter and some local officials made remarks
incompatible with their status, the government statement said.
</P>
<P>
Mihai, who was enthroned in 1940, abdicated in 1947 when the
People's Republic of Romania was established. He later fled to
Switzerland.

<TEXT>
<P>
WARSAW, July 17 (Xinhua) -- About 15 in every 100 Polish
workers are still without job even though the country's
unemployment has dropped to the lowest level since November 1992.
</P>
<P>
There are 2.5 million jobless people at the end of June,
according to the latest statistics issued by the Polish central
planning commission.
</P>
<P>
Unemployment in June were 60,000 people less than in May,
bringing down the nationwide jobless rate to 14.3 percent. The
1995 rate was 16.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Among the unemployed, 60 percent are people under the age of 34.
</P>
<P>
The Polish government is trying to replace unemployment benefit
with scholarships to lure jobless young people to go back to
schools, hoping this will help improve social stability.

<P>
The state is also encouraging the development of
labor-intensive industries such as tourism, transportation and
small enterprises to create more jobs.

<P>
Poland still faces an uphill struggle against unemployment as
the demographers predict that the country's 18-year-olds will
increase to 9 million in the next 15 years, which will add
pressure on labor market.

<HEADLINE> China Aims to End Disorder in Shipping Sector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 18 (Xinhua) -- The Ministry of Communications has
suspended approval of new shipping companies to slow uncontrolled
growth in waterway transportation, according to China Maritime
News.
</P>
<P>
Approval of applications to establish or expand shipping
companies operating on domestic or international waterways has
stopped.
</P>
<P>
Starting July 1, passenger ships, cargo vessels with handling
capacity greater than 10,000 tons, and ships ferrying liquid gas
or chemical goods must receive specific Ministry permission.
</P>
<P>
An investigation of the maritime transport market is to be
conducted soon to strengthen management of the market.
</P>
<P>
According to Ministry sources, maritime shipping has been
plagued with problems, such as an uncontrolled increase in
handling capacity and chaotic competition, as some shippers
recklessly pursue profit.
</P>
<P>
In the past few years, a more open and market-oriented system
has been introduced to the waterway transport sector, which
handles more than 90 percent of China's foreign trade cargo and
acts as a lifeline to areas which depend on water routes.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1995, the Ministry had approved 290 companies for
international sea transport, with handling capacity totalling 23.5
million tons, as well as more than 1,300 companies for offshore
transport, and 5,100-plus companies for inland water transport.
</P>
<P>
The number and handling capacity of shipping companies ,
however, has been growing too rapidly and greatly exceeds demand,
the paper said.

<HEADLINE> Moscow Draws Blueprint for Chechen Settlement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Russia today decided to hold talks
with all political forces in the rebel republic of Chechnya to
keep on track the process of gaining a settlement of the Chechnya
crisis.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made at a meeting of the State Commission on
Chechen Settlement, which was called to analyze the changes in the
rebel republic after the implementation of President Boris
Yeltsin's peace plan and draw a program for further actions.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the one-day meeting, Russian Prime Minister Viktor
Chernomyrdin said, "The major obstacle to further progress is the
vicious circle in which peace talks alternate with outbreaks of
fighting."
</P>
<P>
The vicious circle pointed to Chechen separatist leader
Zelimkhan Yandarbiyev's weakness and inability to fully control
the rebel forces of some 15,000 men, he added.
</P>
<P>
With this view, the commission proposed to engage all political
forces in Chechnya in dialogue on the settlement of the crisis,
Chernomyrdin announced at a news conference after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
He said that the commission also approved a plan for financing
a number of expedient social and economic restructuring measures,
agrarian reform and restoration of the educational system in the
republic.
</P>
<P>
The plan was fully supported by powerful Security Council
Secretary Alexander Lebed, who earlier spoke sharply against
providing any funds to Chechnya before the end of armed
hostilities on its territory, Itar-Tass said.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin said that Yeltsin's peace plan remains as the only
basis for past and future action as it has already yielded certain
political, military and foreign policy results.
</P>
<P>
"We have succeeded in neutralizing the separatist regime and
the threat to Russia's territorial integrity was significantly
dismissed," he said.
</P>
<P>
On the military aspect, Chernomyrdin said that the federal
troops "succeeded in destroying the principal military potential
of the illegally armed formations."
</P>
<P>
He conceded that Moscow had to pay a great price for the
progress in scaling down military operations in the rebel
republic.

<HEADLINE> Grain Output Expected to Rise in Czech Republic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PRAGUE, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Grain output in the Czech Republic
was expected to increase to a total of 6.53 million tons this
year, up slightly over 1995, the latest official statistics said.
</P>
<P>
The hike will be much helpful in relaxing a long-term grain
tension in the central European country, said a spokeswoman of the
National Statistics Bureau.
</P>
<P>
Grain production in the republic had decreased for a couple of
years until 1995, when the situation improved for the first time
partly thanks to measures taken by the government on boosting
agricultural funds and adjusting grain prices.

<HEADLINE> Love for Horse Forces Withdrawal of U.S. Rider </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Horse rider Dorothy Trapp, a
silver medalist in the 1994 World Championships, withdrew from the
1996 United States Olympic Team-Equestrian today, because of
bruises on the heels of her horse Molokai.
</P>
<P>
"Molokai is sound and ready to compete here," said Trapp, "but
because of some bruises on the heels of his front legs, I know he
would experience some pain and I love him too much for him to go
through that."
</P>
<P>
Trapp said Molokai got the bruises in late June and has
improved to the point that he is "ninety percent" OK. "If the
event were just one week later, he'd be 100 percent," she said.
</P>
<P>
Trapp has been riding Molokai since 1987. They finished eighth
in the 1991 Fair Hill International three-day event and placed in
the top ten at Burghley in 1993 and 1994. They were also among
the top six in three British horse trials.
</P>
<P>
"As much as I'd like to ride in the Olympic Games, all that
matters is what's best for Molokai," Trapp said. "The timing is
just a little off. I'm not going to be sad though, I'm doing
what's best for Molokai and I know it's the right thing to do."
</P>
<P>
Trapp is being replaced on the U.S. roster by Mara Depuy on her
horse Hopper. Depuy and Hopper's best record is a first place
finish in the Bromont three-day event in Canada in 1993 and a
third place finish in the 1994 Fair Hill International.

consumption country, has always been active in the cooperation
in the rubber field, and will continue such efforts in the future.

<HEADLINE> Pentagon to Protect US Troops from Terrorist Attacks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 17 (Xinhua) -- The Pentagon is undertaking new
measures to shield its troops abroad from weapons of mass
destruction, U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
According to Perry, up to 4,000 U.S. troops in Saudi Arabia may
be moved to protect them from threatened terror attacks with bombs
four or five times as large as the one that recently killed 19
servicemen in Dhahran of the Meddle East country.
</P>
<P>
"We are going to prepare for a very intense threat. It will be
costly, Perry said in meeting with nearly two dozen senators to
discus the protection measures.
</P>
<P>
"Terrorists... trying to drive us out of Saudi Arabia" could
attack U.S. forces in the Middle East and Bosnia with chemical or
biological weapons, he said.
</P>
<P>
They must be protected from "chemical weapon attack, biological
weapon attack, bombs even bigger than 3,000 pounds -- bombs in the
10,000- to 20,000-pound category -- mortar attacks," Perry said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a photo session in his office, the defense
secretary warned that "more significant attacks" are possible in
the Persian Gulf area and said steps must be taken to protect U.S.
forces based there.
</P>
<P>
The secretary also said his nation must make "fundamental and
drastic" changes in the way its forces are deployed and protected
in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
"I believe we have to be prepared for more attacks on our
forces... all over the Gulf region, whether it is Saudi Arabia,
Kuwait, Qatar, Bahrain. In each of those, we have some information
that suggests that there may be specific threats in those
countries," the secretary said.
</P>
<P>
Perry specified that the troops should be moved from urban
areas to more secure military sites.

<HEADLINE> UK Public Sector Borrowing Stands at 3.6bn Pounds in June </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 17 (Xinhua) -- The British government borrowed 3.6
billion pounds (5.6 billion US dollars) last month to cover the
shortfall between spending and tax revenue, according to the
Office for National Statistics (ONS).
</P>
<P>
Last month's data were up on June last year and well above the
three billion pounds (4.7 billion US dollars) expected in the
City.
</P>
<P>
In addition, May's public sector borrowing requirement (PSBR)
was revised up by 300 million pounds (465 million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
Together this took the cumulative PSBR in the first three
months of the financial year, excluding privatization proceeds, to
12 billion pounds (18.6 billion US dollars), up from 11.3 billion
pounds (17.5 billion US dollars) at the same stage last year.
</P>
<P>
This means that Kenneth Clarke, the Chancellor, is not on
course to meet his target for government borrowing for this year,
which he raised only last week by 4.5 billion pounds (7 billion US
dollars) to 26.9 billion pounds (41.7 billion US dollars).
</P>
<P>
Eddie George, governor of the Bank of England, said Tuesday
that the figures left him feeling uncomfortable, and many City
analysts said that the PSBR figures were disappointing.
</P>
<P>
But the Treasury pointed out that government spending had been
boosted last month by unusually high interest payments on
government debt rather than as the result of a fundamental
deterioration in the government's finances.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Plans to Protect Troops from Massive Attacks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 17 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. military is going to
work out a sweeping plan to protect its troops in the Gulf and
other areas against chemical and biological attacks as well as
massive truck bombings, U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry said
on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"We have to be prepared for a chemical-weapon attack, a
biological-weapon attack, bombs even bigger than 3,000 pounds
(1,300 kilograms) -- bombs in the 10,000-to-20,000 pound
(4,500-to-9,000 kilogram) category -- mortar attacks,"he said at a
briefing at the Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
"This is an initiative to provide adequate protection for our
forces in the face of what I consider to be a threat of weapons of
mass destruction in the hands of terrorists," he added.
</P>
<P>
He admitted it needs "substantial support from the Congress",
and requires both "policy and financial support".
</P>
<P>
Perry reaffirmed that there would be movement of 3,000 or 4,000
American troops within Saudi Arabia this summer for their
protection following the truck bomb attack on June 25 in Dhahran,
which killed 19 American soldiers and injured several hundred
others.
</P>
<P>
He said Washington is also concerned about possible damaging
attacks on its troops in other Gulf states and in Europe.

<HEADLINE> Australia Expects Improved Performance in Atlanta </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Australian sports leader said
today that his athletes are looking for improved performance at
the Atlanta Olympic Games and a harvest of more than 27 medals.
</P>
<P>
"We achieved gradual improvement in all the sports" in the past
a few years, said John Coates, president of the Australian Olympic
Committee. "Now we are better. We expect more than 27 medals from
the games."
</P>
<P>
Australia, a rising sports powerhouse in the Pacific, took home
27 medals, including seven in gold, nine in silver and 11 in
bronze, from the Barcelona Games.
</P>
<P>
Australia sent 290 athletes to the Barcelona Games. But this
time it is sending 425 athletes to the Atlanta Games, the fourth
largest team among 197 participating countries and regions, behind
only the United States, Germany and Russia.
</P>
<P>
"Our large team reflects an improvement in the standard of
Australian sports," said Coates, also Chef de Mission of the
Australian team. "It shows we have 425 athletes qualified or
eligible for the Olympic Games."
</P>
<P>
Coates said Australia is strong in swimming, cycling, rowing,
canoeing, hockey, equestrian and yatching. "Every one in our team
is well prepared," he said.
</P>
<P>
Australian sports officials said Kieren Perkins and Daniel
Kowalski are Australia's favorates to win men's 1,500 meter
freestyle. Perkins is the world record holder and reigning Olympic
champion and Kowalski is a rising star who upset Perkins during
the Olympic trials early this year.
</P>
<P>
In cycling, Kathy Watt is Australia's chance for a gold medal.
In Barcelona, she won a road race and captured a bronze in 3,000
meter individual pursuit. Darryn Hill and Gary Neiwand are now the
world's best athletes in men's sprint. Hill was the gold medalist
and Neiwand, the silver medalist in last year's world
championships.
</P>
<P>
Australia's Shane Kelly broke the world record in 1,000 meters
time trial when winning the 1995 World Track Cycling Championships
in Bogota, Colombia. Austrilia's 4,000 meters team pursuit squad
is also a top contender for gold medal.
</P>
<P>
In rowing, Australians are expected to win medals in coxless
four and lightweight double scull. In canoeing, Clint Robinson is
going to defend his Olympic title in K1 1,000 meters event. In
equestrian, Mathew Ryan is the winner of the individual three day
event and a member of the winning quartet of team three day event
at the Barcelona games.
</P>
<P>
Austrialian women's hockey team, with a record of 32
consecutive wins in the past 12 months, might be a sure bet for
the gold medal. It is the gold medalist at the 1994 world Cup.
Australia's another sure bet for gold medal is men's doubles in
tennis. Todd Woodbridge and Mark Woodforde have won Wimbledon for
three consecutives years.
</P>
<P>
Australia also has medal chances in yatching, weightlifting,
track and field, diving and softball, said Australian sports
officials.

<P>
ATLANTA, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Gold medal hope of the U.S.
swimming team Tom Dolan said in a news conference here Wednesday
that for him the results of the Olympic trials were definetely
past.
</P>
<P>
The versatile Dolan, who turns 21 this September, is considered
to set himself up for a repeat of Mark Spitz performance at the
upcoming Centennial Olympic Games after winning the 200m and 400m
individual medley and 400m freestyle at the Indianapolis trials in
March.
</P>
<P>
Spitz won a total of seven gold medals with seven world records
at the 1972 Munich Olympics.
</P>
<P>
Dolan, world record holder in the men's 400m individual medley
produced the year's best time of four minutes 12.72 seconds at the
trials.
</P>
<P>
He set a high aim for himself in the Atlanta Olympic Games. "It
is the third year since I entered the national squad, and I just
can't do the same thing as when I was just a 17- or 18-year-old
kid."
</P>
<P>
Despite chronic asthma and an unusually narrow windpipe, Dolan
didn't think that the sickness would prevent him from an Olympic
gold medal. "Asthma will not stop me swimming. I just like the
sport and I just do what I need to do."
</P>
<P>
However, he reiterated that he was very relaxed now. Win or
lose, "it is just sport, and is not the end of the world. I am
completely relaxed."
</P>
<P>
He came back from Knoxvelle training camp, Tennessee, a week
ago and had lived in the Olympic Villiage for only two nights.
</P>
<P>
Dolan also said other countries had made great progress in
swimming. "I am glad to see that, " he said. "It's really nice to
see swimmers from eight different countries go to the podium
rather than from only two or three."

<HEADLINE> Global Gap Between Rich And Poor Widens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 17 (Xinhua) -- The global gap between the rich and
poor is widening every day with the assets of the world's 358
billionaires exceeding the combined annual incomes of countries
accounting for 45 percent of the world's people, according to an
UN report.
</P>
<P>
"The world has become more economically polarized, both between
countries and within countries," says James Gustave Speth,
Administrator of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP),
in a foreword to the Human Development Report which released here
today.
</P>
<P>
"If present trends continue, economic disparities between
industrial and developing nations will move from inequitable to
inhuman," the report warns.
</P>
<P>
It also shows that despite a dramatic surge in economic growth
in 15 countries over the past three decades, 1.6 billion people
were left behind and are worse off than they were 15 years ago.
Economic gains have benefited greatly a few countries, at the
expense of many.
</P>
<P>
Among the rich countries, only three -- Canada, Finland and
Iceland -- are worse off today than in the 1980s. But in 70
developing countries, today's levels of income are less than those
reached in the 1960s or the 1970s, the report says.
</P>
<P>
And in 19 of the countries, including not only war-torn Haiti,
Liberia, Nicaragua, Rwanda and Sudan, but also such countries as
Ghana and Venezuela, per capita income today is less than the
level of 1960 or before, it adds.
</P>
<P>
The report points out, since 1980, 15 countries, mainly Asian,
have enjoyed spectacular economic growth at rates much higher and
any seen during two centuries of industrialization in the West,
ranging from 3.5 percent a year in Malaysia to 8.2 percent in
China and the Republic of Korea.
</P>
<P>
The report also says unemployment still affects 35 million
people in the industrial world. In those countries, the average
unemployment rate was 8.6 percent in 1993, ranging from 2.5
percent in Japan to 23 percent in Spain.
</P>
<P>
The report says that there is no one formula for all countries
to succeed. many countries now in transition need to combine the
most rapid possible economic growth with human development, if
they are not to slide back still further on both fronts.

<HEADLINE> Car Sales in Western Europe Fall by 9% in June </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Sales of new cars in western Europe
fell by nine percent last month, dealing a blow to hopes of a
resurgence in sales this year, according to the Association of
European Motor Manufacturers (AEMM).
</P>
<P>
Figures released by the AEMM showed sales down in nine of 17
markets monitored by the AEMM, and sales slipped in four of
Europe's five biggest markets.
</P>
<P>
The French market suffered most, with a 32.1 percent fall in
sales, followed by Austria, down 28.4 percent, and Spain, down
21.1 percent. Even the big German market reported a 3.3 percent
fall. Britain alone stood out in Europe's top five markets, with a
4.7 percent rise.
</P>
<P>
The decline clipped the rate of growth in new car sales in the
first half of 1996 to 4.8 percent to 6.638 million units, compared
with 7.5 percent in the first five months.
</P>
<P>
"We believe the fundamentals are not strong enough to create
significant consumer demand. Therefore, the underlying trend
remains weak sales growth," said James Rosenstein, AEMM's director
of communications.
</P>
<P>
The association said that almost the only improvements in last
month's European sales came among South Korean brands, which built
on their strong push with a 12.2 percent surge in sales
year-on-year, taking sales to 125,844 in the first half. This is
almost 53 percent above the same period last year.
