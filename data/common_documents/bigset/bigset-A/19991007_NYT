WANTED FOR RAPE: JOHN DOE, WHO IS KNOWN ONLY BY HIS DNA 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs 8th graf to change `never analyzed' to `never makes its way
into the data bank.')  (bl)

<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ In a novel legal gambit that stretches the law to
match the developing science of DNA, a prosecutor in Wisconsin has
filed rape and kidnapping charges against a defendant who has no
name. John Doe is known only by his DNA code, extracted from semen
samples from three rapes, samples which have been tested after six
years of storage in a police property room.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know that one person raped these three women,'' said the
prosecutor, Norman Gahn, assistant district attorney for Milwaukee
County. ``We just don't know who that person is. We will catch
him.''
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutor's strategy is an attempt to keep the six-year
time limit for bringing a charge from running out in the only one
of the three cases where that has not already happened. A warrant
must identify the person to be arrested, and this one names ``John
Doe, unknown male with matching deoxyribonucleic acid profile.''
The warrant, signed by a judge in September, will keep the statute
of limitations from expiring, which in this case would otherwise
happen in November. Now, every month, an FBI computer will compare
the numbers that describe John Doe's DNA with thousands of genetic
samples from around the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``John Doe'' is typically used in a warrant when the accused is
known by an alias or by a physical description. The Milwaukee case
is unusual in that it described the suspect by only DNA
information.
</P>
<P>
   The case reveals several gaps between the law and science. Can a
person be identified on a warrant by biometric evidence, such as a
DNA code or fingerprint, or is a more traditional behavioral
identification required, such as a name and date of birth? And is
the legal concept of a statute of limitations relevant in an age of
DNA testing of old evidence? Legal experts said the case would be
challenged, but has merit.
</P>
<P>
   The case also reveals the promise and limitations of the
national DNA databank, which is one year old this month.
</P>
<P>
   Much attention has focused on the promise. The FBI says the DNA
databank has helped solve 583 cases, such as the serial rapist in
Washington, D.C., linked with a serial rapist in Florida. Police
routinely collect DNA evidence not only in rape cases but from
saliva on beer cans left behind by a burglar, from sweat on a
baseball bat used in a beating, from blood on a bullet that passed
through a suspect.
</P>
<P>
   Less attention has been paid to the holes in the system. Only 18
of 50 states are hooked into the FBI databank, known as the
Combined DNA Index System (CODIS), while the rest are working on
the technology and the funding. The databank is still far smaller
than the FBI's fingerprint bank. State crime labs are far behind in
their work. Much of the DNA evi- dence that is collected never
makes its way into the databank.
</P>
<P>
   Approximately 180,000 rape kits _ evidence from only one type of
crime _ sit unexamined on shelves in police departments across the
nation, according to a new survey of police agencies commissioned
by the National Commission for the Future of DNA Evidence. These
flat rectangular boxes include blood vials, swabs of semen, a lock
of hair, and fingernail scrapings _ evidence collected from rape
victims in a humiliating ritual.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   New York City alone has 12,000 unexamined rape kits, and is
trying to reduce the backlog by contracting with private
laboratories. It has stopped destroying untested kits after five
years, but other police departments continue the practice.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the technology to solve these crimes, and we're not
doing it'' said Christopher Asplen, executive director of the DNA
commission.
</P>
<P>
   Many police departments still use DNA evidence as they have used
fingerprints and tire tracks, to rule a suspect in or out. But the
new DNA databanks make the evidence useful for matching cases to
convicted offenders, or to other cases in which a suspect may be
known.
</P>
<P>
   About 40 percent of the police agencies in the survey reported
that they test all or nearly all samples for DNA. About one-third
of the agencies test less often. And about one-quarter weren't
sure.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Cities vary widely in their use of DNA testing. In Cleveland,
``We only do DNA testing when there's an identifiable suspect,''
said Lt. Edward Thiery, spokesman for the Cleveland Police
Department.
</P>
<P>
   In Chicago, ``We now submit every sample for testing, but we
still have a backlog of untested samples,'' said Pat Camden,
spokesman for the Chicago Police Department.
</P>
<P>
   In Los Angeles, the police department buys a new, 40-foot
refrigerated trailer truck every six months, just to hold DNA
evidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Los Angeles Police Department, right now, if you didn't
have a suspect in custody and a court date, that thing is not going
to get analyzed, whatever it is,'' Maria Foster, a detective
supervisor, told the DNA commission. ``When you got a court date,
when you go to trial, then it will happen.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The three DNA samples that identified a serial rapist in
Milwaukee were collected in 1993. In each case, on the city's north
side, a man grabbed a woman from behind, told her that he had a
knife, took her to a quiet place, raped her, and demanded money,
police said. After she reported the crime, vaginal and cervical
swabs of semen were collected at a hospital.
</P>
<P>
   The samples waited at the police evidence room, along with 2,300
other unexamined rape kits. To test them all would have swamped the
state crime lab, which already has a backlog.
</P>
<P>
   So Detective Lori Gaglione and her colleagues in the city's
Sensitive Crimes Unit winnowed down to the best cases, based mostly
on human factors, such as the availability of victims and
witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   From the 53 samples that were tested, one case matched a
convicted rapist in Minnesota. Another matched a convicted rapist
elsewhere in Wisconsin, allowing charges to be filed only eight
hours before the statute of limitations expired.
</P>
<P>
   And the three samples were found to match each other.
</P>
<P>
   The law in Wisconsin, as in other states, requires that a
warrant identify the accused. If the name is not known, the law
allows identification ``by any description by which the person to
be arrested can be identified with reasonable certainty.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My argument is going to be that genetic code goes well beyond
reasonable certainty,'' Gahn said. ``We're pushing the envelope as
far as we can. It does something for the victim of the sexual
assaullt, to know that someone cares and to know that we're out
there working on the case.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The forensic science supervisor in the state crime lab, Dirk
Janssen, said that the probability of randomly selecting an
unrelated individual who would have a DNA profile matching the
three samples would be approximately 1 in 7.25 billion _ more than
the world's population _ in the U.S. Caucasian population, and 1 in
1.96 billion in the African-American population.
</P>
<P>
   Such a John Doe warrant has been used at least one other time,
in a Kansas case in 1991. No one was caught, so the issue has not
been tested.
</P>
<P>
   The warrant appears to have merit, said Myrna Raeder, a
professor of law at Southwestern University in Los Angeles and the
former head of the criminal section of the American Bar
Association.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is not frivolous,'' Professor Raeder said. ``It's clearly
novel and therefore courts are really going to have to struggle
with the intention of the statute and whether the clear meaning of
the statute would cover this.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   As in most states, only people convicted of sexual offenses in
Wisconsin are required to give samples for DNA testing. The
Legislature is on the verge of expanding that to all felony
offenses, as Alabama and Virginia have done. In addition, the
Legislature is considering eliminating the statute of limitations
in cases of rape, as Florida has done.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors hope that someday, perhaps even 20 years from now, a
man will leave a cigarette behind at another rape, or cut himself
on broken glass at a burglary. His saliva or blood will be tested,
its DNA catalogued and entered in the FBI databank.
</P>
<P>
   And he will be charged with raping and kidnapping a woman in
Milwaukee on Nov. 9, 1993.

MAYOR SHOWS OFF HIS CITY TO BUSH 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By ELISABETH BUMILLER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mayor Rudolph Giuliani escorted Gov. George W. Bush
of Texas on a tour of what was clearly ``Rudy's New York'' on
Wednesday, taking the Republican presidential candidate to a Queens
welfare-turned-jobs-center, a firefighters' memorial service and an
Italian restaurant for a pizza lunch on a Bedlam-like Arthur Avenue
in the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   Although the mayor's aides called it ``the governor's day,'' the
itinerary, was meant to show off the mayor's strengths as he
prepares to run for the U.S. Senate against his almost-certain
opponent, Hillary Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who was also accompanied on the last day of a three-day
trip to New York by Gov. George Pataki, seemed a happy participant
in the mayor's ambitions. Giuliani formally endorsed Bush last
week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Standing behind me are the pillars of the strength of the
Republican Party here in New York,'' Bush said at the Queens Job
Center in Long Island City while Pataki, and particularly Giuliani,
beamed periodically. After saying that he was honored that Pataki
is supporting him _ the governor endorsed Bush in May _ Bush added:
``I'm honored that the future senator is standing by my side as
well. I leave this state upbeat about my chances. I really do.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Bush and Pataki heaped praise on Giuliani at the jobs
center, where the mayor flanked a chart showing the decline in
welfare since he took office.
</P>
<P>
   After the jobs center, the two governors and one mayor departed
for ground zero of Giuliani's constituency, some 7,000 firefighters
assembled in front of the Fireman's Monument in Riverside Park in
Manhattan. The occasion was the New York City Fire Department's
annual memorial service in honor of firefighters who have died on
the job during the last year.
</P>
<P>
   Although all three politicians spoke at the service _ Bush said
the firefighters ``have paid the cost of courage, and they have
climbed to heaven on the flames'' _ it was Giuliani who spoke the
most directly to the firefighters' families.
</P>
<P>
   He said that the ``extraordinary'' people of the Fire Department
needed heroes like those who had died, and that ``I know that the
firefighters that we're particularly remembering today didn't
become that way by accident.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It didn't happen by luck or by good fortune,'' he said. ``It
happened because you loved them, brought them up, taught them to be
extraordinary men.''
</P>
<P>
   The next stop was billed as a ``walking tour'' of Arthur Avenue
in the Belmont section of the Bronx, but it immediately
deteriorated into a kind of moving scrimmage of television cameras
and politicians.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, hey, ho, ho, Pataki's got to go!'' shouted about two
dozen mental health attendants from Local 401 of the Civil Service
Employees Association, who said they were angry over a contract
dispute with the governor.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, the politicians had pizza at Giovanni's, where
Bridget DeSantis, 85, a Republican from the Woodlawn section of the
Bronx, was waiting outside on the sidewalk to shake Bush's hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``He looks just like his father,'' she marveled, referring to
the Texas governor's resemblance to former President George Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in the kind of association that no doubt would be opera to
the ears of City Hall officials, she declared: ``He's going to get
my vote! George! Giuliani!''

<P>
   People who constantly remind themselves to make a phone call or
invite someone to dinner are more likely to forget what they wanted
to say or buy all the right food than those who take a more relaxed
approach to everyday life.
</P>
<P>
   New research has shown that trying to remember facts or tasks by
saying them over and over again blocks related memories and induces
forgetfulness.
</P>
<P>
   The findings show that students who cram for exams or ask
colleagues to quiz them before the start will forget vital
information for the duration of the test.
</P>
<P>
   Neil Macrae, professor of experimental psychology at Britain's
Bristol University and author of the report, said: ``In anxious
situations, such as exams, people employ a range of methods to help
them remember. However, although the logic of repeating facts over
and over again may seem flawless, this attempt at cramming
information into your brain blocks other information temporarily.''
</P>
<P>
   For memory to function effectively, the mind has to be able to
deal with competing related information.
</P>
<P>
   The research, in the latest issue of the Journal of Personality
and Social Psychology, involved 128 students.
</P>
<P>
   In one experiment they sat through a mock geography exam. They
were presented with 20 facts about two fictitious islands. The
group was divided into two, with one half receiving ``cramming''
cards to remind them about half of the facts.
</P>
<P>
   When the whole group was tested, those who had crammed could
recall more of the latest data given to them, but performed four
times as badly on recalling all 20 facts.
</P>
<P>
   Psychologists believe these findings have important implications
for people trying to forget traumatic memories.
</P>
<P>
   Professor Macrae said: ``The victim of abuse will hold both
negative and positive memories of the perpetrator. It is likely
that the victim will be motivated only to retrieve the good
memories not caring to dwell on material that is disturbing.
Constant retrieval can serve a valuable function of locking
unwanted recollections in memory.'' &QL;

   SAN FRANCISCO _ The inmates of San Francisco's county jail have
seen plenty in their time, but this was a new one even for them.
</P>
<P>
   Recently the sheriff's department thoughtfully organized a
seminar to teach them about their civil rights. Even more
thoughtfully, the lawyer running the class decided to teach them
how to run rings around the police, how to wriggle their way out of
search warrants, and even how to pick the right store to rob
without encountering excessive security.
</P>
<P>
   Sheriff's deputies looked on in stunned amazement as role
players in police uniforms depicted themselves as slow-witted,
racist thugs, and the instructor, civil-rights lawyer Katya
Komisaruk, taught her 120 charges how to see through the trickery
of good cop-bad cop interrogation routines.
</P>
<P>
   After several days of deputies raising hell, the course has now
been hurriedly dropped _ much to the embarrassment of the city
authorities and the amusement of just about everyone else.
</P>
<P>
   ``What better way to reduce the city's jail population than
teaching the criminals how not to get caught?'' David Hardy,
president of the San Francisco Deputy Sheriffs' Association, asked
sarcastically.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't believe that the tax-paying citizen could support the
sheriff teaching people how to be better criminals.''
</P>
<P>
   Komisaruk, a radical with a hell-raising past of her own _ she
served time in federal prison for smashing computers at the
Vandenburg military base in California during an anti-nuclear
protest nine years ago _ insisted that everything she had said was
legally accurate. The actors dressed up as policemen were meant to
be entertaining, not demeaning.
</P>
<P>
   There seemed to be some disagreement, however, whether her tips
constituted civil-rights education or merely instruction on how to
avoid getting caught.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did she address the finer points of search warrants and
the right to request the presence of a lawyer before agreeing to
police questioning, she also came out with lines like: ``It's
stupid to boost from the large chain stores. They have better
security.''
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco has been running civil-rights courses for
prisoners _ unheard of in the rest of the United States _ for more
than 20 years, thanks to the liberal credentials of the city's
sheriff, Mike Hennessey, a former prisoners' rights activist and
diehard Sex Pistols fan.
</P>
<P>
   The sheriff's department said the classes would be resuming, but
with another instructor. &QL;

   LOS ANGELES _ If you are planning to send your children to
school in San Jose, Calif., over the next 10 years, you had better
make sure they like Pepsi.
</P>
<P>
   The school district there has recently signed a deal making the
Pepsi-Cola company the exclusive fizzy drink vendor for its
schools. The deal is worth $3.5 million to the district, and even
more if the kids drink up.
</P>
<P>
   In another example, if a child is 11 or 12, the chances are he
or she will be using a textbook called ``Mathematics: Applications
and Connections'' that teaches fractions by counting the sweets
M&AMP;Ms, and asks how many hours a teenager would have to work at
McDonald's to pay for a new pair of Nike shoes.
</P>
<P>
   The book, published by McGraw Hill, is used in 50 states and is
officially endorsed by 15 of them.
</P>
<P>
   Even more widespread is an in-school television station, Channel
One, which is watched by eight million United States schoolchildren
daily. The station provides 10 minutes of programming, including
two minutes of compulsory advertising, as the price for free
television and video equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Its computer equivalent, a company called ZapMe!, provides free
hardware but obliges schools to use its machines for four hours
each day and expose children to advertisements.
</P>
<P>
   Advertising in U.S. schools is reaching epidemic proportions.
Some 150 schools and school districts have exclusive drinks
contracts in what is rapidly turning into a turf war between Pepsi
and Coca-Cola, neither of them noted for the nutritional or health
values of their products.
</P>
<P>
   One Georgia teenager who wore a Pepsi shirt to his school's Coke
Day last year was suspended for insubordination.
</P>
<P>
   A backlash against this trend is beginning to take shape,
however. The state of California has just passed a law banning
product placement in school textbooks _ dealing a severe blow to
the fortunes of the McGraw Hill math book, since California is the
single largest education market in the country.
</P>
<P>
   New York, which bans exclusive Coca-Cola contracts, is
considering a similar measure.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're ecstatic (about the California textbook ban) because
it's an important precedent. It was a trend that was just
starting,'' said Andrew Hagelshaw of the Center for Commercial-Free
Public Education, a national nonprofit campaign group. ``If not
checked, it would have expanded to other companies and other
books.''
</P>
<P>
   But a second bill introduced in California recently, which would
have banned classroom television and most other forms of
advertising in schools, ran into a wall of resistance after Channel
One hired a powerful lobbying firm.
</P>
<P>
   The bill now sitting on the desk of California Governor Gray
Davis for consideration is heavily watered down, merely mandating
public hearings before schools can buy Channel One's services.
</P>
<P>
   According to Hagelshaw, school districts rarely make their
negotiations with private companies known to parents and teachers.
San Jose had been talking to Pepsi for a year, but local papers
only reported it days before the signing.
</P>
<P>
   His group argues the deals are detrimental to schools even in
financial terms, because taxpayers still pay for the time in which
students are being bombarded by private advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Academic researchers recently calculated that Channel One costs
U.S. taxpayers $1.8 billion a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``All these things are taking advantage of a captive audience.
That's why companies want to get into schools,'' Hagelshaw said.
``But is it ethical for community leaders to buy and sell our
students' attention? Are we going to treat our students as
commodities we can barter in exchange for resources, or treat them
as precious resources themselves?'' &QL;

   LOS ANGELES _ If you are planning to send your children to
school in San Jose, Calif., over the next 10 years, you had better
make sure they like Pepsi.
</P>
<P>
   The school district there has recently signed a deal making the
Pepsi-Cola company the exclusive fizzy drink vendor for its
schools. The deal is worth $3.5 million to the district, and even
more if the kids drink up.
</P>
<P>
   In another example, if a child is 11 or 12, the chances are he
or she will be using a textbook called ``Mathematics: Applications
and Connections'' that teaches fractions by counting the sweets
M&AMP;Ms, and asks how many hours a teenager would have to work at
McDonald's to pay for a new pair of Nike shoes.
</P>
<P>
   The book, published by McGraw Hill, is used in 50 states and is
officially endorsed by 15 of them.
</P>
<P>
   Even more widespread is an in-school television station, Channel
One, which is watched by eight million United States schoolchildren
daily. The station provides 10 minutes of programming, including
two minutes of compulsory advertising, as the price for free
television and video equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Its computer equivalent, a company called ZapMe!, provides free
hardware but obliges schools to use its machines for four hours
each day and expose children to advertisements.
</P>
<P>
   Advertising in U.S. schools is reaching epidemic proportions.
Some 150 schools and school districts have exclusive drinks
contracts in what is rapidly turning into a turf war between Pepsi
and Coca-Cola, neither of them noted for the nutritional or health
values of their products.
</P>
<P>
   One Georgia teenager who wore a Pepsi shirt to his school's Coke
Day last year was suspended for insubordination.
</P>
<P>
   A backlash against this trend is beginning to take shape,
however. The state of California has just passed a law banning
product placement in school textbooks _ dealing a severe blow to
the fortunes of the McGraw Hill math book, since California is the
single largest education market in the country.
</P>
<P>
   New York, which bans exclusive Coca-Cola contracts, is
considering a similar measure.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're ecstatic (about the California textbook ban) because
it's an important precedent. It was a trend that was just
starting,'' said Andrew Hagelshaw of the Center for Commercial-Free
Public Education, a national nonprofit campaign group. ``If not
checked, it would have expanded to other companies and other
books.''
</P>
<P>
   But a second bill introduced in California recently, which would
have banned classroom television and most other forms of
advertising in schools, ran into a wall of resistance after Channel
One hired a powerful lobbying firm.
</P>
<P>
   The bill now sitting on the desk of California Governor Gray
Davis for consideration is heavily watered down, merely mandating
public hearings before schools can buy Channel One's services.
</P>
<P>
   According to Hagelshaw, school districts rarely make their
negotiations with private companies known to parents and teachers.
San Jose had been talking to Pepsi for a year, but local papers
only reported it days before the signing.
</P>
<P>
   His group argues the deals are detrimental to schools even in
financial terms, because taxpayers still pay for the time in which
students are being bombarded by private advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Academic researchers recently calculated that Channel One costs
U.S. taxpayers $1.8 billion a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``All these things are taking advantage of a captive audience.
That's why companies want to get into schools,'' Hagelshaw said.
``But is it ethical for community leaders to buy and sell our
students' attention? Are we going to treat our students as
commodities we can barter in exchange for resources, or treat them
as precious resources themselves?'' &QL;

POVERTY RATE PERSISTS IN CITY DESPITE BOOM
</HEADLINE>
   (sw) 
 By NINA BERNSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Despite the strongest economy in years, nearly one
out of four New York City residents had incomes below the federal
government's poverty threshold last year, a rate that has barely
dipped since the last recession and that is twice as high as the
national average, a new analysis of poverty in the city concludes.
</P>
<P>
   The analysis, based on figures from house-to-house surveys by
the Census Bureau, was released on Wednesday by the Community
Service Society of New York, an advocacy group for the poor that
has been tracking city poverty rates for decades.
</P>
<P>
   But the finding that the city's economic boom is not lifting the
poor along with the well off echoes recent studies by the Federal
Reserve Bank of New York and the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the best economy the country has seen since the late
60s,'' said Mark K. Levitan, who analyzed the census data for the
Community Service Society. ``It's not going to get any better than
this. And we're still in a situation where a quarter of the city's
population is in poverty.''
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, for the third year since 1994, more than a million
Americans moved above the poverty line, defined as below $16,665 a
year for a household of four. But in New York City, where the
recovery has been gathering steam since 1996, 1.8 million are
officially poor, as many or more than in the early 1990s, during
the last recession.
</P>
<P>
   Rae Rosen, regional economist with the Federal Reserve Bank of
New York, said the Community Service Society's findings on poverty
should be understood in light of the city's 6.9 percent
unemployment rate, which remains high compared with 4.5 percent for
the nation, as well as its high rate of immigration, which adds to
a mismatch between the low level of skills and education of the
least successful job seekers and the rising demands of new service
jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would agree that there are a group of people at the very
bottom that have been bypassed by this economy that has been pretty
robust,'' Ms. Rosen said.
</P>
<P>
   But city officials disputed the significance of the figures,
noting the number of jobs created in recent years and their efforts
to move New Yorkers from welfare to work ``The quality of life in
New York City is higher than it's been in years,'' said Edward
Skyler, a spokesman for Mayor Rudolph Giuliani. ``Three hundred and
thirty thousand new jobs have been created in the last five years,
as opposed to the 320,000 jobs that were lost in the early 90s.
People are moving from welfare to self-sufficiency in record
numbers.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``Impartial observers recognize that there has been a
renaissance and revitalization in every borough that is a model for
cities around the world.''
</P>
<P>
   But Solidelle Wasser, a senior economist with the Bureau of
Labor Statistics, said Census Bureau data on poverty rates in the
largest metropolitan areas around the country supported the view
that New York's economy was lagging behind in lifting the incomes
of the poor.

N.Y. COLUMN: A REPUBLICAN EXERCISES SOME FINESSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JOHN TIERNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When the Rev. Floyd Flake introduced Texas Gov.
George W. Bush to this city's conservative establishment Tuesday,
it was probably the first time in the history of the Manhattan
Institute for Policy Research that a luncheon speaker was described
as ``my homeboy.'' And that was not the most incongruous moment of
the day for a Republican from Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Bush visited an elementary school in Harlem, advocated spending
more federal money on education and sounded a little like Hillary
Rodham Clinton during his luncheon speech at the New York Sheraton.
He didn't mention anything about a village, but he did declare
passionately: ``Our nation has a moral duty to insure that no child
_ I mean  &UR; no &LR;  child _ is left behind.''
</P>
<P>
   Could a Republican really be serious about education? Many
voters, especially in New York, would dismiss Bush's compassionate
rhetoric as political pandering. In a way it was, but not
necessarily in the way that voters think.
</P>
<P>
   When asked which party can do a better job of improving schools,
voters overwhelmingly prefer Democrats, according to a poll by the
Pugh Research Center. The Democrats have long been admired for
their determination to allocate more money to public schools.
</P>
<P>
   Adjusted for inflation, spending on the average American public
school pupil has doubled in the last three decades, according to
the National Center for Education Statistics. But the money has not
brought obvious improvement. As a result, many reformers are
considering bigger changes, like the charter schools and voucher
plans that New York's Republicans have been championing.
</P>
<P>
   Local Democrats and union leaders have put up fierce resistance,
but these reforms seem to be gaining favor, especially outside New
York. The current issue of Blueprint, the journal of the centrist
Democratic Leadership Council, wholeheartedly endorses charter
schools and advises Democrats to ``stop opposing school reform
ideas just because some Republicans like them.''
</P>
<P>
   There were plenty of those ideas in Bush's speech: reduce
regulation of schools, make them compete for dollars and students,
finance the construction of charter schools, get money directly to
students and parents. It left the conservatives buzzing about
education as a possible new wedge issue.
</P>
<P>
   Like the Reagan Democrats who had defected over the issues of
crime and welfare, and the Republican soccer moms driven to
President Clinton by their party's stance against abortion, maybe
Democratic parents could flee to a Republican promising better
schools.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the National Education Association could turn into the
Democrats' version of the Christian Coalition: a powerful special
interest that alienates voters. Teachers keep the party opposed to
vouchers, but they don't cast as many votes as parents and
grandparents, whose support for school vouchers has been growing.
Support is especially strong among Hispanic and black voters, whose
defection would be a major blow to Democrats. Flake's enthusiasm
for Bush may not be shared yet by many of his fellow
African-Americans, but his support for vouchers is.
</P>
<P>
   After listening to Bush's pleas, the conservative intellectuals
and business leaders could righteously believe their candidate to
be standing up for children and the working classes. But there was
an underlying problem with the speech.
</P>
<P>
   However much conservatives may want to rescue children, they
usually do not think that any president can do the job. They favor
local control of schools. After arguing for the devolution of power
_ the liberation of New York City's schools from the bureaucrats in
Albany and at Board of Education headquarters in Brooklyn _ it's
inconsistent for them to put great faith in any reform coming out
of Washington.
</P>
<P>
   And however much Bush wants to reform schools as president, he
won't have the money or the power to do it. The federal government
provides only 8 percent of the money spent in public schools. Like
crime, the issue is far more important on the campaign trail than
in the Oval Office.
</P>
<P>
   So perhaps the speech was mainly an exercise in political
finesse: a demonstration that a Republican could learn the
Clintonesque art of co-copting the other side's symbolic issue.
Clinton had demonstrated how to win by sounding tough on crime. Now
Bush was looking for victory by sounding soft on education.

MAN OFFERING RARE PAPERS SERVED TIME FOR THEIR THEFT
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Conn.)  (rk) 
 By BENJAMIN WEISER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Last Friday, Basil A. Panagopulos, an autograph
dealer in Greenwich, Conn., got a phone call from a man who wanted
to sell some rare documents, including papers of Thomas Alva Edison
and presidents Thomas Jefferson and James Monroe.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said: `Can you bring them in? I'd like to see them,'''
Panagopulos said. ``He said, `Sure, I can be there in an hour and a
half.'''
</P>
<P>
   But before his visitor arrived, Panagopulos made some phone
calls, and became suspicious that the materials were valuable maps
and other documents stolen from Columbia University in 1994. A man
named Daniel Spiegelman had been arrested, convicted and sent to
prison.
</P>
<P>
   The dealer's suspicions were correct.
</P>
<P>
   Federal prosecutors in Manhattan said in a complaint on Monday
that the papers were indeed part of the collection stolen from
Columbia, and that the man offering to sell them in Greenwich last
week was none other than Spiegelman, who was completing his
sentence in a halfway house in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Spiegelman was arrested by the Greenwich police on Friday, and a
state Superior Court judge in Stamford on Monday ordered him held
in $250,000 bail, according to a report on Tuesday in The Greenwich
Time. The newspaper said that Spiegelman entered a plea of not
guilty to larceny and other charges.
</P>
<P>
   The federal complaint by the U.S. attorney, Mary Jo White,
charged Spiegelman with one count of interstate transportation of
stolen property.
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer who represented Spiegelman at the Connecticut hearing
could not be reached Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The federal complaint, filed in District Court in Manhattan,
where Spiegelman is expected to be transferred, said the documents
were worth about $100,000, and also included letters by presidents
John Quincy Adams, Andrew Jackson and James Knox Polk.
</P>
<P>
   There was also a manuscript, circa 1504, signed by Henry VII of
England, said Jean W. Ashton, director of the Rare Book and
Manuscript Library at Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the recovery of the papers, Ms. Ashton said, roughly
one-quarter of the stolen documents are still missing. These
include medieval and Renaissance manuscripts, more than 200 maps
that had been removed with a razor from a 17th-century Dutch atlas,
and a document signed by President John Adams.
</P>
<P>
   When Spiegelman was originally sentenced to five years in prison
last year after pleading guilty to stealing the manuscripts, the
case drew widespread attention because the federal judge, Lewis A.
Kaplan, said he was imposing a harsher sentence than he might have
under federal guidelines because of the unique nature of the stolen
property, and the loss to history.
</P>
<P>
   Kaplan told Spiegelman that he had ``deprived a generation of
scholars and students of the irreplaceable raw materials by which
they seek to discern the lessons of the past.''
</P>
<P>
   The case was different, Kaplan said, ``from a simple theft of
money or other easily replaceable property.''

AMALIA RODRIGUES, 79, QUEEN OF LISBON'S SAD SONGS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JON PARELES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Amalia Rodrigues, the Portuguese singer who was considered the
queen of fado, died Wednesday at her home in Lisbon. She was 79.
</P>
<P>
   Her recording company, Valentim de Carvalho, said she was found
dead in her bed by her secretary.
</P>
<P>
   Fado, which means fate in Portuguese, is a passionate, volatile,
haunted style that originated in the cafes and taverns of Lisbon.
Played on the round, bright-toned 12-string Portuguese guitar, with
Arabic elements that make it kin to Spanish flamenco, fado is
filled with the quality called saudade in Portuguese: a mixture of
sadness and nostalgia, longing and resignation. Its lyrics are
bleak and fatalistic, with their suffering described in the first
person. Ms. Rodrigues performed in the black clothes of mourning,
with her head thrown back and her face like a mask of tragedy,
singing in a voice that was at once tearful and fierce.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have so much sadness in me, I am a pessimist, a nihilist,
everything fado demands in a singer, I have in me,'' Ms. Rodrigues
once said. ``When I am on my own, alone, tragedy comes, and
solitude.''
</P>
<P>
   During more than 50 years as a performer, Ms. Rodrigues was
acclaimed as the definitive voice of fado, revered in Portugal and
acclaimed as its musical representative around the world. When her
death was announced, Portugal's radio stations dropped regular
programming and began broadcasting tributes. Prime Minister Antonio
Guterres ordered three days of national mourning. Reuters reported
that Guterres said: ``It is a moment of great sadness. She was the
voice of Portugal.''
</P>
<P>
   Amalia Rodrigues was born in 1920 in the Alfama district of
Lisbon, the cradle of fado. She was one of 10 children in a
working-class family and was reared by her grandmother. She sold
fruit in the streets and worked as a seamstress before she began to
perform as a tango dancer.
</P>
<P>
   As a teen-ager her renditions of tangos built a reputation, and
she began singing professionally in 1939. At first her family did
not approve of her singing tango and fado, songs associated with
the lower classes and the underworld.
</P>
<P>
   She made her first recordings in 1945 in Portugal and in Rio de
Janeiro. In 1952 she signed to the Valentim de Carvalho label and
began to reshape the tradition. She combined the urban and rural
styles of Lisbon and Coimbra; she chose lyrics that reached beyond
stories of heartbreak to muse on God and destiny.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Rodrigues began to tour beyond Portugal after World War II.
She performed regularly in Brazil, Spain, France and Britain and
eventually gave concerts in the United States, Japan, Mexico and
the Soviet Union. She recorded more than 170 albums that were
released in 30 countries, and appeared in a dozen films, notably
``Les Amants du Tage'' (``Lovers of the Tagus''), by the French
director Henri Verneuil.
</P>
<P>
   Fado fell from its commercial peak during the 1960s, and after
1974, when a revolution removed the dictator Marcello Caetano, fado
was associated by many Portuguese with the authoritarian regime.
``I always sang fado without thinking of politics,'' Ms. Rodrigues
said. ``I never had the support of any government.''
</P>
<P>
   By then, Ms. Rodrigues was known around the world. At her
concerts, including her last New York City performance at Town Hall
in 1990, rapt listeners sang along to her songs of love and death.
In the 1990s she had heart surgery and retired from singing because
of poor health. She made her last public appearance in 1998 in
Lisbon, singing at the opening of Expo 1998.

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CARLTON THOMPSON  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
ATLANTA _ Bring on Tom Glavine.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mix in a little John Smoltz and maybe even another dose of Greg
Maddux _ anyone except Kevin Millwood, who left a taste in the
Astros' mouths more bitter than any medicine Atlanta's more
celebrated pitchers could have prescribed.
</P>
<P>
   At least the Astros hope so.
</P>
<P>
   Millwood, often the forgotten man of the Braves' rotation,
turned in one of the most unforgettable pitching performances in
playoff history Wednesday, tossing a one-hitter in a 5-1 victory
over the Astros in Game 2 of their National League Division Series.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves pulled even in the best-of-five series, which shifts
to the Astrodome for games Friday and Saturday. If a fifth game is
necessary, it will be played Sunday in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is why I said we can't afford to get too carried away
after we won the first game,'' Astros first baseman Jeff Bagwell
said. ``You have to remember that these are the Atlanta Braves.
There's a reason they won 103 games this season. They have a great
club, and they can throw a top-notch pitcher at you every game.''
</P>
<P>
   You could take shots at the Astros' offense, something that
became a pastime during the last two postseasons, but that would be
misguided fire. You could question some of the pitching decisions
manager Larry Dierker made late in the game, but that would be
running away from the obvious.
</P>
<P>
   Fact is, the Astros weren't going to win this game _ not the way
Millwood was pitching.
</P>
<P>
   Barring a no-hitter by one of the Braves' other pitchers, the
Astros can take solace in the fact they probably encountered the
best pitching performance they'll see in this series. Millwood
allowed the fewest hits in a postseason complete game since
Boston's Jim Lonborg pitched a one-hitter against St. Louis in the
1967 World Series.
</P>
<P>
   Millwood, 24, couldn't have spotted his fastball more accurately
with a remote control. That and his Darryl Kile-caliber curve kept
the Astros off balance.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who was surprised by the masterful display of pitching
hasn't been paying attention to Millwood, who compiled a
major-league-best .202 opponents' batting average this season.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros, having been the victims of a seven-inning, two-hit
effort by Millwood in June, knew exactly how difficult Wednesday's
task would be.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people (outside baseball) might not know about this
guy, but I guarantee you every single player in the game knows what
Kevin Millwood is capable of doing,'' Bagwell said. ``The guy is
just nasty.''
</P>
<P>
   The only mistake Millwood made Wednesday wasn't much of a
mistake at all. Ken Caminiti did a good job of redirecting a
fastball over the inside portion of the plate for a solo homer in
the second inning.
</P>
<P>
   Millwood quickly regrouped, retiring the next 15 batters before
Bagwell reached on an error in the seventh. He followed that by
setting down the last eight Astros.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't throw a one-hitter every day,'' said Millwood, who
retired 27 of the 29 batters he faced. ``It was a lot of fun.
Everything was working. My fastball was good. My curveball was
good. My slider was good.''
</P>
<P>
   And the Braves' offense was good, too. They knocked 21-game
winner Jose Lima out of the game in a three-run seventh inning that
zapped the life out of the Astros.
</P>
<P>
   Lima, who was making his first postseason appearance, allowed
four runs on nine hits in 6 innings.
</P>
<P>
   He was better than his pitching line might suggest, allowing
several broken-bat or seeing-eye singles. But the Braves lumped
together enough hits to hang a loss on the Astros righthander.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm disappointed that we lost the game, but I can't be too
disappointed about the way I pitched,'' Lima said. ``My goal is
always to keep the team in the game and give us a chance to win,
and I think I did that.
</P>
<P>
   ``But Millwood was just unbelievable today. You have to tip your
hat to him.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if you're Astros center fielder Carl Everett, who credits
pitchers about as often as it freezes in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't knock him,'' Everett said. ``If he's not throwing
his breaking balls for strikes, he's just a typical pitcher, but he
was getting his breaking stuff over and that made him tough. He
pitched a good game, and his team gave him support. We didn't
support our pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   ``Personally, I didn't come here for a split; I came here to
take both games. But you have to be satisfied to win one. The
Braves didn't get down after they lost the first game, and we can't
get down because we lost this one.''
</P>
<P>
   Braves right fielder Brian Jordan put the Astros at an early
disadvantage with an RBI single in the first.
</P>
<P>
   Caminiti's second home run of the series tied the score in the
second, and Lima then matched zeros with Millwood until Eddie
Perez's sacrifice fly gave the Braves a 2-1 lead in the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had to win this game no matter what,'' Astros shortstop
Ricky Gutierrez said. ``Going back to the Dome down 0-2 would have
been tough for them. They came out and did what they had to do.
Now, we have to try to get the next one.''
</P>
<P>
   Dierker replaced Lima with Scott Elarton after Jordan's
seventh-inning sacrifice fly, and Elarton gave up RBI singles to
Ryan Klesko and Andruw Jones.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to use Elarton was somewhat curious considering the
righthander had not pitched in relief since June 29 and shoulder
tendinitis has hampered his ability to get loose quickly.
</P>
<P>
   But Elarton offered no excuses.
</P>
<P>
   ``They called (to the bullpen) in the seventh and told me to get
ready for Jordan,'' Elarton said. ``The bottom line is that I
didn't do my job.''
</P>
<P>
   It probably wouldn't have made much difference considering the
manner in which Millwood did his.

NEW TESTS SHOW HIGHER LEVEL OF GAS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY BETH BARRETT  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Potentially deadly hydrogen sulfide has been
found at several new locations and in much higher concentrations
than previously known in the ground beneath the Belmont Learning
Center, the Daily News has learned.
</P>
<P>
   The new tests, the latest in a series to determine the extent of
the gases generated by a shallow oil field under the school, found
hydrogen sulfide in three times as many monitoring wells as was
found previously.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the levels of gas detected exceeded those found during two
previous tests by as much as 10 times, according to California
Department of Toxic Substances Control officials.
</P>
<P>
   The results mean more tests are required to determine whether
the higher concentrations show the gases are shifting beneath the
school, which could make remediation far more costly and difficult
for the Los Angeles Unified School District, state officials and
toxic experts said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Hydrogen sulfide, which smells like rotten eggs, is extremely
dangerous if it migrates through cracks in the soil and reaches the
air.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the amount that's in the soil got to the surface, people
would be extremely sick, if not dead,'' said Dr. Debbie Oudiz, a
state toxics scientist.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question is, how much goes through the soil and how do we
ensure it doesn't get through the soil. We're doing additional
tests on that now.''
</P>
<P>
   DTSC-monitored air testing equipment at Belmont has not detected
dangerous levels of the hydrogen sulfide in the air, Oudiz said.
</P>
<P>
   Hamid Saebfar, DTSC's chief of Southern California's cleanup
operations branch, said the new test results require further study
to determine their full implications. He noted that some of the
tests could be ``aberrations'' as the result of the monitoring
wells not yet having reached equilibrium.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is certainly true the gases are there, it is not a fluke,''
he said. ``But we are still evaluating it before we make a
definitive statement.''
</P>
<P>
   The tests detected hydrogen sulfide in 22 vapor wells _ 15 more
than in previous tests _ with concentrations ranging from traces to
33,000 parts per million at 33 feet below left center field of the
proposed baseball field, Saebfar said. Those concentrations are
about 10 times higher than previously detected in a nearby well.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's pretty high,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Toxic officials said acute health problems can occur at levels
as low as 0.03 parts per million.
</P>
<P>
   In a June article, the Daily News revealed that high levels of
hydrogen sulfide had been detected around houses adjacent to
Belmont, with residents saying the problem had grown worse as
construction crews removed a mountain of earth to begin work on the
terraced school.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, members of the district's safety team and state
officials have conceded that the removal of some 500,000 cubic
yards of earth could have changed the migration pattern of the
potentially deadly gases.
</P>
<P>
   The board is awaiting a recommendation due Oct. 20 from the
independent Belmont Commission as to whether the $200 million
school can be safely completed at a reasonable cost.
</P>
<P>
   Superintendent Ruben Zacarias is scheduled to make his
recommendation on the school's fate to the commission today,
including his environmental assessment.
</P>
<P>
   State toxics officials are scheduled to make their presentation
to the commission Saturday. DTSC senior geologist Craig Christmann
said commissioners will get a ``big picture'' explanation of the
toxic trends based on a series of data, including the new tests.
</P>
<P>
   Board of Education President Genethia Hayes said the
commission's recommendation should take into account all toxics
information, including the concerns of state toxics officials, even
if conclusions are not fully formed.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is more fluctuation at the site, if there is
apparently more volatility to the situation, does that change
things, does that weigh differently on the decision to be made?
Sure, it does, if it tells us it is not safe,'' Hayes said, saying
she was speaking only as a board member.
</P>
<P>
   ``If DTSC says, `We don't have a definitive answer but, boy, are
we concerned,' this is a new level of concern, then I'd have a new
level of concern.''
</P>
<P>
   Commission David Beckman said that on their face, the new test
results were ``stunning.''
</P>
<P>
   ``At a minimum, they suggest the site will be more difficult to
mitigate and will become even more expensive.''
</P>
<P>
   Barry Groveman, chief Belmont investigative attorney who
initially raised questions about the oil field, said the tests
remove any confidence the district can have in the stability of the
35-acre site.
</P>
<P>
   (CONTINUED ON NEXT TAKE)
</P>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES: of the 35-acre site.
</P>
<P>
   ``We pointed out that this is a very dynamic field,'' Groveman
said. ``The oil deposit and natural gas are there in endless
supplies, and they are very close to the surface. The geology is
fractured and very unpredictable.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is entirely unacceptable in its present condition for a
school.''
</P>
<P>
   William Panos, the district's new director of the Environmental
Health and Safety Branch, said he hadn't seen the new results and
that it would be premature to discuss them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I need to see the protocols and all the appendices,'' Panos
said. ``Until I can see a complete report, it's difficult to
respond.''
</P>
<P>
   Groveman said the continuing test results only underscore the
``staggering incompetency'' of district officials to have properly
characterized the site before construction began.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the district's inspector general, Don Mullinax,
found massive wrongdoing and incompetence reaching to the highest
level of the district in connection with the scandal-ridden school,
recommending disciplinary action, up to termination, for a number
of district officials. Criminal referrals of the former school
board, the developer and five environmental firms also have been
made to various law enforcement agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Groveman said the growing understanding of the site's
instability has tremendous implications for the amount of testing
that remains to be done, which will translate into delays and
greater expenses.
</P>
<P>
   Those tests _ which include a seismic characterization expected
to take at least three months, in addition to more soil studies _
must be done with the view that children are involved, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Acceptable exposure rates for toxics like hydrogen sulfide are
established for adults, which are not adequate ``for the unique
physiology of children,'' Groveman said.
</P>
<P>
   Further, because the entire site appears be fractured, providing
potential paths for hydrogen sulfide to reach the surface, the
entire property might need to be sealed, said Angelo Bellomo,
chairman of the district's safety team.
</P>
<P>
   ``If hydrogen sulfide shows up on a number of sites, then the
prudent course is to provide remediation as though it could show up
anywhere on the site,'' Bellomo said.
</P>
<P>
   The highest concentrations of hydrogen sulfide found in the
ground have been in the open spaces intended for the athletic
facilities, with smaller concentrations in the ground near the
school complex, toxic officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The cost of remediating the entire 35-acre site could be
tremendous, Groveman said. Current estimates for an active
remediation system to carry off hydrogen sulfide and potentially
explosive methane gas range from $4 million to $10 million.
</P>
<P>
   Groveman said the current remediation estimates likely would
climb. That would cut into the $74 million the district's financial
analyst Roger Rasmussen has estimated the district would save by
completing Belmont, rather than building a new school on clean
soil. Those numbers, however, have been challenged.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of what is being found, the testing will have to be
very conservative, and that will lead to extensive delays,''
Groveman said. ``If you see different levels of chemicals, then you
have to take more and more samples, which takes time to acquire, to
evaluate and to report on.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're in the middle of construction, every day is
costly.''

   &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
ATLANTA _ Jose Lima had finished his warm-up and was ready to go to
work, which for him means spending the afternoon alternately
tossing pitches and jumping around on the mound like a hyena with a
hot foot.
</P>
<P>
   Then third-base umpire Bruce Froemming approached him for a
little conference.
</P>
<P>
   If it's Lima Time, it must be pine tar time.
</P>
<P>
   Froemming pointed to a brown splotch about six inches long, high
up the right side of Lima's uniform ants, near the thigh.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him, `Go ahead. Feel my leg if you want,''' said Lima.
```Be happy.'''
</P>
<P>
   Not that there's anything wrong with that.
</P>
<P>
   Another day, another manager _ this time Bobby Cox _ plays mind
games with Lima. And why not when the guy has more potentially
explosive buttons to push than the Joint Chiefs of Staff?
</P>
<P>
   ``They have been checking the side of my pants every year, all
year round, (to see) if I got pine tar,'' Lima said. ``I keep
saying if I cheat, if I put pine tar on my pants, nobody is going
to beat me. I will be nasty, nastier than I am. You know what I
mean? They just wake me up.''
</P>
<P>
   If that's the case, maybe it's time somebody in the Astros'
dugout decided to check Craig Biggio and Jeff Bagwell for pine tar
_ or a pulse _ after another combination playoff collar of 0-for-7.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Lima is down but not out after giving up nine hits
and four runs in 6 innings in a game that was a one-run duel with
Kevin Millwood's glittering gem into the seventh inning.
</P>
<P>
   This wasn't the Lima who has been known to rattle more than the
epicenter of an earthquake at a sign of trouble. This wasn't an
immature meltdown before a national television audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought Jose pitched an excellent game,'' said Astros
manager Larry Dierker. ``He never got the ball up except for the
few times that he wanted to, and he always seemed to stay within
himself. Even after they tried to get to him with having the umpire
check him.''
</P>
<P>
   Lima allowed the Braves to break a 1-1 tie in the sixth on a
broken-bat single by Ryan Klesko, a double by Andruw Jones on a
ball that was one step to Ken Caminiti's left and arguably should
have been swallowed up, and a sacrifice fly by Eddie Perez.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta began to break it open in the seventh when Bret Boone
smashed a one-out double off the wall in deep left-center. But what
really allowed a big inning by the Braves was Daryle Ward's cutting
in front of Carl Everett on the carom, misplaying the ball and
allowing Boone to go all the way to third. That was the error that
eventually allowed the dominoes to fall on Lima.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's OK,'' Lima said. ``There are things that are going to
happen in every game, and they can't always go your way. They had
Millwood out there pitching a good game, and he was going to be
tough to beat anyway. But I'm not down. I'm not angry. I'm just
ready to get right back into it and get real dirty in the rest of
the series to finish this thing.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, according to Lima, it is his desire to ``get dirty''
like his buddies Biggio, Bagwell and Caminiti that has led to the
season-long controversy about the brown spot on his uniform.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's dirt,'' he said, swinging his hip around. ``That's all it
is. I see Biggio and all those other guys covered in dirt all the
time all over their uniforms, you know. So I want to be like them.
I want to be dirty, too. So I take some dirt out in the bullpen,
and I wipe it in real good on my uniform, and there it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is either livin' la vida loca or living life a few
sandwiches short of a picnic. Either way, it's Jose.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want to say I cheat,'' he said. ``Why do I cheat now in
the playoffs when everybody is around to see it? They throw me out
of the game, and what good am I then? I want to be around here when
we go to the World Series, and I'm telling you, it's going to
happen this year. You watch.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Braves' pitching staff is a collection of cool, precise
personalities you'd expect to see working on the bomb squad, Lima
is the guy who'd dance through a crowded room juggling two jars of
nitroglycerine.
</P>
<P>
   And so, while there is the pragmatist in him who would prefer to
see the Astros return home and win two straight to finish off the
Braves, there is the ham in Lima who yearns for another spotlight
dance back here on Sunday in Game 5.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I have to pitch on Saturday in Game 4 to back up (Shane)
Reynolds, then I'm ready,'' he said. ``I will warm up. I will be
ready for anything to make this happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I really want the ball on Sunday. Give it to me in
Atlanta, in Japan, in Africa. I don't care. I am ready now. I am up
for this.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the playoffs. This is Lima Time, you know. Well, it
wasn't Lima Time today, because we lost. But you know what I
mean.''
</P>
<P>
   We think so. Which is frightening in itself.

 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
PHOENIX - In addition to the New York Mets, their coaches, agents,
bodyguards and parole officers, several writers from the New York
papers and their therapists are visiting Phoenix.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Among them is one from the New York Post, who produced a story
for Wednesday's paper under the head line, ``Phoenix has never
risen from the ashes.''
</P>
<P>
   The reporter's name is Gersh Kuntzman.
</P>
<P>
   I swear.
</P>
<P>
   From his downtown hotel room, Gersh declared Phoenix ``a city
that needs to be slapped in the face.''
</P>
<P>
   He described residents here as ``dull'' and ``not . . . the
brightest bunch of baseball fans.''
</P>
<P>
   He informed Post readers that Phoenix is a ``dusty, desert waste
land,'' a ``nightmare city'' that looks ``like a neutron bomb
hit.''
</P>
<P>
   Dusty desert wasteland? Night mare city? Dull?
</P>
<P>
   If I could say one thing about re porter Gersh Kuntzman to all
the New Yorkers who may have read his article, it would be this:
</P>
<P>
   He overestimates us. &QL; 
HORRIBLE PLACE
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix is WAY worse than that.
</P>
<P>
   New Yorkers, please, don't let the pictures from the Snoopy
blimp fool you, particularly those showing what looks like a
beautiful new ball park at night, with city lights spread over the
desert like diamonds on black velvet.
</P>
<P>
   They take those pictures after the sun goes down for a reason,
you know.
</P>
<P>
   It's the media's way of keeping you from seeing the SNAKES that
are everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   And the SCORPIONS.
</P>
<P>
   And the ground that's completely covered with sharp, poisonous
CACTI _ except for the playing field at Bank One Ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   Don't be duped by that place, ei ther. Shea Stadium is much
nicer, or will be once they clear out the in festation of roaches,
which is to say, once the Diamondbacks win the se ries and Mets
fans are forced to go home.
</P>
<P>
   Listen to Gersh.
</P>
<P>
   Too many New Yorkers have failed to heed dire warnings about
Arizona and moved here.
</P>
<P>
   SO, PLEASE, STAY HOME
</P>
<P>
   The rest of you, please, don't do it. Particularly if you happen
to be Donald Trump or Al Sharpton.
</P>
<P>
   Or Howard Stern.
</P>
<P>
   Or Hillary Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   You won't like it here.
</P>
<P>
   Stick with Marv Albert. Our sportscasters aren't nearly as
biting.
</P>
<P>
   You wouldn't feel safe on our streets, anyway. Police here don't
understand the tactical need to fire 41 shots at an unarmed
immigrant, as yours do, and have no training in the creative use of
a broken broom stick during interrogations.
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, culturally, we simply cannot compare to New
York.
</P>
<P>
   That's evident to anyone who's ever set foot on a New York City
street.
</P>
<P>
   I'll never forget the first time I opened the door of a taxi in
mid-town Manhattan, looked around at the majestic skyscrapers
rising like canyon walls, and stepped out of the cab into a big
mound of what folks in Arizona might call ``gersh.''
</P>
<P>
   Out here, among people the Post says are ``overwhelmed by the
very idea of deli sandwich,'' we'd simply just scrape off the nasty
stuff and move on.
</P>
<P>
   What a waste! As they say. &QL; 
WASTELAND FOR ART
</P>
<P>
   Near as I can tell, and I've done some checking, there's not a
single museum in the Phoenix metropolitan area featuring a painting
of the Blessed Virgin Mary with a wad of dung stuck onto it.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, you can get that kind of artistic enlightenment only
in a place like New York.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, I read recently that the Brooklyn Museum of Art is
drawing very large crowds of New Yorkers, each one anxious to stare
at the doo-doo on the wall.
</P>
<P>
   Which explains why the city has so many Mets fans.
</P>
<P>
   Also, New York, if you're going to send one of your thugs down
here to try to slap us in the face, you gotta come up with somebody
tougher-sounding than Gersh.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, fagetaboudit. &QL;

LAUGHLIN POWER PLANT TO CLEAN UP ITS ACT 
</HEADLINE>
 PLANT-AZR   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE YOZWIAK  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (UNDATED) - Environmentalists and utility officials Wednesday
announced a $300 million air pollution cleanup of the coal-fired
Mohave Generating Station in Laughlin, Nev.
</P>
<P>
   The move could, by 2006, help clean up vistas at the western end
of Grand Canyon National Park.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement came the day after the Salt River Project
announced the completion of a five-year, $420 million cleanup of
the Navajo Generating Station on the Canyon's eastern end.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of Southern California Edison, the plant's principal
owner, said the deal announced Wednesday will best position Mohave
to continue using coal and continue operating the plant well into
the next century.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about protecting both the environment and the economy,''
said Bob Wyman, an attorney for the plant's owners.
</P>
<P>
   Nader Mansour, an environmental regulation manager for Edison,
said the pollution controls will allow the Mohave plant to operate
at greater efficiency.
</P>
<P>
   Current environmental restrictions, intended to reduce visible
smoke from the plant, restrict output to about 60 percent of
capacity. With the new pollution controls, Mansour said, the plant
could average more than 80 percent of capacity.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement, if approved by a federal judge in Las Vegas,
would settle a lawsuit brought last year by three environmental
groups: the Sierra Club, the National Parks and Conservation
Association and the Grand Canyon Trust.
</P>
<P>
   The groups contended, and Edison denied, that the Mohave plant
exceeds federal emission standards for sulfur dioxide and for
opacity _ the measure of how clear the air is, with 100 percent
opacity being total blockage. Environmentalists contended that the
federal opacity limit was 20 percent; Edison and Nevada regulators
said it was 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Mansour said the new pollution controls would enable Edison to
drop the opacity of the Mohave plant to less than 5 percent,
significantly improving the looks of the Mohave Valley.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about time,'' said Dave Simon of the National Parks and
Conservation Association. ``This plant is an older, dirty dinosaur
plant that has been belching pollution for nearly 30 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Rob Smith of the Sierra Club said that Mohave is the largest
plant in the Southwest without significant pollution controls,
adding that the installation of scrubbers would have the equivalent
effect of removing 6 million cars from the road.
</P>
<P>
   Simon said attention should now turn to reducing pollution from
Phoenix, Las Vegas and Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there remains a lingering question with Wednesday's pact.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike during the cleanup at the Navajo power plant, today's
ongoing efforts to deregulate the electric power industry mean
there are no guarantees that the agreement will actually be
executed.
</P>
<P>
   Edison, or a subsequent owner, could close the plant or switch
to a different fuel source, such as natural gas, rather than clean
up its coal-burning operations. That would mean a loss of coal
mining royalties for the Hopi and Navajo tribes.
</P>
<P>
   A new contract for coal is due to be negotiated in 2005 with
Peabody Western Coal Co., the mining operations of which annually
contribute $17.1 million to the Navajo Nation (12 percent of the
tribal budget), and $3.7 million for the Hopis (26 percent of the
budget).
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no guarantees on how long this plant will operate,''
Edison's John Fielder said. &QL;

DOLE COMING TO STATE TO BOOST SAGGING GOP CHANCES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By KRIS MAYES  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (PHOENIX) - Aides to GOP presidential hopeful Elizabeth Dole
harpooned Sen. John McCain on Oct. 6th as she maneuvered for
Arizona votes to shore up her sagging campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Dole isn't due in the state until Friday, but her aides are
already flaunting an endorsement by Phoenix Mayor Skip Rimsza and
citing recent Arizona polls showing McCain running behind Texas
Gov. George W. Bush, all in an effort to undercut claims that
McCain's fortunes are rising as hers are plunging.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have have been amazed as to how the national media have
bought this whole McCain phenomenon and ignored the fact that he is
probably going to lose his home state,'' Dole advisor Tony Fabrizio
said. `Someone suggested that to know John is to dislike John.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain spokesman Dan Schnur quickly shot back at the Dole
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tell (the Dole campaign) if the mayor (Rimsza) is not
available, we would be happy to send out a tour guide so they don't
get lost at the airport,'' Schnur said.
</P>
<P>
   The jousting between Dole and McCain comes as McCain is
struggling to deal with home-state challenges not only from Bush,
the GOP race's front-runner, but from publisher Steve Forbes.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who last week secured the endorsement of Gov. Jane Hull,
has made it clear that he will compete aggressively with McCain in
his own back yard. Forbes, who spent nearly $4 million to win
Arizona in 1996, is expected once again to pour millions into the
state.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Dole, too, will vie with McCain for his political
legacy, attending a $200-a-person fund-raiser at the Wrigley
Mansion in Phoenix, where she will officially unveil her leadership
team, headed by Rimsza.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Dole will be feted at the Phoenician by Committee 200, a
national organization of women successful in business and the
professions.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for McCain said the senator remains unfazed by the
recent forays of other candidates into his home turf, pointing out
that he is gaining ground elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the last two weeks, John McCain has moved into second place
in New Hampshire, South Carolina and New York state, and we've
raised more money than any candidate besides the front-runner,''
Schnur said.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's aide also downplayed the Rimsza endorsement, saying
that McCain's list of endorsements is longer and more likely to
generate votes.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has won three consecutive statewide elections in Arizona,
and his grass-roots organization is already at work on next year's
primary,'' Schnur said. ``But we congratulate Mrs. Dole on her
endorsement.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Dole campaign is clearly encouraged by a recent poll
showing that McCain is vulnerable to a challenge. That poll,
released last week, shows Bush leading McCain 31 percent to 22
percent. Forbes placed third with 10 percent and Dole was fourth,
at 6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's not going to cede any territory to McCain,'' Dole
spokeswoman Chris Hawes said. ``Arizona is by no means locked up.''
</P>
<P>
   But according to one GOP leader, the Dole campaign has sparked
little excitement among local activists.
</P>
<P>
   ``It does not appear that she has the same campaign enthusiasm
as McCain does,'' Arizona Republican Party Chairman Mike Minnaugh
said. ``The spirit doesn't seem to be there.''
</P>
<P>
   Minnaugh pointed out that Dole's last event in Arizona, also a
fund-raiser, drew a modest crowd and was noteworthy only because it
was primarily attended by women.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is nothing wrong with that, but you need to attract more
than just women to win,'' Minnaugh said. ``We're talking about the
presidency of the United States. As much as we would all like a
woman or a minority in there, you have got to show that you have
what it takes.''
</P>
<P>
   Dole loyalists pointed to Arizona's recent election of women to
the state's top five statewide offices as a reason to hope that
money doesn't mean everything here.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the state that elected the `Fab Five,' and I just
think that's a huge sign that Arizona could be won by a woman,''
Rimsza said. &QL;

NINE BROTHERS GET BABY SISTER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DENNIS MCCARTHY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- First came Max, next Fred, then Brandon _ all
about a year apart.
</P>
<P>
   Three years later, baby Kyle came along, and Ivan was born 17
months later.
</P>
<P>
   Five boys. No girls.
</P>
<P>
   That's when Kelli Skinner, their mother, decided to take three
years off to regroup.
</P>
<P>
   Then Russell came along in '87, Joey in '91, Stanley in '92 and
Charley in '97.
</P>
<P>
   Nine boys. Still no girls.
</P>
<P>
   Until this week.
</P>
<P>
   Say hello to Daisy Skinner. Finally.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is it,'' Kelli Skinner, 42, said, sounding exhausted as
she rested in her hospital bed Wednesday at West Hills Hospital and
Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm maxed out.''
</P>
<P>
   Her husband, Bryan, who owns a pool plastering business in the
Northridge community of Los Angeles' San Fernando Valley, says he
isn't so sure.
</P>
<P>
   Kelli laughs, then jokingly tells him to have the next one by
himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``We used to joke about it when we were dating,'' said Kelli,
graduated from Agoura High School in 1975. Bryan was graduated from
El Camino High in 1973, and they were married in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bryan always said he wanted 12 kids. It turns out it wasn't a
joke.''
</P>
<P>
   They come from big families, this Mormon couple. Kelli's mom,
Rene Hofer, was one of 17 children, Bryan one of nine, and Kelli
one of eight.
</P>
<P>
   Big numbers don't scare them.
</P>
<P>
   After parenting nine boys, now ranging in age from 22 months to
22 years, they finally have a girl.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't so much that they were trying for a girl this time,
Kelli said, as a playmate for 22-month-old Charley.
</P>
<P>
   ``We lost our son Fred at 17 in a car accident three years ago
and were devastated,'' Kelli said. ``We decided to have one more,
and we had Charley. Then we decided we wanted one more for Charley
to play with, and now we have Daisy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't a case of going for a girl, but I knew Bryan really
wanted a daughter _ a daddy's girl to go with all the mommy's boys
around the house,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, Bryan admitted, although he had just about given up hope
of ever having a little girl. But they kept trying.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd talk to the boys and say, Mom and I are thinking about
having another, and they'd look at me like I was nuts,'' Bryan
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But you know what? The boys are all so excited about this. At
least they were until I explained to them that life, as they know
it, will cease to exist from now on.''
</P>
<P>
   Has to. There's going to be a girl around the house.
</P>
<P>
   Now, if you're thinking that having so many kids is, well, a
handful, the Skinners want to set you straight.
</P>
<P>
   Once you pass three, they said, you hardly feel the tired
numbness anymore.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we had our third in three years, I thought we'd pull our
hair out, but from that time on, it didn't get any harder,'' Bryan
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The boys got older and started helping out. It just became
second nature.''
</P>
<P>
   But all that changed at 2:12 a.m. Tuesday when a 7-pound,
12-ounce baby girl named Daisy entered the world. It's no longer a
boys' world over at the Skinners' home in Agoura Hills, about 35
miles northwest of Los Angeles.

A PAINFUL START FOR RED SOX 
</HEADLINE>
 SOX-INDIANS-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND _ The balance of power between the Red Sox and
Cleveland Indians was supposed to hinge on Pedro Martinez's slender
right shoulder, but no one anticipated that his back would give out
four innings into this American League Division Series.
</P>
<P>
   In the absence of the Sox ace, who was unable to continue
because of a muscle he strained on a 96-mile-per-hour fastball to
Jim Thome, the Indians seized the advantage against Derek Lowe, who
gave up just one hit in four innings but couldn't dodge the loss in
a 3-2 decision that left not only Martinez hurting in the
aftermath.
</P>
<P>
   ``Amazing,'' pitching coach Joe Kerrigan said after Travis
Fryman's single off Rich Garces, the Red Sox' third pitcher of the
ninth, scored Manny Ramirez, who took a pitch in the back from Lowe
to open the Indians' last at-bat. ``He gives up one hit and ends up
losing the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Baseball's not fair sometimes. But against a team that scores
1,000 runs, you can't give them four outs in an inning. They're
tough to beat, boy.''
</P>
<P>
   Lowe had retired 31 Indians batters in a row, including the
regular season, until John Valentin threw away Ramirez's two-out
grounder in the sixth. ``It wasn't a hard-hit ground ball to me,''
Valentin said. ``I was looking for the big hop, and I got it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I threw it hard enough to get it over there, but I
underthrew it.''
</P>
<P>
   Thome followed by blasting a 434-foot home run over the
right-center field fence to tie the score.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unbelievable,'' Lowe said. ``What can I say? They got one hit,
but it was a very big hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a very potent lineup. You can't let your guard down for
one pitch. I did, and it cost us the game. I was trying to throw a
first-pitch curveball for a strike. It wasn't my best pitch or my
worst, but he did what he was supposed to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Thome's home run was the only ball Lowe allowed out of the
infield. It was his misfortune that it left the outfield, too.
</P>
<P>
   But it didn't cost the Sox the game, only tied it on a night
when the only offense Boston generated was when the Indians gave
Nomar Garciaparra a chance to swing the bat.
</P>
<P>
   Garciaparra, playing for the first time in eight days because of
a bruised tendon in his right wrist, homered in his first at-bat
off Bartolo Colon to open the second inning. He doubled and scored
on Mike Stanley's single in the fourth, one of Stanley's three hits
on the night.
</P>
<P>
   The sellout crowd of 45,182 at Jacobs Field roared its approval
when Colon walked Garciaparra in the sixth, after which he was
doubled off first on Troy O'Leary's liner that was grabbed at the
fence by left fielder David Justice. Garciaparra, with the play in
front of him, was around second base when Justice made the catch
and was doubled up easily.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a good time for me to be aggressive,'' Garciaparra
said.
</P>
<P>
   Colon squashed what little aggression the Sox mounted against
him, striking out a season-high 11 batters before giving way to
Paul Shuey to start the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   Shuey then did what Colon was unable to do, he got Garciaparra
out to start the inning, thrusting his arms skyward after
Garciaparra went down swinging on a fastball.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox finished with five hits, all by two players _
Garciaparra's double and home run and Stanley's three singles.
Rookie Brian Daubach, last seen here whiffing four times on Sept.
15, struck out three more times. So did Jason Varitek.
</P>
<P>
   And Lowe, coming out for a fifth inning of work for the first
time this season, could not afford the mistake he made in the
ninth, when he hit Ramirez.
</P>
<P>
   Jimy Williams then summoned lefthander Rheal Cormier, who
retired old hunting buddy Thome on a liner to left, then gave up a
single to pinch hitter Wilfredo Cordero. Two years ago, Cordero was
cast as the villain in a Boston morality play involving domestic
abuse, but has come back as No. 1 on the scorecards of Cleveland
fans, if not in their hearts.
</P>
<P>
   Garces entered and walked another pinch hitter, Richie Sexson,
on four pitches, before Fryman rifled his winning single on a line
to left.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a situation today where everything went wrong for
us,'' said Garces, who was consoled by catcher Varitek and last
season's closer, Tom Gordon. ``The guy (Fryman) hit a pretty good
pitch. I threw him a fastball in, then a curveball that he swung
and missed at. I tried to come back again on the inside corner. I
thought it was a good pitch. What can you do?''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez, who gave up three singles in his four innings, decided
he could do no more after pitching a 1-2-3 fourth, the only inning
in which he retired the Indians in order.
</P>
<P>
   He hurt his back whiffing Thome, the first batter of the fourth,
but retired Harold Baines on a pop and Justice on a bouncer to
first before informing Williams and Kerrigan of his injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``He felt a little pinch in his back,'' Kerrigan said. ``We went
down in the tunnel, where (trainer) Jim Rowe examined him. Ramon
(Martinez, Pedro's brother) came down, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was cut and dry. He just couldn't continue.''
</P>
<P>
   Kerrigan wouldn't even guess as to when Martinez would pitch,
though he said it was ``out of the question'' for Lowe to see any
work this afternoon in Game 2.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a short series, you really don't think about it,'' Kerrigan
said of when Martinez might pitch again. ``We're thinking about
(Bret) Saberhagen and the bullpen tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Pedro comes in tomorrow and feels better, everybody will
feel a lot better, but you can't guess on these things, or wish on
these things.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor should you despair, according to Williams.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a team,'' he said. ``We rebound. We have other good
pitchers and we bounced back from other situations and challenges
during the season. So we come out and play hard tomorrow. See what
happens. We've got Saberhagen going.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez opted for the braveheart, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can win with me, or without me,'' he said.

<P>
   CLEVELAND _ It's the playoffs. These are the Red Sox. Bad things
happen.
</P>
<P>
   When Boston's baseball team plays in October, the Larger Forces
always seem to be at work. At a time when optimism was running amok
in New England, Pedro Martinez Wednesday &UR;  &LR; night sustained a back
injury and Boston lost its 17th playoff game in 18 tries, a 3-2
bottom-of-the-ninth job against the Indians.
</P>
<P>
   Pedro, the Man Who Would Be Koufax, lasted only four innings in
his Game 1 Division Series start against the Tribe. The Sox led,
2-0, and appeared to have things in hand when Pedro failed to come
out for the fifth because of a muscle strain in his back.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez was testy after the game and said, ``Don't scare our
fans. Write it in the right way. I'll be back in the house. Don't
get our fans against us. I'm going to be back in the house.''
</P>
<P>
   Sorry, Pedro. It's hard to put this gently. Boston's ace is on
the shelf, at least until Sunday, Derek Lowe is burned out for a
couple of days, and the depleted Sox staff has to face the mighty
Tribe _ the first major league team to score 1,000 runs in 49
years. Bret Saberhagen gets the ball Thursday. Lucky fella.
</P>
<P>
   Sox pitching coach Joe Kerrigan said there was no question about
removing Martinez from Wednesday &UR;  &LR; night's game.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no choice,'' said Kerrigan. ``He did it on a pitch
to (Jim) Thome in the fourth. After that, his fastball dropped to
90 miles per hour. It looked like a batting practice fastball and
he was throwing almost all changeups to (Harold) Baines and (David)
Justice. I thought it was kind of strange.
</P>
<P>
   ``I go up to him after every inning. When I did after the
fourth, he grabbed me and said he felt a pinch in his back. We went
inside and Ramon came with us and (trainer Jim) Rowe examined him.
(Manager) Jimy (Williams) said, `That's enough.'''
</P>
<P>
   Pedro said, ``I didn't throw hard after feeling it. I didn't
want to be stupid. I wanted to come out one more inning, but I
wanted to have it checked out before I went out there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could re-hab it. I'm a quick healer. It's a burning I've got
back there. It's gonna be there for the next few hours.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez threw only 58 pitches in four innings. The sellout
Cleveland crowd when wild when Lowe came on to pitch the bottom of
the fifth. Lowe was spectacular, allowing only one hit in four
innings _ a game-tying two-run homer by Thome in the sixth.
Naturally, the homer came after a two-out error by John Valentin.
</P>
<P>
   It's the playoffs. These are the Red Sox. Bad things happen.
</P>
<P>
   There was some question about Boston's clubhouse karma before
the game even started. The Sox were slightly rocked by Reggie
Jefferson's abrupt departure after learning he was not part of the
playoff roster.
</P>
<P>
   There was also the surprising sight of Mark Portugal _ appearing
like Roland the headless Thompson gunner _ in the lobby of the Sox
hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Williams countered the bad vibes with his trusty Baby Ruth candy
bar. The manager seems to think the chocolate treat is some kind of
antidote for the Curse of the Bambino and carried it with him all
the way through the Sox' 8-4, make-or-break road trip. He also had
it on his desk when the Sox swept the Yankees in September.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got it with me,'' Williams said before Wednesday &UR;  &LR; night's
game.
</P>
<P>
   Pedro, who is kind of a Baby Ruth himself, threw 21 pitches in
the first inning, which ended when he fanned Manny ``165 RBIs''
Ramirez on a 3-and-2 pitch.
</P>
<P>
   In the press box, 80-year-old Bob Feller, wearing a Tribe tie,
said, ``I've seen him quite a bit. He's not Sandy Koufax yet, but
he had a great year, a great couple of years.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez was on an unbelievable roll coming into the game. Many
considered him unbeatable. But he was beaten by 49-degree
temperatures and a pinch in his back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt in command,'' said Martinez. ``I felt we could have won
that game. But we didn't lose yet. There's plenty of games left. We
have to come back and win the next game.''
</P>
<P>
   Travis Fryman, who got the winning hit off Rich Garces, said,
``When it happened (Martinez left the game), I said, `Hey, we've
got a chance to get back into the ballgame.' And it gives you a
sense of confidence to win the ballgame.''
</P>
<P>
   Kerrigan would not speculate on when Martinez might be ready to
pitch again, but Saturday's Game 3 would seem to be out of the
question. The Sox can only hope there is a Game 4 Sunday. Let's
face it, folks: any injury to Pedro effectively smothers the Red
Sox' postseason hopes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Saberhagen has pitched big games before,'' Williams said.
``He's going to go out and compete the best he can tomorrow. We
have a team. We rebound. We have other good pitchers. We've bounced
back from other challenges during the course of the season.''
</P>
<P>
   They have. But an injury to Pedro increases the likelihood that
Boston's postseason woes will continue. The 1999 Red Sox have been
resilient, but it's difficult to imagine them overcoming the loss
of their Cy Young/MVP ace.
</P>
<P>
   Why should we have expected things to be any different? It's the
playoffs. These are the Red Sox. Bad things happen.

PHOENIX - In addition to the New York Mets, their coaches, agents,
bodyguards and parole officers, several writers from the New York
papers and their therapists are visiting Phoenix.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Among them is one from the New York Post, who produced a story
for Wednesday's paper under the head line, ``Phoenix has never
risen from the ashes.''
</P>
<P>
   The reporter's name is Gersh Kuntzman.
</P>
<P>
   I swear.
</P>
<P>
   From his downtown hotel room, Gersh declared Phoenix ``a city
that needs to be slapped in the face.''
</P>
<P>
   He described residents here as ``dull'' and ``not . . . the
brightest bunch of baseball fans.''
</P>
<P>
   He informed Post readers that Phoenix is a ``dusty, desert waste
land,'' a ``nightmare city'' that looks ``like a neutron bomb
hit.''
</P>
<P>
   Dusty desert wasteland? Night mare city? Dull?
</P>
<P>
   If I could say one thing about re porter Gersh Kuntzman to all
the New Yorkers who may have read his article, it would be this:
</P>
<P>
   He overestimates us. &QL; 
HORRIBLE PLACE
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix is WAY worse than that.
</P>
<P>
   New Yorkers, please, don't let the pictures from the Snoopy
blimp fool you, particularly those showing what looks like a
beautiful new ball park at night, with city lights spread over the
desert like diamonds on black velvet.
</P>
<P>
   They take those pictures after the sun goes down for a reason,
you know.
</P>
<P>
   It's the media's way of keeping you from seeing the SNAKES that
are everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   And the SCORPIONS.
</P>
<P>
   And the ground that's completely covered with sharp, poisonous
CACTI _ except for the playing field at Bank One Ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   Don't be duped by that place, ei ther. Shea Stadium is much
nicer, or will be once they clear out the in festation of roaches,
which is to say, once the Diamondbacks win the se ries and Mets
fans are forced to go home.
</P>
<P>
   Listen to Gersh.
</P>
<P>
   Too many New Yorkers have failed to heed dire warnings about
Arizona and moved here.
</P>
<P>
   SO, PLEASE, STAY HOME
</P>
<P>
   The rest of you, please, don't do it. Particularly if you happen
to be Donald Trump or Al Sharpton.
</P>
<P>
   Or Howard Stern.
</P>
<P>
   Or Hillary Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   You won't like it here.
</P>
<P>
   Stick with Marv Albert. Our sportscasters aren't nearly as
biting.
</P>
<P>
   You wouldn't feel safe on our streets, anyway. Police here don't
understand the tactical need to fire 41 shots at an unarmed
immigrant, as yours do, and have no training in the creative use of
a broken broom stick during interrogations.
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, culturally, we simply cannot compare to New
York.
</P>
<P>
   That's evident to anyone who's ever set foot on a New York City
street.
</P>
<P>
   I'll never forget the first time I opened the door of a taxi in
mid-town Manhattan, looked around at the majestic skyscrapers
rising like canyon walls, and stepped out of the cab into a big
mound of what folks in Arizona might call ``gersh.''
</P>
<P>
   Out here, among people the Post says are ``overwhelmed by the
very idea of deli sandwich,'' we'd simply just scrape off the nasty
stuff and move on.
</P>
<P>
   What a waste! As they say. &QL; 
WASTELAND FOR ART
</P>
<P>
   Near as I can tell, and I've done some checking, there's not a
single museum in the Phoenix metropolitan area featuring a painting
of the Blessed Virgin Mary with a wad of dung stuck onto it.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, you can get that kind of artistic enlightenment only
in a place like New York.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, I read recently that the Brooklyn Museum of Art is
drawing very large crowds of New Yorkers, each one anxious to stare
at the doo-doo on the wall.
</P>
<P>
   Which explains why the city has so many Mets fans.
</P>
<P>
   Also, New York, if you're going to send one of your thugs down
here to try to slap us in the face, you gotta come up with somebody
tougher-sounding than Gersh.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, fagetaboudit. &QL;

DESPITE FINE EFFORT, LOWE FEELS DOWN 
</HEADLINE>
 SOX-LOWE-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB DUFFY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND _ As he strode to the mound at Jacobs Field
Wednesday &UR;  &LR; night, he was saluted with a deafening cheer as 45,182
delirious patrons rose to their feet.
</P>
<P>
   Derek Lowe had never heard such an unpleasant sound.
</P>
<P>
   ``First time I ever got a standing ovation on the road,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   And that meant trouble. Lowe knew that the crowd wasn't paying
tribute to his presence so much as celebrating the absence of Pedro
Martinez. In their Division Series opener, the Red Sox' Cy
Young-elect had stymied the Indians on three hits, while the Sox'
bats had delivered a 2-0 lead through four innings.
</P>
<P>
   Then Martinez had disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   All the stunned Lowe knew when the bullpen phone rang was what
coach John Cumberland told him: ``You got the fifth.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew something was wrong, obviously,'' said Lowe. ``But
they're not going to explain to me what was going on.''
</P>
<P>
   What was going on was that the Red Sox had lost their ace with a
strained muscle in the middle of his back and that the versatile
Lowe _ spot starter, steady setup man, promising closer _ had been
entrusted with salvaging the situation.
</P>
<P>
   The rescue mission failed, but it was a gallant attempt
nonetheless. In four-plus innings, Lowe struck out four, walked
none, and allowed only two hits. Unfortunately for him, one of
those hits was a two-run homer to Jim Thome that tied the game in
the sixth inning.
</P>
<P>
   And the other was a hit batsman, Manny Ramirez, leading off the
ninth. The last man Lowe faced wound up scoring on Travis Fryman's
bases-loaded single as the Indians pulled out an unlikely 3-2
victory.
</P>
<P>
   Lowe was in no mood to give himself an ovation despite his
gritty 911 work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I lost the game,'' he said. ``How can I give myself credit for
that? I gave up only one hit, but it was a homer. And then I hit a
guy who scored the winning run.''
</P>
<P>
   Lowe didn't mention it, but he just as easily could have been a
2-0 winner. With two out in the sixth, third baseman John Valentin
short-hopped a throw to first on Ramirez's grounder. Thome then
launched a 434-foot rocket into the right-field seats. Lowe should
have been out of the inning unscathed, but he wouldn't take himself
off the hook.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no reason to give up a home run in that situation,''
he said. ``I tip my cap to Thome. I threw him a curveball. It
wasn't my best curve, but it wasn't my worst, and he jumped on
it.''
</P>
<P>
   By then, Lowe had an idea of what dire straits the Red Sox'
pitching was in. After working a perfect fifth, he came into the
visitors' clubhouse and found Martinez being treated in the
trainer's room.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said he was sore,'' recalled Lowe. ``He wasn't going to
give me a complete rundown, but obviously, he was hurting.''
</P>
<P>
   Not as much as Lowe was after he nailed Ramirez in the back with
a 2-2 pitch, then trudged disconsolately to the dugout.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a fastball and I was trying to get it inside,'' he
said. ``But when your body gets a little tired, you tend to throw
too much with your body. I must have missed by 10 feet with that
pitch.''
</P>
<P>
   After such a shattering result and a taxing effort, Lowe is
looking forward to some time off _ until Game 2 this afternoon,
when he vows he can give an inning or two if requested.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, this is the playoffs,'' he said. ``This is when you want
to be in there.''

   LONDON _ The strands of twisted, blackened metal jut out like
surreal pieces of a charred sculpture. There is the smell of burned
things in the air, the rest is just ashes, knee deep. This was a
First-Class carriage, with seating for 48 passengers.
</P>
<P>
   It is still not known exactly how many perished in carriage H of
the InterCity 125 as it was wrenched off the rest of the train and
flung aside in the crash. The fire sparked by the impact spread in
seconds and then raged on for the next 20 minutes, reaching a
staggering 1,000C. Everything inside was incinerated.
</P>
<P>
   At dawn yesterday firemen, police officers and forensic
scientists began sifting through the debris. What remained of the
bodies under the sea of ashes could be ashes themselves. They will
have to be sieved and gathered together. It is horrifying.
</P>
<P>
   The men from Scotland Yard's body recovery team have been to
Cambodia, Bosnia and Kosovo, but even they say they have never seen
anything quite like this. Each rescuer was carefully monitored for
signs of stress.
</P>
<P>
   Superintendent Tony Thompson of the British Transport Police, a
man of vast experience, could only say quietly: ``It is utter
devastation, utter devastation. One can imagine what happened. It
must have been dreadful.''
</P>
<P>
   The one clear forecast being made amid the mayhem, confusion and
recriminations surrounding the accident is that the body count is
going to rise and rise and rise.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Assistant Commissioner Andy Trotter, the senior police
officer for this area of west London, said he feared it will be
``considerably higher'' than the official figure so far. He pointed
out that there was a large ``gap'' between the hundreds thought to
be travelling on the two trains and those accounted for, either
alive or dead.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from the ones trapped and killed in the burned carriage,
there are believed to be bodies hidden under other carriages and
the engines of the trains. One was found early yesterday stuck in
an undercarriage. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   The lifting needed to get to these bodies cannot take place
until heavier equipment is brought in, including a 100-ton crane,
which was being assembled yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   A road will have to be built to bring it on to the site from a
parking lot and some buildings beside the track will be demolished
to position it.
</P>
<P>
   Specialist cutting equipment is also needed. Some of the tools
used by the firefighters could not cope with the metal fused by the
intense fire.
</P>
<P>
   But other recovery work continued yesterday, mostly centered
around the shell of carriage H, draped in a thick blue-and-yellow
tarpaulin.
</P>
<P>
   Markings had been made, in fluorescent green paint, on the sides
and the emergency workers, in their white boiler suits, delicately
began to pick their way through the ash and metal inside.
</P>
<P>
   What they gathered was being carefully bagged and stored to be
examined by the forensic specialists. The firemen, dressed in
brown, stood by to cut through any obstacles in the way.
</P>
<P>
   Gathering was also taking place outside. The force of the blast
had thrown some of the debris into gardens 150 feet away, and the
bits were being collected. House-to-house inquiries were also
taking place. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC;

</P>
<P>
   Immediately outside the carriage, there were everyday reminders
of the lives of those who died _ coats and shoes, briefcases and
magazines and paperbacks, coffee cups and chocolate wrappers and a
railway timetable.
</P>
<P>
   In one carriage, you could see a photo of a smiling, fair-haired
boy, no more than a year old, holding up a ball. It probably fell
out of someone's wallet. Also being collected were mobile phones.
</P>
<P>
   The sprawling area of the accident, now an official crime scene,
has been sectioned off by blue-and-white police tape, within which
a fingertip search is being carried out. The evidence brought
together will be used to establish identities. DNA tests, dental
records and fingerprints will be crucial.
</P>
<P>
   The bodies found so far have been tagged, photographed and
videoed. This will be needed for the inquests and any criminal
prosecution that may follow. ``This is the only chance we have to
do this,'' Supt. Thompson said. ``Once the bulldozers move in and
the carriages are lifted away this will be lost.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to place every person exactly where they were on the
train. We more or less did this in King's Cross. It is vital to do
this if we are to find out what happened. We owe it to the victims
and their families as well as the law.'' &QL;

   One of the ``black box'' recorders from the commuter train has
been recovered, but another one situated at the front has not. The
recorders, each the size of a small suitcase, should show how fast
the Thames train was travelling _ and whether or not the driver
applied the brakes.
</P>
<P>
   The InterCity 125 did not carry such a recorder, being built
before they became standard for safety reasons. ``This is a big
blow,'' said one investigator. ``They're invaluable for finding out
what actually occurred, what signals came on, what action was taken
by the driver.''
</P>
<P>
   Normal life was returning to this stretch of west London
yesterday. The Sainsbury's supermarket, a makeshift refuge the
previous day, was busy with shoppers. The staff of the store, who
had been the first to arrive at the scene, were busy behind their
tills. Occasionally the shoppers would ask each other if they knew
the latest number of dead.
</P>
<P>
   The work continued for the emergency services. Andy, a young
fireman, pained and exhausted, with tiredness etched on his face,
was drinking coffee from a Styrofoam cup, standing in the sunshine
looking down at the broken trains.
</P>
<P>
   Will he be leaving? ``I don't know, I suppose I should. I
couldn't have slept last night even if I had wanted to,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I suppose one ought to get hardened to these things but I
can't. I think about the families of those who died. Who do they
blame? When a bomb goes off one can blame the people who planted
it. Here, even if human error was involved, it wasn't done on
purpose, was it? Who do you blame, God?'' &QL;

GARCIAPARRA RETURNS AND DOESN'T MISS A BEAT 
</HEADLINE>
 SOX-GARCIAPARRA-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN PAUL DUPONT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND _ Another year, another Division Series, same old
stuff for Nomar Garciaparra.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox shortstop picked up where he left off in last year's
playoffs, slamming a home run Wednesday &UR;  &LR; night against the Indians,
essentially teaming with first baseman Mike Stanley to shape the
entire Boston offense.
</P>
<P>
   Leading off the second inning, the 26-year-old Garciaparra broke
a scoreless tie when he strong-armed a Bartolo Colon fastball over
the wall in right center. The ball landed 418 feet from home plate,
impressive considering that Garciaparra wheeled around on Colon's
delivery virtually without stepping into the pitch. All but
flat-footed, Garciaparra flicked his titanium wrists (did someone
say sore?) into the offering and sent it rocketing into the night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Flat-footed? I've never heard that before,'' said Garciaparra,
smirking. ``I hit it. It went out. That's all.''
</P>
<P>
   In the fourth, Garciaparra belted another Colon pitch, a shot to
left, that just missed being another homer. The ball hit off the
wall for an easy double, and two batters later Garciaparra chugged
home with the sox second run on Stanley's single to left _ one of
three singles for the Sox first baseman.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox finished with five hits againt Colon. Garciaparra had
two. Stanley had three. The rest of the lineup went 0-for-Colon.
</P>
<P>
   ``He pitched great _ he did a good job,'' said Garciaparra, who
went 5 for 15 in the playoffs last year, when the Sox fell to the
Indians in four games. ``He's not going to be giving any
freebies.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the rest of the Sox lineup was dormant, Cleveland
manager Mike Hargrove didn't see the need to pitch around
Garciaparra.
</P>
<P>
   ``Garciaparra is a good hitter,'' he said. ``I don't think with
nobody on, you don't pitch around people. I'm not going to sit here
(and put) Nomar Garciaparra on base to face (Troy) O'Leary and
Stanley and those guys hitting behind him. That's not the idea of
pitching around people . . . there are times you have to pitch to
people no matter how good they are, and if there's nobody on, and
that guy is at the plate, I'm not going to sit there and pitch
around him.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sox still had a 2-0 lead in the sixth when an overzealous
Garciparra got carried away on the basepaths on Troy O'Leary's deep
fly ball to left. Anticipating that the ball would leave the yard
or hit the wall, Garciaparra raced around second base and was well
on his way to third when left fielder David Justice made the catch.
</P>
<P>
   Garciaparra, halfway home when Justice came down with the ball ,
raced back to first. But second baseman Roberto Alomar gathered in
Justice's relay, turned and tossed a soft lob to first baseman Jim
Thome. Garciaparra was doubled off first. The inning was over. In
the bottom of the sixth, Thome drilled a two-run bomb to right,
tying the score, 2-2.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it hits the wall, I score,'' said Garciaparra. ``I thought
it was a good time to be aggressive on the basepaths. But, he made
a nice catch.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Sox are going to get by the Indians and make their way to
the American League Championship Series, they need more than a
Garciaparra-Stanley offense. Seven dead bats have to come back to
life. The Sox also face the possiblity of losing their ace, Pedro
Martinez, who exited with a muscle burning in the middle of his
back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pedro can't pitch everyday, we know that,'' said Garciaparra.
``We can't be worried about it carrying over, psychologically. I
don't know his problem, we'll have to see what it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Garciaparra sounded upbeat. The Sox had a two-run lead, but left
losers, and history reminded the shorstop that an opening playoff
loss doesn't necessarily spell series defeat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, it's not like we're out of it,'' said Garciaparra. ``Last
year we won the first game _ and then we went home.''

and the emergency workers, in their white boiler suits, delicately
began to pick their way through the ash and metal inside.

   What they gathered was being carefully bagged and stored to be
examined by the forensic specialists. The firemen, dressed in
brown, stood by to cut through any obstacles in the way.
</P>
<P>
   Gathering was also taking place outside. The force of the blast
had thrown some of the debris into gardens 150 feet away, and the

taking place. &QL;

of the lives of those who died _ coats and shoes, briefcases and
magazines and paperbacks, coffee cups and chocolate wrappers and a
railway timetable.
</P>
<P>
   In one carriage, you could see a photo of a smiling, fair-haired
boy, no more than a year old, holding up a ball. It probably fell
out of someone's wallet. Also being collected were mobile phones.

   The sprawling area of the accident, now an official crime scene,
has been sectioned off by blue-and-white police tape, within which
a fingertip search is being carried out. The evidence brought
together will be used to establish identities. DNA tests, dental
records and fingerprints will be crucial.

   The bodies found so far have been tagged, photographed and
videoed. This will be needed for the inquests and any criminal

   One of the ``black box'' recorders from the commuter train has
been recovered, but another one situated at the front has not. The
recorders, each the size of a small suitcase, should show how fast
the Thames train was travelling _ and whether or not the driver
applied the brakes.
</P>
<P>
   The InterCity 125 did not carry such a recorder, being built
before they became standard for safety reasons. ``This is a big
blow,'' said one investigator. ``They're invaluable for finding out
what actually occurred, what signals came on, what action was taken
by the driver.''

   Normal life was returning to this stretch of west London
yesterday. The Sainsbury's supermarket, a makeshift refuge the
previous day, was busy with shoppers. The staff of the store, who
had been the first to arrive at the scene, were busy behind their
tills. Occasionally the shoppers would ask each other if they knew
the latest number of dead.
</P>
<P>
   The work continued for the emergency services. Andy, a young
fireman, pained and exhausted, with tiredness etched on his face,
was drinking coffee from a Styrofoam cup, standing in the sunshine
looking down at the broken trains.
</P>
<P>
   Will he be leaving? ``I don't know, I suppose I should. I
couldn't have slept last night even if I had wanted to,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I suppose one ought to get hardened to these things but I
can't. I think about the families of those who died. Who do they
blame? When a bomb goes off one can blame the people who planted
it. Here, even if human error was involved, it wasn't done on
purpose, was it? Who do you blame, God?'' &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   After 52 years, India has at last found a leader it likes who is
not a member of Jawaharlal Nehru's family.
</P>
<P>
   Atal Behari Vajpayee, who is likely to start his third term as
Prime Minister in the next few days, is an amateur poet, a Hindu
romantic, a parliamentarian for more than 40 years, a lyrical
orator, a Brahmin and an honest man.
</P>
<P>
   He is, his opponents allege, ``a good man in the wrong party'';
a ``mask'' for the fanatics and fascists who make themselves amply
at home in the Hindu nationalist family.
</P>
<P>
   To his party before the last election one and a half years ago
he was ``the man India awaits.''
</P>
<P>
   Against great odds, Vajpayee has justified the trust his party
has placed in him, though as much by luck as good judgment.
</P>
<P>
   He began his term last year in dramatic fashion by staging five
nuclear tests and drawing down the wrath of the world. Delhi's
diplomatic grapevine has been humming with speculation that they
might do some more tests on winning this election.
</P>
<P>
   By the time his parliament was defeated in parliament in April,
thanks to the defection of an ally, he looked like a blundering old
man _ he is 74 _ and way out of his depth.
</P>
<P>
   He could make India a nuclear power, but could not control the
price of onions _ let alone his coalition partners.
</P>
<P>
   When he had been relegated to the status of ``caretaker prime
minister'' Vajpayee got lucky. His luck took an unlikely form.
Pakistani troops infiltrated deep into Indian territory above
Kargil in Kashmir, and seized strategic positions high in the
mountains. By the time they were discovered in early May they were
practically unassailable.
</P>
<P>
   That was a great embarrassment for India, but Vajpayee turned
this debacle into a diplomatic and military triumph. The
infiltrators were met by massive Indian force, but the government
resisted powerful military persuasion to end the conflict quickly
by crossing the cease-fire line, the so-called Line of Control.
</P>
<P>
   This restraint won international applause, and was followed by a
massive diplomatic effort to persuade world leaders that Pakistan
was the aggressor, which left Pakistan isolated.
</P>
<P>
   Reckless enough to try to bomb his way to the top table; but
calm under heavy pressure: that is the paradoxical impression
Vajpayee made.
</P>
<P>
   There has long been something Churchillian about him. The Kargil
crisis reinforced the image of a bulldog brahmin. His popularity
now transcends party and regional lines. &QL;

STANLEY MISSED WITH PICK 
</HEADLINE>
 SOX-STANLEY-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SHIRA SPRINGER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND _ By all accounts, the ball fell into unfortunate
territory. It bounced in the dirt just a few inches short of the
first baseman's glove. It was one of those difficult hops _ too far
to reach, too close to nab on a hop. Mike Stanley was left with
what he called an ``ole' ,'' a ball he needed to swipe out of the
dirt _ like the motion of a matador _ for the third out in the
sixth inning. But even that proved difficult. Stanley did not know
whether to pick the ball or try a backhanded grab.
</P>
<P>
   And unfortunately, a leather glove cuts a much smaller swath
than a red cape. The ball never got swept into Stanley's glove, and
Manny Ramirez reached first. Third baseman John Valentin accepted
the error on the throw. The failed ``ole' '' and the underthrown
ball would haunt the Red Sox. Jim Thome belted a home run to right
center on the next pitch, evening the score at 2-2, which led to a
ninth-inning, 3-2 Cleveland victory Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Defensive lapses by Boston and spectacular fielding plays by the
Indians, complemented by the pitching of Bartolo Colon, resulted in
the Red Sox downfall. While the Indians made catches when it
mattered most, the Red Sox were relying on an ``ole' '' at first
and luck at the plate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was one of those where you don't ole' one way or backhand
ole' the other,'' said Stanley. ``It was kind of in the middle. I
just kind of tried to come up with it. I'd come up with it before.
I just didn't do it this time. You just try to come up and pick it.
Sometimes the ones that are right in the middle of your body are
the toughest . . . I guess it's all for not, if Thome doesn't come
up with a big home run. But he did. Obviously, that puts a bigger
mark on it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Indians did the job at the plate, and the defense held the
Red Sox at bay. In the ill-fated sixth, Troy O'Leary hit a long fly
ball to left. The Indians' David Justice made a catch at the wall
and his relay to the infield doubled-up Garciaparra at first. Other
defensive highlights for the Indians included a diving stab and
across-the-body throw by second baseman Roberto Alomar in the
seventh inning, and an eighth-inning catch by shortstop Omar
Vizquel with his back to the infield.
</P>
<P>
   But the strength of the defense started with the Colon, who
fooled Red Sox hitters with strong pitches all night. The Cleveland
starter finished with a season-high 11 strikeouts in eight innings.
Many of those K's came courtesy of a fastball that reached 100
miles per hour.
</P>
<P>
   Stanley had a productive night, going 3 for 4 with an RBI in the
fourth inning. All of Stanley's hits were singles off Colon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just tried to maintain some time of focus and trust the
abilities I was given,'' said Stanley. ``I've been trying to do
that for the last week or so, just trusting in what you have. I
tried to relax a little bit and make the most of it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Colon was absolutely nasty. He was tough. When you're going
against a guy throwing 99-100 miles an hour, sharp breaking ball
and locating his fastball as well as he did with good movement, it
makes it very tough . . . I just got lucky.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Stanley would be the first to admit, the one piece of
luck he needed Wednesday &UR;  &LR; night didn't fall into place.

MARTINEZ EXIT WAS MUSIC TO INDIANS' EARS 
</HEADLINE>
 SOX-ANALYSIS-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND _ They will never admit they were scared
Wednesday &UR;  &LR; night. They were looking at Pedro Martinez and his 2-0
lead, and the Cleveland Indians didn't believe they could win their
Division Series opener. Now they are not only thinking about
winning the series, they believe they can sweep it.
</P>
<P>
   They didn't quite say that Wednesday &UR;  &LR; night at Jacobs Field,
because baseball tradition is that you neither acknowledge
vulnerability nor embrace the obvious. But by watching and
listening to the Indians after their 3-2 win over the Red Sox, you
could tell they were thrilled to have something they didn't expect.
It's the same feeling you get when you find a $50 bill in your
pocket.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez left the game after the fourth with what the Sox
described as a muscle strain in his mid-back. The Indians said they
had noticed that his velocity had dropped during the game, from his
usual high 90s to high 80s. But his presence on the mound still
shook them. When they saw him leave, they were jubilant.
</P>
<P>
   ``We came in (for the fifth inning) and I heard Omar (Vizquel)
say, `Hey, new pitcher guys.' I thought he was joking around to
kind of lighten the guys up a little bit,'' said Indians third
baseman Travis Fryman, who had the winning single in the ninth
inning. ``I looked out there and I saw (Derek) Lowe walking in and
for me, personally, it was kind of, `Hey, we got a chance to get
back in the ballgame, too.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Think about that statement. It was only the fifth inning and the
Indians' view of themselves was that they were out of the game. It
was 2-0. This is the same team that scored more than 1,000 runs in
the regular season. It once trailed a game by eight runs and came
back to win by nine. But the Indians know Martinez treats them with
irreverence. He has never delivered safe, conservative comments
about their lineup. He has mocked them, talked trashed to them, and
dominated them. They knew they were going to lose. They were
scared. They aren't scared anymore.
</P>
<P>
   ``Getting Pedro out of the game was huge for us,'' said Jim
Thome, who hit a monstrous, 434-foot home run off Lowe to tie the
game in the sixth. So if Martinez's exit was a huge psychological
boost for the Indians, what was it for the Red Sox? Thome said he
could understand the shock of losing your best pitcher in the first
game of the playoffs, but the series is not over. He said the
Indians have just as much respect for Bret Saberhagen and Ramon
Martinez as they do for Pedro Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   You know that isn't true.
</P>
<P>
   After the game, you would have thought the Indians' clubhouse
was a Lansdowne Street club. The players blasted their music over
the posh stereo system. When one lowered the volume, a group
sitting at a table shouted in unison, ``Hey!'' So the music went
back up. Over that consistent bass, player after player recounted
Pedro stories.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great win for us,'' said winning pitcher Paul Shuey.
``When it was 2-2, it was almost like we were winning. Pedro was
out of the game at that point . . . ''
</P>
<P>
   Across the room, Roberto Alomar said he knew something was wrong
with his friend Pedro. ``But they have a great bullpen, so there is
no guarantee that you'll win with him out. The other guy (Lowe) did
a great job.''
</P>
<P>
   The only mistake Lowe made was in the sixth, to Thome. The
slugger was looking for a breaking ball and that's what Lowe gave
him. And he gave it to him high.
</P>
<P>
   Outside of the very loud clubhouse, Martinez was walking out of
the stadium. He saw Indians closer Mike Jackson, who asked how he
was doing. He also saw Indians coach Luis Isaac and spoke with him.
He walked cautiously, the softest way you can walk without doing so
on tiptoes. It is not the way the Indians are used to seeing
Martinez. Because they saw him like this, they are no longer
scared. And remember, no matter what they say, they were
frightened.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Lowe's 1-for-30 performance against the Indians coming
into the game, the fans here cheered when they learned Martinez had
left. Many of them had spent the day calling radio talk shows,
offering Pedro theories. Some said that manager Mike Hargrove
should try to get in Martinez's head by complaining about his cut
uniform sleeves. They said the Indians should work the count and
tire him out. They were panicking before the first pitch was
thrown. Their team wasn't panicking, but it wasn't confident.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Indians are awake. Maybe Saberhagen can reach back to
1985 and capture a bit of his Cy Young residue. The Indians say
they know that can happen and they say the Sox are a great team.
But just as much as baseball players dismiss weakness, they also
don't tell the truth about any advantages they might have.
</P>
<P>
   They have an advantage. They went from a whimpering team to a
supremely confident one with a single announcement: ``Ladies and
gentlemen, the new Red Sox pitcher . . . ''
</P>
<P>
   As Martinez, wearing a brown sport jacket and black slacks,
quietly left the stadium, many Indians were still in the clubhouse
wearing their uniforms. They didn't say they were feeling good.
They simply laughed and turned up their music.

   AMMAN, JORDAN _ He is glossy, affable, short _ the unkind would
say squat _ and has the sort of heavy facial features that hint at
a prize fighter. And now, eight months after assuming the throne of
the Hashemite kingdom, King Abdullah II of Jordan has thrown his
first big punch.
</P>
<P>
   The target of the youthful new king's uppercut is Hamas, the
militant Islamic group which has long been active among Jordan's
Palestinian population, and which is now reeling after the
detention of 21 members. Among them are two of the organization's
senior figures.
</P>
<P>
   The 37-year-old king, who took over the throne after the death
from cancer of his father, King Hussein, spelled out his strategy
in a conversation with a small group of correspondents Wednesday,
before he set off for a trip to the United States where he will
meet Bill Clinton next week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jordan has made itself clear that Hamas offices will be shut
down in Jordan and that is what will happen,'' he said, over brunch
in palace offices in Amman.
</P>
<P>
   The Sandhurst (English military academy)-educated king, who
formerly commanded the Jordanian army's Special Operations, appears
to enjoy using the logic of a military man: ``A soldier has to pick
his battles, rather than let other people chose them for him.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, two prominent Hamas leaders are now behind bars _
Khalid Mashaal, head of its ``politburo,'' and Ibrahim Ghosheh, a
senior publicity official.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, the men, both Jordanian citizens, were taken into
custody as they arrived in Jordan from a trip to Iran, along with
their four bodyguards. At the time, Jordanian officials said the
two had been gathering security-related information on Jordan,
training militant cadres, and stockpiling caches of arms. The two
Hamas men denied it.
</P>
<P>
   The arrests followed a swoop in late August when Jordanian
police also raided Hamas offices, closing them down and detaining
15 staff. Since then public figures have been warned against
advocating pro-Hamas views, and a Muslim cleric, who made pro-Hamas
sermons was arrested and held for six days..
</P>
<P>
   Jordan's crackdown has fuelled speculation that the new king is
not so much flexing his own muscles as acting on the behest of the
Israelis or the United States, both of whom relish the spectacle of
militant Palestinians being sent packing from Amman (almost
certainly to Syria).
</P>
<P>
   Whether that is fair or not, the purge suggests that the king _
who, in the past, has openly criticized the U.S. enemy-in-chief,
Iran _ leans more unambiguously towards Washington than his
brilliantly pragmatic father, King Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   The latter _ whose grizzled, twinkling features still adorn
banners and posters throughout his desert kingdom, and whose name
is repeatedly summoned up by his devoted heir _ was also
pro-western. But powerful elements of the Arab world have yet to
forget how King Hussein adopted what they saw as an excessively
pro-Iraqi stance in the 1991 Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly the new king has some cause to please the Americans,
who have been increasing their already substantial aid to Jordan,
and are next year expected to pay out $125 million in military aid
alone.
</P>
<P>
   But the crackdown on Hamas also benefits Yasser Arafat, who
views it as a thorn in the side which threatens to disrupt the
already precarious Middle East peace process. The Palestinian
leader has been privately pressuring the Jordanians to act.
</P>
<P>
   The king's tactics entail significant risks. Although Hamas does
not enjoy strong public support in Jordan, surveys suggest that
many of the population share its opposition to making a peace
treaty with Israel.
</P>
<P>
   There is also a chance that the jailed Hamas leaders will seize
on the possibility of a trial to publicize their cause _ a risk
which suggests Jordan's best ploy would be to strike a deal in
which they are released and exiled.
</P>
<P>
   The issue is part of a larger bid by Jordan's leader to breathe
air into the cinders of the Oslo peace process, which fizzled
during the stagnant rule of Israel's Benjamin Netanyahu but is now
showing signs of new life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now there is a great sense of euphoria in the Middle East,''
King Abdullah said Wednesday, ``My greatest fear is what happens if
nothing takes place over the next six months.''
</P>
<P>
   This approach is unlikely to do much to endear the new king _
who speaks limited Arabic but is as slick and as persuasive in
English as an international financier _ to much of his country,
burdened as it is by high unemployment, sparse natural resources,
and a hefty foreign debt.
</P>
<P>
   But it will strengthen his claim on his father's other title;
that of ``plucky little king.'' &QL;

   AMMAN, JORDAN _ He is glossy, affable, short _ the unkind would
say squat _ and has the sort of heavy facial features that hint at
a prize fighter. And now, eight months after assuming the throne of
the Hashemite kingdom, King Abdullah II of Jordan has thrown his
first big punch.
</P>
<P>
   The target of the youthful new king's uppercut is Hamas, the
militant Islamic group which has long been active among Jordan's
Palestinian population, and which is now reeling after the
detention of 21 members. Among them are two of the organization's
senior figures.
</P>
<P>
   The 37-year-old king, who took over the throne after the death
from cancer of his father, King Hussein, spelled out his strategy
in a conversation with a small group of correspondents Wednesday,
before he set off for a trip to the United States where he will
meet Bill Clinton next week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jordan has made itself clear that Hamas offices will be shut
down in Jordan and that is what will happen,'' he said, over brunch
in palace offices in Amman.
</P>
<P>
   The Sandhurst (English military academy)-educated king, who
formerly commanded the Jordanian army's Special Operations, appears
to enjoy using the logic of a military man: ``A soldier has to pick
his battles, rather than let other people chose them for him.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, two prominent Hamas leaders are now behind bars _
Khalid Mashaal, head of its ``politburo,'' and Ibrahim Ghosheh, a
senior publicity official.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, the men, both Jordanian citizens, were taken into
custody as they arrived in Jordan from a trip to Iran, along with
their four bodyguards. At the time, Jordanian officials said the

ERROR BELIES VALENTIN'S PRESENCE 
</HEADLINE>
 SOX-VALENTIN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SHIRA SPRINGER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND _ When the criticism came, John Valentin took it like
a veteran. And therein lies the problem.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox third baseman was placed on the 15-day disabled list
with left patella tendinitis the last day of August. During his
absence, some questioned Valentin's commitment. He was activated
Sept. 23, but in a move that raised more questions, manager Jimy
Williams kept rookie Wilton Veras in the starting lineup. Valentin
took the decision in stride, betraying no concern and announcing
the day off was part of a plan to bring him back slowly.
</P>
<P>
   The 21-year-old Veras had played admirably in place of the
32-year-old Valentin. The young infielder had impressed after his
recall from Double A Trenton in late June and again showed great
promise in early September.
</P>
<P>
   But Wednesday &UR;  &LR; night, Valentin took his playoff experience into
Game 1 of the Division Series while Veras was left on the ``also
traveling'' list. It was an interesting call by the manager and a
troubling night for Valentin, whose throwing error proved to be a
turning point as the Indians rallied for a 3-2 win.
</P>
<P>
   Valentin went 0 for 4 at the plate, hitting into a double play
in the fifth inning. But his most regrettable play came in the
bottom of the sixth with two outs. He made an error on a throw to
first, allowing Manny Ramirez to reach base. Jim Thome followed the
error with a home run to right-center on reliever Derek Lowe's
first pitch. The homer tied the game, 2-2, and set the stage for
the Indians' ninth-inning victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``You go out there and you try to make every play perfect,''
said Valentin. ``It wasn't a hard-hit ground ball, and I waited
back to get a good hop. I just underthrew it. I thought I threw it
good enough to reach (Mike) Stanley, and it didn't make it.
Obviously it was a bad throw, and the rest is history.''
</P>
<P>
   The error overshadowed a stellar defensive play that Valentin
made in the eighth. With Omar Vizquel at bat, the third baseman was
playing in close to protect against a possible bunt. The Indians
shortstop tried to whack the ball past Valentin, but Valentin
snagged it with a backhanded catch as he stretched toward the foul
line. This time, he made a successful throw to first for the out.
But there was no joy in his expression after the play. And no joy
in the clubhouse after the game.
</P>
<P>
   When asked to discuss the catch, Valentin said, ``It really
doesn't matter, does it?''
</P>
<P>
   Williams may reward regular players and veterans with spots on
the playoff roster. But during the game, it doesn't matter how
steady you are or whether you make a spectacular play in the
eighth. The most important thing is making the right throw when it
matters. And Valentin, the veteran, knows it.

play equipment where they can leap, hang, climb and run, blowing
off steam and exercising those gross motor muscles. By Anne Raver.

KINGS FALL TO PANTHERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SUNRISE, Fla. _ Less than two minutes from their best start in
more than a decade, the Los Angeles Kings suddenly looked as though
they were skating on 10 years of bad ice.
</P>
<P>
   They were leading, they were happy and they were heading to
Tampa when their season's improbable start was shattered Wednesday
night.
</P>
<P>
   In a span of one minutes and 15 seconds, the Florida Panthers
scored the fastest three goals in franchise history to give the
Kings a painful 4-2 loss at National Car Rental Center.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of opening the season with three road victories, and
three victories of any kind for the first time the 1988-89 season,
the Kings learned this year will be much tougher than its feel-good
first week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good teams win these games,'' captain Rob Blake said. ``We're
getting better, but we're not there yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Now they have to turn around and play the Lightning tonight in
the fourth game of the Kings season-opening, seven-game road trip,
hoping they don't bring the Panthers with them.
</P>
<P>
   ``For 58 minutes it might have been our best game,'' said goalie
Stephane Fiset, who faced just 22 shots. ``Then we had a breakdown.
It's hard to explain. I was there and I'm not sure what happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Blake was on the ice for the first goal, stopping Panthers
superstar Pavel Bure from picking up speed near center ice. But
Bure got the puck to Ray Whitney who raced up ice then slipped a
pass through Kings defenseman Mattias Norstrom.
</P>
<P>
   Viktor Kozlov was waiting and he beat Fiset to tie the game.
</P>
<P>
   Rookie coach Andy Murray thought about calling a timeout, but
when the crowd started throwing hats and fish on the ice, he
thought he could rally his troops.
</P>
<P>
   He told them to play for the tie, which under new rules gives a
team a point even if they lose in overtime.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll take a point on the road anytime,'' Murray said. ``I told
them during the timeout that if anyone had told us in training camp
that we had a chance to get two wins and a tie in the first three
games I would have taken it.''
</P>
<P>
   That theory crumbled 20 seconds later when Bret Hedican stopped
the puck at the Kings blue line and fired into a crowd at Fiset.
Mark Parrish redirected Hedican's shot past Fiset and suddenly the
sure victory was gone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two minutes left, you've got to win this game,'' Murray said.
``We frustrated them all period. They only got three chances. Our
system was working. If there ever was a time to say hockey is a 60
minute game this is it.''
</P>
<P>
   Until the end, the Kings were impressive, outplaying a more
talented opponent away from home.
</P>
<P>
   Early in the second period, Luc Robitaille tied the game with
his third goal of the season, on a pass in front from Blake after
some fancy stick work by center Jozef Stumpel.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings took a 2-1 lead in the opening minutes of the third
period when Ziggy Palffy batted down a shot in front of Panthers'
goalie Trevor Kidd for his second goal of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were playing in a style with more enthusiasm,'' Panthers
coach Terry Murray said of the Kings. ``After it was 2-1 they were
playing their system and really frustrating us.''
</P>
<P>
   But when it was over some lingering questions started to
surface. Although they got six shots on goal against Florida, the
Kings second line of Glen Murray, Bryan Smolinski and Donald
Audette, still have not scored this season. Audette entered the
game with 13 career goals against the Panthers.
</P>
<P>
   The defense, which shut down Bure all night, broke down at the
end. Parrish's goal came after the Kings had won a face off. They
couldn't control the puck, which popped out to Hedican at the
point.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one of those games that can come back to get you at
the end of the season,'' said Fiset. ``We can't lose this kind of
game. In a way its good we play (Tampa) right away. You don't want
to think about this one too long.''

NEW YORK _ Arizona, Arkan sas, what's the difference?
<TEXT>
<P>
   As every Mets fan'll tell ya, they're both miles from the Center
of the Universe, which we all know stretches roughly from Verrazano
Narrows to Hastings-on-Hudson.
</P>
<P>
   So we should forgive Brad Schrader, 47, a savvy corporate
investor and civil engineer from Chatham, N.J., for his tortured
stab at being modest about the Mets: `Anything can happen with
those guys. They've had flashes of bril liance before, and it'll be
amazing if they get past the Razorbacks.''
</P>
<P>
   We yokels west of the Jersey Turnpike know, of course, that he
meant the Diamondbacks, not some well-known Arkansas college team.
We also assume he knows a snake from a pig. But by and large, those
are the sort of insightful comments lobbed at the Diamondbacks by
New Yorkers everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you've got a swimming pool in your stadium, you're crazy,''
Brian Doughney, 27, a stockbroker from Queens, announced from his
perch at the ESPN Zone, a mega-sports bar at Times Square. ``We're
not some frilly-frally luxury kind of place. We're not there for
vacation. We've got ballplayers, and we're there to win. How can
you have a swimming pool in your ballpark?''
</P>
<P>
   The Big Apple's press is equally a-dither over Arizona's
laid-back lifestyle and its luxurious baseball digs, while the
average Mets fan is living 43 years in the past with talk about an
all-NYC World Series. (For Arizonans who might not know it, the New
York Yankees are the city's other baseball team, and they're also
in the World Series chase).
</P>
<P>
   Do any of them give Arizona a chance in the National League
playoffs? Fagetaboudit! They're not even sure where it is on the
map.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're talking about the Arizona Razorbacks, right?'' said
Blair How ell, 36, assistant conductor for Amtrak's
Washington-to-New York Metroliner. All Howell knows about Arizona
is, ``It's dry, and there's a lot of gun-totin' kind of people out
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Mike Jaycock, 53, a Pennsylvanian, ``Yeah, I hear women
take semiautomatic rifles to the grocery store out there.''
</P>
<P>
   He must have been reading Ari zona's press clippings. One New
York Daily News columnist de scribed Phoenix as ``Boca Raton with
cactus and Gila monsters,'' and suggested Mayor Skip Rimsza was a
rube.
</P>
<P>
   To make matters worse, a New York Post headline dubbed Arizo
na's Big Unit ``small potatoes.'' Not everyone was so hard on the
D-Backs, though.
</P>
<P>
   ``You gotta give them credit,'' said Joel Schindler, 48, a
marketing research executive. `They went out and bought a good ball
team.'' In a moment of unbridled honesty, he added, `If you're a
Mets fan, you never have any expectations.''
</P>
<P>
   Irishman Pat McAuliffe, 41, of Long Island, said the Mets ``got
their chest puffed up pretty good now that they beat Randy
Johnson.'' But he hasn't forgotten their skids this season, and he
isn't willing to buy Series tickets just yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mets fans know enough not to take any team lightly, after they
way they've played,'' McAuliffe said. ``They showed us not to be
over confident.''
</P>
<P>
   The lessons were lost on Ronald Joseph, 24, of Brooklyn, who was
asked about Arizona's chances while hanging out at Manhattan's All
Star Cafe.
</P>
<P>
   `They're going down _ there's no ifs, ands or buts about it,''
Joseph said.
</P>
<P>
   Cafe worker Cliff Cadet, 23, of Queens, said, ``Even Yankee fans
would like to the Mets go all the way this year.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's gonna be a Subway Series,'' stockbroker Paul Amerigo, 35,
pre dicted. ``The Diamondbacks are just standing in their way _ and
just for a minute.''
</P>
<P>
   The trash talkin' doesn't stop with the teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure Arizona is a nice place, but as far as sports are
concerned, they don't know very much there,'' said Kevin Chambers,
24, a New York City accountant.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Schoniedeberg, 29, a New Jersey native who's lived in
Arizona for six months, complained about Bank One Ballpark and its
fans as he prepared to watch the game at BOB on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stadium is a little too comfortable,'' he said. ``It's
like sitting in an easy chair in your living room. People cheer
louder for the mustard, ketchup and relish race (on the stadium
screen) than they do for their own player's home run that ties up
the game. They come here to eat, and then they leave here in the
sixth inning.''
</P>
<P>
   Rob Segreto, 26, of Long Island said Diamondbackers ``are
spoiled for what they have.''
</P>
<P>
   Brent Congdon, 29, of Chester, N.J., who showed up at BOB even
though he's a Yankees fan, chided the genial ``country club'' atmos
phere.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is nothing like the Bronx,'' Congdon said (in the
understate ment of the night). ``If you went to the bleachers in
any other garb but Yankees, you'd be hassled and probably have to
leave.''
</P>
<P>
   Diamondbacks fan Tom Gammill, 53, of Prescott took all this
Gotham City nonsense with a grain of salt.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got the best stadium,'' he said. ``They're just
jealous.'' Republic writer Alicia A. Caldwell contributed to this
article.

L.A. LOSES NFL BID TO HOUSTON
</HEADLINE>
 (SLANG -- Attn. Sports) 
By STEVE DILBECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The NFL may want to return to Los Angeles, but
Wednesday morning they embraced something even closer to their
hearts _ money.
</P>
<P>
   NFL owners put their arms around a $700 million winning
expansion bid from Houston, finally granting the 32nd franchise and
leaving Los Angeles scrambling to decide what its next move would
be.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all about money at the end of the day, and I didn't
believe it would be,'' said Michael Ovitz. ``I thought it would
also be about location. But it's their league, they can do what
they want. We did what we could.''
</P>
<P>
   Ovitz and Ron Burkle bid $550 million, with $150 million to be
repaid through future revenues. Ed Roski Jr. and Eli Broad bid $500
million.
</P>
<P>
   Both were respectable offers and in the vicinity of the $530
million Cleveland paid for its expansion franchise last year, but
all dwarfed by Bob McNair's bid for Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``You put the money on the table, and you get the votes,'' Broad
said. ``It was just an offer the league couldn't refuse. In the
final analysis, it came down to price.''
</P>
<P>
   It made for a persuasive argument. The league expansion
committee voted unanimously to support the Houston bid in the
morning, and barely an hour later, the full membership had voted
29-0 with two abstensions to award the franchise to Houston and
realign the league into eight, four-team divisions when the team
begins play in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Commissioner Paul Taglibue said there had been some committee
support on Tuesday night to wait another month before taking action
_ giving Ovitz-Burkle more time to work out their belated move to
Hollywood Park and Roski-Broad more to demonstrate their added
political support _ but by Wednesday morning, $700 million looked
like all they needed to consider.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew we had to differentiate ourselves,'' McNair said.
``That was what we were attempting to do. We wanted to do something
so outstanding that we would break through this period of
indecision, so that it would be clear to everyone it was a superior
proposal.''
</P>
<P>
   The defeat was bitter for the L.A. groups, and it left them
uncertain how to proceed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really disappointed,'' Roski said. ``We put a lot of
effort and a lot of time into it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to continue to pursue NFL football in Los Angeles
at the Coliseum. We're going to have to start from scratch, because
we have not pursued that option before.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That option'' would be having an existing team relocate to Los
Angeles. Coliseum general manager Pat Lynch said L.A.'s NFL
proponents will need time to gather themselves after a frustrating
end to their long expansion saga.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been years and years of hard effort,'' Lynch said.
``We're seriously disappointed. We believed we are the stadium for
Los Angeles and the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now it's time to just catch our breath, sort out where things
are, watch what plays out in Houston. They still have a lot of work
to do. And start to plan a new future.''
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles is now in its fifth year without an NFL team, and
counting. The NFL has no other plans to expand, and Los Angeles'
hope of the league returning now rests with a team relocating.
</P>
<P>
   Roski said he would work to attract an owner to the Coliseum and
would be willing to take a minority role to return the NFL to Los
Angeles. Broad said he would also aid in the effort, but if he was
required to invest, would likely want control.
</P>
<P>
   Ovitz said last week he expected to return from Atlanta with the
expansion team, and still seemed stunned Houston had won the day
after returning to Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very optimistic going in,'' he said. ``I had high hopes
and am very disappointed. I really thought we would come back with
the expansion franchise and Houston would get a relocated team.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made them a very attractive offer. I can't compete with a
$300 million overbid.''
</P>
<P>
   Ovitz holds an option to purchase the nearly 100 acres at
Hollywood Park across from the Forum, but it expires on Friday.
It's doubtful Ovitz would want to purchase the property for $55
million and hold the non-revenue site in hopes of working out a
deal with another owner, but Ovitz said he had yet to decide.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me tell you after a couple of full nights' sleep,'' he
said. ``I don't like to lose.''
</P>
<P>
   Houston's $260 million in public funding for a retractable-roof
stadium gave McNair a major edge. If the stadium comes in at $350
million and they are as successful at selling PSLs as anticipated,
McNair and his investors will have to take on almost no doubt for
the stadium construction.
</P>
<P>
   But Los Angeles' inability to generate public funding to support
stadium construction doesn't figure to end here. Any existing owner
now eyeing the L.A. market will likely be met with the same
hurdles.
</P>
<P>
   Other sites remain possibilities in Southern California, but all
with their drawbacks. Carson, Anaheim and Dodger Stadium have all
been considered by the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL had lobbied for added parking at the Coliseum and
demanded _ and maybe expected _ public assistance that never came.
Ovitz said it proved a learning experience for the league.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't match Houston's offer without public financing, and
in L.A. you're not going to get public support,'' Ovitz said.
``They (NFL) are not going to get it. They know that now. Paul told
me the miscalculated.''
</P>
<P>
   Tagliabue said the league still wanted to be in the nation's
second largest market, but had not developed a plan should Los
Angeles fail to win the expansion team.
</P>
<P>
   He said the league's current focus was to aid teams in older
stadiums to get state-of-the art stadiums in their existing cities,
not in relocating.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now we're in the business of keeping teams where they
are, committing them to their current fan bases, and getting
stadiums built in our existing markets,'' Tagliabue said.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Tagliabue also downplayed the significance of
Houston's $700 million bid, instead claiming it won the owners over
because of superior stadium design, organizational plans, fan base
and ownership. He said even if one of the L.A. groups had come in
at $600 million, it might not have been enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one thing that was clear, we were not just making a
decision based upon a price,'' he said. ``We were making a decision
based upon price, the quality in terms of the stadium, the
franchise operation and ownership.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we would have had different prices in Los Angeles and fewer
uncertainties in terms of where we are to get a state-of-the-art
stadium built, I'm sure we would have had more discussion. But
that's all speculative.''
</P>
<P>
   Ovitz had gambled that McNair's offer would come in $100 million
less, a gamble he lost badly.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expected them to come in a $600 million, and then we'd
close the gap,'' he said. ``It didn't work out that way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was told we would not have to equal their bid. But I mean,
$700 million?''

UNHAPPY TEAMS CAN NOW TARGET L.A.
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STEVE DILBECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Now that Los Angeles knows who's not coming to its NFL
party, is it time to expect a former invitee back?
</P>
<P>
   The Raiders are still under the control of Al Davis, who as
ever, is unhappy with his stadium situation, and as ever, is mired
in multiple lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   With Houston capturing the NFL's new expansion franchise
Wednesday, Los Angeles now becomes the desired site of every team
currently unhappy with its stadium situation.
</P>
<P>
   Or at least every team looking for leverage to squeeze out a new
stadium deal.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona, Minnesota, New Orleans, Buffalo, San Francisco and
Oakland are all NFL teams lusting for new $400-million, luxury-box
lined stadiums.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona is the only NFL team that plays in a college stadium
(Arizona State). The Cardinals had a new stadium plan voted down
last year by a populace that's grown weary of publicly supporting
the financing of the new ballpark for the Diamondbacks, the arena
for the Suns and several new spring training stadiums.
</P>
<P>
   Davis, though, could be at the center of any new movement in Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Davis is currently suing the NFL over territorial rights to the
Los Angeles market he left after the 1994 season, when he fled back
to Oakland after the league wanted to put an NFC expansion team to
share his planned stadium at Hollywood Park.
</P>
<P>
   Oakland and Alameda County, which owns the Oakland Coliseum, got
tired of Davis _ embittered over the failure to sell luxury box
suites and Personal Seat Licenses _ threatening to break his lease
and abandon the city. They've sued to validate his lease. It has 12
years remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Davis responded by _ countersuing and asking that the lease be
voided. The lawsuit is expected to reach trial early next year.
</P>
<P>
   But with Davis seeming to want out of Oakland _ two weeks ago he
was talking about how Chicago could support two NFL teams _ it
seems too logical to some that he not fill the void in Los Angeles,
even if he did help create it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, I think that's a good possibility,'' said Cowboys owner
Jerry Jones. ``That could take care of a lot of problems. That
could work out well for the league.''
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles, however, has a lot of bad memories of Davis' first
venture into Southern California, and few are eager for his return.
When Councilman Nate Holden talked of trying to bring the Raiders
back early last year, the city almost went into shock.
</P>
<P>
   City officials scampered to assure Oakland it wanted no part of
Davis.
</P>
<P>
   ``He treated Los Angeles shabbily, atrociously,'' Mayor Richard
Riordan said at the time. ``He's treated Oakland atrociously. Do we
want to give him another chance? We'd have to be pure masochists to
have him back.''
</P>
<P>
   When Marvin Davis bowed out of Hollywood Park last week, Davis
reportedly made several calls to inquire about picking up the
option that ultimately was given to Ron Burkle and Michael Ovitz.
</P>
<P>
   Al Davis voted to approve the $700 million sale of the 32nd
expansion franchise to Houston on Wednesday, but afterward would
not discuss the NFL's future in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just don't think it would be appropriate for me to comment
right now,'' Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL was in control of the Los Angeles movement when it was
lobbying for an expansion franchise. But David Carter, who teaches
the business of sports at USC and owns a Los Angeles sports
marketing company, said Los Angeles may gain control with a team
trying to relocate.
</P>
<P>
   ``The NFL wanted to maintain control over the Los Angeles
market,'' Carter said. ``Any team that relocates here means they
will have less control over the venue, less control of the
ownership group and no way to make money off the deal as they would
have through expansion. And, you can expect lawsuits that will sour
everybody and turn out to be ugly.''
</P>
<P>
   Pat Lynch, general manager of the Coliseum, said the negotiating
process would probably be easier with a single owner.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll find that out now,'' Lynch said. ``We've proven to
ourselves we have (major renovation) plans that will work. When
you're trying to convince one party, it's a helluva lot easier than
trying to convince 31 parties.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the Raiders and Cardinals, Minnesota and New
Orleans play in bad domed stadiums, Buffalo is in an old and dated
stadium and San Francisco has had its new stadium plans squashed by
scandal. Few doubt, however, that someone will try to move to Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no doubt Los Angeles will have an NFL team soon,''
Jones said. ``The NFL needs to find a way to return to Los Angeles.
As sure as I'm in the NFL, there will be a team in the NFL soon.''
</P>
<P>
   Coliseum Commission President Sheldon Sloan said he was
disappointed, but remained prepared to open talks with the NFL
about bringing football back to the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still believe Southern California is a strategically
important market for professional football, and that the Coliseum
remains the best location and facility for an NFL team in this
region,'' Sloan said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing that happened today changes the fundamental truth that
the Coliseum remains the best choice for the future location of an
NFL franchise in Los Angeles.''

L.A. LOSES NFL BID TO HOUSTON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Fixing slug)

 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The NFL may want to return to Los Angeles, but
Wednesday morning they embraced something even closer to their
hearts _ money.
</P>
<P>
   NFL owners put their arms around a $700 million winning
expansion bid from Houston, finally granting the 32nd franchise and
leaving Los Angeles scrambling to decide what its next move would
be.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all about money at the end of the day, and I didn't
believe it would be,'' said Michael Ovitz. ``I thought it would
also be about location. But it's their league, they can do what
they want. We did what we could.''
</P>
<P>
   Ovitz and Ron Burkle bid $550 million, with $150 million to be
repaid through future revenues. Ed Roski Jr. and Eli Broad bid $500
million.
</P>
<P>
   Both were respectable offers and in the vicinity of the $530
million Cleveland paid for its expansion franchise last year, but
all dwarfed by Bob McNair's bid for Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``You put the money on the table, and you get the votes,'' Broad
said. ``It was just an offer the league couldn't refuse. In the
final analysis, it came down to price.''
</P>
<P>
   It made for a persuasive argument. The league expansion
committee voted unanimously to support the Houston bid in the
morning, and barely an hour later, the full membership had voted
29-0 with two abstensions to award the franchise to Houston and
realign the league into eight, four-team divisions when the team
begins play in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Commissioner Paul Taglibue said there had been some committee
support on Tuesday night to wait another month before taking action
_ giving Ovitz-Burkle more time to work out their belated move to
Hollywood Park and Roski-Broad more to demonstrate their added
political support _ but by Wednesday morning, $700 million looked
like all they needed to consider.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew we had to differentiate ourselves,'' McNair said.
``That was what we were attempting to do. We wanted to do something
so outstanding that we would break through this period of
indecision, so that it would be clear to everyone it was a superior
proposal.''
</P>
<P>
   The defeat was bitter for the L.A. groups, and it left them
uncertain how to proceed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really disappointed,'' Roski said. ``We put a lot of

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN McCLAIN  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
ATLANTA _ When they awarded the 32nd franchise to Houston on
Wednesday, NFL owners also passed a resolution to realign for the
2002 season when Bob McNair's team begins play.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The league will realign into eight divisions of four teams each.
There will still be an AFC and NFC, and the same number of teams
(12) will make the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could be in for a big fight on realignment,'' said
Buffalo's Ralph Wilson, an original American Football League owner.
``Agreeing on realignment might be tougher than deciding to expand
to Houston or Los Angeles.''
</P>
<P>
   The owners will try to formulate and approve a plan that
appeases as many of them as possible. All McNair knows is that his
team will play in the AFC. Houston could be placed in the AFC
Central or, more than likely, in a new division that might be
called the AFC South.
</P>
<P>
   After the expansion committee recommended Houston by a 14-0 vote
Wednesday, 31 owners or their representatives spent more time in a
two-hour meeting discussing realignment rather than McNair's $700
million offer.
</P>
<P>
   One owner said the Houston vote was such a sure thing, it had
become a formality and that realignment was the hot topic that is
sure to get hotter as the NFL gets closer to 2001 and when it will
need to realign.
</P>
<P>
   After the league realigns, one proposal will be made to change
the scheduling format to take advantage of natural rivalries such
as Dallas/Houston, Miami/Tampa, San Francisco/Oakland, Giants/Jets
and Jacksonville/Carolina. Under that format, natural rivals would
play a home-and-home series every season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to do everything we can to have the Cowboys and
Houston competing annually,'' Cowboys owner Jerry Jones said.
``What a good thing that would be for the fans as well as the
NFL.''
</P>
<P>
   The owners also want to preserve traditional rivalries like
Dallas/Washington, Green Bay/Minn-esota, Pittsburgh/Cleveland,
Oakland/Kansas City, Chicago/Detroit and New Orleans/Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The owners have discussed expansion at almost every meeting for
years, but they haven't been in a situation like this in which they
passed the resolution to realign. Now they have to get serious.
</P>
<P>
   The owners don't want to ask more than a couple of teams to
switch conferences. They do want to get New Orleans, Carolina and
Atlanta out of the NFC West. They also know they may have to pay
millions to persuade some owners to switch conferences or
divisions.
</P>
<P>
   One owner suggested that a team without a natural or traditional
rival should be made to switch conferences. He used Tennessee as an
example.
</P>
<P>
   One NFL executive said that everyone can speculate about changes
in divisions, but no one has come close to making a proposal that
satisfies all of the owners.
</P>
<P>
   Some plans make sense. Let's present a plan in the NFC that
looks like this:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; NFC East:  &LR; Dallas, Washington, Philadelphia and the New York
Giants.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; NFC Central:  &LR; Green Bay, Chicago, Minnesota and Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; NFC West:  &LR; San Francisco, St. Louis, Arizona and Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; NFC South:  &LR; New Orleans, Atlanta, Tampa Bay, Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   In this plan, there are two problems. Seattle would have to
switch to the NFC, and Arizona would have to leave the NFC East.
Seahawks owner Paul Allen, who never attends an NFL meeting, will
have a new stadium and might be open to the possibility. Cardinals
owner Bill Bidwill is expected to put up a fight because he doesn't
want to leave his division and a guaranteed sellout for the Dallas
game each year.
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis would have to remain in the NFC West, but the Rams
wouldn't protest.
</P>
<P>
   The newly created NFC South would keep the Saints and Falcons
together, add the Panthers and give the Buccaneers an easier
schedule, at least based on perennial records.
</P>
<P>
   Now, let's look at an AFC plan:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; AFC East:  &LR; Miami, New England, Buffalo and the New York Jets.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; AFC Central:  &LR; Pittsburgh, Cleveland, Cincinnati, Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; AFC West:  &LR; Denver, San Diego, Oakland, Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; AFC South:  &LR; Houston, Tennessee, Jacksonville, Indianapolis.
</P>
<P>
   There are a few questions in the AFC but none that would be as
difficult as trying to get Bidwill to leave the NFC East.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, Houston fans might want their new team to return
to the AFC Central in place of Baltimore or Cincinnati. Don't
expect it to happen. Ravens owner Art Modell and Bengals owner Mike
Brown have been in the NFL for decades, and their partners aren't
going to vote for McNair over them, even if McNair did pay a $700
million entry fee.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, the newly created AFC South would be interesting. Colts
quarterback Peyton Manning would be entering his fifth season.
There is no reason to believe the Jaguars wouldn't remain an elite
team as they have been since 1996, their second season of
existence.
</P>
<P>
   And, perhaps best of all, Houston and Tennessee would play every
season. Now that could become quite a rivalry.

<P>
   Unlike Modell, who has vowed to never return to Cleveland
because he fears for his life, Titans owner Bud Adams would have
the courage to attend games in Houston's new stadium.

PINCAY 40 SHORT OF SHOEMAKER
</HEADLINE>

 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARCADIA, Calif. _ Jockey Laffit Pincay Jr. entered the week 40
wins from tying Bill Shoemaker's all-time record.
</P>
<P>
   Shoemaker's record is 8,833. Pincay entered Wednesday with
8,793. He won Saturday aboard Golden Tassel at 4-1.
</P>
<P>
   He is scheduled to ride four mounts today.
</P>
<P>
   Oak Tree leaders: Entering the week, David Flores leads all
jockeys with seven wins at Oak Tree. Gary Stevens is second through
Sunday with five wins. Stevens in the money percentage is an
impressive 59 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Flores won the riding crown at Del Mar with 38 wins from 208
starts.
</P>
<P>
   Vladimir Cerin leads all trainers with a remarkable four wins in
10 starts. Cerin had just eight wins in 43 starts at Del Mar.
</P>
<P>
   Scott joins fair circuit: If you are looking for jockey Joy
Scott, she's moved on _ for now.
</P>
<P>
   A longtime fixture on the Southern California thoroughbred
horseracing scene, Scott is currently on the fair circuit. She had
two mounts at Fresno on Wednesday, Creates in the seventh and
Pouring Down Rain in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome back: Gary Stevens may be wishing he was back in merry
olde England. The jockey, who returned here after leaving for Great
Britain last spring, got nailed with a five-day suspension this
week.
</P>
<P>
   The suspension was leveled on Stevens on Tuesday for his ride
aboard Wealth of Nations in Saturday's fifth race.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens moved Wealth of Nations to the outside for a clear path
but instead caused several horses to bump one another.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens, who finished sixth in the race, is suspended through
Sunday. He will be allowed to ride in designated races.

   &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
ATLANTA _ On the downside, we lost five seasons worth of cheers _
surely a few jeers, too _ and a nickname most people loved, some
negative connotations notwithstanding. We also lost Steve McNair
and Eddie George in the prime of their careers.
</P>
<P>
   Also, getting a new NFL team is going to cost the community
roughly $50 million more than keeping the old team.
</P>
<P>
   The upside? No more Bud-bashing. No more Columbia blue. A new
stadium that Steve Patterson, Bob McNair's point man, promises will
be ``the finest on the planet.'' Plus, of course, McNair himself, a
prince of a fellow who will surely at some point in constructing
his new franchise will make a mistake _ something, amazingly, he
hasn't done yet.
</P>
<P>
   And don't forget a Super Bowl _ perhaps XXXVIII in 2004 _ with
its estimated $450 million impact on the local economy.
</P>
<P>
   Bud Adams never fielded an NFL champion in all the years the
Oilers represented Houston. That failure was not necessarily his
fault, but the buck stopped with him. And his image in the
community, combined with the Oilers' travails on the field, created
an environment ultimately so poisoned that his departure to
Nashville's greener pastures became inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   And, it must be said, beneficial, as of Wednesday morning's
decision to pass on Los Angeles' squabbling, disorganized,
underfunded factions and award McNair the NFL's 32nd franchise, not
to mention the aforementioned Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   It was a no-brainer, to say the least. McNair's willingness to
part with the staggering sum of $700 million and a stadium to end
all retractable-roof, real-grass stadiums was tantamount to a
roundhouse right to the bridge of LA's nose.
</P>
<P>
   Even Bud, whatever anger and hurt he may feel for how Houston _
in his mind, anyway _ wronged him, knew what had to be done. Adams,
who still lives and works among us, supported McNair both in the
expansion committee vote and in the general vote by all the owners,
none of whom could say ``nay'' to a man who clearly deserved to
join their, ahem, august fraternity.
</P>
<P>
   Hey, money talks, Ovitz walks. Broad and Roski, too.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles blew a bigger lead than the Oilers did in Buffalo by
failing to secure public funding on any front and never reaching a
consensus on a suitable venue. Michael Ovitz, Eli Broad and Ed
Roski were the Three Stooges incarnate, squabbling and ducking the
core issues right up to the very end. As badly as the NFL wanted to
reclaim the nation's No. 2 TV market, it couldn't crunch the
numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Not with McNair sitting there, a bird, a veritable peacock, in
hand.
</P>
<P>
   McNair sold his energy company, Cogen Technologies, to raise
capital for his football venture. He worked his tail off to close
the massive and complicated deal, finally staying up almost all
night Tuesday fine-tuning the most minute details before the
expansion committee reconvened at 7 a.m. Houston time Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``And now,'' he conceded, ``comes the hard part.''
</P>
<P>
   First, McNair needs a sales/marketing department to begin
pushing luxury boxes. Seventy-five of the planned-for 110, at an
average price of $145,000, must be sold by mid-January. Otherwise,
McNair will be in violation of his freshly signed agreement with
the NFL and, as Patterson said, ``We don't want to get off on the
wrong foot.''
</P>
<P>
   A nickname and team colors also are a high priority because they
identify the product to the fans. You will, by the way, help him
choose the former, if not necessarily the latter, which figure to
include some shade of green.
</P>
<P>
   Bob is Irish, after all.
</P>
<P>
   Stadium construction is a super-high priority as well. It must
begin as soon as the rodeo ends in February to be ready for the
2002 season, and there will surely be cost issues to confront. The
$310 million price tag was set 18 months ago, and you know how
those things go. Somebody, be it McNair or the Harris
County-Houston Sports Authority, the city and/or the county, will
have to sign off on covering the anticipated overruns.
</P>
<P>
   It behooves all parties, however, to join hands and maintain a
united front. McNair must get the utmost cooperation from every
government entity in reciprocation for his remarkable efforts, for
which we lack a sufficient variety of laudatory adjectives.
</P>
<P>
   If sports matter, and they seem to, no grander civic gesture has
ever been made on Houston's behalf. While one might argue Bob's
immense fortune could be better spent on more noble causes, that's
hardly the point. McNair made himself a billionaire fairly and
squarely, and he has every right to choose how he spends his money.
</P>
<P>
   He won't profit hugely from this investment. He may not profit
at all for many years. But the city will, and for this he deserves
a thank-you from the bottom of our hearts.
</P>
<P>
   Adams, too, actually. If Bud hadn't left, the story couldn't
have had such a happy ending.

IF THERE'S MONEY TO BURN, LET IT BURN IN HOUSTON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Football fans in Houston will be talking about
Wednesday's big win for years. Between bites at the Goode Company
BBQ and the Cadillac Cafe they'll get giddy recounting how, in the
first month of overtime in the Expansion Bowl between Houston and
L.A., Bob McNair caught Michael Ovitz flat-footed with his Hail
Mary pass to the NFL owners.
</P>
<P>
   He threw them $700 million, McNair did, after maneuvering
Houston into position on the strength of a $195 million pledge of
public monies for a $310 million stadium, $9 million in city funds
for a parking lot and a new $300 million rail line.
</P>
<P>
   By today's gold standards, it was a textbook-perfect drive. To
those with the spoils goes the victory. We in L.A. applaud McNair's
effort and execution.
</P>
<P>
   Congratulations, Houston. The NFL is your problem.
</P>
<P>
   Better you than us.
</P>
<P>
   Bringing pro football back to Houston was such a priority,
McNair bid $170 million over the sale price of the expansion
franchise in Cleveland, which began play this season. For that kind
of outlay, Houston should get a football team and also have its
overtaxed thoroughfares swept of traffic and its summers siphoned
of humidity.
</P>
<P>
   Ovitz's last-minute drive came up a few hundred million dollars
short. He's so vain, he probably thinks Angelenos feel his pain.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is, Wednesday's slap in the face hurts Ovitz a lot
more than it does L.A.
</P>
<P>
   Our Sundays aren't going to be wasted on the NFL's diluted
product and neither are our tax dollars. It's all good for us.
</P>
<P>
   Let Ovitz grow his ego at somebody else's expense. That's all
the NFL is to its billionaire owners: an anabolic steroid for their
egos.
</P>
<P>
   L.A. already flexes a mean muscle in sports, entertainment and
industry. The city doesn't need a boost, it doesn't need any more
megalomaniacs masquerading as civic boosters.
</P>
<P>
   If L.A. needs anything, it's for its denizens to make like
Denver linebacker Bill Romanowski and spit on the next person who
tries to wed us to the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   It's insulting for Angelenos to be told we need the NFL to
complete us. Yeah, right. That's why a recently published U.S.
travel guide devoted 23 pages to L.A. attractions.
</P>
<P>
   Houston's charms were summed up in five pages and if that
doesn't sufficiently explain why the city was desperate to
re-acquire an NFL team, there's this: one of the points of interest
is the American Funeral Service Museum.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, Houston's victory does not mean the NFL is dead in L.A. To
the contrary, somebody somewhere _ maybe in Minneapolis, perhaps in
Phoenix _ will look at L.A. and next thing we know he'll be
flirting with us shamelessly.
</P>
<P>
   Owners will want to dance with us, if for no other reason than
to make their jealous cities collapse in a heap of costly
concessions. L.A. has been a willing partner in these tawdry
affairs before, charming the Dodgers out of Brooklyn, the Lakers
out of Minneapolis and the Clippers out of San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   That was before we lost both our NFL teams to sweet-talking
cities. L.A. is wiser and warier for having gotten trampled by its
own stiletto heels. We are less inclined to give our hearts, our
souls and our discretionary income to a league that exudes all the
emotional warm of a steel bank vault.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL, so unaccustomed to rejection, probably will try to spin
the story so L.A. comes out looking like a ditzy, glitzy city that
just couldn't get its act together. That's OK. To live in L.A. is
to know we have never been more level-headed.

IF HE COULD DO IT OVER ...
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SUNRISE, Fla. _ Mattias Norstrom stood between Ray Whitney and
the end of the Los Angeles Kings winning streak.
</P>
<P>
   The club's top defensive defenseman had helped limit Florida to
just three shots in the third period Wednesday night, but he was
defenseless when caught between Whitney and Viktor Kozlov on the
Panthers' 2-1 break with 1:51 left. Whitney slipped the pass past
Norstrom and Kozlov beat goalie Stephane Fiset for the tying goal.
</P>
<P>
   The Panthers wound up winning 4-2.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Andy Murray said there was little Norstrom could have
done, but Norstrom was clearly upset. He didn't feel tired after
missing all of training camp in a contract dispute, but couldn't
help but wonder if he could have done more.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if I could have been in better game shape,'' said
Norstrom, who signed a four-year deal last Thursday. ``I know we
played well for 58 minutes, but right now I wish I had stopped that
puck. We just broke down at the end.''
</P>
<P>
   Second fiddle: Overlooked in season-opening victories at
Nashville and St. Louis, the Kings' second line of Donald Audette,
Bryan Smolinski and Glen Murray did not score for the third
consecutive game.
</P>
<P>
   Defenseman Rob Blake is the only player besides Luc Robitaille,
Ziggy Palffy and Jozef Stumpel to score for the Kings.
</P>
<P>
   But Murray was encouraged that the second line got plenty of
chances Wednesday. That did not happen in the first two games.
Audette, who has 13 career goals against the Panthers, got just one
first-period shot. Smolinski had three and Murray two.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're obviously looking for more balance,'' Murray said. ``The
first line has come together great, but the second line had some
chances tonight. They'll get theirs.''
</P>
<P>
   McKenna out: Steve McKenna, a left-winger on the Kings fourth
line, will undergo laser surgery today to repair a partially torn
retina in his left eye suffered Monday night in St. Louis. He is
expected to miss one to two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   McKenna, who missed 56 games last season with an abdominal
injury, returned to Los Angeles on Wednesday morning for an
examination by team eye doctor Howard Lazerson.
</P>
<P>
   McKenna, 26, was struck on the left cheekbone by the butt of
Ricard Persson's stick in the second period and quickly rushed off
the ice. He received five stitches and did not return.

NO L.A. TEAM GOOD FOR TV VIEWERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MARLA MATZER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Los Angeles might have lost its bid for an
expansion team to Houston on Wednesday, but fans who like to watch
football and the TV networks were winners.
</P>
<P>
   Quite simply, it means more football games with attractive
matchups for the networks to broadcast and profit from. If L.A. had
a team, for instance, CBS and Fox probably wouldn't be able to show
as many weekend doubleheaders as they do now. The networks would
lose, and so would viewers.
</P>
<P>
   It works this way: If a city has a home team, home games will
only be broadcast in that market if the game sells out at least 72
hours in advance. (Remember when Raiders playoff games were blacked
out.) Also, road games of the team are always favored for local
broadcast, no matter the quality of the teams. So unless your team
is very good and very popular, you may get the short end of the
stick as a TV viewer. (In other words, you get to watch your 4-10
team against another 4-10 team, while everybody else in the country
watches a couple of undefeated teams go at it.)
</P>
<P>
   Though advocates for pro football in Los Angeles seemed to think
television would want a team in L.A., representatives for the
networks _ who were skittish about speaking on the record _ claimed
not having a local team in the second biggest TV market in the
country isn't in itself a big drawback.
</P>
<P>
   ``So far this season, game ratings are up 30 percent on ESPN,''
said a spokesman for that network, ``so we feel the league overall
is performing fine as it is.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, L.A. is a desirable market,'' said executive at
another network. ``There's three times the viewers in L.A. But
there are a lot of ifs. A terrific rating in L.A. is better than a
terrific rating in Houston. But if the team doesn't sell out and
isn't that good, you're better off having those two factors in
Houston.''
</P>
<P>
   Anne Elliot, vice president of marketing communication for
Nielsen Media Research, agreed: ``Los Angeles is a larger market
... but it depends on the market getting behind a new team and
watching.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, ABC, ESPN, CBS and Fox committed to $17.6 billion in
contracts with the NFL for eight seasons, and many believe that the
networks will lose money on the deal. But pro football for the
networks is often a way to lure fans to their other shows. (You may
have noticed Fox's analyst John Madden touting the `` '70s Show''
during Sunday's Tampa Bay-Minnesota game.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Today's sport events are very valuable in promoting other
programming,'' said Leslie Anne Wade, CBS Sports vice president of
communication. ``It's changing universe in TV _ there are so many
options. Major sports events are one of the few things you can
count on. They still get good numbers. Young men as an audience are
harder and harder to reach _ they're attractive to advertisers and
harder to find.''
</P>
<P>
   Wade added that the ratings for football on CBS are up 18
percent, and ``it's rare for anything on network TV to go up that
much in a year.''
</P>
<P>
   There are those who think that the Houston decision isn't the
end of the line for L.A. football, including Madden. ``Houston got
the expansion team. But I think L.A. will get a relocated team. ...
I believe the owners really wanted to go to Los Angeles, and gave
(those proposing a Los Angeles expansion team) every opportunity to
get it together,'' Madden said, ``so I don't think this is the end.
But in order to make it work, the stadium issue has to be solved. A
stadium has to be built, or at least committed to.''

FAILED L.A. BID WAS `TORTURUOS EXPERIENCE`
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICK ORLOV  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The people trying to bring an expansion team to
Los Angeles were forced to play the NFL's game, and in the end came
out battered, bruised and on the losing end.
</P>
<P>
   When Houston was awarded the league's 32nd franchise over two
rival groups from L.A., it left disappointed feelings among those
who came up on the short end.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I got involved eight months ago, somebody told me it
would be a laborious, torturous experience,'' said billionaire Eli
Broad, who with partner Ed Roski Jr., tried to get a team at the
Coliseum. ``That was accurate.''
</P>
<P>
   Councilman Mark Ridley-Thomas, the chief proponent of the
Coliseum, agreed, saying, ``They put everyone through torture.
That's their game.''
</P>
<P>
   Broad said he and Roski had put up ``several million dollars''
in developing their proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Ovitz, the former superagent who teamed with grocery
magnate Ron Burkle, has said they spent millions on plans and land
options in trying to join the NFL club.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been a long, arduous ordeal,'' Ovitz said. ``I
started at the Coliseum, they asked me to go to Carson and I did,
they asked me to go back to the Coliseum and I did, then they asked
me to go to Hollywood Park. I've done everything they asked. I
played by their rules.''
</P>
<P>
   The rules, of course, kept changing. Roski and Broad thought
their bid started to slip away when they gave up their exclusive at
the Coliseum, leaving officials unsure of who to negotiate with and
further muddling an already confusing process.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you confuse a project like this, bouncing it around,
going to different locations and different individuals, it gives an
undue burden on a project that could be done fairly simple, if
approached differently,'' Roski said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether that made any difference at the end, I don't know. I
don't think given our restraints in California, in particular Los
Angeles, we could have matched the offer Houston made.''
</P>
<P>
   Some city officials said they resented the NFL's tactic of
pitting cities against each other to boost bids.
</P>
<P>
   ``The NFL absolutely, positively used Los Angeles to stage a
bidding war to the the $700 million from Houston,'' said councilman
Joel Wachs, a leader in opposing use of any tax money for
professional football.
</P>
<P>
   Jon Coupal of the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association said the
Houston choice was good news for Los Angeles taxpayers and
described the league as behaving ``like a burglar that keeps
circling the house hoping to find an unlocked window.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not about sports any more.'' said Wachs. ``This is
about money and how much money the NFL can squeeze out of a city.
You're not talking about even millionaires anymore. You're talking
about billionaires.''

EXPANSION VOTE A WIN-WIN-WIN DECISION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The morning after Houston got the nod, Los Angeles
awakens with bloodshot eyes, a pounding headache, a sour stomach
and the vaguest sense of melancholy.
</P>
<P>
   Too much champagne will do that to a town.
</P>
<P>
   Champagne? After losing the bid for the NFL's 32nd franchise by
a practically unanimous vote of the other club owners?
</P>
<P>
   Yes, champagne. Because _ congratulations _ Los Angeles had a
victory to celebrate Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   There are three winners at the end of this long, messy,
downright ridiculous process of selecting an NFL expansion city.
Everybody got what they wanted.
</P>
<P>
   Football-mad Houston is a winner because it gets to replace the
Oilers, gone to Tennessee in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The money-mad NFL is a winner because it gets a $700 million
franchise fee from Houston power-plant operator Bob McNair, a
record sum that raises the value of each existing team.
</P>
<P>
   And Los Angeles is a winner because it set its priorities and
stuck to them, a rare accomplishment anymore in the overlapping
worlds of pro sports and politics.
</P>
<P>
   We don't have a pro football team, but we have the deed to City
Hall. We don't have a pro football team, but we have pride in
knowing we'll get along fine without it.
</P>
<P>
   This might sound like sour grapes: City loses football team and
local columnist says, ``We didn't really want it anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   But that's not what I'm saying.
</P>
<P>
   A football team would have been nice. Good for Monday-morning
conversations at the fax machine. A rallying point for a
disconnected city.
</P>
<P>
   Don't fall for this notion that Los Angeles is not a pro
football town. It had the Rams for 49 years. They're still our most
enduring franchise. The Dodgers just finished their 42nd season
here. The Lakers are beginning their 40th.
</P>
<P>
   We gave up on the Rams and Raiders at the end not because we
dislike pro football but because they were bad teams being run into
the ground by front offices insensitive to the fans. Neither team
has posted a winning season since leaving.
</P>
<P>
   And don't believe the people of Los Angeles weren't dead set
against the return of pro football. It's just that not enough
people were dead set in favor.
</P>
<P>
   That meant insufficient support for spending tax money to build
a new stadium or refurbish the Coliseum. So we drew the line short
of giving public money to owners and players who didn't need our
charity. Then, like few cities, we resisted the temptation to step
over the line.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles is different in this regard from Houston, which is
putting $195 million in public money into a retractable-roof
stadium.
</P>
<P>
   We're pretty savvy about the business behind entertainment and
sports. We make movies, television and music here. We have eight
major pro franchises and two major sports universities. We've seen
teams come and go.
</P>
<P>
   We've seen the man behind the curtain. We know he's a man in a
pinstripe suit who might not have the best interests of the city at
heart.
</P>
<P>
   So when a guy like that wants to put a stadium and a team here,
most people's attitude is the same as when Walgreens plans to build
a drug store in the neighborhood. Fine, just don't expect me to
drive the crane and don't count on me shopping there.
</P>
<P>
   We could have broken our promise to ourselves and mailed our tax
checks to the NFL. By making the acquisition of a football team a
civic priority, we could have put in a unified bid and might have
succeeded.
</P>
<P>
   We knew the consequences if we refused the sugar-coated tax
plans: Instead of speaking to the NFL with one voice about one
proposed site, Los Angeles would be represented by rival
billionaires playing musical stadiums. We were a football team with
two head coaches, running two playbooks at once.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the league kept delaying a choice between cities, hoping
Los Angeles would cave in, embarrassed by the thought of losing out
to Houston.
</P>
<P>
   We didn't cave in. And messy as the process was, as it turned
out, we didn't lose.
</P>
<P>
   In the hard game of achieving public consensus, we won. Ugly,
but we won.
</P>
<P>
   So celebrate. Just leave some champagne for Houston.

UMPS MAKE CLOSE CALLS, AND BOTH GO DIAMONDBACKS' WAY 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ The tone of the second game of the division series
between the New York Mets and the Arizona Diamondbacks on Wednesday
night was set by two early plays that were thisclose. Each call
went the Diamondbacks' way, and that's why they made their way to
New York tied with the Mets at 1-1. The plays, however, easily
could have been called in the Mets' favor had the umpires been
watching television replays.
</P>
<P>
   Replays, however, are not a part of the umpires' lexicon. They
certainly are a major no-no after Frank Pulli, now a former
National League umpire, actually used a replay earlier this season
to determine whether a home run was a home run. Pulli, a veteran
umpire, who was rated among the league's top half dozen in a 1998
players' survey, was one of 22 umpires whose resignations were
accepted in a labor dispute, and his replay reprimand was seen as
an element in that decision.
</P>
<P>
   Leonard Coleman, the N.L. president, was seated in the second
row next to the Diamondbacks' dugout when Wally Bell and Dana
DeMuth made the close calls on Wednesday night, Bell at home plate,
DeMuth at second base. On the play at the plate, with two out in
the Arizona third inning, Bell called Matt Williams safe. On the
play at second base, with no one out in the Mets' fourth, DeMuth
called Robin Ventura out.
</P>
<P>
   Williams' run, the second that scored on Steve Finley's single,
gave the Diamondbacks a 3-1 lead. Ventura's out, quickly followed
by a double play, undermined a threat that might have enabled the
Mets to tie the game or take the lead. Bobby Valentine, the Mets'
manager, only mildly argued the call at the plate; he did not
emerge from the dugout after the call at second.
</P>
<P>
   Both plays were so close that repeated replays did not settle
them beyond a shadow of doubt. When that happens, umpires cannot be
faulted even if subsequent television angles show they were wrong.
Umpires get to make the call once, when they see the play live.
Television viewers have an advantage by having the benefit of
replays, and they often still can't agree on what they're seeing.
</P>
<P>
   In the matter of the Williams run, he slid home as Mike Piazza
caught the throw from Roger Cedeno, who had fielded Finley's single
in right field. Williams slid right leg first and appeared ready to
be safe. But just before his right foot reached the plate, his leg
went up in the air and became Piazza's target. Piazza also tried to
block the plate with his own leg, but he left a bit of the front
uncovered.
</P>
<P>
   Piazza tagged Williams' lead leg, and he appeared to do that an
instant before Williams' trailing leg, the left one, made contact
with the exposed part of the plate, although one replay was
inconclusive as to whether Piazza tagged the leg at all.
</P>
<P>
   Unperturbed by Finley's two-run single or the call at the plate,
Kenny Rogers retired the next batter, Bernard Gilkey, on a grounder
to third for the third out. The Mets immediately mounted their
threat.
</P>
<P>
   If there's one thing a manager hates to see, it's his pitcher
walking the leadoff batter in the opposing team's turn at bat
immediately after his team has scored, especially when the run or
runs give the team a tie or a lead. But Todd Stottlemyre threw four
pitches to Ventura and all were balls. Runner at first.
</P>
<P>
   Darryl Hamilton, with two balls and one strike, then hit a
grounder to Jay Bell that had double play written on it. But when
the second baseman seemed to want to throw the ball before he had
it, he lost the ball for an error. Runners at first and second.
</P>
<P>
   Cedeno was the next batter, and after taking the first pitch for
a ball, he tried to bunt and sacrifice the runners to second and
third. But Cedeno missed the pitch, and Ventura, having taken a
running start on his way to third, was caught too far off second.
Catcher Kelly Stinnett fired the ball to shortstop Tony Womack as
Ventura scrambled back toward the bag and dived in headfirst.
</P>
<P>
   The ball beat Ventura to the base, but Womack's tag _ if he
tagged him _didn't necessarily beat Ventura. In going to tag the
runner, Womack fell over him and, replays seemed to indicate, might
have missed him with his glove, which held the ball. But umpires
often give the play at second to the fielder if the ball beats the
runner there.
</P>
<P>
   As if the out at second didn't put a damper on the Mets' threat,
the next play extinguished it altogether. After taking a second
ball, Cedeno hit a grounder to the first base side of second. Bell
fielded this one cleanly and went to tag Hamilton coming from
first. Bell's idea was to tag Hamilton for one out, then flip to
first for the completion of the double play.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton, however, didn't want to be tagged so he ducked around
Bell, who then ignored him and threw to first to get Cedeno. But
even before Bell released the ball, DeMuth raised his right arm,
signaling that Hamilton got himself out by going out of the
baseline. The Diamondbacks had the double play, and the Mets had
spoiled their last chance to make a game of it.
</P>
<P>
   Finley drilled a two-run double to right-center field in the
fifth inning, raising the Arizona lead to 5-1, and Stottlemyre
continued to baffle the Mets' batters. The night before they
battered Randy Johnson. This night they stroked three singles
against Stottlemyre in the first six innings. With that kind of
production, they are not going to get to play in the World Series
against the team Stottlemyre's father coaches for. &QL;

LAKERS' BUSS EXPLAINS DOLLARS, CENTS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA BARBARA, Calif. _ A palatial downtown arena promises to
fill Jerry Buss' bank account with millions of dollars in new
revenue this season. He's wasted no time deciding how to spend it
all.
</P>
<P>
   He hired the best coach money could buy this summer _ $6 million
a year for Phil Jackson _ and has committed to a payroll in the $60
million range.
</P>
<P>
   But he passed on acquiring one high-priced star (Scottie Pippen)
in order to have the money needed to retain another (Glen Rice)
next season.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even without Pippen to run Jackson's offense, or the
bruising power forward Buss coveted (Charles Oakley), the Los
Angeles Lakers' owner believes his team can win the NBA
championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is the best team we've had in the last four or
five years,'' Buss said Wednesday in an informal meeting with
reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at length for the first time since February, Buss said
he never seriously considered bringing back Rodman. He also said he
never got past the discussion stage regarding a trade for Pippen,
the ex-Chicago Bull recently dealt from Houston to Portland.
</P>
<P>
   Pippen, a Jackson favorite, wanted a reunion with his old coach.
But the $54 million and four years remaining on Pippen's contract
made him an unattractive acquisition.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we ever really came close to getting Scottie at
all,'' Buss said. ``It's something that always comes up in a
conversation ... but it really would make it impossible for us
because his salary a couple of years hence would deny you any
opportunity whatsoever to pick up any kind of a good free agent. So
when you take him, you're basically saying, `This is our personnel
for the next four years.' Right now we have a lot more (roster
flexibility), and I think we should maintain that.''
</P>
<P>
   Buss said reports of the Lakers offering Rice, Robert Horry and
possibly Travis Knight to Houston for Pippen were ``not true.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Scottie is just a great player, and certainly, for a year or
two, it would have been the right thing to do,'' Buss said. ``We
probably would have done it had he not had a four-year contract.''
</P>
<P>
   There was no such temptation when it came to Rodman, the
troublemaking rebounder who disrupted the Lakers often during his
23-game stopover last season. Rodman, still unemployed, has lobbied
to return and has even predicted he would. But even his friendship
with Buss and relationship with Jackson won't open that door.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anybody's really seriously considered bringing
back Dennis,'' said Buss, who nevertheless claimed he has no
regrets about any personnel decisions made last season _ from the
firing of Del Harris to the trade for Rice to the signing of
Rodman.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers will once again rely on a power forward by committee
to support the starring trio of Shaquille O'Neal, Kobe Bryant and
Rice. If Jackson's system can, as promised, weave a championship
season from that group, Rice stands to profit.
</P>
<P>
   A free agent next summer, Rice is seeking a contract starting at
the NBA maximum of $14 million, a figure he can only get from the
Lakers. Buss already has committed $70.9 million to Bryant and $120
million to O'Neal, but indicated he'll pay whatever Rice is worth
to keep him here in the long term.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's pretty much what's on Jerry (West)'s mind,''
Buss said. ``My understanding of Jerry's thinking is I think he
wants to watch him play this year.''
</P>
<P>
   And as for the big contract? ``I think we're going to have to
pay the market price for the personnel that we want.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he deserves that money, we would have to pay it.''
</P>
<P>
   In Jackson's case, the decision was almost a no-brainer, even
for an owner who's never paid a coach more than $2 million. But
when faced with bringing back unproven Kurt Rambis or hiring a
coach with six championships in the 1990s, Buss didn't hesitate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that after the season was over, it became obvious to
us that we probably would have a better chance if we had a real
big-name coach who would command the kind of respect that Phil
does,'' Buss said. ``I think part of it had to do with the triangle
offense. That was very successful with Michael Jordan, of course.
And, with Kobe and with Shaq, I thought that was something that
would probably improve our performance on the court a great deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Buss also felt the Lakers' high-salaried superstars needed an
equally high-paid, high-profile coach to command their attention,
something Rambis and Del Harris sometimes could not do.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very difficult for somebody making one-tenth of what the
player he's talking to (makes) and get that kind of respect,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers may yet make a move for an established power forward,
but Buss is confident the group he has can catch the NBA champion
San Antonio Spurs, who knocked his team out of the playoffs in a
second-round sweep.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that we came reasonably close to San Antonio last year
... so hopefully the triangle offense and some more work and
maturity from the players will make us a better team,'' he said.
``I think we have a excellent chance with the personnel we have
right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Notes: Rice was held out of most of the morning practice at UC
Santa Barbara because of tendinitis in his left knee but was able
to participate fully in the evening practice.... O'Neal weighed in
at about 340 pounds, missing an unspecified goal Jackson set for
him. ``But I'm not unhappy about it,'' Jackson said. ``I think he's
in condition. I think (the desired weight) is something we can get
to during the season.''.... General manager Mitch Kupchak said the
team still hopes to sign former Bulls guard Ron Harper....
First-round pick Devean George dislocated his left pinky but was
able to practice.

VISIONS OF CBA KEEP HUDSON WELL MOTIVATED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY HILL  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ After conceding their staggering mismatch at the
position of team owner, the Los Angeles Clippers' most critically
disclaimed job description is point guard.
</P>
<P>
   For the sake of rebuttal, the floor now belongs to Troy Hudson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Come to the games and watch the performance,'' said Hudson,
who will co-star with recently acquired veteran Eric Murdock as
Clipper playmakers.
</P>
<P>
   But skeptics who missed Hudson's audition last season, have
predicted a point-guard horror show.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't take it personally,'' Hudson said while winding down
after a spirited training-camp workout at L.A. Southwest College.
``I just go out and try to prove them wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   He began gathering evidence at the University of Missouri, where
rare playing time inspired Hudson's transfer to Southern Illinois
University in his hometown of Carbondale.
</P>
<P>
   After averaging 21 points per game in his junior season, Hudson
entered the NBA Draft and couldn't find his way out. With an assist
from a training-camp injury to John Stockton, he made the Utah Jazz
as an undrafted rookie. When Stockton returned, Hudson took his
eight-game NBA resume all the way to the CBA.
</P>
<P>
   He remained stuck there in his second pro season, until being
rescued by the Clippers midway through the post-lockout disaster of
1999. In 25 games, Hudson produced 6.8 points, 3.7 assists and
enough fearlessness per game to hang around.
</P>
<P>
   ``Troy's a guy who just competes all out,'' said Clippers coach
Chris Ford. ``That's the energy I love.''
</P>
<P>
   For Hudson, vivid memories of CBA life make it easy to stay
motivated.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were more down times than good times in the CBA,'' he
admitted. ``But I always thought I could play here. To stay here, I
have to continue to play hard and be a leader on the court.''
</P>
<P>
   And his objective review on the state of Clippers point guards?
</P>
<P>
   ``Between myself and Eric Murdock, we have a solid backcourt.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, they don't seem to be grooming owners in the CBA.
</P>
<P>
   Fast breaks: When charted with rookies in the NBA's rookie class
of 1999, undrafted Clipper Tyrone Nesby ranked among the top 10 in
nine statistical categories. But he still doesn't have a sneaker
deal. Converse soon may change that.... Murdock, who played at
Providence College, holds the NCAA career record for steals (376 in
117 games). He averaged 25 points per game as a senior
(1990-'91).... Kebu Stewart, the star of the Clippers' Summer Pro
League entry at the Pyramid, is camping with the Dallas Mavericks.
Stewart, who led that league in scoring and took the silver in
rebounding, didn't impress the coaching staff enough to warrant a
guaranteed contract. He wasn't offered a guaranteed deal in Dallas,
either....
</P>
<P>
   The search for a backup center continues, but may not yield a
plausible alternative until league rosters are trimmed....
According to strength coach Johnny Doyle, one of the mightiest
Clippers pound for pound is 6-foot-5, 195-pound shooting guard
Derek Anderson. His surgically repaired knees also have received
ringing endorsements from team physician Dr. Tony Daly. Anderson,
acquired from Cleveland in the sign-and-trade deal that made Lamond
Murray a Cavalier, missed a dozen games last season, but currently
is moving around the court like a missile under factory warranty.

WITH GAME TAPES, THERE'S NO TRUSTING IN FOOTBALL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ USC wanted to scout Arizona by reviewing tapes of
every Wildcats game this season. But when a courtesy call was
placed to Penn State requesting a copy of the Pigskin Classic, the
Trojans were told to look elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``Joe (Paterno) didn't offer the game to us,'' USC coach Paul
Hackett said. ``They wouldn't send it to anybody. When you have an
extra game, you don't send it to anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, it's common practice for teams playing in early
games to make agreements not to send out tapes to future opponents.
The theory is that Arizona would open up its entire playbook
against the Nittany Lions, compared to a later game, against, say,
Middle Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   But would Penn State have sent it to USC anyway? The Nittany
Lions' series with Pitt ended in 1993, which was Hackett's last
season. His last game before being fired was a 57-13 loss to Penn
State.
</P>
<P>
   ``They beat us pretty good,'' Hackett said.
</P>
<P>
   Mystery man: Backup quarterback John Fox is eager to show he's
ready to play in a game, but is as curious as fans to see how much
has changed since he last started a game in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't lost much of a step. I'm older, more mature,
although I haven't had game experience,'' Fox said. ``It's a
mystery to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox also knows that he is one injury (to Mike Van Raaphorst)
away from becoming USC's quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything can happen. I don't go in expecting Mike to get hurt
and I pray that he doesn't,'' Fox said. ``But I prepare to play 70
snaps in a game whether I can get in or not.''
</P>
<P>
   Hayes progressing: Wide receiver Windrell Hayes practiced
Wednesday and appears fit to play. He'll sit out today's practice
to rest his sore ankle. Hackett was also pleased with tailback
Malaefou MacKenzie's recovery from a sore hamstring.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw some of the cutting from the old Malaefou,'' he said.
``I don't imagine he'll get a lot of work but we'll ease him in.''
</P>
<P>
   Less likely to play large roles are center Eric Denmon (knee)
and guard Donta Kendrick (ankle). Both will be available but won't
be 100 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Moreno raises profile: Linebacker Zeke Moreno was named the
season's first winner of the Bronko Nagurski National Defensive
Player of the Week award.
</P>
<P>
   The award is given to the top player each week by the Charlotte
Touchdown Club, for the nation's top defensive player.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps more interesting, the Butkus Award committee is debating
whether to put Moreno on its watch list of the nation's top
linebackers, which would lead to placing his name on the ballot
sent to voters. A decision will be made next week.
</P>
<P>
   On the case: USC will go to the Coliseum today to investigate
why the headphones malfunctioned last Saturday. It's believed that
a stadium employee may have plugged the 110-volt headsets into a
220-volt socket.

NO MORE WORRIES FOR CSUN SAFETY SPARKS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHRIS BRANAM  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Even though he didn't lose hope, Rahman Sparks
wondered if he was ever going to make an impact on the Cal State
Northridge football team.
</P>
<P>
   He's not worrying anymore.
</P>
<P>
   Sparks, a senior safety who played sparingly last season, leads
CSUN in tackles entering the Matadors' Big Sky Conference game
Saturday at Montana.
</P>
<P>
   Sparks has 31 tackles, including 18 solo, and five pass
deflections. He was supposed to back up Hassan Abdul-Malik at free
safety to start the season but Abdul-Malik pulled his hamstring
early in fall camp and is now going to redshirt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to work hard if (Abdul-Malik) was here or not,'' said
Sparks, who played the first two games at cornerback before moving
to safety. ``I just had to tell myself that as soon as I got the
opportunity, I had to step up.''
</P>
<P>
   Sparks transferred to CSUN from L.A. Southwest College prior to
the 1998 season. He had seven tackles in three games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was playing behind a big-time dude,'' Sparks said, referring
to Vito Clemente, who had 68 tackles and three interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   Sparks would have made Clemente proud against Eastern Washington
on Sept. 25; despite missing most of the fourth quarter with sore
ribs, Sparks had 12 tackles, forced a fumble and had a sack.
</P>
<P>
   Not bad for a guy who figured to be a backup this season after
Abdul-Malik earned the starting job in the spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I needed to work harder,'' he said. ``I dropped a
few pounds over the summer.''
</P>
<P>
   Relieving pressure: The Matadors have already had three players
start at left guard on the offensive line, but the latest _
sophomore Javier Ortiz _ seems to have nailed down the job for the
rest of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``He stepped into that role, and he's done a good job,''
offensive line coach Bob Connelly said of Ortiz, a 6-3, 285-pound
transfer from Fresno State.
</P>
<P>
   Another new starter on the line is freshman Nick Longshore, a
left tackle from Canyon High. Longshore has been Johnny Acosta's
backup through the first four games.
</P>
<P>
   Battling back: Julio Alcala, CSUN's starting center, isn't
participating in every drill in practice to protect his sore lower
back from getting worse. But after sitting out a few practices a
few weeks ago, Alcala thought his technique wasn't sharp in games
and requested more action.
</P>
<P>
   The coaches agreed, but Alcala is playing only with the
first-team offense and not in scout drills.``(Alcala) not
practicing and still playing Saturdays doesn't frighten me too
much,'' Connelly said.
</P>
<P>
   Middle man: After an early-season slump, middle linebacker Cos
Abercrombie has 20 tackles in his past two games.

HOPE IN PARKINSON'S FIGHT

<P>
   PHOENIX - Fred Forbes' voice is weak and hard to make out over
the phone, a telltale sign of Parkinson's disease.
</P>
<P>
   But when talk turns to a recent federal court ruling that allows
fetal tissue research in Arizona, the 64-year-old Tucson resident
be comes clear as a bell.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be in the front of the line,'' said Forbes, a retired
electrical engineer and one of 10 plaintiffs who challenged a state
ban on using fetal tissue in research.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes now wants to be the first Arizona volunteer injected with
fetal brain cells, a procedure that could help reverse the
debilitating effects of Parkinson's.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look forward to participating as a patient and giving myself
up as a guinea pig,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Fetal tissue research also may help patients with spinal cord
inju ries, epilepsy and other neuro-de generative diseases.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the medical promise, the use of fetal tissue poses grave
ethical questions. And last month's ruling may face an appeal by
Arizona Attorney General Janet Napolitano.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point, we need to take a look at what options we have,
if any,'' said Pati Urias, a spokes woman for Napolitano. ``It's a
really complicated issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Researchers in other states have found limited success using
fetal cells to restore the adult brain cells that produce dopamine,
a chemical that controls movement and coordi nation.
</P>
<P>
   But a 24-year ban on such research has stymied doctors from
using any tissues and fluids from aborted fetuses in Arizona. The
ban was overturned Sept. 30 by U.S. District Judge William Browning
in Tucson.
</P>
<P>
   The ban was challenged by the New York-based Center for Repro
ductive Law and Policy, which represented four people with Parkin
son's, two people affiliated with Planned Parenthood Inc. and four
other Arizonans.
</P>
<P>
   For Forbes, who has given up night driving and recently had to
buy a walking cane, the ruling offers hope that fetal cell Parkin
son's researchers will consider com ing to Arizona, and that those
who left when the ban went into effect in 1975 may return.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing that produces the dopamine that I need is fetal
cells, and I'm scraping the bottom of the barrel right now,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers are equally enthusi astic about the ruling, although
they caution patients that fetal cell thera pies may not provide a
cure for decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not that the fetal implants are the most hopeful, but
it's an area that we should have open to us to learn how to help
patients,'' said Dr. Barry Hendin, a Phoenix neurolo gist and
clinical professor at the University of Arizona's medical school
campus in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   Current treatment for most Par kinson's patients is medication
and sometimes surgery to stimulate pro duction of dopamine in an
area of the middle brain known as the substantia nigra.
</P>
<P>
   But researchers are always on the lookout for more aggressive
treat ments that could lead to a cure for the disease, which
affects 1.5 mil lion Americans. The disease is characterized by
tremors, stiffness in the limbs, loss of balance, a weaker voice
and episodes of ``freezing,'' in which patients feel stuck in place
and unable to move.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge to Arizona's ban on fetal tissue research began in
1996 with the Center for Reproduc tive Law and Policy. The center
moved to overturn the state law because of the number of Parkin
son's patients in Arizona and be cause of new clinical trials that
proposed using fetal brain cells.
</P>
<P>
   Bebe Anderson, a staff attorney for the center, said the
Legislature shouldn't block the evolution of medical techniques.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't surprised in that I do believe that these laws are
unconsti tutionally vague,'' she said. ``Cer tainly, I was very
pleased with the ruling.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether the issue repre sents a slippery slope for medical
science, Anderson said that certain safeguards can protect against
fe tuses being aborted for the sole purpose of providing research
tis sue.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's quite an argument that's unfair both to Parkinson's
patients and women who are considering whether to carry a pregnancy
to term,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The use of fetal tissue is not new in medicine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people don't realize that the polio vaccine was developed
in the 1950s by work on dead fetuses,'' said Dr. Charles Daschbach,
chair man of medical ethics education at St. Joseph's Hospital and
Medical Center in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are many other cases where learning about fetuses has
helped the human condition. We wouldn't have had amniocentesis and
some of the ultrasound findings that we have.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Daschbach cautions that fetal tissue research is a mine
field of ethical dilemmas.
</P>
<P>
   ``The possibilities for alleviating suffering and preventing
disease are phenomenal, but we always have to ask the fundamental
question of what are we sacrificing to get there.'' &QL;

DIAMONDBACKS TIE SERIES WITH 7-1 VICTORY OVER METS 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By JUDY BATTISTA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ The predictions should be tossed aside, the
expectations shelved. The New York Mets were supposed to be in the
post-season but had to scurry to unearth their invitation from the
trash heap hours before the party began.
</P>
<P>
   They were expected to be too weary from their one-game playoff
against Cincinnati to keep their bleary eyes focused on Randy
Johnson's fastballs on Tuesday night. But they managed to stay
awake long enough to batter one of the most dominant pitchers in
baseball.
</P>
<P>
   And then, with a 1-0 lead in the three-of-five-game division
series against Arizona, the Mets were prepared to cruise against a
pitcher for whom each start is a testament to modern sports injury
treatment.
</P>
<P>
   But following the Mets is like trying to balance on a surfboard.
The Mets can beat up on a pitcher that most opponents fear and then
be subdued by a pitcher who, less than five months ago, feared his
career might be over.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Stottlemyre and the Arizona Diamondbacks throttled the Mets
on Wednesday night, delivering a 7-1 loss to tie the series at 1-1
as it heads to New York for Games 3 and 4 on Friday night and
Saturday afternoon. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This was a battle of two scarred pitchers: Kenny Rogers by his
Yankees experience and Todd Stottlemyre by a debilitating shoulder
injury that put him out of action for three months this season.
</P>
<P>
   In his five starts leading to the post-season, Stottlemyre had
not lasted more than six innings. On Wednesday night the Mets,
still riding the emotional high of their ninth-inning victory in
Game 1, struck first, scoring a run in the third when Rickey
Henderson hit a leadoff single, stole second base, went to third on
a fly ball and scored on a John Olerud grounder.
</P>
<P>
   Stottlemyre, though, then began to roll. He struck out Mike
Piazza in the third and sixth innings. At that point, Piazza had
only one hit in eight post-season at-bats with four strikeouts.
Stottlemyre also held the sizzling Edgardo Alfonzo, who hit
Tuesday's game-winning grand slam, hitless. He lasted six and
two-thirds innings, and allowed only one run on four hits.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets had their best opportunity to score again in the
seventh inning, when Rey Ordonez hit a one-out double off the
left-field fence with the pinch-hitter Bobby Bonilla up next.
Bonilla made the post-season roster precisely because he still
presents a power threat from both sides of the plate, but this time
he popped out in foul territory for the second out. Henderson
walked, and he and Ordonez pulled a double steal to put them at
second and third. However, Alfonzo grounded out to end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers, who was superb since returning to New York in a
midseason trade, would need more help than that. Entering the game,
he had a 5-1 record with a 4.03 earned run average in 12 starts for
the Mets, but in his previous four starts his era had jumped by
almost a full run. In his most recent start, though, which was also
the most important one, he allowed only two runs and struck out 10
in seven and a third innings against Pittsburgh, in the first game
of what was a must-win sweep that kept the Mets' playoff hopes
alive.
</P>
<P>
   ``He surprises me with his curveball, something I didn't know he
had developed so well,'' said Manager Bobby Valentine, who managed
Rogers in Texas. ``He's a much better pitcher than I remember. He's
everything that we had hoped for.''
</P>
<P>
   But on Wednesday night Rogers, who was still bothered by a
tweaked hamstring and back spasms, faced a team that is
particularly tough on left-handers. Arizona had the best record in
the majors against lefty starters this season, going 32-16. And
Rogers has a famously abysmal history in the post-season. While
with the Yankees in 1996, he went 0-0 with a 14.14 era in three
starts and one relief appearance.
</P>
<P>
   In the third inning, the Diamondbacks created fresh misery for
Rogers, who has insisted that he feels he has nothing to prove in
New York. With two out, Rogers appeared to be cruising through
another inning, when he allowed a single to left field by Jay Bell.
Then, Rogers, a control pitcher, unraveled. He hit Luis Gonzalez
with a pitch in the back. Matt Williams followed with a high
chopper that bounced in the dirt in front of home plate and drew
Rogers in to field it. He did, but by then he had nowhere to throw.
The bases were loaded for Greg Colbrunn. This season, Colbrunn was
.343 (12 for 35) with 18 runs batted in with men in scoring
position. This time, he drew a walk that brought in Bell to tie the
score at 1-1.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Finley's numbers with the bases loaded this season were
impressive: he was 5 for 12 with 19 rbi. He smacked a 1-2 pitch for
a single to right field that scored Gonzalez and had Williams
racing for home plate. But right fielder Roger Cedeno made a
perfect throw to the plate and Williams slid. As he came in, his
lead leg _ the right one _ lifted in the air and his lower leg
appeared to have been tagged by Piazza, who had the plate blocked
with his left shin. But Williams was ruled safe and the Mets
trailed for the first time in the division series, 3-1.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers remained in the game, but the fifth inning finally sent
him to the clubhouse. He allowed a leadoff single to Bell and then
struck out Gonzalez. Valentine brought in the reliever Pat Mahomes,
who was 8-0 with a 3.68 era in the regular season and whom Arizona
Manager Buck Showalter said may be pitching as well as anybody the
Mets have in their bullpen. But Mahomes was facing Williams first,
and he laced a single to center to put runners at first and second.
Mahomes struck out Greg Colbrunn, but Finley was back. He doubled
to left center to score Bell and Williams, increasing Arizona's
lead to 5-1.
</P>
<P>
   In four and a third innings, Rogers allowed four runs on five
hits, with two walks and six strikeouts. It was the briefest _ and
most damaging _ start by a Mets pitcher since they began their
climb six days ago out of the hole their collapse had created.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night was the first reminder the Mets had that while
that climb had been dramatic and thrilling, it could not always
remain free of treachery.
</P>
<P>
   INSIDE PITCH
</P>
<P>
   Rickey Henderson stole three bases on Wednesday night, a
single-game record for a division series, and he now has five
steals in this series. &QL;

SPECIAL TEAMS ARE A KICK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The offense is inconsistent and the defense can't
stop big plays, but in this season of turmoil, UCLA's special teams
have been, well, special. If the defense covered receivers like the
kickoff unit covers returners, the Bruins would be in first place.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our kickoffs are fun to watch,'' coach Bob Toledo said.
``We're splattering people right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, UCLA's opponents averaged 26.6 yards per
kickoff return. This year, 19. Although the Bruins have better
athletes than they did in 1996, Nate Fikse's booming kickoffs are
the primary reason for their success.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chris Sailer was a great kicker, but he didn't get quite the
hang time that Fikse does,'' said assistant Marc Dove, who coaches
the kickoff unit. ``That's allowed us to cover the field better.
But we'll face some talented return teams in the coming weeks, so
we have a big challenge ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's opponent, Oregon, is third in the league in kickoff
returns (23.7), and Cal, which visits the Rose Bowl in 10 days, is
second (23.9).
</P>
<P>
   Add special: Walk-on freshman Chris Griffith has made 8 of 9
field goals, with a long of 46 yards, and ranks second in the
Pacific-10 in field goals per game (1.6).
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins lead the Pac-10 in kickoff returns with a 24-yard
average, courtesy of Lovell Houston's 95-yard return against
Stanford
</P>
<P>
   The weakest special teams unit is punt return. UCLA averages 6.4
yards per return (ninth in the league), and Ryan Roques's longest
return is 16 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Foster update: UCLA tailback DeShaun Foster has been downgraded
from questionable to doubtful because of a sprained right ankle.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't look good, but we'll wait until game time,'' Toledo
said.
</P>
<P>
   Recruiting update: UCLA landed its 10th recruit Tuesday when
receiver Craig Bragg, of Bellarmine Prep in San Jose, gave the
Bruins an oral commitment.
</P>
<P>
   Bragg, 6-foot and 185 pounds, is expected to inject much-needed
speed into UCLA's receiving corps. He selected the Bruins over
Oregon and Michigan State, among others.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins have 18 scholarships available and hope to sign at
least two receivers.
</P>
<P>
   Feeling good: One of the biggest surprises in the Pac-10 this
season is the play of Oregon quarterback A.J. Feeley, who spent two
seasons on the bench watching Akili Smith run the Ducks'
high-powered offense.
</P>
<P>
   Feeley leads the league in passing (278 yards per game) and is
fourth in passing efficiency. He has completed 61 percent of his
passes, with 11 touchdowns and one interception.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, UCLA's pass defense is eighth in the conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``He lacked game experience, but he's always had a strong arm,
and he's becoming a great leader,'' Ducks coach Mike Bellotti said.
``He's probably exceeded my expectations. With our top-two running
backs down, more of the burden falls on his shoulders.''
</P>
<P>
   Starting tailback Reuben Droughns (separated ribs) and
second-stringer Herman Ho-Ching (sprained foot) are doubtful for
Saturday's game.

DON'T TAKE BETS ON PROHIBITION OF ONLINE GAMBLING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE WILSON  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
(UNDATED) - Sometime not too many years from now, you or I will be
able to roll out of bed, power up our computer and legally play a
few hands of blackjack on a Web site before heading to work.
<TEXT>
<P>
   During the lunch break, we might get on a computer to wager on a
horse race or two. When we come home, we may call up a sports
betting site and place some money on that night's baseball games.
In the evening, we could play video poker in a cybercasino while
relaxing in an easy chair.
</P>
<P>
   Tom W. Bell, a law professor at Chapman University in Orange,
Calif., expects that the law will allow us to do all those things
within the next decade. Writing in the current issue of Reason
magazine, he argues that demand for online gambling will soon
overcome the opposition now lined up against it.
</P>
<P>
   I hope he's wrong, but I fear he's right.
</P>
<P>
   Bell makes a strong case why efforts to stop online gambling
will fail, including those in Congress led by Sen. Jon Kyl, sponsor
of the Internet Gambling Prohibition Act. That measure enjoys
bipartisan support and was approved by a Senate vote of 90-10 last
year. Time ran out before the House could act last session, so the
bill was reintroduced this year, and Kyl is confident it will
become law.
</P>
<P>
   Besides having the support of both political parties, the
measure is backed by interest groups ranging from the Christian
Coalition to Ralph Nader's Public Citizen.
</P>
<P>
   Kyl says his bill is primarily meant to bring the current
prohibitions up to date with evolving technology. But he also
believes that legal wagering on the Internet would have a heavily
negative social impact, producing more gambling addicts and feeding
other social pathologies.
</P>
<P>
   Bell, a libertarian, concedes that some people would be tempted
to gamble too much. But he doesn't think that justifies such a
broad ban on Internet bets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gambling has long been a part of the American ethos,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people who first sailed across the ocean to live here took
a big gamble. Declaring our nation's independence was a gamble.
George Washington regularly bet on horses and in card games. Many
of the founders liked to gamble. They embraced gambling as part of
their inalienable right to the pursuit of happiness.''
</P>
<P>
   Bell contends that federal laws and other attempts to stop
online wagering will fail for three reasons:
</P>
<P>
   (1) The Internet's open architecture makes prohibition futile,
and relentless innovation will make it all the harder. Imagine if
the U.S. Postal Service were required to check all correspondence
to stop gambling. That impossible task will be a thousand times
tougher on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   (2) Since the Internet is international, domestic efforts to ban
gambling won't work. Internet sites abroad will offer plenty of
options to Americans. Worldwide, the revenues of online casinos
doubled from 1997 to '98 and are predicted to reach $2.3 billion in
the year 2001.
</P>
<P>
   (3) Consumer demand for online gambling, together with
government demand for millions of dollars in tax revenue, will
create political pressure for legalization.
</P>
<P>
   Kyl disagrees that the Internet's complexity makes enforcement a
hopeless task. Besides, the fact that a law isn't easy to enforce
doesn't mean you don't try to enforce it, he said.
</P>
<P>
   He also thinks it will be possible to stop gambling on sites
outside this country, noting that many foreign sites today respect
our laws and don't allow U.S. citizens to play. As for the day when
a majority of Americans want Internet gambling made legal, Kyl
doesn't expect to see it.
</P>
<P>
   Bell predicts that public demand will bring legalization in the
next five to 10 years, adding that Americans have ``a natural
desire to take risks and seek fortune.''
</P>
<P>
   He's right about that; the sharp rise in stock market
day-trading shows as much. But the consequences of creating a
culture so thoroughly saturated with gambling would be
far-reaching. Could the values of hard work, personal
responsibility and perseverance hold up against sheer luck? Could
the ethic of earning money survive the seductive ease of online
wagering?
</P>
<P>
   I wouldn't take those bets. &QL;

UCLA HURT BY LACK OF EXPERIENCE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Early last week, as the evening mist caressed
Spaulding Field, UCLA coach Bob Toledo gathered his seniors for a
post-practice meeting. After a close loss at Stanford, the Bruins
faced a pivotal game at Arizona State _ a Rose Bowl elimination
game _ and Toledo needed leadership.
</P>
<P>
   He waited in the middle of the field as dusk fell and the
seniors shuffled over. He knew exactly what to say: They must lead
by example on the field, they must inspire off it, and, above all,
they must convince the underclassmen that hope remained despite the
Stanford loss.
</P>
<P>
   The players arrived and formed a semi-circle around Toledo. He
was about to begin one of the most important speeches of the season
when, scanning his tiny audience, a strange thought popped into his
head.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is this it?''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, that was it.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to UCLA '99 _ also known as where have all the seniors
gone?
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins have 12 healthy seniors, tied with Washington for the
second-lowest total in the Pacific-10 behind Stanford's 11. What
happened to the Bruins at Arizona State _ the late-game mistakes,
the blown fourth-quarter lead, the inability to win on the road _
is typical of a team heavy on underclassmen and light on seniors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything that happened last year, when we won (close games)
because of our experience, is becoming the opposite this year, when
we lose (close games) because of our inexperience,'' senior
fullback Durell Price said.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins oozed leadership last year. They had a senior
quarterback, Cade McNown, who would berate, cajole or inspire the
moment he sniffed trouble. They had two senior offensive linemen,
Shawn Stuart and Andy Meyers, who barked like dobermans when
necessary. They had two senior tight ends, Mike Grieb and Ryan
Neufeld, a senior kicker, Chris Sailer, and a senior safety, Larry
Atkins, who specialized in quiet inspiration.
</P>
<P>
   Toledo couldn't have asked for more. The seniors did not lose
their cool in close games _ in fact, they thrived on pressure _ and
they did not hesitate to speak their minds in the locker room, on
the sideline or in the huddle.
</P>
<P>
   But that's not the case this year. Six seniors were involved in
the handicapped parking scandal and suspended for two games.
All-American receiver Danny Farmer missed two games because of an
ankle injury. Defensive end Travor Turner is out for the season
with a knee injury. Vocal cornerback Jason Bell hasn't played in
weeks _ and may redshirt _ because of a bad heel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Farmer's been hurt, so how's he going to lead?'' Toledo said.
``Look at the guys who have been injured, suspended or aren't
playing, and it's hard to be a leader.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the five remaining seniors, three are reserves, one's a
former walk-on (safety Joey Strycula) and one's a junior college
transfer (tight end Randy Hakes). Only defensive tackle Pete
Holland has the health, personality, credibility and experience to
lead like a member of the class of '98.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a team dominated by guys who are young,'' Holland
said. ``We've got some seniors playing, but they aren't as much of
a presence (as last year).
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether it's remembering your assignments better or being
poised in crunch time, you can definitely tell a senior team. It
takes being in big games, and (the ASU loss) showed we have more
guys who need that experience than have it.''
</P>
<P>
   The senior shortage began 4{ years ago, with former coach Terry
Donahue's final recruiting class. It had talent at the top (McNown,
Sailer, Kris Farris) but lacked quality depth and staying power. Of
the 17 signees, only six remain. (Farmer and Strycula were
walk-ons.)
</P>
<P>
   Three players left the program _ Jason Bendinelli, Matt
Pentecost and Langston Woodberry. Three more retired because of
injuries _ Ramogi Huma, Mike Wiley and Turner. Four exhausted their
eligibility last season _ McNown, Sailer, Craig Walendy and Cheyane
Caldwell.
</P>
<P>
   Donahue resigned 10 months later and Toledo was hired Jan. 4,
1996 _ with just 3{ weeks left in the recruiting season. His
hastily compiled class featured 18 signees, of which only 11
remain.
</P>
<P>
   Linebacker Brendon Ayanbadejo was a junior college transfer who
departed last year. Cornerback Damian Allen quit to run track.
Tight end Aaron Ladd, defensive lineman David Plenty Hawk and
receiver Ahmad Hebert left school for various reasons. Quarterback
Dylan Aquino retired for medical reasons and gifted linebacker
Anselmo Zamano suffered a career-ending knee injury in the third
game of his first season.
</P>
<P>
   The final count says more about UCLA's current struggles than
disabled-parking suspensions or quarterback questions. Of the 35
recruits signed in 1995-96, 17 remain.
</P>
<P>
   Most top-25 programs can absorb one subpar recruiting season,
but few can survive two without feeling a talent and leadership
crunch. For UCLA, the squeeze is on.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's definitely a generation gap,'' Holland said. ``At the
start of every season, you look around and see how many seniors
there are, guys that are good players and leaders that you hope
will play every week. We've lost a lot of key guys.''
</P>
<P>
   After Toledo's post-practice meeting last week, the seniors
gathered to plot their course. They discussed the painful ending to
'98 and the turbulent start to '99. They bemoaned the breakdowns at
Stanford and the wasted opportunities at Arizona State. Mostly,
they talked about salvaging their final season, about turning
nothing into something.
</P>
<P>
   ``We talked about this at the start of the season,'' Toledo
said. ``We knew there would be problems being as young as we are.
It's not an excuse. It's a fact.''
</P>
<P>
   There aren't many options. The Bruins are loaded with freshmen
at the three most difficult positions in football: quarterback,
offensive line and cornerback. They can't turn rookies into
veterans overnight. They can't will Bell and Turner back to health,
and they can't bring McNown and Atkins back from the NFL. All they
can do is inspire, cajole _ and endure.

FLORIDA, LSU EMOTION ARE STIRRING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ And now, our latest installment in the backward
behavior that dominates the Southeastern Conference.
</P>
<P>
   With Florida playing at Louisiana State this week, a mystery man
faxed the following letter to media outlets in Louisiana on Sunday
afternoon from a Kinko's copy store:
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of the nasty, vulgar treatment our team received from
LSU fans during our last visit to Baton Rouge, we have decided that
from now on, we will wear the traditional white jersey on the road
and dark jersey at home.''
</P>
<P>
   Sincerely,
</P>
<P>
   Steve Spurrier
</P>
<P>
   Football Coach
</P>
<P>
   No one knows who faxed the letter. When contacted Monday, LSU
sports information director Herb Vincent said LSU coach Gerry
DiNardo confirmed the letter is authentic and is from Florida coach
Spurrier.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coach DiNardo pulled the original letter out of his file and
showed it to me,'' Vincent said. ``It was postmarked Jan. 14, 1999.
So somebody, either at our end or at Florida's end, wanted to stir
things up this week with the fax.''
</P>
<P>
   After Florida's practice Monday night, Spurrier did not shy away
from the controversy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to get them real mad,'' Spurrier said. ``We play
better when the other guys are mad at us. I found that out. Alabama
came in here and said all the nice things and we all sat back and
read it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully we can get LSU talking nasty about us. That makes us
play a little better, it seems.''
</P>
<P>
   Sportswriter Glenn Guilbeau of The (Baton Rouge) Advocate, one
of the recipients of the fax, posed a question: ``Could DiNardo
have dispatched someone to Kinko's Sunday afternoon?''
</P>
<P>
   The jersey issue is one of DiNardo's favorite topics. Raising it
diverts attention from his growing problems at LSU.
</P>
<P>
   When he came to LSU in 1995, DiNardo successfully lobbied the
NCAA for a rule change so the Tigers could wear their favorite
white jerseys at home if the opponent agreed to wear dark jerseys.
</P>
<P>
   So far the only team to deny LSU's request to wear white at home
was Vanderbilt in 1996. DiNardo responded by unveiling new gold
jerseys for LSU and his team ripped the Commodores 35-0.
</P>
<P>
   ``We like the gold jerseys,'' Spurrier said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Florida wore blue and the white-clad Tigers pulled off
a 28-21 upset victory.
</P>
<P>
   LSU won't be wearing its white jerseys Saturday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Devil in the details: Florida State coach Bobby Bowden signed a
new contract this week. Bowden, who turns 70 on Nov. 8, will see
his deal extended for another five years. His contract, which pays
him approximately $1 million per year, was set to expire after the
2000 season. He will get a raise to the $1.3 million-$1.5 million
neighborhood and his deal will go through the 2004 season, when he
will be 75.
</P>
<P>
   In case you wondered about the priorities in college athletics,
here's a couple of details from Bowden's deal.
</P>
<P>
   If the Seminoles reach the national championship game, he makes
$75,000. If Bowden's team has an 80 percent graduation rate, he
gets $19,000.
</P>
<P>
   Purple paranoia: At practice last week, as his team prepared to
face Washington, Oregon coach Mike Bellotti got one of his security
men to ask an onlooker wearing a purple jacket to remove said
garment.
</P>
<P>
   Why?
</P>
<P>
   Because his Ducks were preparing for a game against the hated
Huskies, whose main color is purple.
</P>
<P>
   It turned out the guy was a scout for the Minnesota Vikings,
and, offended, he opted to leave practice rather than set aside his
coat.
</P>
<P>
   Said Bellotti: ``I thought at first it was a Husky fan trying to
make some kind of a statement, and I thought our players and
coaches might be very uneasy with someone in that purple jacket
standing there watching us. When I found out he was a scout, I just
wanted him to take the coat off. I said, `We'll get him another
coat.' But I guess he got upset about it and left.''
</P>
<P>
   Ugly duckling: Michigan and Michigan State will play for the
Paul Bunyan Trophy, which isn't to be confused with the Paul Bunyan
Axe, which goes to the Wisconsin-Minnesota winner.
</P>
<P>
   The Bunyan Trophy is the ugly stepchild of college trophies,
ranking behind the Axe, Floyd of Rosedale and the Old Oaken Bucket
within the Big Ten as far as prestige goes.
</P>
<P>
   That could be because Michigan has won the Bunyan Trophy 22 of
28 times since 1970, or it could be because the trophy is _ well,
we'll let Wolverines coach Lloyd Carr tell it:
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an ugly trophy,'' Carr said of the contraption that
features a five-foot replica of the legendary lumberjack standing
on the State of Michigan between both a UM and MSU flag. ``I always
tell the players, `This is the ugliest trophy in college football.'
''

SPORTS COLUMN: A BUMP ON THE ROAD FOR VALENTINE'S BAND
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs for rewriting throughout)   (sw) 
 By WILLIAM C. RHODEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ The Mets return to New York on Thursday after an
exhilarating three days on the road that saw them accomplish most
of want they wanted. Despite Wednesday night's 7-1 loss to Arizona,
the Mets got more than they bargained for. They defeated Cincinnati
in a playoff on Monday to gain the National League wild card, then
took Game 1 of their three-of-five-game division series with the
Diamondbacks on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gives us a chance to win another one, go home, and we at least
had a split here,'' Mets Manager Bobby Valentine had said before
Game 2.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets didn't just split, they beat Randy Johnson, the
Diamondbacks' ace and one of baseball's premier pitchers. The Mets
didn't simply beat Johnson, they knocked him around.
</P>
<P>
   As catcher Mike Piazza said diplomatically, ``I'm not going to
say we pounded him, but we hit him pretty good.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mets also discovered a new star, a new force. Edgardo
Alfonzo, their low-key second baseman, emerged from the shadows to
propel the Mets when they needed a lift: on Monday, a home run in
Cincinnati; on Tuesday, a leadoff home run in the first inning
against Johnson, then a crushing game-winning grand slam in the
ninth inning.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks clinched the division so long ago that they had
time to sit and watch the Mets' soap opera drama unfold in the last
two weeks. Little did Arizona know that it would soon become part
of the Mets' script.
</P>
<P>
   That script invariably includes a knock at the door. In Game 1
of the division series, the stranger at the door was the
25-year-old Alfonzo. In his first at-bat against the indomitable
Johnson, Alfonzo, down no balls and two strikes, cracked a home run
over the left-center-field wall. The confidence spread immediately.
</P>
<P>
   After that, every Met battled Johnson, refusing to be cowed by
his reputation. The Mets had great at-bats, not all resulting in
hits, but they set Johnson on the defensive early in the game.
</P>
<P>
   Alfonzo's homer signaled an early turning point.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday night, the Mets' bats and timely hitting were not
so loud. Twice, Alfonzo failed to drive in or advance Rickey
Henderson. In the seventh inning, with men on second and third and
two out, Alfonzo grounded to third and the Mets lapsed into their
pre-resurrection habit of leaving runners stranded.
</P>
<P>
   Where do the Mets go from here? Will they be stranded with one
victory in the post season?
</P>
<P>
   The team must be fatigued. Three emotional games at home against
Pittsburgh, a flight to the Midwest, a night game in Cincinnati for
the wild-card playoff, another flight halfway across the country,
and across three time zones, to face the 6-foot-10-inch Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're beyond tired,'' Piazza said. ``We're physically tired.
We're not thinking, we're just playing baseball. That was our
attitude in the Pittsburgh series because of the fact that we were
left for dead.''
</P>
<P>
   Manager Bobby Valentine said that the Mets' loss had nothing to
do with fatigue. But nonetheless, the team will take Thursday off.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a day off tomorrow, and we'll take it,'' he said.
``Our guys can use it.''
</P>
<P>
   The luster of the last few days has faded and the series they
struggled so mightily to get into is tied, 1-1. The Diamondbacks
feel that Game 1 was an aberration, that the series will eventually
move back here for Game 5 with Randy Johnson pitching.
</P>
<P>
   After Tuesday's victory, Piazza talked as if the Mets were
invincible. ``We just feel like we're not thinking about who we're
playing against and who's pitching,'' Piazza said. ``There's not a
hitter you can't pitch to and get out. There's not pitcher who's
unhittable.''
</P>
<P>
   After Wednesday night's sobering loss, the Mets, and Piazza,
were less euphoric. Wednesday night, Todd Stottlemyre did what
Johnson couldn't do in Game 1. He wasn't unhittable, but he
repeatedly handcuffed the Mets when it mattered.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Alfonzo filled a great divide. But on Wednesday
night, the team hit a wall. At a point in the season when attitude
is so important, the Mets' frame of mind comes into play more than
ever. It seems like ages ago that the Mets had nearly caught
Atlanta and were leaving Cincinnati behind; the Mets players spoke
of a cushion. Since they survived the free fall, now they speak of
feeling no pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Is there any sense of urgency or do they see anything from this
point on as gravy?
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the attitude now that everything is icing on the
cake,'' Piazza said. ``We never thought we'd be here. I don't think
we feel like were going out there pressing. We're having fun.''
</P>
<P>
   It didn't seem that they were having fun on Wednesday night. As
the Mets know, only a thin line separates good and bad fortune.
</P>
<P>
   Last August, Alfonzo seemed ambivalent when someone asked if he
minded obscurity in a news-media-driven town where notoriety can
often mean dollars. He said that anonymity is fine at one level
``because I'm able to go out.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``I can go out with my wife and not worry.''
</P>
<P>
   In the same breath he expressed hope for a change, and that some
celebrity would come his way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometime, it's going to happen and, hopefully, that will be
pretty soon,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Change doesn't just happen. You have to force change, and force
transformation. What better way to do it than to homer three times
in two games in October on a New York baseball team?
</P>
<P>
   Alfonzo's transformation began this week. The Mets'
transformation is still under review. &QL;

WAVES INTEND TO BE ON THE RUN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHRIS BRANAM  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Whether the new offense is going to be wildly
successful, he's not yet sure about.
</P>
<P>
   But Jan van Breda Kolff enters his first season as the
Pepperdine men's basketball coach with a new plan for a team that
won 19 games last season and lost only one starter.
</P>
<P>
   The Waves are going to run _ a lot.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to get our players accustomed to a style they're
not used to,'' said van Breda Kolff, who coached at Vanderbilt for
six years before replacing Lorenzo Romar in April. ``Last year it
was hard to score against Pepperdine in the halfcourt ... but (the
Waves) didn't get steals, they didn't block shots. There weren't
many `big-play' situations.''
</P>
<P>
   The Waves were 9-5 and second in the West Coast Conference last
year despite averaging just 65.7 points per game, sixth in the WCC.
Defensively, Pepperdine was No.2, giving up 63.2 points per game.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Scoring more) will generate excitement and enthusiasm for the
fans,'' van Breda Kolff said. ``The players are really going to
enjoy it.''
</P>
<P>
   Pepperdine starts practice next Friday night with ``Midnight
Madness'' at Firestone Fieldhouse. Junior forward Kelvin Gibbs, the
Waves' leading returning scorer (11.0 ppg) and rebounder (7.3 rpg)
said he can't wait to get into the Waves' new transition offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's probably something we've all wanted to do since we've
been here,'' he said. ``Last year we probably had the most athletic
team in the conference. Having a slowed-down game probably held us
back.''
</P>
<P>
   Big match: The 10th-ranked women's volleyball team, already a
top contender for the West Coast Conference championship, plays an
important nonleague match tonight at defending national champion
Long Beach State.
</P>
<P>
   Pepperdine is 11-1, 2-0 in the WCC. The Waves host Loyola
Marymount on Saturday night at 7.

CLINTON BLASTS SENATE OVER COURT DELAYS
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By MARC SANDALOW 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  WASHINGTON _ Decrying the Senate's record on judicial
confirmations as ``disgraceful,'' President Clinton called
Wednesday for a prompt vote on the nomination of a San Francisco
attorney and a Los Angeles judge whose appointments to federal
posts have been languishing for years.
<P>
   The appeal came one day after the Senate rejected Clinton's
nomination of Ronnie White, the first black justice on the Missouri
Supreme Court, to serve on the federal District Court. It was the
Senate's first rejection of a federal judicial nomination since the
1987 defeat of conservative jurist Robert Bork, who was nominated
to the Supreme Court by President Ronald Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton called the vote ``a disgraceful act of partisan
politics'' in a sharply delivered Rose Garden statement that echoed
the complaints of many Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republican-controlled Senate is adding credence to the
perceptions that they treat minority and women judicial nominees
unfairly and unequally,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   There are 42 judicial nominees awaiting confirmation by the
Senate, including six chosen for the Ninth Circuit U.S. Court of
Appeals in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton singled out Marsha Berzon, a San Francisco attorney, and
Richard Paez, a U.S. District Court judge in Los Angeles, in his
Rose Garden statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are both excellent candidates for the Ninth Circuit and
have been waiting for some time to receive a vote from the
Senate,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Paez was originally nominated in January 1997. Berzon was
nominated in January 1998. Another Ninth Circuit court nominee,
Raymond Fisher, was confirmed by the Senate on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., did not respond to
Clinton's call for a vote.
</P>
<P>
   The vacancies on the Ninth Circuit _ which has jurisdiction over
nine Western states, including California _ have contributed to a
long backlog of cases. The court receives about 9,000 cases a year.
Though it is alloted 28 judges, it has been between five and 10
judges short for the past several years.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a huge hole in that court,'' charged Sen. Barbara
Boxer, D-Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Court spokesman Mark Mendenhall suggested that the Ninth
Circuit's reputation for being too liberal _ and too large _ may be
part of what ``stands in the way of the fast approval of judges in
our court.'' A few years ago, Republicans in the Northeast tried
unsuccessfully to break the Ninth Circuit into two jurisdictions.
</P>
<P>
   Boxer had another explanation, suggesting that the race and
gender of the nominees is a factor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a bad feeling about this Senate about the way they are
treating women (and) minorities,'' Boxer said. Of the jurists she
has recommended to the court, white males have had a far easier
time being confirmed than either women or minorities, Boxer said.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans denied that race or gender has played any part in
their actions. Several insisted they did not even know White's race
when they voted Tuesday. Lott noted that nine of the last 21 judges
confirmed have been minorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their record and the kind of judge that the men and women
would make is the only thing that has been a factor,'' Lott said.
</P>
<P>
   The vacancies have forced the Ninth Circuit to rely on retired
jurists or visiting judges from other areas. Still, the average
time for disposition of the cases is about two months longer than
the national average.
</P>
<P>
   A recent study by Citizens for an Independent Court, a
nonpartisan judicial watchdog group, found that the Senate takes
163 more days, on average, to act on judicial nominations than it
did 20 years ago. It also found that Clinton has taken 75 more
days, on average, to nominate candidates than President Jimmy
Carter took 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The study also confirmed the allegation by Boxer and other
Democrats that the number of days between nomination and final
action for women candidates is greater than for men. Data were not
available to make the same comparisons based on race, the group
said.

PATTY HEARST STILL FACES LEGAL TROUBLES, DECADES AFTER
HER  TERRORIST DAYS
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By MICHAEL TAYLOR 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Despite the fact that she now has former
President Carter on her side in a bid for a presidential pardon,
Patty Hearst Shaw still has legal problems from her days as a
radical bank-robbing terrorist that may well cloud her efforts to
clear her name.
</P>
<P>
   The retired prosecutor responsible for Hearst's San Francisco
bank robbery conviction is firmly convinced of her guilt, and she
must also contend with her involvement in a Sacramento bank holdup
that left a customer dead. She may also be called to testify in the
trial of her onetime radical chum, Kathleen Soliah, now known as
Sara Jane Olson.
</P>
<P>
   The White House declined comment on the potential pardon, but
Hearst's attorney, George Martinez, said his client ``is obviously
very moved by President Carter's support. She's been a model
citizen, and she deserves a pardon.''
</P>
<P>
   Several key figures in the saga said enough time has gone by to
allow her to be pardoned, including Olson.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel very sympathetic to Patty Hearst and wish her only the
best,'' Olson said through her San Francisco attorney, Stuart
Hanlon. ``I hope the pardon goes through.''
</P>
<P>
   Olson was an associate of Hearst 25 years ago, during the days
when the radical group called the Symbionese Liberation Army had
kidnapped newspaper heiress Hearst from her Berkeley apartment in
February 1974. Over a period of a few months, the SLA converted her
to their cause, and she helped them rob banks and was a fugitive
for more than a year.
</P>
<P>
   Hearst was captured in September 1975, convicted of bank robbery
in March 1976 and sent to federal prison. In February 1979,
President Carter commuted her sentence to time served, and she was
freed.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, she has married her former bodyguard, produced two
children, written a couple of books and appeared in a few movies.
She lives in a wealthy Connecticut suburb of New York.
</P>
<P>
   Olson, once a hanger-on to the SLA and, for the past 23 years, a
fugitive on bomb-related charges, was captured on June 16 in St.
Paul, Minn., where she was living an upscale life _ similar to
Hearst's _ as a doctor's wife, acting in local plays and cooking
gourmet meals.
</P>
<P>
   Olson, now free on bail, is scheduled to go on trial in Los
Angeles in January on explosives and murder conspiracy charges. The
Los Angeles County district attorney has asked a Connecticut judge
to compel Hearst to be a witness in the Olson case, and her
attorney says ``it's no secret that she doesn't want to give
testimony.''
</P>
<P>
   Hearst is also implicated in the April 21, 1975, robbery of a
Crocker Bank branch in the Sacramento suburb of Carmichael. Hearst
admitted in her book that she had been driving the getaway car.
During the robbery, Myrna Lee Opsahl, 42, the wife of a Sacramento
surgeon, was shot to death. Hearst says SLA member Emily Harris
pulled the trigger, but Sacramento County authorities say they
still want to talk to Hearst about the robbery.
</P>
<P>
   Olson's brother, Steven, was the only person charged in the
case. He was acquitted in a 1976 federal court trial.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, the dead woman's husband, Dr. Trygve Opsahl, revealed
that more than 20 years ago, the Hearst family, along with the
bank, quietly paid a substantial amount of money to settle a
lawsuit the Opsahl family had filed against the bank.
</P>
<P>
   ``If she claims she wasn't directly involved in the Carmichael
(robbery), why would her family pay to help settle a lawsuit?''
Opsahl said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Hearst first applied to the Department of Justice for a
presidential pardon in August 1988, according to Martinez. A
spokeswoman for the Justice Department would not comment on the
specifics of Hearst's application, but said, in general, pardon
requests are reviewed by government investigators and attorneys who
go out and interview all the principals in the criminal case.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of Hearst, that would mean talking to, among others,
James L. Browning. Browning was the chief federal prosecutor who
secured a conviction against Hearst in March 1976 for robbing a
branch of the Hibernia Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Browning, who has always been convinced that
Hearst was guilty, said, ``Her defense was physical duress, but it
never squared with the facts. When she was in that bank, she acted
with verve and great purpose, and she avoided apprehension for a
year and a half, when she had plenty of opportunities to walk away
and come home. The fact is she had joined them.''
</P>
<P>
   Hearst's attorney, Martinez, said, however, referring to
Hearst's claim that she was brainwashed and tortured by the SLA,
that ``people don't understand what happens if you are put in a
closet for two months and raped and beaten.''
</P>
<P>
   Olson's attorney, Hanlon, said that while ``Patty Hearst
deserves a pardon,'' the possibility ``raises some issues of
inequities in justice, issues of class and money. She could be the
first armed robber in the history of the United States to get a
pardon. I certainly feel bad for Patty Hearst, and she deserves
this, but so many others deserve this, and they don't have money.''
</P>
<P>
   The latest flurry over a possible presidential pardon for Hearst
came this week when Carter, who commuted her prison sentence 20
years ago, again called for a pardon.
</P>
<P>
   Carter had earlier broached the idea on CNN's ``Larry King
Live'' TV show in mid-September, when he and King were discussing
President Clinton's clemency deal allowing 11 militant Puerto Rican
nationalists to be freed from federal prisons.
</P>
<P>
   Carter told King that he thought President Clinton has ``been
very rare in the granting of pardons,'' referring to Clinton's
clemency for the Puerto Ricans.
</P>
<P>
   ``The particular pardon that I have been pursuing for the last
six or seven, or even more, years is Patty Hearst,'' Carter said.
``She has led a model life. ... She's been a perfect American
citizen. I commuted her sentence (in 1979), so she could get out of
jail, but I would like to see her get a pardon.''
</P>
<P>
   Hearst is the daughter of Randolph A. Hearst who, at the time
she was kidnapped, was publisher of the San Francisco Examiner, a
paper still owned by the New York-based Hearst Corp., which
recently announced its intention to buy The Chronicle for a
reported $660 million.

MEN WHO CHEAT PUT 3.5 MILLION WOMEN AT RISK OF DISEASE
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By CARL T. HALL 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  Men who secretly sleep around are putting 3.5 million
unsuspecting American women at risk of contracting the AIDS virus
or other sexually transmitted diseases, a new survey shows.
<P>
   Results highlighted the growing problem of indirect spread of
disease, particularly among female partners of HIV-positive men.
</P>
<P>
   ``A fair number of these people are underestimating their
risk,'' said Lawrence Finer, senior research associate at the New
York-based Alan Guttmacher Institute and co-author of the new
study, published in the latest issue of the institute's Family
Planning Perspectives journal.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that couples in which the man has multiple partners are
no more likely to use condoms than are strictly monogamous couples.
Few men, he added, are apt to suggest using protection with their
main partners after beginning a secret liaison.
</P>
<P>
   Based on surveys taken between 1988 and 1996, Finer and his
colleagues estimated that at least 17 million U.S. women _ or a
third of all sexually active females between the ages of 18 and 44
_ are at risk of contracting a sexually transmitted disease (STD),
through multiple partners.
</P>
<P>
   The estimate includes 5.4 million women who had more than one
sexual partner within the past year, 6.3 million who slept with a
man who had multiple partners, and 5.5 million who had both direct
and indirect risk.
</P>
<P>
   The study looked at the risks of disease spreading in
heterosexual relationships, and it focused mostly on male-to-female
indirect exposure because of insufficient survey data for risks to
men.
</P>
<P>
   Results showed no evidence of any recent increase in the
proportion of sexually active adults, male or female, with multiple
partners.
</P>
<P>
   Surveys in the late 1990s showed about 14 percent of men ages 18
to 44 said they had at least three partners within the prior year,
down from 18 percent in comparable surveys a decade earlier. For
women, the proportion held constant at about 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a public perception of increasing promiscuity, but the
data don't show that at all,'' Finer said.
</P>
<P>
   The survey found a substantial discrepancy between what men say
about their promiscuity and what women say about their male
partner's activities. Surveyors found that 24 percent of the men
reported having had more than one partner during the past year, far
higher than the 15 percent estimate from women asked about their
partner.
</P>
<P>
   The difference between the two findings led to the new estimate
of 3.5 million sexually active women unknowingly at risk of being
exposed to a sexually transmitted disease.
</P>
<P>
   Whether this risk actually leads to infection was left
unanswered in the Guttmacher study. Finer also conceded that some
men may simply have overstated their number of partners, although
it's also possible that some may have kept their dalliances hidden
even from the researchers.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the unknowns, the survey clearly showed that indirect
risks tend to be highest for younger, lower-income minority women,
particularly divorced women or women who have never been married.
</P>
<P>
   Formerly married women had odds seven times higher than married
women of being at risk, while the potential for indirect exposure
was nearly twice as high among women in their late teens as among
women in their 40s. All told, about two-thirds of sexually active,
unmarried women and teens are at risk of exposure through multiple
sex partners.
</P>
<P>
   Specialists in prevention of sexually transmitted diseases said
it behooves women to seek regular testing and weigh both their own
and their partner's risk factors. Another possibility is to use
birth control methods that provide some protection against
dangerous microbes.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first time we've had a national examination of
this issue,'' said Linda Alexander, president of the American
Social Health Association, a nonprofit based in Research Triangle,
N.C. ``We make all sorts of assumptions when we enter into sexual
relationships, and often the assumptions are not true. This is how
these epidemics continue to rage.''
</P>
<P>
   Close to 1 million people are thought to be carriers of the AIDS
virus, including about 300,000 unaware of their HIV-positive
status. New HIV infections are estimated at 40,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The epidemic is increasingly female,'' said Daniel Zingale,
executive director of AIDS Action, a Washington, D.C. advocacy and
research group.
</P>
<P>
   Relationships with men who have multiple sexual partners or who
inject drugs make women ``increasingly vulnerable,'' he added,
calling for more research into vaginal microbiocides as ``a
last-ditch defense.''
</P>
<P>
   Another obvious solution might be expanded HIV testing, although
the costs and benefits of a national education effort remain
controversial.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most men would act responsibly if they knew they were HIV
positive,'' Zingale said. ``The infected who don't know they're
infected are the ones we most desperately need to reach.''

 LET THEM EAT CAKE _ BUT NOT THE FROSTING  &HT;     By SCOTT OSTLER 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Remember Robocop? Forget him, he's a wimp.
</P>
<P>
   Make way for Logocop.
</P>
<P>
   If Logocop catches you eating the Bank of America's new logo,
you're going to wind up with more than indigestion, my friend.
</P>
<P>
   The furor started back in Charlotte, N.C., the headquarters of
the BofA. There was an employee get-together, the purpose being to
hammer them for donations to United Way.
</P>
<P>
   Cake was served. The frosting was decorated with the new BofA
logo. Folks ate the cake.
</P>
<P>
   Wrong! The bank's Brand Council, the department I refer to as
Logocop, fired off a stern memo warning employees that ``the logo
cannot be eaten.''
</P>
<P>
   Charlotte Observer columnist Doug Robarchek said he wasn't sure
what the Bank would do to the ``logovores,'' but suggested Other
Things You Can't Do With the BofA Logo: Tattoo it on chickens ...
Think about it naked ... Fraudulently misrepresent it as a sandwich
spread, building product or cure for the hives.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, out here in the BofA hinterlands, no cake-scarfing
scandal. But S.F. employees have received copies of the ``Branding
Manual,'' about 60 pages on how to respectfully and properly deal
with The Logo.
</P>
<P>
   You know, like the proper etiquette during mass nude bonfire
BofA logo-worship ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
   DOES DA MAYOR have an official campaign song?
</P>
<P>
   If not, he might want to have a listen to ``Poor Willie Brown,''
written in 1919 by C.R. Morse. It was performed in the old days by
the Cal Glee Club, and was recently unearthed by
archaeologist/cartoonist Phil Frank.
</P>
<P>
   First verse: ``There was a boy named Willie Brown who always was
in error/He cussed and swore with all his might, he was a holy
terror.''
</P>
<P>
   It wouldn't be exactly the traditional type of campaign song,
but it would show Willie's whimsical, self-deprecating side.
</P>
<P>
   BUSTED by the grammar posse: Yes, I made a mistake in a recent
column.
</P>
<P>
   ``Criteria,'' it turns out, is no longer a singular noun. I
never got the memo. Must have been the decade my fax machine was
out of paper.
</P>
<P>
   Seriously, I shoulda knowd better, especially since I once drove
a Ford Criterion, which required plural mechanics.
</P>
<P>
   MARTHA STEWART would be proud. Now we've got geographically
correct food for NFL watching:
</P>
<P>
   At Knuckles sports bar in Palo Alto, owner Laurie Paulson is
thinking of serving Wisconsin bratwurst for the 49ers-Packers game.
</P>
<P>
   Then, who knows? Maybe Philly cheesesteak, Baltimore crab cakes,
Carolina cornpone?
</P>
<P>
   Claude Beaver heard of the plan and wonders what to serve for
the Washington Redskins game. Barrelled Pork? Curried Crow?
</P>
<P>
   For sure, after-dinner cigars.
</P>
<P>
   What about next time the 49ers play the Raiders? I'd go with
tailpipe-smoked ribs and Jack Daniel's Popsicles.
</P>
<P>
   YOU KNOW you're in Berkeley when you see (as Darleen Dhillon
did) a Ford Wrangler with the following sign painted neatly on the
door: ``INCAHOOTS _ Importer of fine owls from Peru.''
</P>
<P>
   NOT SURE if this is good news or bad, but in the Compass Rose at
the St. Francis, the 1906 signature dish Celery Victor is back on
the menu.
</P>
<P>
   Some things from '06 we just don't want to see again, so here's
hoping the new Celery Victor is not an earthshaking dish.
</P>
<P>
   FLEET WEEK is here, with all the noise (Blue Angels, thousands
of sailors invading North Beach) and pageantry. But there will be
quieter moments.
</P>
<P>
   The submarine San Francisco will be docked at Alameda, and
Sunday at 10 a.m., the crew will head to San Francisco and out to
Lands End.
</P>
<P>
   They'll hold a memorial and lay a wreath on the shell-pocked
bridge from the first vessel named San Francisco, a warship that
suffered fatal damage at Guadalcanal in '42.
</P>
<P>
   That original San Francisco produced five Medal of Honor
recipients in the long and bloody fight, and hundreds of heroes,
alive and dead; on Sunday, some new sailors from a new ship will
remember.

WILLIAMS GENERATING MUCH INTEREST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STEVE IRVINE  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The business cards piling up in Mike Fitch's desk at Mayfair
High tell the story of the interest that Mike Williams and several
other Monsoon seniors have generated among college coaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``There must be 45 of them,'' Fitch said mentioning USC's Paul
Hackett, Arizona's State's Bruce Snyder, UCLA's Bob Toledo, UNLV's
John Robinson and Washington State's Mike Price among the head
coaches who have stopped by since last spring. ``Some of them have
been head coaches and some have been assistant coaches, but pretty
much everybody has stopped by.''
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot, 195-pound Williams is the player drawing the most
attention. According to Fitch, Williams has already been offered
scholarships by nearly every Pac-10 school, including USC and UCLA,
as well as Michigan, Notre Dame, Texas A&AMP;M, Nebraska, Tennessee and
Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   The favorites, at least now, seem to be Arizona State or
Michigan, if he decides to leave Southern California. However, UCLA
and USC are also at the top of his list. Williams has former
Mayfair teammates at Arizona State (fullback Darrell Turner) and
USC (offensive guard Zach Wilson).
</P>
<P>
   Williams has the ability to play several positions in college,
including cornerback, safety and receiver. But, according to Fitch,
there is one position that colleges should want him to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``The smart ones will recruit him at tailback,'' said Fitch.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, who took an unofficial visit to Arizona State this
past Saturday to see the Sun Devils play UCLA, has shown his
offensive versatility this season with touchdowns receiving,
rushing and kick returning.
</P>
<P>
   ``His ability to catch the ball separates him from anyone
else,'' Fitch said.
</P>
<P>
   Another strength for Williams, who may consider studying
medicine, is academics.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not a kid that will go (to a college) to party and have
fun,'' Fitch said. ``He's a kid who'll get his degree in four
years.''
</P>
<P>
   The other Mayfair players drawing interest from college coaches
include two way-linemen Marcus Johnson and Jesse Bender,
fullback-linebacker Terrence Young and receiver Joe Hunter.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, who is 6-foot-3 and 291 pounds, has trips planned to
Arizona State, Washington and Kansas. Other trips could come to
Washington State, UNLV or Idaho.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people are looking at him as a defensive tackle who
can get up the field and go,'' Fitch said. ``He's really into
karate, which makes him very flexible. He also has good feet for a
big man.''
</P>
<P>
   Bender, who is 6-foot-3 and 285 pounds, will probably take a
trip to Arizona State and Washington with Johnson. Other schools
he's considering include Idaho State, UNLV, Utah, Utah State and
Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   Both Bender and Johnson bench press more than 350 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Young, a 5-foot-11, 230-pounder with a top bench press of 370
pounds, was offered in the spring by UNLV and Idaho State.
</P>
<P>
   Hunter, who is 5-foot-11 and 160 pounds, has been approached by
Arizona State, Kansas, Idaho State, Cal State Northridge, Utah and
Utah State.
</P>
<P>
   Fitch and his coaching staff have built a program that college
scouts have become familiar with over the past few years. In
addition to Turner at ASU and Wilson at USC, Mayfair, which won the
CIF Southern Section Division IX title last season, also sent
quarterback Mike Harrison to Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   But Fitch has never been busier when it comes to selling his
players. One of the most time-consuming chores is making copies of
game films to send to colleges, which has become a daily
after-practice task for the Mayfair coaching staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm Mr. AV (audio-visual) man,'' Fitch said.

HOUSTON, WATCH OUT FOR NFL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PAUL OBERJUERGE  
 San Bernardino County Sun  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Houston, you've got a problem.
</P>
<P>
   The National Football League is coming to your town, and it
wants something like $1.75 billion. Preferably in small, unmarked
bills.
</P>
<P>
   Hey, Houston, how does it feel to be shaken down by the greatest
extortionists in sports? Better check to see if the NFL took your
watches; we know they got your wallets.
</P>
<P>
   The short-sighted and simple-minded celebrated in Houston last
night after the NFL awarded them its 32nd franchise, an expansion
team to begin play in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   For the privilege of watching a hapless team fall face-first in
its town eight times a year, a Houston businessman will give the
NFL $700 million in cash, the city will build a $310 million
stadium and, an NFL owner gloated, the city, county and state will
ante up something like $900 million for infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
   ``When an ownership group comes together with local and state
government to the tune of $1.75 billion to bring the NFL to a
city,'' New Orleans Saints owner Tom Benson said, ``it demonstrates
the many positives of having an NFL team in your city.''
</P>
<P>
   Hah! It demonstrates the great gullibility of football-crazed
Houstonians, who apparently are so flush in cash they don't need
nearly $2 billion of it.
</P>
<P>
   Thank you, Houston, for saving Los Angeles from this folly.
</P>
<P>
   Not that L.A. was ready to make a mistake of that magnitude.
Michael Ovitz had scraped together a franchise fee of, maybe, $550
million, and there was no public money for a stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL dismissed that bid as sadly inadequate, and jumped on
Bob McNair's offer of $700 mill _ primarily because each of the 31
existing franchises gets $4.8 million more from Houston than it
would from L.A.
</P>
<P>
   For the umpteenth time, Los Angeles proved it is not some
pathetic wannabe-great metropolis that feels naked without an NFL
franchise.
</P>
<P>
   Some will criticize Los Angeles city, county and state officials
for not pursuing the expansion team more vigorously. Mayor Richard
Riordan seems to come in for heavy criticism.
</P>
<P>
   That is wrong. The politicians in this case should be commended,
for they perfectly read the sentiment of city and state voters _ no
public money for NFL billionaires.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL is not worth $1.75 billion. No sports franchise is.
</P>
<P>
   Politicos also picked up on the apathy of SoCal sports fans for
the NFL. Even NFL commission Paul Tagliabue felt it. He said the
Houston franchise was ``virtually certain to be a guaranteed
success, and that we didn't have that kind of pulse in Los
Angeles.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, it's the NFL that barely has a pulse in increasingly
unconcerned Los Angeles, and instead of dealing with this emergency
the league is going to Houston.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL still hasn't diagnosed the cancer in its guts _ no team
in the entertainment capital of the world _ because it is chasing
the fattest franchise fees it can find.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, SoCal sports fans care a little less every day.
Houston got a franchise? Cool for them. Wanna go roller-blading?
</P>
<P>
   What's next? It's up the NFL. It has several teams that want
bigger and better stadiums. If one of them wants to come here (with
no franchise fee), fine. Maybe SoCal will help build a stadium.
Don't count on it.
</P>
<P>
   Heck, we might even consider Al Davis and the Raiders. If he'll
play in the Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday was a red-letter day in L.A. sports history. It had a
chance to make a huge, expensive mistake, but its resolve to be
fiscally responsible never failed.
</P>
<P>
   Houston, meanwhile, mortgaged the farm, the oil wells and the
Astrodome. Hope they really enjoy that team.

ROOKIE MONTOYA DRIVING TO STARDOM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DOUG PADILLA  
 San Bernardino County Sun  
<TEXT>
<P>
   FONTANA, Calif. _ The high speeds and fast lifestyle that go
with being a successful CART driver provide enough of a thrill for
rookie sensation Juan Montoya.
</P>
<P>
   Proving he has no sense of theater, the series points leader is
hoping that the season-ending Marlboro 500 at California Speedway
on Oct.31 is reduced to a glorified exhibition.
</P>
<P>
   The 23-year-old Colombia native would rather wrap up the series
points title in Australia next weekend than see it all on the line
during the last lap at Fontana.
</P>
<P>
   A neck-and-neck battle to the finish _ and the championship _
with Dario Franchitti would do wonders for open-wheel racing in
general and CART in particular.
</P>
<P>
   But Montoya can do without the high drama.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh no, nobody wants that,'' Montoya said Wednesday between
practice runs at California Speedway. ``I'm sure the public wants
that, but we don't want it. Drivers and teams don't want that. We
prefer to win it in a different way.''
</P>
<P>
   What the Target/Chip Ganassi driver prefers is a signed and
sealed points title, and he laments the fact that it isn't. The
next best scenario is that he rides a championship wave out of
Surfer's Paradise, CART's next-to-last stop on Oct.17.
</P>
<P>
   Montoya is nearing the end of the best rookie season in CART
history. His seven victories are a rookie record. He has won seven
poles and twice this season has won three consecutive races. He has
a 13-point lead in the standings over Franchitti. (A race victory
is worth 20 points.)
</P>
<P>
   He learned of his newfound fame last week, when he was mobbed
everywhere he went on a visit to his home in Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the expectations at the beginning of the season were
high, but I don't think anybody would have said or thought that he
would have the success that he has had,'' team managing director
Tom Anderson said. ``I think we thought his learning curve would be
longer. The fact is, you only have to show him something once and
he's got it.''
</P>
<P>
   It's amazing stuff from a young man who seems older than his
years on the track and much younger off it.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Montoya rode a gas-powered scooter around the
garage and pit areas, was showing off a giant portfolio of his
uncle's auto-racing photos, and even took a German luxury car for a
spin on California Speedway's 2-mile oval.
</P>
<P>
   Yet put him in his 800-horsepower Reynard 99I Honda, and the kid
becomes as focused as any racing veteran.
</P>
<P>
   While team owner Chip Ganassi had been told of a Montoya's
potential over a year ago, it was team chief engineer Morris Nunn
who eventually gave the approval to sign the driver. Montoya had
competed in Formula 3000 in Europe the previous three seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Both Ganassi and Morris went to Barcelona, Spain, just over a
year ago, to watch Montoya on a test track. The team needed to
replace Alex Zanardi, who moved to Formula One this year after
winning the last two CART championships.
</P>
<P>
   ``He showed raw speed, car control and confidence'' said the
61-year-old Nunn, who has worked on Champ cars since 1984. ``I
never heard of him before I went to Barcelona, I had never seen him
or heard of him. We judged it solely on what we saw in Barcelona
and we were very impressed.''
</P>
<P>
   Just after signing with Ganassi's team a year ago, Montoya was
at Fontana to watch practice for last year's Marlboro 500. A road
and street racer by nature, Montoya wanted to see what oval racing
was all about.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was my first time and I thought it was really quick,''
Montoya said. ``It was something new and it was interesting. I went
to Turn1, on the outside, to watch and (my eyes) were pretty big, I
can tell you that.''
</P>
<P>
   It didn't take Montoya long to get used to driving in circles.
His first victory came at the street race in Long Beach earlier
this year. He won the following week at Nazareth, Pa., in just his
third career race on an oval.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't expect to win on ovals, but now, I like them,''
Montoya said. ``If you feel comfortable and like to drive it, then
you are at an advantage already. That's the most difficult part, to
get comfortable as you drive it. I knew it was going to be tough. I
just wanted to get a bit better and a bit better.''
</P>
<P>
   He even has devised a philosophy for driving in 500-mile races,
and it might be something he could apply to everyday life.
</P>
<P>
   ``You need to relax yourself and enjoy the ride,'' he said.
``It's a long ride, so enjoy it.''

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: No warm feelings for drug tests
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   School boards hot to order their teachers to tinkle for them
would do well to chill out instead. Yes, the Supreme Court just
blew off a legal challenge to one district's requirement that
teaching applicants take drug tests. But the operating sanction for
public-sector or legally mandated drug testing is still that the
job must be safety-sensitive.
</P>
<P>
   An appellate court's finding that teaching involves safety
concerns on some rough par with law enforcement or firefighting
seems a considerable stretch. Best to await a definitive high court
ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Meantime, public and private employers alike might profitably
use the interim to study a recent report by the American Civil
Liberties Union that calls the usefulness of drug testing into
serious question.
</P>
<P>
   Still fairly limited where the Constitution reaches, drug tests
are virtually epidemic in the private sector. Going on 50 million
employees work under one or another testing regime. Testing is a $1
billion industry that aggressively markets its programs.
</P>
<P>
   Is that money well spent? Avoiding even one drug-addled employee
who might create an outsized legal liability is worth a pretty
penny, but on average and in the case of most jobs, drug testing
seems a solution in search of a problem.
</P>
<P>
   Drug testing mainly catches marijuana users, but what is the
point? Only about 5 percent of Americans use marijuana with any
frequency and only a fifth of those _ 1 percent of the work force _
use it more or less daily. Hard drug use is even rarer.
</P>
<P>
   A report by the National Academy of Sciences found that illegal
drugs contribute little to work accidents and that the effects of
off-duty use are negligible, about the same as the effects of
off-duty drinking.
</P>
<P>
   There are embarrassing moments for testers in the research. A
study of 63 high-tech companies, reported last year in the magazine
Working USA, found that productivity was 16 percent lower in firms
with pre-employment drug testing than in firms with no testing _
and 29 percent lower in firms with both pre-employment and random
testing. Whoops.
</P>
<P>
   A 1991 analysis calculated that it cost the federal government
$77,000 to catch each drug user. Even discounting for government
inefficiency, the price is steep to finger employees who for the
most part have no on-the-job drug problems.
</P>
<P>
   There's a reasonable case for testing employees whose
performance suggests a possible drug problem and for testing the
limited numbers of workers who have substantial public-safety
responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
   But commercial huckstering and political pressure are forcing
ever more employees into intrusive and humiliating drug tests. A
Seattle ordinance would require tests for ushers and librarians!
</P>
<P>
   Unless the Supreme Court begins enforcing its original limits
firmly and unless employers develop some sense of proportion, we'll
be reduced from a nation of free citizens to a shuffling line of
suspects with specimen cups in one hand and, for about half of us,
it bears not saying what in the other.

 &HT;    SCIENTISTS WILL TRY TO DUPLICATE EXTINCT SPECIES
 &HT;    For release Sunday, Oct. 10.
 &HT;    By MARILYN GEEWAX
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Many scientists believe that in the coming century, thousands of
species will disappear from the Earth in a wave of mass
extinctions, similar to the death spasm that wiped out dinosaurs
about 65 million years ago. Pollution, destruction of trees, global
warming and other man-made problems will trigger these extinctions,
ecologists say.
</P>
<P>
   The elimination process appears to be well under way, with
hundreds of species already having been certified extinct in the
past hundred years. Indeed, humans may have set off the first
ripple of this long wave of extinctions some 11,000 years ago, give
or take a millennium. That's when people got good at hunting large
animals, including the once-flourishing mastodons, saber-toothed
tigers, giant ground sloths, North American camels and lions.
</P>
<P>
   With the human population now soaring above 6 billion,
ecologists say the loss of forests, wetlands and other habitats
will further reduce the number of large animals, such as giraffes,
pandas and tigers, leaving us with only ``weedy'' species that
procreate under almost any circumstances. In other words, the fauna
of the future will be cockroaches, pigeons and rats.
</P>
<P>
   But ironically, while most humans are inadvertently contributing
to the thinning of the four-legged ranks, a few are looking for
ways to restore species that have been extinct for eons. If they
are successful, humans in the 21st century may witness both mass
extinctions and astonishing revivals, as different species from
different eras meet opposite fates.
</P>
<P>
   One international team of scientists is trying to breathe new
life into the woolly mammoth with the help of ancient DNA and
modern cloning methods. They hope to duplicate a male mammoth,
discovered two years ago by a young reindeer herder in Siberia, by
removing its ice-encapsulated carcass from the Taimyr Peninsula.
The body will be flown more than 200 miles to the city of Khatanga,
where it will be kept frozen in an underground tunnel as
researchers conduct tests.
</P>
<P>
   When alive about 23,000 years ago, the hairy beast stood 11 feet
tall. If the scientists can pull off a biological miracle, a chip
off the old mammoth will reach that height again. They plan to take
DNA from the extinct creature and put it into an Asian elephant's
egg, which will be stripped of its elephant genes. Then when the
elephant gives birth, out will pop a perfect replica of the big
beast that died in the ice field.
</P>
<P>
   Many scientists say the plan won't work because cloning requires
live nuclei. Developers who want to start planning the first real
``Jurassic Park'' for once-extinct animals may want to wait and see
whether the revival is a success. But given the advances science
already has made with cloning sheep, some believe it won't be long
before extinct species can be resurrected.
</P>
<P>
   Given how quickly species may be disappearing in the 21st
century, the ability to raise the dead could come in handy.

HYBRID ELECTRIC ENGINES: LESS FUEL, LESS POLLUTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Honda's new Insight is an odd-looking car, resembling a mutant
Honda Civic. But the swoopy styling of the little coupe isn't
nearly as adventurous as what lurks beneath the sheet metal.
</P>
<P>
   For the Insight (www.honda2000.com/insight/homepage.html) is a
new kind of car, one that combines electric and gasoline power
under the same hood. The Insight really is a mutant _ or rather, a
hybrid. And it'll be joined on the market next year by Toyota's
entry, a five-passenger sedan called the Prius that's already sold
28,000 units in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Both of these cars take a clever approach to car design that
promises lower fuel consumption and less air pollution, while
delivering a car that the typical consumer would actually want to
drive. ``It is a brand new technology on a brand new platform,''
says Mark Amstock, Toyota's national marketing manager for the
Prius hybrid (www.toyota.com/afv/prius/intro).
</P>
<P>
   If all you want is a clean machine, you can go with an
all-electric car powered by batteries. General Motors has been
leasing its EV1 all-electric car (www.gmev.com) since 1997. But so
far, only a few buyers have signed on. Consumers have rejected a
car that has to be plugged into an electric socket every 60 miles,
for a recharge that can take up to three hours.
</P>
<P>
   So engineers decided on a different tack _ a combination of
electric and internal-combustion power, where each type of motor
would help to overcome the deficiencies of the other. By adding an
electric motor, a hybrid gets good acceleration without having to
burn as much gasoline. By keeping a gasoline motor, the hybrid can
keep its batteries fully charged at all times. It can also use a
far smaller battery pack, weighing around 100 pounds instead of the
1,200 pounds of the all-electric EV1.
</P>
<P>
   In a hybrid car, you'll find a small gasoline or diesel engine
with a transaxle linking the power plant to the front wheels. So
far, so ordinary.
</P>
<P>
   But in the Toyota Prius, an electric motor and a generator are
attached to the transmission. The generator, driven by the car's
58-horsepower gasoline motor, recharges the 135-pound battery pack,
and can provide power for the 40-horsepower electric motor as well.
</P>
<P>
   A sophisticated computer system constantly regulates the gas
engine, electric motor and generator, using each in the most
efficient way possible. Say you're pulling away from a stoplight.
That requires lots of torque _ the actual turning power delivered
by an engine. As it happens, electric motors provide torque more
efficiently than a gas engine. So the Prius will disengage the gas
engine from the transmission and feed all its power to the electric
generator. That power goes to the electric motor, which transmits
it through the transaxle to the wheels.
</P>
<P>
   But once the car is rolling along at a good clip, it's more
efficient to rely on the gasoline engine for turning the wheels.
The electric motor is shut off and the generator is used if the
battery needs topping off.
</P>
<P>
   Honda's Insight does it all a bit differently. The Insight has
no generator, just an electric motor powered by a battery. Once
again, the electric motor kicks in under those driving conditions
that suit it best.
</P>
<P>
   But how does the Insight recharge its battery without a
generator? In fact, it does have a generator: the electric motor
itself. Run an electric motor in reverse, and it generates
electricity. So when the Insight is cruising, its electric motor
</P>
<P>
   can recharge the car's battery.
</P>
<P>
   Both the Prius and the Insight take advantage of this principle
at every stop light, in a technique called ``regenerative
braking.'' Tap the brake, and the electric motor of the hybrid
connects to the transmission. The motor runs in reverse, generating
electricity and recharging the battery. Meanwhile, the car slows
down as its forward momentum is used to spin the electric
motor-turned-generator.
</P>
<P>
   Regenerative braking is vital to a hybrid's efficiency.
Traditional brakes just discard the energy of a car's momentum,
turning it into waste heat. Hybrids still use traditional hydraulic
brakes as well. But their regenerative braking systems let hybrids
capture some of the car's lost momentum, then reuse it to get the
car rolling again.
</P>
<P>
   Hybrid cars still burn fossil fuel, just not as much as
traditional cars. Toyota's Prius, somewhat larger than the
company's Corolla compact sedans, gets about 55 miles per gallon.
The Insight, a two-passenger coupe, should deliver more than 60
miles per gallon.
</P>
<P>
   These fuel savings also mean a sharp reduction in greenhouse gas
emissions. That's why Dan Becker is such a fan. Becker, director of
the global warming and energy program for the Sierra Club, reckons
that over its lifespan, a typical Ford Taurus sedan will dump 64
tons of carbon dioxide into the Earth's atmosphere. A Prius would
contribute only 27 tons.
</P>
<P>
   And unlike pure electric cars, the user of a hybrid doesn't have
a rubber band on his bumper, dragging him back home every 60 miles
or so to recharge his ride. With a hybrid, says Becker, ``You can
do everything you want to do, anywhere you want to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Becker may be even happier in a few years, if scientists in
Japan and the United States find ways to abandon gasoline for
cleaner fuels. The ultimate goal is a car powered by a fuel cell; a
system in which hydrogen and oxygen are mixed together in the
presence of a chemical catalyst. The only byproducts of this
reaction are water and electricity, so a fuel cell could be used to
drive ultraclean electric cars.
</P>
<P>
   But nobody expects to see fuel cell cars for another decade.
Fuel is a big problem; to carry enough hydrogen, the gas must be
stored under high pressure, in a big heavy steel tank that uses up
much of the car's carrying capacity. Besides, there are no hydrogen
filling stations on the nation's street corners. So for now,
gasoline-powered hybrids are likely to be the energy-efficiency
champs.
</P>
<P>
   That's good news for the Japanese. Inspired by the high gas
prices of their homeland, Japanese firms have taken a big lead in
hybrid development, with American automakers lagging years behind.
GM, Ford, and DaimlerChrysler have yet to announce when they'll
start selling hybrids. But the Big Three have joined with the
federal government in a research consortium that's developing
hybrid technologies.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Kizer, director of powertrain and electrical engineering
at DaimlerChrysler, said his company is focusing on mild hybrids,
or ``mibrids.'' These will be cars and trucks where a traditional
gasoline or diesel engine still does the great bulk of the work,
using an electric motor only for the occasional assist.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're looking for is the proper balance between the cost
and the benefit,'' said Kizer.
</P>
<P>
   Both Honda and Toyota think they've already found it. Soon we'll
see if American consumers agree.

SATELLITE RADIO IS ALL ABOUT MUSIC 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Admit it: You've grown accustomed to chatter on the radio.
All-news stations, talk shows, even commercials fill the airwaves
with words. Sure, you can slide in a tape or CD to escape it, but
by and large, you've learned to live with talk as part of the radio
experience, especially when you're behind the wheel.
</P>
<P>
   That's about to change, thanks to satellite radio and its
promise of channels filled with all music, all the time.
</P>
<P>
   For consumers willing to plunk down $200 for a new car radio
receiver, plus a $10 monthly service fee, both XM Satellite Radio
of Washington, DC (www.xmradio.com) and rival CD Radio of Manhattan
(www.cdradio.com) are hoping to change the way people think about
music and driving.
</P>
<P>
   Currently the only two companies licensed by the Federal
Communications Commission to provide satellite radio service, both
plan to provide largely commercial-free programming using competing
satellite networks. Both companies are scheduled to launch their
service within a few months of each other at the tail end of 2000
and the beginning of 2001.
</P>
<P>
   XM Radio recently filed for an initial public offering and is in
the midst of an SEC-mandated ``quiet period'' that prevents its
employees from publicly commenting on the company's future. CD
Radio, which has been public since 1994, recently filed for an
additional round of funding, and is also in the midst of a quiet
period.
</P>
<P>
   Both companies believe consumers not only will like the lack of
advertising on many channels, but also will be willing to pay for
the high quality sound, coast-to-coast coverage, and wide range of
choice that will be available among the approximately 100 channels
of programming that both CD Radio and XM Radio will offer.
</P>
<P>
   Of these 100 channels, both companies plan to devote about half
to all-music formats while offering a range of news, sports,
foreign language, and more traditional talk programming on the
remaining channels.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers will be able to buy a packaged adapter and antenna set
that will enable existing car sound systems to receive satellite
signals, or they can purchase fully integrated systems to replace
their existing units, much like people currently upgrade car
radios.
</P>
<P>
   In late 2000 and early 2001, selected Ford models are scheduled
to arrive from the factory with CD Radio receivers; XM Radio has a
similar deal with a select, but so far unannounced, number of
General Motors models.
</P>
<P>
   Once consumers properly equip their cars with the antenna and
receiver, and pay the subscriber fee, they'll be ready to start
receiving programming. Beamed in the form of a data stream, both CD
Radio and XM Radio will uplink programming from their respective
studios to a satellite positioned near or above the United States.
From the satellite, the data stream will be bounced back or
reflected to a car antenna equipped to receive a satellite transmis
</P>
<P>
   sion. The antenna, in turn, moves the signal to the receiver,
which processes and plays the music in digital quality sound.
</P>
<P>
   Because satellite radio broadcasts will consist of data streams,
and not traditional audio waves, each company plans to include more
than just music as part of its package. As each song is played, the
receiver could display the name and length of the song, the name of
the artist, plus information about where to purchase the music or
even tickets for concerts by that artist.
</P>
<P>
   Although both companies project relatively inexpensive costs for
consumers, each face steep development costs. Programming costs
aside, each company is spending millions to implement a network of
two (in the case of XM Radio) or three (in the case of CD Radio)
satellites, enough to ensure that at least one satellite will be
orbiting above North America at all times.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, both CD Radio and XM Radio need to develop a
so-called terrestrial repeater network that will bridge the gaps in
service that will exist in the so-called urban canyons in the
downtown areas of virtually every major U.S. metropolitan area.
These repeaters, which function similarly to the way cell phone
towers re-broadcast signals to mobile phone users, will be placed
on existing buildings or towers in upwards of 50 cities to ensure
complete coverage.
</P>
<P>
   CD Radio and XM Radio will compete in the satellite radio market
(the receivers will not be compatible, so consumers will likely
choose only one service or the other). However, satellite
technology itself won't force listeners to give up their
traditional AM or FM habits unless they want to.
</P>
<P>
   So, as commuting times across the nation creep higher and
higher, and as the consumer demand for convergence and choice
continues to expand, will satellite radio strike a chord with
drivers? Or will they still be tuned to talk radio, Top 40, or
classic rock favorites?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe someone will do a call-in show to find out.

 &HT;    Book of King's correspondence a good read
 &HT;    By Jay Milner
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Most people's do, I suppose, but Texas writer Larry L. King's
career seems to go in cycles.
</P>
<P>
   In the last letter in King's new book, ``A Life in Letters, or,
Reflections from a Bloodshot Eye'' (TCU Press), the East Texas
native who has lived in Washington, D.C., for a number of years,
chats with his friend, Dr. Stanley Gilbert of Dallas, about his
up-and-down career.
</P>
<P>
   King writes ``Pat Oliphant (the political cartoonist) said to me
at lunch on Friday, `Your career seems to go in cycles. Have you
ever noticed that?' Well, yes, I have and thank Sweet Jesus, it is
on an up-cycle now.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oliphant was reacting to the fresh news that (1) The Executive
Committee at Ford's Theater has newly offered me their mid-January
through February slot next year for my play `The Dead President's
Club.' (2) Both Texas Monthly and The Washington Magazine ... want
to buy excerpts from my Letters book coming in October from TCU
Press and (3) that I am writing a `funny' about living in the
Nation's Capital for Crown Publishing of New York ... Some things
can't be explained easily. Why, suddenly, are more people
interested in doing the original 'Whorehouse,' 'The Night Hank
Williams Died' and even the old 1979 play 'The Kingfish'? And why
is New York interested in me again after years of indifference? And
why are more people asking me to speak or read? All this after a
long period when it seemed to me I somehow couldn't get arrested?''
</P>
<P>
   King, as you may or may not recall, was, way back in the 1960s,
a former congressional administrative aide who had given up that
semi-comfortable career to become a writer. For years he was one of
the few full-time magazine writers in the United States who made a
living at it. He used to travel from coast-to-coast interviewing
this and that celebrity or kook or politician, or what have you,
for magazines such as Harpers, Life and Esquire. Along the way, he
published a novel titled ``The One Eyed Man.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, he was persuaded by a New York playwright to join him in
writing a play based on an article King had written for Esquire
about a famous whorehouse in South Texas called ``The Chicken
Ranch.'' They called it ``The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas.''
The rest, as they say, is history. King and his cohort made
millions on the play which became a big hit on Broadway, then a
movie that wasn't a hit but made some money, and even today is
being produced by high school and college groups to add even more
to King's bank account.
</P>
<P>
   He has since written several books, including my favorite ``The
Whorehouse Papers,'' a memoir about writing and going through the
rigors of getting the play ready for Broadway audiences that reads
like a suspenseful novel.
</P>
<P>
   He has also continued to write magazine pieces, other plays and
a sequel to ``The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas'' that wasn't
exactly a hit, but did open on Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   Being a compulsive writer, King also during those years typed
out letters to friends around the country, telling us what he'd
been up to and what he thought about just about everything. This
month, the Texas Christian University Press has released a hardback
copy of more than 400 pages of those letters, with comments by the
editor, Richard A. Holland, an Austin scholar who until recently,
was curator of the University of Southwest Texas Southwestern
Writers Collection of manuscripts and photographs.
</P>
<P>
   As indicated above, a number of the letters in this new,
anxiously awaited book are to yours truly, since King and I have
been friends since the middle 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   But that's not the reason I call your attention to this book.
The reason for that is that it is a book that does a number of
enjoyable and provocative things for and to its readers. It is
funny, extremely informative about the life and times of a Texas
writer and his friends and relatives _ including that famous rabble
of Texas writers and picker poets, the members of Maddog Inc.
(''Doing indefinable services to mankind.''). The group is
chronicled in a recent book titled ``Confessions of a Maddog'' by
Jay Dunston Milner (University of North Texas Press) that is
available at your friendly neighborhood bookstore as well as on the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Books of letters are not always the most fun volumes to read,
but trust me folks, this one is. Besides yours truly, King's
correspondence is aimed at former Congressman Morris Udal, a
longtime buddy in our nation's capitol; Frank Rich, New York Times
columnist; the editors of various magazines he wrote for; H. Allen
Smith, the Yankee writer who moved to southwest Texas because he
felt he would love it there but didn't; his agent; and on and on,
the famous, infamous, and just ordinary people, if there be such as
that in King's Rolodex.
</P>
<P>
   The arrangement of the letters, from the early '60s to 1999
tells the story of much more than Larry L. King's life. This is a
good one, one you'll be reading snippets and chapters from for a
long time, and reading some of them over and over.

 &HT;    The visit of a very special niece of mine
 &HT;    By GARY BORDERS
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NACOGDOCHES, Texas _ My youngest niece came to visit the other
day, accompanied by the rest of her doting brood: my brother, his
wife, and their other two children. My parents made the trip down,
too, along with an aunt visiting from California. Ostensibly, they
were down to visit us, but really, Christina was the main
attraction.
</P>
<P>
   Christina is what's called these days a special child. She has
Down syndrome. The doctors say she is testing well on intelligence
measures, and though she has the round face and distinctive eyes of
a Down child, she appears in most ways to be a normal 2
1/2-year-old child, with long blond hair, chubby cheeks and blue
eyes.
</P>
<P>
   I take that back. She's far from normal. Christina is
extraordinarily sweet-natured, a child that smiles constantly,
rarely if ever cries, and is content watching ``Sesame Street'' and
flipping through her picture books. She has turned into quite the
ham since I last saw her around Christmas. She's learned to walk,
says a few words, and loves to give high-fives, to play peek-a-boo,
to dance with the Teletubbies _ and to get into anything that's
within arm's length.
</P>
<P>
   She discovered the cat bowl first off and immediately began
chunking handfuls of dry cat food across the wooden floor while
jabbering excitedly to herself. I moved her away and cleaned up the
food, but it's been a while since I've had to babyproof a house, so
I didn't move the cat bowl. Five minutes later, she was back
hurling the cat food like she was tossing rice at a wedding.
Finally, I wised up and put the bowl outside.
</P>
<P>
   Christina kept us entertained for an afternoon, going from
relative to relative, exchanging high fives and playful punches on
the leg. When her mom exhorted her to ``Be nice,'' she immediately
puckered up to give a kiss to whoever _ or whatever _ was closest.
</P>
<P>
   She doesn't say much yet, though she obviously understands a
lot. One of her favorite phrases is ``All right!'' I'd say,
``Christina, are you all right?'' and she'd pipe up immediately,
``I'M ALL RIGHT!'' We would all clap and smile, and she'd clap
back, basking in the attention.
</P>
<P>
   Her young life hasn't always been easy. Like many Down children,
she had serious health problems not long after birth, and spent too
much time in the hospital. Happily, save for an occasional cold,
she seems to be a healthy little girl now.
</P>
<P>
   When I heard my brother's youngest daughter had Down syndrome,
my heart sank. What a burden, I thought, but I didn't say that, of
course. I learned quickly that my brother and his wife didn't view
it that way. Christina was their daughter, and they would love and
raise her as best they could. Thus far, they have done an admirable
job.
</P>
<P>
   When I first saw her, I finally understood how they could handle
this so well. She has been adorable from day one. As a baby, she
enjoyed snuggling up on my chest and promptly going to sleep as I
sat in the recliner.
</P>
<P>
   Her two older siblings, Matthew, 9, and Stephanie, 14, dote on
Christina. You can see her eyes light up whenever they're around,
and now that she's perambulating, she toddles behind them, looking
for whatever mischief she can get into. Stephanie in particular has
matured in a hurry to help out her parents in keeping an eye on the
baby. I worry that she's given up a piece of her own childhood, but
certainly what she's gained in learning about responsibility is
worth it.
</P>
<P>
   Christina begins public school next year at age 3 in order to
give her as much of a head start as possible on learning things
that won't come as easily to her as to others. Since I haven't seen
her in nine months or so, the changes I see are probably more
marked than what her parents see, dealing with her every day. Her
ability to communicate and to understand has increased
dramatically. You say ``No,'' and she shakes her head and at least
temporarily quits trying to pull all the CDs out of the rack,
though really she's just waiting for you to get distracted _ just
like any 2-year-old.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly the road ahead for Christina is uncertain and will be
more difficult than it might be for a so-called ``normal'' child.
But if the love of her parents and family has anything to do with
success, and I believe it does, then she'll do just fine. She's a
winner already, in my book.

 &HT;    That buzzing sound is Ross Perot
 &HT;    By Dave McNeely
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Well, here we go again.
</P>
<P>
   Just as Vice President Al Gore is moving his campaign to
Tennessee in an attempt to get it focused on the very real
challenge from former New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley, the Bushes
again are having to fool with Pat Buchanan and Ross Perot.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, Buchanan proved a persistent and pesky opponent for
President Bush's effort to keep the GOP nomination. Simultaneously,
Bush's minions were trying to talk multibillionaire Perot out of
mounting a third-party campaign.
</P>
<P>
   But it didn't work. And Texas Gov. George W. Bush, among others,
blames Perot for Bush's dad losing the White House to Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Last Wednesday in California, George W. was still trying to keep
Buchanan from bolting the Republican Party _ even while saying
Buchanan is wrong in contending Hitler posed no direct military
threat to the United States until Germany declared war in 1941.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Perot is playing footsie with Buchanan, as the former
Richard Nixon speechwriter and TV talk-show personality eyes the
Reform Party's nomination.
</P>
<P>
   With it would go $13 million in taxpayer campaign funds. But
Bush folks say there's enough distrust of Buchanan within the
Reform Party that he's unlikely to get their nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Bushes obviously hope Buchanan and Perot don't sting
the son as badly as they did the dad. George W. himself reminded
reporters in California of the grief the Buchanan-Perot combo
caused.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always thought the 1992 campaign was hard for my dad to
get traction in the race because of, first, Patrick J. Buchanan,
and then Ross Perot inflicted a series of cuts,'' Bush said.``If
the adage is true _ you die a death of a thousand cuts in politics
_ Ross Perot was a part of the thousand cuts.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bushes remain suspicious of Perot _ whose personal wealth
dwarfs Bush's campaign swag.
</P>
<P>
   Perot's 1992 run against President Bush was driven partly by his
feeling that years earlier, Vice President Bush had undermined
Perot's campaign to find MIAs in Vietnam _ something the elder Bush
vehemently denied.
</P>
<P>
   But when Perot quit the 1992 race in July, his campaign manager,
Dallas lawyer Tom Luce, went to Washington at Bush's invitation and
spent a night in the White House. Perot got extremely angry.
</P>
<P>
   Perot later re-entered the race _ without Luce. Despite
providing his own campaign speed bump, Perot got 19 percent _ three
times the margin of difference between Democrat Bill Clinton's 43
percent and George Bush's 37 percent. And George W. thinks most of
the votes Perot got otherwise would have gone to Bush's dad.
</P>
<P>
   Perot's grudge passed on to George W. two years later. When he
was trying to unseat incumbent Democratic Gov. Ann Richards, Bush
recalled, ``about one week before the 1994 election, up pops Mr.
Perot, and he endorsed my opponent.''
</P>
<P>
   While the Bush camp in 1999 doesn't seem overly worried about
either Buchanan or Perot in 2000, a third-party effort can be a
problem.
</P>
<P>
   Chuck McDonald, a press aide for Richards in both of her
gubernatorial campaigns, said Bush in 1994 was fortunate not to be
bled as badly by a Libertarian gubernatorial candidate as
Republican Clayton Williams Jr. was against Richards in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, Richards got less than a majority _ 49.5 percent _ but
beat Williams anyway because Libertarian Jeff Daiell got 3.3
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Williams' foot-in-mouth statements on a variety of subjects
irked voters enough that some who would have voted Republican chose
the Libertarian as a protest, McDonald said.
</P>
<P>
   Four years later, when Bush challenged Richards, Libertarian
Kerry Ehlers got just six-tenths of a percent _ even while
Libertarians in other statewide races were getting five times as
much.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, even if Bush had lost an additional 3 percent, as
Williams had in 1990, he still would have won; he had gotten 53.5
percent to Richards' 45.9 percent. But if the third-party candidate
had gotten 8 percent _ as Perot did in his much lamer re-run for
president in 1996 _ and it had all come off the GOP candidate,
Richards would have stayed in the mansion.
</P>
<P>
   So Bush says he wants the well-known Buchanan to stay in the
party, where Bush can crush him _ rather than be a fly in the
ointment in Perot's third party.
</P>
<P>
   As for Perot, the Bushes keep hoping he'll sit down and shut up.
But he never does.

 &HT;    Learn fron Texas' education successes, and shortcomings
 &HT;    By John Young
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ The editorial was in the Honolulu Advertiser this
April. It could have been written in Texas in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   Hawaii is time zones removed from Texas as the day breaks, and
at least a decade removed in education reform.
</P>
<P>
   The editorial congratulated Hawaii lawmakers for agreeing to
``set up a task force that would create a statewide program of
strong academic standards, accompanied by specific testing of
achievement on those standards and accountability ...''
</P>
<P>
   Seeing these proposals in '99 makes a Texan rub his eyes. They
are, in short, the story of the last 14 years in Texas public
schools. In 1985, the legislature adopted reforms including a
teacher pay raise, lower teacher-student ratios in grade school,
stricter eligibility requirements for extracurricular activities
and a basic competency test for teachers.
</P>
<P>
   Most fundamentally, the '85 reforms set up a basic skills test
in reading, writing and math.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to requiring students to pass an exit-level test to
graduate, the system set up basic skills tests throughout schooling
as well as ratings of schools based on scores.
</P>
<P>
   Hawaii has an exit-level test but otherwise lacks comprehensive
student assessment tools. It has hired a new education commissioner
to place proposals before lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   Knowing that Hawaii just now is sticking its toe into the issue
of statewide student assessment, I feel pity and envy in equal
parts.
</P>
<P>
   We can pity Hawaii because we know now that swarms of Texas
students were drifting along with scandalously weak basic skills.
Today, those students would have a brighter spotlight shown on
their deficiencies. That's one good reason why other states are
emulating Texas.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, we can envy Hawaii because it can set up a
system that avoids what Texas does too commonly: flat-line the
sights of students who would soar without the basics drumbeat.
</P>
<P>
   The key asset, and key curse, of the Texas Assessment of
Academic Skills is spelled out in the '85 legislation:
``criterion-referenced.'' That means testing everyone on certain
things everyone should know, to which everyone has been exposed.
</P>
<P>
   A criterion-based test is distinct from a ``norm-referenced''
test like the Iowa Test of Basic Skills or the SAT, which challenge
every student, no matter how skilled.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that when ``what everyone should know'' becomes
the fulcrum of education, those who already know are left to doze
beside the see-saw.
</P>
<P>
   Please, Hawaii, for your own good, do this. (You should listen,
too, Texas.) Devise a criterion-based test _ an entry-level test
for each grade. Use it to test every student to find those below
grade level. For students at grade level or beyond, exempt them
from the criterion-based test for the rest of the year. Test them
instead with something that challenges, stretches and really
assesses every child, like ITBS.
</P>
<P>
   Texas has gotten high marks nationwide for bringing up low
achievers. I fear, however, that in doing so, it stunts some high
achievers or makes average achievers resolutely average. TAAS
emphasis should be for students below grade level, no one else. If
that means segregating _ ``tracking'' _ students to focus on the
basics, so be it.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, Texas got high marks in eighth-grade writing on the
National Asssessment of Education Progress, supposedly an
endorsement of the TAAS writing assessment. I'm guessing that this
made a lot of college English professors blanch. Writing skills
that ring the bell on TAAS are not the same as good writing. In
fact, English professors far and wide will say that they first have
to ``un-teach'' formulas learned to ace the TAAS writing portion.
</P>
<P>
   The ``back to basics'' movement is a two-edged sword. On one
hand it brings some people out of academic squalor. On the other it
is a big step ``back'' from the real essence of education, which is
to bring out the best in every child. All the best, Hawaii.

HEY, CAR: TAKE ME TO A MOVIE AND GOOD RESTAURANT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RONALD ROSENBERG  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Predictions that onboard vehicle navigation systems will replace
paper road maps in the next few years have been greatly
exaggerated.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe they will disappear like the AM-only car radio, but not
for 7 to 10 years. By then, today's $2,000 to $2,500
factory-installed computerized talking maps that are in
top-of-the-line Lexus, Acura, BMW, Cadillac, and Mercedes models
may reach the majority of car buyers for $500 to $800.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, in-vehicle navigation systems _ the kind that use global
positioning satellites for location accuracy _ have come down in
price in recent years. And there are lower-cost systems, such as
Garmin (www.garmin.com) and Delorme (ww.delorme.com), priced from
$550 to $1,500, that can be installed in many cars but have fewer
features. For example, you'd have to buy regional CD-ROMs with maps
for your local area at a cost of $150 to $170 each.
</P>
<P>
   Those who can afford the high-end systems have helped raise the
bar by seeking services beyond just getting directions. Coming
soon: restaurant menus and movie theater listings displayed on the
navigation system's video screen, as well as traffic conditions
ahead of you, transmitted from other vehicles on the same road.
</P>
<P>
   Also ahead are navigation systems tied into the Internet that
``learn'' a driver's shortcuts and modify their route mapping
accordingly. Others will show passengers a video of a tourist spot
they are driving to visit, such as New York's Guggenheim Museum,
and reserve a parking space at a nearby garage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Navigation will be part of a bundle of computerized products
and services aimed at both the constant traveler and the person
stuck in traffic,'' said Paul Hansen, publisher of the Hansen
Report on Automotive Electronics in Rye, N.H.
(www.hansenreport.com).
</P>
<P>
   Current in-vehicle systems consist of a small on-board video
display monitor (3 to 5 inches across, mounted on the dashboard)
that shows highways, expressways and streets stored on CD-ROMs. All
use a computerized navigation control unit with a GPS receiver and
a dashboard-mounted antenna so travelers can see _ and hear _
directions to their destination.
</P>
<P>
   As the map appears on the screen, a synthesized voice relays
instructions for when and where to turn. Some systems also
``listen,'' with very basic dialog (You ask, ``Where am I?'' and it
responds by naming the street you're on).
</P>
<P>
   Owners of upscale car navigation systems such as General Motors'
OnStar system (www.onstar.com) have some special services. Locked
out of your car? Cadillac owners with OnStar can call an 800
number, give their password, and in a matter of seconds the car
doors are automatically unlocked.
</P>
<P>
   If you're in a shopping mall and can't remember where you
parked, OnStar will remotely flash the headlights and honk the horn
so you and everyone else knows where the vehicle is.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike other manufacturers, Cadillac's navigation system
provides safety with Big Brother: A person sitting in front of a
video screen in Detroit can track your vehicle's movements. Push a
button near the driver's visor and a voice greets you knowing your
vehicle, model _ even color.
</P>
<P>
   OnStar will also play travel agent while you drive, booking a
hotel room and dinner reservation.
</P>
<P>
   And if the Caddy is in an accident and the driver's airbag is
opened, OnStar is automatically notified and an ``adviser'' will
call you. If you can't respond, the adviser will arrange for
emergency services such as police and ambulance.
</P>
<P>
   Since these services go beyond electronic mapping, General
Motors charges a monthly fee.
</P>
<P>
   Still other top-of-the-line navigation systems can automatically
recalculate new directions if you've missed a turn, as well as
provide quick directions to the nearest gas station, automatic
teller machine, post office and historical landmark. That appeals
to drivers of Acuras, where one in four buyers spend more than
$2,000 for the optional navigation system (www.acura.com).
</P>
<P>
   Down the road, future Ryder Cup hopefuls may get both directions
and a video tour of the nation's golf courses, while visitors to
northern California's Napa Valley can get similar map-and-go
information about the area's vineyards.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the US lags behind other countries. ``We in the US are
just getting started with vehicle navigation systems compared to
Japan, which is about seven years ahead of us while Europe is about
2 to 3 years in front of us,'' said Harry W. Voccola, senior vice
president of Navigation Technologies (www.navtech.com), which
provides map databases on CD-ROM to navigation equipment makers
such as Alpine (www.alpine1.com) and Clarion (www.autopc.com).
</P>
<P>
   Navigation Technologies and its rivals are looking to package
restaurant menus with travel directions on a CD-ROM or DVD disk.
</P>
<P>
   He views in-vehicle navigation systems today like air
conditioning in the early 1970s: an expensive option that most
people would like to have, but choose to wait until the price comes
down.
</P>
<P>
   By then, navigation systems will be bundled with components,
such as wireless telephones, multimedia systems and the Internet _
a combination that will enable Boston travelers driving in Chicago
to hear the Red Sox or Celtics radio broadcasts, and at the same
time give a voice command to get directions to, say, McCormick
Place, the city's giant exposition hall.
</P>
<P>
   But even those who can afford to spend big bucks and leave the
driving directions to satellites and electronic maps, human error
still creeps in.
</P>
<P>
   One dark night last year in Germany, a 57-year-old man with a
new BMW relied on his car's navigation system to get him across the
Havel River near Potsdam. But instead of bringing him to a bridge,
the system led him to a ferry crossing _ without the ferry.
</P>
<P>
   The car plunged 13 feet into the water. The driver was pulled
out safely, but we are not sure of the condition of the car _ or
the navigation system.

HIGH-SPEED TRAINS? FAST TO US, NOT TO EUROPEANS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS C. PALMER JR.  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The so-called high-speed rail service that is to get under way
between Boston and New York sometime in 2000 draws chuckles from
rail buffs wise in the ways of the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Amtrak's new Acela train (www.acela.com) looks sleek and
futuristic, and will hit 150 miles per hour _ in a few places. It
will be a welcome improvement in the lives of many commuters who
regularly cross state lines; New York will be only three hours away
from Boston, compared with about five on the diesel trains that
operate today.
</P>
<P>
   But what is considered ``high-speed'' in the Northeast Corridor
_ though much faster than the status quo _ doesn't qualify for that
label in other parts of the world.
</P>
<P>
   The Acela ``is an important advance for the Northeast Corridor
and Boston-New York corridor,'' said Joseph Sussman, professor of
civil and environmental engineering at Massachusetts Institute of
Technology, ``but it's not extraordinary. It's not high-speed by
international standards.''
</P>
<P>
   Can it supplant the air shuttle or a long, weary car ride to
become the travel mode of choice between Boston and New York?
Maybe. Although its speed won't be record-breaking by world
standards, the answer to that question will have a lot to do with
what happens elsewhere in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   James RePass, president of National Corridors Initiative, a
pro-train advocacy group (www.ipt.com/aboard/nci/nci.htm), says
rail travel is undergoing a revival nationwide because it's a good
alternative to congested interstates, especially near cities.
</P>
<P>
   Transportation specialists don't expect trains to prevail in
those long, straight runs across vast expanses: Chicago to Los
Angeles, for example, or Miami to Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   But Amtrak (www.amtrak.com) believes it can be successful on
routes where the time and expense involved in getting to and from
airports, combined with increasingly frequent delays, have
travelers hungry for alternatives. It already has detailed plans to
replicate what it expects to be successful Boston-New
York-Washington service to several other heavily traveled
corridors, such as Los Angeles-San Diego, and
Vancouver-Seattle-Portland.
</P>
<P>
   Some are more suited for truly high-speed rail than others. The
Northeast Corridor is congested, its track is among the oldest in
the nation, and it winds its way along a coastal route from Boston
to New York that would have to be straightened out at enormous cost
before greater speeds could be attained.
</P>
<P>
   Still, three hours downtown-to-downtown sounds pretty good,
especially when you can work or relax in some comfort along the way
_ not crammed into an airline seat the size of a hot-dog bun _ and
pay approximately half of what the airfare normally costs.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, what is left of passenger rail in the country is
being handled by a few electric trains and lots of diesel-powered
locomotives. Diesel is what the MBTA's commuter-rail uses, and
Amtrak service to New York goes diesel to New Haven, where it
switches to electric.
</P>
<P>
   The Acela will be fully electric-powered, running along under
high-voltage electrical wires now being strung along the corridor.
Eliminating the switch in New Haven alone will save about half an
hour on that run.
</P>
<P>
   But in a few years, after commuters get jaded about their
three-hour service, what can they look forward to? Here's a sample
of what's on the drawing board, in production, about to be tested,
or actually in service in the way of passenger rail transportation
worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   France
</P>
<P>
   The French company Alstom makes the TGV, or train a grande
vitesse _ very high-speed train (www.transport.alstom.com). The
original high-speed line in France was Paris to Lyons in the 1900s,
with a top speed of 165 mile per hour. But things have improved.
</P>
<P>
   The TGV Atlantique route gets up to 187 m.p.h., and the TGV Nord
is pushing _ but not quite up to _ 200. The French have a 200-plus
m.p.h. train in the design stages.
</P>
<P>
   The Eurostar (www.eurostar.com), which runs between Paris and
London via the Chunnel, goes 180-plus m.p.h. in France, and someday
it will go fast in England, too.
</P>
<P>
   But all these trains run on new rail lines, straight and smooth
and specially built for higher speeds. ``If you reflect on what
would be involved in even trying to find a new right-of-way from
Boston to New York,'' said Mark Yachmetz, director of the office of
passenger programs with the US Federal Railway Administration
(www.fra.dot.gov), ``it would be a formidable challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Japan
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese are famous for their Shinkansen train, which at
first, in the mid-1960s, went about 125 m.p.h. Japan now has routes
that have pushed into the 160 m.p.h. range.
</P>
<P>
   Like the French, the Japanese think they can push the old
steel-wheel-on-steel-track technology above 200, and they're
working on it. But, unlike the French, the Japanese also have a
mag-lev, or magnetic levitation, program under way.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Germany
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Siemens (www.siemans.com) makes the ICE (intercity express)
train, capable of a top speed of 160 m.p.h. Germany unveiled its
high-speed service early in this decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Europe, in theory, all the systems are supposed to be
compatible,'' said Yachmetz. But the Germans are concentrating on
eliminating the friction of that steel against steel. ``The Germans
are basically still trying to figure out what is the answer to
mag-lev before they work on improving the ICE technology.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Other countries run trains built in France, Japan, and England _
or sometimes variations. The Acela, for example, will employ
``tilt-train'' technology developed in Sweden that allows trains to
tilt while traveling at high speeds around corners, keeping
passengers from sliding from side to side.
</P>
<P>
   Spain runs high-speed rail with France's TGV. And there are
high-speed rail projects being developed in South Korea, Taiwan,
and China, where a Beijing-to-Shanghai route is in the early
stages. Australia is looking at high-speed trains, too.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, because of the long distances between its
largest cities, and the need for high-speed alternatives to air
shuttles between relatively close population centers, the effort
has been to rebuild and improve existing rail lines.
</P>
<P>
   Acela is the first. But high-speed traditionally has meant
electrically powered, and it costs a lot of money to string
electric wires, or catenary, long distances.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem in this country,'' said Yachmetz, ``is we don't
have the density of traffic outside the Northeast Corridor to
justify the investment needed for electric operation.''
</P>
<P>
   Just switching from diesel to electric on the New
Haven-to-Boston stretch is costing more than $3 million per mile.
For that reason, the Federal Railway Administration and train
manufacturers are looking at other options.
</P>
<P>
   Canadian train manufacturer Bombardier (www.bombardier.com),
which built the Acela, supplied an extra ``power car,'' as electric
locomotives are called, that can be outfitted with a gas turbine
engine. Basically, a turbo-train.
</P>
<P>
   The turbine, a form of jet engine, will be used to generate
electricity on board, which will run the motors powering the train.
That will be tested next summer on the same Pueblo, Colo., test
tracks where the Acela is running right now.
</P>
<P>
   The following year, a modified gas turbine will be tried, one
with a flywheel that would effectively store the energy generated
at high speeds and use it to accelerate from a stopped or slow
speed situation in which jet engines (a turbine is basically a jet)
don't do well.
</P>
<P>
   But American engineers also are optimistic about mag-lev, using
powerful electrical magnets to literally levitate the trains from
their platforms, reducing all that friction and allowing them to be
propelled along faster and more efficiently. The current federal
transportation law earmarks $950 million for a mag-lev
demonstration program in which seven participants are competing to
make a mag-lev train work on a corridor up to 40 miles long. The
first test-run will be by 2005, officials hope. And that's a real
test run, with passengers. ``Day after day, when kids stick chewing
gum in the doors and stuff,'' said Yachmetz.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the various corridors around the country that
might run high-speed rail are focusing on short-term improvements.
A nine-state network around Chicago is concentrating on eliminating
grade crossings, putting the tracks under or over the highways, to
allow speedier trains and make travel safer.
</P>
<P>
   When Americans start riding these fast trains, what will it feel
like? Will they all get sick?
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' said Yachmetz. ``You become `velocitized' very
quickly.''
</P>

<P>
   Call 1999 the year of airline passenger discontent.
</P>
<P>
   Fliers have vented their anger at airlines over long delays,
tepid service, and worrisome safety issues; the carriers, in turn,
have pointed accusatory fingers at the Federal Aviation
Administration.
</P>
<P>
   But the industry and the FAA are working together to fix the
problems with the help of technology that will change the way
airplanes move through the nation's skies and how passengers move
through airport terminals.
</P>
<P>
   This past summer, two new high-tech navigation systems dependent
on GPS were tested and they worked well. That means 2000 might be
the year that computers and satellites start to bring spiraling
passenger frustrations back to Earth.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   GPS, or global positioning system, uses a network of satellites
orbiting the Earth for navigation. But because the satellites are
not 100 percent accurate for civilian use (the Department of
Defense insisted on built-in errors for security purposes) the FAA
(www.faa.gov) and airlines are augmenting the system by building a
network of ground-based reference stations that will still preserve
the military's security and enhance the accuracy of the civilian
system. The last of 25 stations that comprise the backbone of the
so-called Wide Area Augmentation System, or WAAS, was completed
last year.
</P>
<P>
   When WAAS becomes operational, probably next September, a pilot
will be able to determine the airplane's veritical and horizontal
position within six or seven meters (about 20 to 23 feet), compared
to 100 meters (328 feet) with normal GPS. The current system of
radio-based navigation is accurate to within about one mile.
</P>
<P>
   Under the current system of navigation, pilots must fly a rather
zig-zag course in order to pass over ground-based navigation aids
such as radio beacons so that they know they are on course and
human flight controllers can track them.
</P>
<P>
   With WAAS, pilots will be able to fly in a straight line from
their origin to their destination; there will be no need to pass
over radio beacons on the ground because the plane will be tracked
by satellites in the air.
</P>
<P>
   By flying a more direct route, planes should arrive on time more
frequently. The accuracy of the system should also allow more
planes in the air with less space separating them. For example,
flights over the ocean _ where radio beacon navigation aids
</P>
<P>
   and radar coverage are virtually non-existent _ are separated by
at least 60 miles today. Under GPS, that could be reduced
significantly.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to WAAS, a Local Area Augmentation System, or LAAS,
will use a series of small networks of receivers on the ground and
a pseudo-satellite _ a small device on the ground that appears to
be a satellite to the plane's navigation system _ called a
``pseudolite'' so planes will have accurate information within 30
miles of an airport. The system increases the usability of GPS so
if not all satellites are in view, or one is malfunctioning, planes
will still be able to land in bad weather. Pseudolites will permit
planes to land in dense fog and visibility of 150 feet.
</P>
<P>
   At Logan International Airport in Boston
(www.massport.com/logan), for example, there is one runway that has
a very accurate instrument landing system that uses radio
frequencies to direct a plane to the center line of the runway and
then to the landing point.
</P>
<P>
   The Logan system lets a plane land in bad weather with 600 feet
of visibility ahead, and guides it to within 50 feet of the ground.
If the pilot cannot see the runway at that point, the landing
should be aborted. With pseudolites, landings can be done with 150
feet of forward visibility, and planes can touch down without the
pilot seeing the runway. ``Massport will certainly lobby the FAA to
get pseudolites on line when they are available,'' said Massport
spokesman Jose Juves.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Another successful test last summer involved advanced
anti-collision equipment that would not only enhance efficiency by
safely allowing more planes into the same airspace, but also reduce
the threat of runway accidents between airplanes and between
vehicles and airplanes.
</P>
<P>
   The system, known as ADS-B, for automatic dependent
surveillance-broadcast, sends out accurate position information,
along with speed, direction heading, and identification data to
other planes or vehicles with similar equipment using a digital
datalink. In the test, some 24 planes and one van equipped with
ADS-B were able to identify other planes. The system is expected to
greatly improve the efficiency of airport arrivals and departures.
</P>
<P>
   ``We truly believe ADS-B technology is essential to streamline
and modernize the National Airspace System and will become an
essential tool to keep our skies safe and more effienctly managed
in the near future,'' said Steve Alterman, president of the Cargo
Airline Association, which co-sponsored the tests.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And what about those frustrations in the terminal? Airlines are
turning to technology here as well.
</P>
<P>
   In September, United Airlines (www.ual.com) announced that it
will begin using state-of-the-art model ``chariots'' at all of its
hub airports. The battery-powered remote workstations will enable
customer service representatives to set up portable ticket counters
anywhere in the airport to issue tickets and boarding passes and to
check luggage _ thereby reducing long lines at the traditional
ticket counters.
</P>
<P>
   Delta Airlines (www.delta-air.com) recently announced a new
computer boarding system that provides more information, from lists
of passengers on standby to the status of connecting flights.
Airline officials say that should accelerate the boarding process,
reduce delays, and free up agents from answering questions so they
can spend more time on other passenger services.
</P>
<P>
   The airline is also using the equivalent of ATMs where shuttle
passengers can check in and obtain boarding cards.

WIRELESS PHONES: THEY'RE BEAUTIFUL AND BRILLIANT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER J. HOWE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   More than 800 companies are working on a project to build a
wireless telephone that will let you:
</P>
<P>
   --Forward all your e-mail to the wireless phone.
</P>
<P>
   --Tell your car stereo to play your calls.
</P>
<P>
   --Authorize a gas pump to charge your credit card for a fillup.
</P>
<P>
   --Get a Coke from a vending machine, and have the $1 cost added
to your phone bill.
</P>
<P>
   --Find out about a bad traffic jam a mile ahead.
</P>
<P>
   --Pay tolls.
</P>
<P>
   --Open your garage door, turn off the burglar alarm, and start a
Frank Sinatra disc spinning on the CD player while New England
Cable News comes up on the TV.
</P>
<P>
   --Tell you the dishwasher has finished a load of dishes, and an
e-mail order was placed for heating oil because the tank is down to
the last 20 gallons.
</P>
<P>
   What could make this admittedly Jetsonian-sounding scenario come
to pass is a new wireless technology standard called Bluetooth,
named for the 10th-century Danish King Harald, who had a dead tooth
that turned blue.
</P>
<P>
   Among the companies working to perfect the Bluetooth standard
are wireless phone makers Ericsson and Nokia, along with fellow
founding members IBM, Intel, and Toshiba. In August, they
publicized initial technical standards for the system, and are
offering the technology free to anyone who will use it _ and agree
to waive patent rights for new applications. Microsoft, whose
support is considered crucial to making the system a success, may
sign up.
</P>
<P>
   The first Bluetooth-equipped products are expected to hit the
market as soon as early next year. By 2002, Philips Electronics _
not a totally impartial source, because it is developing
Bluetooth-equipped products _ predicts that 600 million
Bluetooth-capable devices could be communicating with each other
around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Bluetooth refers not so much to specific devices as a system for
helping many different things communicate with each other through
low-power, 2.4-gigahertz radio signals that might reach just 100
feet, but could penetrate briefcases and walls.
</P>
<P>
   The market for what are broadly defined as ``smart phones,''
those that can receive e-mail, surf the Internet, and do more than
just complete calls, is projected by The Yankee Group in Boston to
grow by a factor of 1,000 in the next three years, from 25,000
units in 1998 to 28.4 million in 2002. In Europe, where wireless
usage rates are much higher, Yankee's projected growth is from
249,000 in 1998 to 43.4 million in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   While Bluetooth backers are full of fantasies for what might
happen, they acknowledge one of the more exciting prospects is a
sort of pre-Tower-of-Babel scenario. Just as people who spoke all
the same language could build a tower to heaven, the machines and
devices we use someday will talk to each other.
</P>
<P>
   Ted Browne, senior product marketing manager for Ericsson mobile
phones in North America, says the dream is that someday, your
wireless phone will be ``something you can use as your remote
control for life.''

COMMENTARY: THOSE CHINESE AGENTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By WILLIAM SAFIRE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Chinese Embassy here sent two of its senior
commercial ministers to Capitol Hill last week to impugn the
testimony of a Chinese citizen now resident in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Jianwei Ding worked for a subsidiary of Cofco, the agricultural
giant that also runs the big Chinese Cultural Center in Phoenix. He
came to the House Reform and Oversight Committee with a charge that
his former boss, Ning Yu _ now named Elizabeth Mann _ had a
gift-giving relationship with the man who gives out visas at the
U.S. Embassy in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   Our State Department yanked out our visa-giver, but Ding's
internal whistle-blowing did not sit well with his company's
officers. They won a lawsuit against him and seek his deportation
home, where his clues to kickbacks can be squelched.
</P>
<P>
   ``The embassy officials kept insisting that `this bad man is a
small potato,' '' reports James Wilson, chief counsel to Dan
Burton's committee, ``but then pointed out, almost as a threat,
that the company imports 18 million tons of corn and barley from
the U.S.''
</P>
<P>
   China has registered not a peep of protest to Congress about
inquiries into corrupt dealings in money and politics by Clinton
friends Charlie Trie, Johnny Chung and John Huang. But curiously,
Ding upsets them greatly, and the People's Republic is spending
bundles on lawyer's fees to get our Immigration officials to reject
asylum. (Over to you, Tony Lewis.)
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of John Huang, who was the Indonesian Riady family's
money man at the Commerce Department and the DNC: President Clinton
had good news for James Riady when he greeted him last month in
Auckland. Reno Justice let Huang off with a fine and probation for
his millions in illegal fund-raising. Now Janet Reno won't let the
committee immunize him to get his testimony about higher-ups,
pretending a ``continuing espionage investigation'' exists.
</P>
<P>
   And what of Charlie Trie, Little Rock's man in Beijing? Over in
the Senate, Fred Thompson's Oversight Committee heard from four FBI
agents assigned to the task force Reno used to block independent
investigation of ``the Asian connection'' with the 1996 Clinton
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI witnesses revealed that the cover-up crew at Reno
Justice knew of the systematic destruction of subpoenaed evidence
by Trie's assistant _ and refused for four months to allow agents
to obtain a search warrant to seize remaining documents.
</P>
<P>
   After a lawful Senate subpoena to Justice for the lead FBI
agent's notebook detailing this obstruction, 27 pages of Roberta
Parker's notebook were destroyed inside Reno Justice. That's a
federal crime. Reno shrugged this scandal over to Marshall Jarrett,
her in-house shoo-fly who can be trusted never to find the perp in
their midst.
</P>
<P>
   FBI agents have testified how Justice deliberately impeded lines
of inquiry into the White House. Senator Thompson, now deposing
Justice witnesses, says: ``Theirs was a hapless, incompetent,
possibly corrupt investigation into Asian fund-raising. We're going
into this now more deeply than Justice is.''
</P>
<P>
   China's contributions to Clinton went hand in hand with its
espionage. Looking into that end is a new Senate task force headed
by Arlen Specter, former Intelligence Committee chairman. He's
interested in the technical transfers of ballistic-missile data by
Loral and Hughes, companies headed by two big Clinton fund-raisers
and trade influencers.
</P>
<P>
   Today Senate Judiciary will vote to arm Specter's newly
recruited team of serious investigators with subpoenas on Justice
officials to find out what went into Reno's cozy plea bargains with
Trie, Huang and Chung _ and why no espionage counts were included
in the prosecution of Peter Lee.
</P>
<P>
   In closed hearings next week, Specter's group will examine the
inspectors general of the CIA and the Department of Energy, and
customs officials critical of the dangerous sale of secrets.
``Nobody's peeled back the covers,'' says the former Pennsylvania
prosecutor. ``I'm determined to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe he will. Maybe Thompson and Burton will flip over rocks as
well. If Justice's stone wall cracks, Americans might yet discover
the connection between unpunished Chinese illegal contributions and
unpublished stories of Chinese espionage.

   Cabal Peniche's bank, the Union Bank, later went belly up along
with other Mexican financial institutions. Mexicans have since been
saddled with an $80 billion taxpayer bail out of banks --
including, perhaps, that $25 million ``donation'' to the PRI,
outraged opposition parties here say.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico's July 2000 presidential election will test whether 1996
reforms that shifted about 90 percent of campaign financing to
public funding will help prevent future scandals.
</P>
<P>
   Already, however, complaints about dirty donations and illicit
spending are fast and furious.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, one of the most persistent gripers has been Humberto
Roque Villanueva, a PRI insider. Roque is trailing dead last in the
polls in a four-man race to win the PRI's first-ever presidential
nomination in a Nov. 7 primary.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico's 1996 campaign reforms failed to take into account
primaries. So the PRI _ not the independent Federal Elections
Institute, or IFE _ is monitoring its own primary spending cap of
about $4.8 million in cash and $1.4 million in in-kind
contributions per candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Roque, once a PRI party president, says his party is not minding
the money.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are donations out of control, spending that's out of
control, excessive publicity . . . direct payments to people who
organize events, direct payments for attending rallies and payments
for transportation to rallies,'' Roque fumed in an interview this
week with Cox Newspapers. ``I'm waiting to see whether all of this
is included in (his rivals') accounts.''
</P>
<P>
   Without honest audits, Roque said, the PRI risks losing even
more credibility. The party set no caps on donations in its
upcoming primary, and could later it find itself embarrassed once
again if its candidates take dubious donations from people like
Cabal Peniche. The former bank president has been a fugitive for
four years. Mexico is now attempting to extradite him from
Australia on charges of embezzling $700 million from his bank.
</P>
<P>
   Roque accuses Francisco Labastida and Roberto Madrazo, the two
leading PRI presidential candidates, of violating the party's rules
most egregiously.
</P>
<P>
   Labastida's campaign recently informed the party that it has
spent well more than half the $4.8 million cap because of advance
payments to media for commercial ad time. But Roque says that the
blitz of costly prime-time television spots that Labastida and
Madrazo have both mounted has surely surpassed the limit with a
month to go before the primary election.
</P>
<P>
   The PRI's opposition agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think even their grandmothers believe them,'' said
Lino Korrodi, fund-raising director for Friends of Vicente Fox, a
candidate of the opposition National Action Party, or PAN.
</P>
<P>
   Korrodi said a prime-time TV spot of 20 seconds can cost ``no
less'' than $27,000. Arturo Sanchez Gutierrez, who monitors
political parties for the IFE, said a spot can cost nearly double
that. Mexican TV networks declined to reveal their fee structure.
</P>
<P>
   Dolores Padierna of the opposition Democratic Revolution Party _
a fierce critic of Mexico's bank bail-out _ said she concurs with
Roque's claim that PRI candidates are violating their own rules.
But because of Roque's previous high position in the PRI she finds
his outrage disingenuous.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a victim of his own party's dynamic,'' she said. ``But
it's something that has happened to us (in the opposition) for
years.''
</P>
<P>
   The PRI says it will audit its candidates' expenditures this
month and punish violators by prohibiting them from campaigning for
15 days.
</P>
<P>
   Labastida's campaign is under special pressure to show it is
sticking to rules.
</P>
<P>
   A former interior minister under current President Ernesto
Zedillo, he is perceived as a candidate the PRI elite favors.
Labastida has been accused of receiving help from state governors
who organize rallies and events on his behalf using public
resources; a charge he denies.
</P>
<P>
   In an attempt to show he's not being bankrolled by wealthy
businessmen alone, Labastida's campaign set its own cap on
individual donations at about $1,500.
</P>
<P>
   Displaying a sample receipt, Labastida campaign finance director
Eduardo Bours said the system is also designed to prevent the
campaign from unwittingly taking donations from undesirable
contributors.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a drug trafficker tries to donate money,'' he said, ``it
won't be more than $1,500.''
</P>
<P>
   The PRI's opponents scoff at these self-imposed limits. The same
party that has controlled the Mexican presidency for 70 years can't
be trusted to police itself, they say.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're just trying to fool Mexicans,'' Korrodi said.
</P>
<P>
   In mid-January, when Mexico's presidential campaign season
officially opens, the rules of campaign finance change
dramatically. Before mid-January, parties are officially forbidden
from using their substantial cash reserves to promote nominees in
the media.
</P>
<P>
   Candidates have skirted the prohibition, however, by setting up
``friends'' groups that raise money, sponsor events and buys ads
for candidates as individuals.
</P>
<P>
   In Vicente Fox's TV ads, for example, he is still portrayed as
an individual candidate rather than the PAN's official nominee,
said Sanchez of the IFE.
</P>
<P>
   Since the 1996 reforms, the activities of Mexico's political
parties are supposed to be supported mostly by public money whose
distribution is based mainly on how many votes each party received
in the last election. About 90 percent of the presidential
candidates' campaigns will be paid for by public money.
</P>
<P>
   Next year, about $300 million in federal money will be given to
Mexico's parties for political campaigns. They also receive public
money from states.
</P>
<P>
   The parties are also allowed to raise money by charging members
dues. Under the current rules, individual sympathizers or
businesses cannot donate more than about $64,800 per year to a
party.
</P>
<P>
   Money raised for the PRI's primary candidates or for Friends of
Fox, said Sanchez, can be rolled over after January into the
presidential campaign. But it has to be divided among individuals
whose donations don't exceed the $64,800 limit, which will be
adjusted for inflation next year.
</P>
<P>
   The system, Sanchez conceded, is not designed for complicated
investigations into whether parties are taking massive donations
from a wealthy supporter and dividing it up to mask the size of the
contribution.
</P>
<P>
   Equally troubling are difficulties the IFE anticipates when it
has to audit the parties' expenditures next year, Sanchez said.
</P>
<P>
   The cap for individual parties' presidential campaigns in 2000
is set at about $50 million right now, according to IFE documents,
but that cap will probably increase to account for inflation.
</P>
<P>
   One area to watch to catch overspending, Sanchez said, is the
media.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, only 25 percent of most political campaigns' budgets
went to the media. In 1997, the percentage had jumped to 55
percent. Next year, even more spending is expected to be devoted to
TV and radio ad spots.
</P>
<P>
   But Sanchez said Mexico's law doesn't give him the power to
request records from media outlets to check on whether parties are
violating limits. The IFE is stuck monitoring the airwaves to count
commercials and make estimates.
</P>
<P>
   After the campaign is over next July, the law requires the
parties to turn over records showing donations and expenditures.
But that's not fool-proof either, Sanchez said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first problem is that I can only review whatever it is
they've been willing to give me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have access to checkbooks,'' he added, ``and they have to
prove every expense they've incurred. But when we're talking about
an election like the one in 2000 _ in which you've got the whole
Congress up for election as well as the presidency _ there are
powerful interests at work.''

BRUCE WILLIS' BEST AND WORST OF TIMES

 Includes black-and-white photos and color slides of Bruce Willis
with Michelle Pfeiffer in a scene from ``The Story of Us.'' 
 By IVOR DAVIS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    These are bittersweet times for Bruce Willis, one of the most
prolific of Hollywood's $20 million men.
 &HT;    On the one hand, Willis _ who has long balanced big-box-office
action pictures with much-admired-but-less-lucrative dramatic turns
_ managed to combine the two with ``The Sixth Sense,'' which opened
in August and not only impressed critics with his sensitive
performance but also turned into a surprise box-office hit. The
intriguing ghost story with a twist has rung up almost $200 million
at the domestic box office and become the sleeper smash of the
summer and into the fall.
 &HT;    He's also currently onscreen in ``Breakfast of Champions,'' an
art-house adaptation of Kurt Vonnegut's 1973 novel that he
personally financed, co-starring Albert Finney, Nick Nolte and
Barbara Hershey.
 &HT;    Completing this impressive trifecta is ``The Story of Us,''
opening on Oct. 15. In it, Willis returns to his romantic-comedy
persona, rarely seen since his days in the 1980s television hit
``Moonlighting.'' He's cast opposite Michelle Pfeiffer in a tale
about a couple whose once-perfect 15-year marriage is on the rocks
_ a topic that Willis himself understands all too well.
 &HT;    While his professional life has rarely been better, Willis is
currently caught up in personal trauma. After 11 years of an
up-and-down marriage to Demi Moore, whose career for a while looked
as if it might eclipse her husband's in a ``Star Is Born''
scenario, the 44-year-old actor finally split with his 36-year-old,
glamour-queen wife last year.
 &HT;    Willis has been dodging the media ever since. He did virtually
no interviews to promote ``The Sixth Sense,'' plugged ``Breakfast
of Champions'' only at the Toronto Film Festival and wasn't
scheduled to attend the press junket for ``The Story of Us.''
 &HT;    But out of the blue, who should drop into the Beverly Hills
hotel room where director Rob Reiner is holding court but Willis
himself?
 &HT;    ``Don't ask me any questions,'' the bald-domed, trim-looking
star declares. ``I'm just here to learn.''
 &HT;    But, predictably, it isn't long before Willis is off and
running, savoring the upturn in a career which, until the mega-hit
success of ``Armageddon'' (l998) and ``The Sixth Sense,'' seemed to
be faltering.
 &HT;    ``I feel good,'' Willis says cheerfully. ``I just think the
wheel has turned for me a little bit _ I've been through times when
they throw rocks and say my work sucks and my movie could have been
better.
 &HT;    ``I take responsibility for my choices,'' he says with a shrug.
``I've done some films I probably shouldn't have done _ I got
involved when the script wasn't done _ they were mistakes. You
shouldn't turn the camera on until the script is on the page and
it's a readable, fascinating story.''
 &HT;    ``The Sixth Sense'' was definitely on the page, he adds.
 &HT;    ``It was completely done,'' Willis says. ``I read it and said
yes the next day. Same thing with `Story of Us' _ I said, `I gotta
do this.'
 &HT;    ``I'm just really happy that the `Sixth Sense' made what it
did,'' he adds. ``It was phenomenal, coming along at the end of
summer and making a bunch of dough.''
 &HT;    ``The Story of Us'' hit closer to home, however. Willis' and
Pfeiffer's characters decide on a trial separation, just as Willis
and Moore were in real life separating as the film was being made.
 &HT;    While they have not officially divorced, one of Hollywood's
highest-profile marriages appears to be over, after 11 years and
three children _ 11-year-old Rumer, 8-year-old Scout and 5-year-old
Tallulah. Willis has been photographed in Spain with a new
girlfriend, 27-year-old Maria Bravo, a Spanish financial broker,
while Moore has been linked in the media with Oliver Whitcomb, her
daughters' 29-year-old karate instructor.
 &HT;    It would be understandable if, under the circumstances, Willis'
share in ``The Story of Us'' had been bleak and agonizing, but the
film is actually surprisingly upbeat. In fact, he says, he thinks
it's a great date movie.
 &HT;    ``Did you cry at the end?'' he asks. ``I think it appeals to a
broad spectrum. I don't think there's anyone around, married or
not, who hasn't gone through these kind of things. A lot of people
can relate to it _ it's got a lot of humor in it.''
 &HT;    It was his first film with Pfeiffer, who like him has mixed
commercial blockbusters such as ``Batman Returns'' (1992) and
``Wolf'' (1994) with dramatic turns in such more serious fare as
``Love Field'' (1992) and ``The Age of Innocence'' (1993).
 &HT;    ``We were challenging each other,'' he says. ``It's really a
game of professionals at that point. I could do an hour with her _
she's so talented and fields anything. Nothing scares her, nothing
throws her _ she just killed everybody with that. She was so
strong. It was difficult to stand there and be my cool self.''
 &HT;    Director Reiner, whose romantic-comedy hits include ``When Harry
Met Sally'' (1989) and ``The American President'' (1996), was the
ideal choice for his return to comedy, Willis believes.
 &HT;    ``He's my favorite kind of director,'' the actor says, ``a great
storyteller with his own acting history. Actors feel comfortable
knowing he's been in their shoes _ he's not going to ask us to go
anyplace he wouldn't go.
 &HT;    ``There are scenes where I had to be vulnerable, and he helped
me through those.''
 &HT;    To those who know him best as the battered-but-unstoppable
heroes of the ``Die Hard'' films, ``Pulp Fiction'' (1994) and
``Armageddon,'' it's hard to imagine that Willis first achieved
stardom through his deft comic interplay with Cybill Shepherd on
their 1985-1989 television hit, ``Moonlighting.'' But that's
actually why he was so eager to do ``The Story of Us,'' the actor
says.
 &HT;    ``I've been waiting to do a comedy,'' Willis says. ``I haven't
done one since l989. It was so much fun, because you use a
different set of muscles. It's much harder to be funny and to take
funny dialogue and try to make human jokes out of it.
 &HT;    ``It's certainly much more fun than running down the street with
a gun and screaming.''
 &HT;    Actually, he adds, his ``Story of Us'' character _ a laid-back,
impractical writer _ is a lot closer to the real Bruce Willis than
his action-movie persona.
 &HT;    ``Yeah, that's me,'' says Willis, whose next film, ``The Whole
Nine Yards,'' is another comedy, this time about a retired hit man
who falls in love with his next-door neighbor. ``As I get older I
get quieter and more philosophical. I've stopped yelling in real
life.
 &HT;    ``That's the whole thing about being an actor,'' he concludes.
``You get to do it all.''

   &UR; By DIANA BUTLER BASS &LR;  &QC; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   A few days after the release of Edmund Morris's controversial
``Dutch: A Memoir of Ronald Reagan,'' C-SPAN aired a speech by
former first daughter, Maureen Reagan. In it, she recalled riding
horseback with her father through the Camp David woods.
</P>
<P>
   During their conversation, the president mentioned that he had
recently memorized a poem.
</P>
<P>
   She asked, ``Would you like an audience?'' Happy with the
prospect, Reagan recited it for her.
</P>
<P>
   Although Maureen Reagan has criticized the new book, her story
supports Morris's argument -- without an audience, Ronald Reagan
could not exist. Morris spent more than a decade researching this
biography. The more evidence he examined, however, the less he
knew. Like an old movie hero, Reagan kept riding off into the
sunset. To use Morris's own term, he ``dissolved.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Morris, when the young Reagan found his vocation as
an actor the future president began to emerge. Only with an
audience in place -- whether in college, on radio, in Hollywood, or
in politics -- could Reagan stride onto stage as savior of the
American dream.
</P>
<P>
   Morris's Reagan calls to mind another American icon: George
Whitefield. A revivalist preacher, Whitefield was the eighteenth
century's Billy Graham. Spurred by his oratory, colonial churches
were engulfed by spiritual fervor.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of this revival, Whitefield came to represent
emerging national unity. ``It is easy to forget,'' writes Harry
Stout, Yale professor and Whitefield biographer, ``that America's
first ... hero was a preacher, not a politician.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Reagan, George Whitefield ``was his mother's son.'' Each
followed the path of his mother's ambitions. And both fell in love
with the theater. For them, acting hid troubled pasts and provided
them with new identities.
</P>
<P>
   Masters of speech, they commanded vast crowds who, in turn,
breathed life into the actors themselves. On stage, they both
embodied popular democracy while envisioning a mythic, biblical
America.
</P>
<P>
   Whitefield, however, never worked as an actor. He was a
preacher. Observers reported that when he said the word,
``Mesopotamia,'' crowds swooned and cried. David Garrick, the
leading man of English theater, used to watch Whitefield to sharpen
his own stage skills. Hundreds of thousands of colonists --
including the rich and skeptical like Benjamin Franklin -- would
turn out to hear him preach.
</P>
<P>
   He was the biggest show in town. ``Whitefield was not content
simply to talk about the New Birth,'' according to Stout, ``he had
to sell it with all the dramatic artifice of a huckster.'' And sell
he did. Whitefield was America's first celebrity -- a religious
hero who gave the colonists a sense of national identity and paved
the way for the Revolution. When he died in 1770, Americans decked
their homes in blacks and mourned him in public services and
sermons.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Whitefield has proved enigmatic to his biographers.
Everything he wrote, he intended for the public. Even his personal
diary appeared as a newspaper serial. As author, actor, and
director, he scripted his own life. After years studying
Whitefield, Stout concluded, ``I became convinced that Whitefield
lived his life almost exclusively for public performance ... his
public career ... reveal(s) his innermost biography.''
</P>
<P>
   Whitefield left his imprint deep on the American soul. Not
surprisingly, generations of evangelical Christians enshrined him
as their hero. Deeper still, however, is that all of us --
believers and skeptics alike -- still unconsciously gravitate
toward those who embody his legacy. American soulfulness inclines
toward theatrical hucksters who offer salvation -- telling us who
we wish we were while making us cry.
</P>
<P>
   Whether George Whitefield's New Birth or Ronald Reagan's New
Morning in America, Americans are simultaneously attracted and
repelled by the performances of actor-preacher-politicians.
</P>
<P>
   When reading ``Dutch,'' I thought: ``He doesn't get it. Morris
doesn't get it because he isn't really an American'' (Morris was
born and reared in Africa). He misses the nuances of American
religion, small town sports, midwestern reserve and middle-class
nostalgia. He does not get it.
</P>
<P>
   But his distance from American sentimentality enables him to tap
into a disturbing part of the national psyche -- Americans love
being an audience. Especially for an ``essentially decent'' and
not-very-bright actor like Ronald Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   And, while we watch, our actors transfigure themselves into
saviors. In American religion and politics, the play's the only
thing.

DINA MEYER GOES `BATS'

 (Includes a color slide and a black-and-white photo of Dina Meyer

 By IAN SPELLING  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Ready to go batty?
 &HT;    Dina Meyer is, and just in time for Halloween, too. Last seen
battling killer arachnids as Dizzy in 1997's ``Starship Troopers,''
Meyer co-stars with Lou Diamond Phillips in the sci-fi-tinged
thriller ``Bats,'' which descends upon theaters on Oct. 22.
 &HT;    ``Genetically enhanced bats are tormenting Texas, and it's up to
Lou and me to save the entire world,'' says Meyer, who portrays
intrepid zoologist Sheila Cooper. ``And we've got 48 hours to do
it.''
 &HT;    Meyer loved that basic premise, but what she really liked was
the idea of playing a fully formed female character and working
with Phillips, star of the 1987 hit ``La Bamba.''
 &HT;    ``I was surprised, because when you get a script for any action
movie you think it will be a typical action script,'' the actress
says by telephone from Vancouver, B.C., after a day of shooting
``Secret Agent Man,'' her upcoming UPN series. ``Sheila is a
wonderful character who's strong yet vulnerable, smart but a little
naive, and different from the other characters I've played.
 &HT;    ``After `Starship Troopers' I said, `I'm done with this CGI
stuff. I want to work with actors,''' she adds. ``When I heard Lou
was interested in doing `Bats,' that put the final nail in the
coffin for me. I said, `Wow, how lucky am I?'
 &HT;    ``Lou is a wonderful actor, and we're lucky to have him,'' Meyer
says. ``The only bad thing I can say about Lou is that I don't
think I'll ever meet anyone as nice as he is.''
 &HT;    Making ``Bats,'' however, proved as tough as Phillips was nice.
The cast and crew routinely worked 12-to-14-hour days, alternating
five-day and six-day weeks while shooting on location near Salt
Lake City. The days were hot, the nights were cold and in an
instant rain could pour from the heavens.
 &HT;    Then there were the bats and _ holy guano, Batman! _ the bat
caves.
 &HT;    ``Our bats were mostly puppets,'' Meyer says. ``We had bats on a
string, wind-up bats, wrap-around bats, stick-on bats and some bats
that were put in later with CGI. I even had to attack myself with a
puppet bat.
 &HT;    ``It was insane to do scenes in our bat caves, which were the
equivalent of the bug tunnels in `Starship Troopers,''' she says.
``I was Batgirl. We were up to our necks in this stuff that was
supposed to be bat guano.
 &HT;    ``After a week of people working in it, sloshing through it,
spitting chewing tobacco in it and doing whatever, I had to lay in
it.''
 &HT;    OK. Enough. So how's the film?
 &HT;    ``It looks enormous,'' Meyer says enthusiastically. ``We had a
small budget, about $12 million, but the film looks like it cost
five times more than that.
 &HT;    ``It looks really big _ but then again, what the hell do I
know?'' she says with a laugh. ``Thrillers seem to be very hot
right now, so hopefully we'll ride the wave.''
 &HT;    While ``Bats'' invades darkened movie houses across the country,
Meyer will still be up in Vancouver toiling on ``Secret Agent
Man,'' a superspy-adventure series from ``Men in Black'' maestro
Barry Sonnenfeld that will hit the airwaves in 2000 as a midseason
replacement. Think ``Man from U.N.C.L.E.,'' ``The Avengers,'' ``Get
Smart'' and the Bond films all rolled into one.
 &HT;    ``It's handsome people looking great and saving the world in
style, but we don't take ourselves too seriously,'' says Meyer, who
co-stars with Costas Mandylor and Dondre T. Whitfield. ``We're five
episodes into it, and it's been a friggin' blast.
 &HT;    ``The scripts are getting better and better. We're coming into
our own with our characters and their relationships. And right now
there's nothing on television like it.''
 &HT;    Hmm ... ``Starship Troopers,'' 1995's ``Johnny Mnemonic,''
1996's ``Dragonheart'' and now ``Bats'' and ``Secret Agent Man.''
It sounds as if Meyer is fast becoming Genre Girl.
 &HT;    ``I've never really thought of it that way,'' Meyer says with a
laugh. ``I know I've done a bunch of these sci-fi/special-effects
movies. I've dealt with bugs, bats, dragons and virtual reality.
 &HT;    ``Now on `Secret Agent Man' I'm dealing with all these neat
little gadgets. I don't know if I'm becoming Genre Girl or if it's
just the next wave.''

GATES DID HIS PART _ NOW IT'S GOVERNMENT'S TURN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating for Philadelphia and all needing.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DERRICK Z. JACKSON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As buoyant as he is about Bill Gates's $1 billion gift of
college scholarships to low-income students of color, Bill Gray is
adamant about what the rest of the country has to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see no effort at the federal or state level to expand
financial help to get low-income students into college,'' said
Gray, the former US representative and now president of the United
Negro College Fund. ``The current loan and development programs to
get kids into college are all for the middle class. The expansion
of education opportunity is driven by the middle class.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one wants to talk about how this expansion is more money
being spent on the education of suburban kids. But they keep saying
how money won't solve the problem for minorities. For us, they say
it's a value problem, it's your dysfunctional families.''
</P>
<P>
   Gray was the man behind the scenes who got Gates to value the
future of low-income children of color. Gray had gotten to know
Gates through visits to Microsoft. About two years ago, Bill and
Belinda Gates began asking Gray what was the top difficulty for
low-income achievers to go to college.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him that for so many kids, it simply was money,'' Gray
said. ``You have a lot of students who have never had money who are
completely intimidated by what they have to face. Harvard might
give them scholarships and grants, but they still might face $8,000
in loans. That might not be a big deal to an upper-class or
middle-class kid, but that is scary to someone who has never dealt
with that kind of money.''
</P>
<P>
   Many months later, Gates told Gray that he wanted to establish a
scholarship fund and wanted the UNCF to run it. The $1 billion
would be spent over 20 years to allow low-income high school
seniors with a B-plus grade point average to seek degrees at the
colleges of their choice to pursue careers in mathematics, science,
engineering, computer technology, education, and library science.
</P>
<P>
   In creating a 20-year program, it was clear Gates had listened
to something Gray had advised in their earlier talk. Gray said,
``If you want to bring about change, you have to sustain it.''
</P>
<P>
   The question is whether the rest of the country is interested in
change, let alone sustaining it. Gates's money will cover full
scholarships for about 1,000 students a year. As impressive as that
is, it is the first step on a steep mountain.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Nettles, an education professor at the University of
Michigan and research director of the UNCF's Frederick Patterson
Research Institute, estimates that there are between 70,000 and
100,000 students of color who have at least a B-plus grade point
average and come from families that earn $25,000 or less a year.
</P>
<P>
   Nettles's estimate comes from a review of data from the College
Board. These are students who are at particular risk of not going
to college as skyrocketing campus costs eat up a far higher
percentage of the income of low-income families.
</P>
<P>
   For a family at the 20th percentile of income, the average
annual tuition, room and board at a public university now equals a
33 percent of the family's income, according to the US Department
of Education. The costs at a private college now equal 90 percent,
or nearly all of the family's income.
</P>
<P>
   Those costs are up from 27 and 69 percent, respectively, for
public and private colleges in 1986. For families at the 80th
percentile of income, the cost for public and private college
equals 9 and 24 percent of income, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   The UNCF is unsure how many B-plus students are not attending
college because of cost, but the Department of Education said that
even after factoring in financial aid programs, lower-income
students in general have higher unmet financial need than higher
income students. The department said that at a certain level of
unmet need, low-income students are more likely than higher income
students to be deterred from attending college. It said that each
increase of $150 in the net price of college decreases the
enrollment of low income students by about 1.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``All Bill is doing is taking 1,000 of the best,'' Gray said of
Gates. ``But there are so many more kids in the pool. When I say
how many are in the pool, I usually get a gasp from the audience.
They say, `You mean there's that many?' But right now, there's no
political interest in them. People have bought so much into the
stereotypes of low-income families that they think they're all
sitting around having babies and gang-banging.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, we have a lot of bad schools. But you don't hear about
how hard black people are trying, graduating from high school at
the highest rates ever (87 percent of African-Americans aged 25 to
29 completed high school in 1997, compared with 59 percent in
1971). The problem is not the kids. The aspiration is there. The
ability is there. What we need are the resources.''

<P>
   CHICAGO _ Kevin Lacey, a 41-year-old architect, was no gambler.
He had never even been to Las Vegas, Nev. But when he saw a
magazine advertisement about playing blackjack on the Internet, he
was intrigued.
</P>
<P>
   Just for fun, he found the Web site, keyed in his credit card,
played a few hands and won a couple of dollars. That was three
years ago. Now Mr. Lacey is more than $60,000 in debt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've maxed out seven credit cards,'' said Lacey, who recently
entered a gambling addiction program. ``I've got to get this
monster under control.''
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of ``cybercasinos'' have come on line since 1995,
giving almost anyone with a computer and a credit card the chance
to gamble. Americans last year wagered an estimated $1 billion on
line in a form that thrives in a legal twilight zone as advances in
technology have outpaced the law.
</P>
<P>
   These cybercasinos are based offshore, many of them on Caribbean
islands, because gambling in the United States requires specific
legal permission. On-line casinos blur those legal boundaries.
</P>
<P>
   Is it illegal for a woman in Ohio, for instance, to place a bet
with a cybercasino in Antigua? Does the betting occur in Ohio or in
Antigua?
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Jon Kyl, Republican of Arizona, has introduced a bill that
would prohibit on-line gambling by giving judges the power to shut
down Internet providers who give Web sites to cybercasinos.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate approved the measure last year 90 to 9, but it did
not come to a vote in the House of Representatives before Congress
adjourned. The bill is expected to come to the Senate floor again
this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Kyl, the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee's
subcommittee on technology, said he thought that Internet gambling
already violated the law against sports betting, which, although
permitted in Las Vegas, was banned under the Federal Wire Act of
1961. But the law does not address nonsports betting.
</P>
<P>
   And the 1961 measure could eventually be irrelevant if satellite
transmission or radio waves replace telephone lines.
</P>
<P>
   For now, some states have taken separate approaches, none of
them altogether effective. Illinois and Louisiana have banned
Internet gambling. Minnesota is studying whether on-line wagering
could be regulated and licensed. And Missouri has taken court
action against on-line gambling providers.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Nixon, the Attorney General of Missouri, has filed a Federal
suit in Kansas City against the Coeur D'Alene Indian tribe in
Idaho, contending that the tribe's lottery and bingo Web site
violates Missouri's consumer laws, which prohibit the sale of
illegal goods or services.
</P>
<P>
   The tribe, meanwhile, contends that the wagering is legal
because it is based in a sovereign American Indian nation, where
wagering is permitted.
</P>
<P>
   Missouri also filed suit against a Pennsylvania man for running
an Internet gambling site. The man pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor
charge last year and was fined $27,000.
</P>
<P>
   But prosecutions of Internet gambling remain rarer than a poker
hand of four aces. Sue Schneider, who publishes an on-line magazine
on computer gambling, Interactive Gaming News, said it would be
impossible to stop people from wagering over the Internet. She said
that more than 500 sites offered gambling.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, she said, states and the Federal Government should
regulate the industry. Australia, she noted, has recently started
to license on-line casinos.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could regulate them just like you regulate any land-based
gambling operation,'' Schneider said.
</P>
<P>
   Dianne Meyer, the publisher of Rolling Good Times On-Line,
another Internet magazine that reports about on-line gambling, said
a prohibition would drive the industry underground. That would
leave consumers with no protection, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an unregulated industry that desperately needs to be
regulated,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But on-line gambling has relatively few defenders. In June, the
National Gambling Impact Study Commission, created by Congress,
called for a ban on Internet gambling.
</P>
<P>
   Most professional sports leagues, as well as the National
Collegiate Athletic Association, have called for the prohibition of
on-line wagering. The Las Vegas casino industry has called for a
ban as well.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Fahrenkopf, the president of the American Gaming
Association, which represents the casino industry, said he scoffed
at the notion that his group's opposition to on-line gambling was
rooted in a fear of competition. He said the industry's chief
concern was that Internet gambling would tarnish all operators of
casinos.
</P>
<P>
   Even those who support the ban, however, acknowledge that
enforcement could be difficult. And the Internet providers have
chafed at being forced to act as a sheriff expected to keep outlaws
out of a virtual Dodge City.
</P>
<P>
   Acknowledging those concerns, the Kyl measure would relieve
Internet providers of the responsibility to block on-line casinos
in two instances: if it was technologically impossible to block
access or if it was prohibitively burdensome to do so.
</P>
<P>
   While operators tend to be mysterious, surveys have gathered
some information about users. On-line gamblers tend to be white men
ages 20 to 40, often wagering on sports, said Kevin O'Neill, a
spokesman for the Council on Compulsive Gambling of New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Sports betting is popular on the Internet, he said, ``because
everybody knows the outcome of a game _ you can't cheat on that.''
</P>
<P>
   On-line casinos typically set up accounts with customers that
debit a credit card. Losses are charged to the card, while winnings
are tallied as a credit.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, it has been relatively easy for on-line casinos to
open for business. Nearly two dozen of them are based in Antigua,
where a license can be bought for $100,000 or less, and there are
no taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Experts on gambling say on-line wagering removes most of the
social barriers that inhibit gambling. There is no travel. And it
can be done in private at home, so no one else has to know about
it.
</P>
<P>
   Lacey, the architect who lost $60,000 to Internet gambling, said
he started wagering on his computer as a way to forget off-line
frustrations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I found it as a means of escaping life's problems,'' he said.
``I was in a bad marriage. And I had the early stages of
Parkinson's.''
</P>
<P>
   The gambling problem, he said, is a much fiercer foe than his
health problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Parkinson's, I can control that with medication,'' he
said. ``That gambling, that's a harder thing to control.''

OUR STUFF IS EATING AWAY AT US 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LINDA WELTNER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   After my column on the pleasures of having just enough, I
received a letter from friends. They'd been looking for a simple
family hideaway where they could get away and enjoy life together
when they stumbled upon an amazing piece of property.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a magnificent tract of land,'' Steve says. ``Sitting in
the hot tub, you could see the most dramatic view of Mount
Monadnock on one side and a lovely secluded private pond on the
other. Besides a big, up-to-date main house, there was a garage
with a workroom and a small beach house by the water. Our immediate
response was, `This is not what we'd imagined, but why shouldn't we
shoot high?' We were dazzled.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Steve and Katrina walked away from this seductive
piece of real estate. They decided that not only didn't they want
to duplicate the house they had at home, they didn't want to
improve upon it, either. They wanted something more like, well _ a
shack.
</P>
<P>
   Why would anyone who could afford it turn their backs on all
that luxury? These guys must be crazy, right?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe not.
</P>
<P>
   My husband Jack and I have friends with gorgeous second houses
in Vermont who occasionally invite us to dinner. One day I decided
to help our hostess get ready. As I hiked up the road to her house,
I could hear the sound of her vacuum cleaner. By the time I reached
the front door, she was using the Cuisinart. Norma had spent her
day shopping for groceries, and the bags were still partially
unpacked. With a half-hour to go, she still had to empty the
dishwasher, set the table, and finish the avocado dip. When I asked
what I could do to help, she burst into tears.
</P>
<P>
   Some ``vacation'' house!
</P>
<P>
   We've all been tricked into thinking that we can buy peace of
mind, but the truth is that eventually you become a slave to all
the expensive things you bought to pamper you. A fancy house
requires a lot _ pictures on the walls, attractive furniture,
color-coordinated accessories, a host of appliances, and a certain
degree of cleanliness. To get those things, you have to plan and
shop and spend money. To maintain them, you have to scour and wash
and polish. When they break down, you need to hire carpenters who
won't show up, plumbers who don't call back, and appliance repair
men who make you stay home all day waiting for them.
</P>
<P>
   I'm in no position to criticize. God knows, I've spent an
obscene portion of my life looking after my possessions, but
there's a reason people don't take vacations at home. Although we
take our slavish guardianship of things for granted, we intuitively
sense there's too much to do at home. It's even harder with a
second house at a distance.
</P>
<P>
   This is the magic of our simple shelter in Vermont: It expects
very little from us. Raw pine walls ask for nothing more than
thumbtacks and a few maps, or pictures the children have drawn with
crayons. An unfinished floor requires nothing more than sweeping. A
meadow, instead of crying out for mowing, spends its energy
becoming the perfect habitat for fireflies. While a decent stove
insists you serve a decent meal, our campfire gives us permission
to say to guests, ``Here's a stick for cooking your chicken hot
dog.'' People appreciate that it's the best we can do.
</P>
<P>
   Possessions are deceitful and manipulative. A hot tub pretends
it will indulge you while giving out orders: ``Wash this scum off.
Fix my leak. Check the pH balance. I'm too hot. Secure the cover.
Don't just sit there: Drain me before the cold weather arrives.''
</P>
<P>
   The demands never stop. Most of us can't resist them.
</P>
<P>
   If I had cabinets, I know I'd line them instead of throwing a
few plastic dishes into a plastic milk carton, as I've done. If we
hadn't made our own beds and sofas by placing mats on homemade
four-legged tables, I know I'd pour my energy into buying nice
furniture and then protecting it. I have high standards, and I
maintain them when I can. It's only when I've given up all hope of
improving anything that I can allow myself to spend afternoons in
the hammock and twilights watching beavers.
</P>
<P>
   Steve and Katrina want a place where family comes first, where
there's very little to do except focus on one another, where you
make do with what you have and what you find and what you can make
with your own hands. They want a place where things don't rule, and
where the true luxury is having time for the things that matter.
</P>
<P>
   This is the dirty little secret of a consumer society: The
things we work so hard to possess end up consuming us.

   CHICAGO _ Kevin Lacey, a 41-year-old architect, was no gambler.
He had never even been to Las Vegas, Nev. But when he saw a
magazine advertisement about playing blackjack on the Internet, he
was intrigued.
</P>
<P>
   Just for fun, he found the Web site, keyed in his credit card,
played a few hands and won a couple of dollars. That was three
years ago. Now Mr. Lacey is more than $60,000 in debt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've maxed out seven credit cards,'' said Lacey, who recently
entered a gambling addiction program. ``I've got to get this
monster under control.''
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of ``cybercasinos'' have come on line since 1995,
giving almost anyone with a computer and a credit card the chance
to gamble. Americans last year wagered an estimated $1 billion on
line in a form that thrives in a legal twilight zone as advances in
technology have outpaced the law.
</P>
<P>
   These cybercasinos are based offshore, many of them on Caribbean
islands, because gambling in the United States requires specific
legal permission. On-line casinos blur those legal boundaries.
</P>
<P>
   Is it illegal for a woman in Ohio, for instance, to place a bet
with a cybercasino in Antigua? Does the betting occur in Ohio or in
Antigua?
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Jon Kyl, Republican of Arizona, has introduced a bill that
would prohibit on-line gambling by giving judges the power to shut
down Internet providers who give Web sites to cybercasinos.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate approved the measure last year 90 to 9, but it did
not come to a vote in the House of Representatives before Congress
adjourned. The bill is expected to come to the Senate floor again
this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Kyl, the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee's
subcommittee on technology, said he thought that Internet gambling
already violated the law against sports betting, which, although
permitted in Las Vegas, was banned under the Federal Wire Act of
1961. But the law does not address nonsports betting.
</P>
<P>
   And the 1961 measure could eventually be irrelevant if satellite
transmission or radio waves replace telephone lines.
</P>
<P>
   For now, some states have taken separate approaches, none of
them altogether effective. Illinois and Louisiana have banned
Internet gambling. Minnesota is studying whether on-line wagering
could be regulated and licensed. And Missouri has taken court
action against on-line gambling providers.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Nixon, the Attorney General of Missouri, has filed a Federal
suit in Kansas City against the Coeur D'Alene Indian tribe in
Idaho, contending that the tribe's lottery and bingo Web site
violates Missouri's consumer laws, which prohibit the sale of
illegal goods or services.
</P>
<P>
   The tribe, meanwhile, contends that the wagering is legal
because it is based in a sovereign American Indian nation, where
wagering is permitted.
</P>
<P>
   Missouri also filed suit against a Pennsylvania man for running
an Internet gambling site. The man pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor
charge last year and was fined $27,000.
</P>
<P>
   But prosecutions of Internet gambling remain rarer than a poker
hand of four aces. Sue Schneider, who publishes an on-line magazine
on computer gambling, Interactive Gaming News, said it would be
impossible to stop people from wagering over the Internet. She said
that more than 500 sites offered gambling.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, she said, states and the Federal Government should
regulate the industry. Australia, she noted, has recently started
to license on-line casinos.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could regulate them just like you regulate any land-based
gambling operation,'' Schneider said.
</P>
<P>
   Dianne Meyer, the publisher of Rolling Good Times On-Line,
another Internet magazine that reports about on-line gambling, said
a prohibition would drive the industry underground. That would
leave consumers with no protection, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an unregulated industry that desperately needs to be
regulated,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But on-line gambling has relatively few defenders. In June, the
National Gambling Impact Study Commission, created by Congress,
called for a ban on Internet gambling.
</P>
<P>
   Most professional sports leagues, as well as the National
Collegiate Athletic Association, have called for the prohibition of
on-line wagering. The Las Vegas casino industry has called for a
ban as well.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Fahrenkopf, the president of the American Gaming
Association, which represents the casino industry, said he scoffed
at the notion that his group's opposition to on-line gambling was
rooted in a fear of competition. He said the industry's chief
concern was that Internet gambling would tarnish all operators of
casinos.
</P>
<P>
   Even those who support the ban, however, acknowledge that
enforcement could be difficult. And the Internet providers have
chafed at being forced to act as a sheriff expected to keep outlaws
out of a virtual Dodge City.
</P>
<P>
   Acknowledging those concerns, the Kyl measure would relieve
Internet providers of the responsibility to block on-line casinos
in two instances: if it was technologically impossible to block
access or if it was prohibitively burdensome to do so.
</P>
<P>
   While operators tend to be mysterious, surveys have gathered
some information about users. On-line gamblers tend to be white men
ages 20 to 40, often wagering on sports, said Kevin O'Neill, a
spokesman for the Council on Compulsive Gambling of New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Sports betting is popular on the Internet, he said, ``because
everybody knows the outcome of a game _ you can't cheat on that.''
</P>
<P>
   On-line casinos typically set up accounts with customers that
debit a credit card. Losses are charged to the card, while winnings
are tallied as a credit.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, it has been relatively easy for on-line casinos to
open for business. Nearly two dozen of them are based in Antigua,
where a license can be bought for $100,000 or less, and there are
no taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Experts on gambling say on-line wagering removes most of the
social barriers that inhibit gambling. There is no travel. And it
can be done in private at home, so no one else has to know about
it.
</P>
<P>
   Lacey, the architect who lost $60,000 to Internet gambling, said
he started wagering on his computer as a way to forget off-line
frustrations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I found it as a means of escaping life's problems,'' he said.
``I was in a bad marriage. And I had the early stages of
Parkinson's.''
</P>
<P>
   The gambling problem, he said, is a much fiercer foe than his
health problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Parkinson's, I can control that with medication,'' he
said. ``That gambling, that's a harder thing to control.''

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   On Saturday beginning at 3 p.m. Eastern standard time, millions
of people worldwide are expected to log on to their computers for a
seven-hour concert billed by its promoters as the largest Internet
event in history.
</P>
<P>
   The concert's Web site _ NetAid.org _ is poised to handle one
million hits per minute, delivering 125,000 streams of live video
per second of music megastars from David Bowie to Sheryl Crow
performing in New York, London, and Geneva.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, sites for the 1998 Winter Olympic games and World
Cup soccer matches were each configured to handle less than
one-tenth of the traffic expected for NetAid, which, in addition to
being a benefit for poverty eradication programs worldwide, is also
meant to be the ultimate test of the Internet's capacity.
</P>
<P>
   What's expected to keep NetAid's Webcast from melting under the
intense heat of unpredictable surges of traffic? The ``secret
sauce'' is a mathematical equation developed by professors and
students at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
</P>
<P>
   That equation, now embodied in a mindboggling computer program
tens of thousands of lines long, belongs to Akamai Technologies
Inc., a small startup nestled in Cambridge's Technology Square and
founded by MIT whizzes.
</P>
<P>
   Here's how it works. Traffic for any Web site is handled through
computers called servers that can be located anywhere. Generally,
however, each Web site's traffic and its servers are centrally
coordinated by a single traffic cop. Akamai's algorithm
dramatically multiplies the number of traffic cops by giving each
server the ability to direct data by independently calculating a
workable route. This helps to keep information flowing and prevent
flash crowds from crushing the site.
</P>
<P>
   Sounds simple. But the ability to accommodate uncontrollable,
unpredictable, massive flows of traffic is tremendously complex
because it involves an infinite number of constantly changing
variables.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, events such as the Victoria's Secret Webcast
fashion show in February and the Olympics site crumpled un-
</P>
<P>
   der the burden of unforeseen traffic.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, computer scientists have been stymied over the
problem of figuring out the best way to prevent crashes on the Web.
That dilemma prompted a conversation on the topic in 1995 between
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, and Tom
Leighton, a tenured math professor at MIT.
</P>
<P>
   As it turns out, the best answer is not the most perfect answer,
according to Paul Sagan, president of Akamai and a second cousin of
Carl Sagan, the late astronomer. So instead of relying on an
equation that required knowledge of all variables, the Akamai
network functions on computers that require a far more limited
amount of information to make routing decisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``A partial answer based on limited information works just as
well as a perfect answer based on all the information,'' Sagan
said. ``Now what you have is a global solution that can fix
Internet traffic problems now demonstrated in what will be the
largest Internet event ever.''
</P>
<P>
   So on Saturday, all hands will be on deck at Akamai for NetAid,
the most public test thus far of the company's abilities.
Technicians will huddle in Akamai's network operations center, a
room that resembles a NASA command control center. Filled with
about 30 monitors, the room's computers function as air-traffic
control for the entire Internet, monitoring data flows, checking on
the status of the Internet, and calculating the capacity of any
given node on the 'net _ all in real time. (On any given day,
Akamai's network manages Internet traffic flows for megasites such
as CNN, Yahoo!, and Go Network, sometimes steering as much as half
a billion hits in just 24 hours.)
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the concert, the NetAid site is set up to handle
1,000 donations per second in a virtual marriage of e-commerce and
entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   The site's sponsors, Cisco Systems Inc., Akamai, KPMG Peat
Marwick, and the United Nations Development Programme, won't say
how much money is likely to be raised to combat poverty. But every
dollar donated will go directly into a foundation, rather than be
used to help pay for the event. Cisco, which spearheaded the event
as a way to show off its technological prowess, is donating 1,500
servers housed in 90 data centers in 15 countries. Akamai will
donate its ``secret sauce,'' as Sagan puts it, to keep data flowing
at the Web site, which was desgined gratis by KPMG.
</P>
<P>
   The concert is expected to culminate in a simultaneous crooning
by dozens of pop artists of ``New Day,'' a song by Wyclef Jean and
Bono.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the scenes, making sure that Internet surfers catch every
note, will be Sagan and his crew of programmers. Asked what it was
like to be involved in the event, Sagan recalled a day in August
when the site was announced and he found himself sitting on a dais
for a press conference with Kofi Annan, secretary general of the
United Nations, rap musician Puff Daddy, and rock star David Bowie.
The glue for his brief conversations with the celebrities turned
out to be the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``The common ground, it turned out, wasn't politics or
Hollywood. It was the Internet,'' said a star-struck Sagan. ``It
was being Web-aware.''

FOUNDATION THE SOLUTION TO SAGGING BRICK STAIRS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER HOTTON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I am getting brick steps fixed and replaced. They are
sagging, sinking, and uneven, and undergoing a general malaise.
They are quite old, but I wonder why they are sagging and sinking
so much. Is the earth under them unstable? Or are they not on a
proper foundation? Would they need to be completely rebuilt, or can
they be shored up?
</P>
<P>
   A.B., Brighton, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. I don't think it is a matter of unstable earth under them; it
is rare for earth to be unstable, unless it is freshly filled earth
that was not compacted properly. And since it took so long for the
steps to go into their malaise, I think it is because they have no
foundation, a structure that goes at least 3 feet into the ground
to prevent heaving from winter frost. It is the heaving, which is
an irresistible force, that causes the malaise.
</P>
<P>
   It would not do much good to shore up the steps. I think they
should be taken apart and removed, a proper foundation should be
put in (poured concrete or concrete blocks going at least 3 feet
into the ground), and new steps should be installed. You can
certainly use the old brick, but it does not sound as if the old
steps can be removed in one piece and put back on the foundation.
</P>
<P>
   If you do that, it will not move in winter or summer, and will
last indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I took up the carpeting in my foyer, revealing a parquet
floor, but with a lot of nails driven into the wood and not
countersunk. There are black marks around each nail head, which is
flush with the wood. The living room has a similar parquet floor,
but no nails showing. Why are the floors so different, and why did
they let the nails show in the foyer?
</P>
<P>
   ELLEN COUGHLIN, Lynn, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Sounds to me like carelessness, ineptitude, or a thought that
a foyer is less formal than anyplace else, so anything went. Who
knows, really, what lurks in the minds of floor layers. Actually,
sometimes parquet floors were face-nailed (with the nail head
showing) on purpose; when the nails corroded, they created those
black spots, and the whole thing was considered decorative.
</P>
<P>
   But hope springs eternal: You can refinish the foyer floors and
no one will notice the difference. Countersink the nails, if indeed
their heads are not too big; the heads must be very small, like a
finish nail or cut nail, in order for them to be countersunk in
hardwood. Fill the holes with a wood filler of the same color as
the wood, then sand and finish.
</P>
<P>
   If the nails have big heads, I have no good answer for you
except to live with the black marks. Since you said the nails are
impossible to pull out without messing up the wood, that is as good
a motive as any to live with the black marks if you can't do
anything else.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I enclosed my porch, putting in windows and a ceramic tile
floor over about a 2-foot crawl space. I put insulation under the
floor with the paper vapor barrier down, facing the crawl space. I
realize that the vapor barrier is facing in the wrong direction.
Will that hurt? And what should I do to alleviate it? Someone
suggested I screw 1-inch rigid polyisocyanurate on the bottom of
the joists. Is there anything else I should do?
</P>
<P>
   BILL KELLEY, Georgetown, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. There are several things you should do, but I would not worry
too much about the wrong-way vapor barrier. It has been done many
times, and while it is wrong according to the state-of-the-art
rules, it may be OK for years. The only danger from such a
situation is trapping moisture between the vapor barrier and the
floor above. To keep an eye on that, inspect the insulation
occasionally; if it is not wet, then you have nothing to worry
about. If it is damp or wet, then take it down and reverse it.
</P>
<P>
   And do not put the rigid insulation up; that would seal the
cavity even more, which I don't think is a good idea.
</P>
<P>
   Three things that you should do are:
</P>
<P>
   1. Staple Tyvek to the bottom of the joists; this stops the
passage of air but allows water vapor to pass through it in both
directions, which you want to happen. Perforate that insulation
backing paper before putting up the Tyvek.
</P>
<P>
   2. Cover the crawl space ground with polyethylene plastic. This
will keep water vapor from coming up through the ground and into
the crawl space.
</P>
<P>
   3. Ventilate the crawl space; open windows, if any (unlikely in
a 2-foot crawl space), but make sure there are vents that you can
open and close. Keep those vents open from April to October; they
can be closed in winter, but will help keep down moisture for the
rest of the year.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I have hot-water heat and plan to replace my boiler. Can I
put in central air at the same time?
</P>
<P>
   TRACY SLUICER, Millis, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. You can put in central air any time you please, but there is
no advantage to doing it at the same time as you replace the
boiler, because the boiler and the a/c have nothing to do with each
other. The a/c will require putting in ducts as well as the
compressor and coils, which adds to the cost, so it might be a good
idea to postpone the a/c for a while, and concentrate on paying for
the new boiler before being hit with the a/c bill.

HOW COLETTE SINNED, THEN REDEEMED HERSELF 
</HEADLINE>

CREATING COLETTE 
From Baroness to Woman of Letters, 1912-1954 
By Claude Francis and Fernande Gontier 
Steerforth Press, 298 pp., illustrated, $27 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is 1913 as the second volume of this exhaustive biography of
Colette, the famed French writer, begins. She has shed her user of
a husband, Henry Gauthier-Villars, who claimed much of her early
work as his own, and has moved on to her second (but not last)
husband, newsman and politician Henry de Jouvenel. With her
marriage have come respectability and the title of baroness.
</P>
<P>
   But this is a woman determined not to go quietly into anyone's
good night. She has spent her first 40 years in a gauzy whirl of
fabulous parties and lovers of both sexes, and is high-stepping
into middle age with nary a sign that time has dulled her voracious
lust for life. Though married, she continues her relationships with
women and men, including renowned actress Musidora and Bertrand de
Jouvenel, her 16-year-old stepson, with whom she had a five-year
affair.
</P>
<P>
   ``Colette herself . . . renounced nothing,'' write her
biographers Claude Francis and Fernande Gontier, and for the rest
of her inimitable life she would continue to ``soar toward a law
written by herself for herself.''
</P>
<P>
   This concluding volume of ``Creating Colette,'' which spans the
last 41 years of the writer's life, is no less involving than its
predecessor, which began this definitive work. But there is
something decidedly less admirable about its subject. In the first
book, the woman born Sidonie-Gabrielle Colette sashayed into the
reader's consciousness as a sort of Tante Mame, a devil-may-care
firebrand with an expansive view of life and love. But in this
volume, the reader is confronted with Colette's brutalizing
selfishness. She fully enjoyed life, but often at the expense of
those around her _ her mother, her daughter, her lovers.
</P>
<P>
   Especially discomforting is the section dealing with the death
of her mother, Adele Eugenie Sidonie ``Sido'' Landois. Sido had
endured a double mastectomy, and for a year begged her daughter to
come see her. Colette would promise to visit, then never show up.
Her mother's failing health coincided with Colette's burgeoning
affair with the elder de Jouvenel, the editor of Le Matin. Colette
was already angling to marry him, wanting ``the artistocratic title
and the standing it would give her in society.'' Jouvenel was a
blindly ambitious womanizer, yet Colette had no desire to leave him
even to tend to a dying parent.
</P>
<P>
   Not that Colette even believed the gravity of her mother's
condition. In a letter, she called Sido ``insufferable,'' and said
her mother was ailing from nothing more dire than ``a fit of `I
want to see my daughter.' '' Colette, however, sought her mother's
approval of Jouvenel; she would never get it. When Sido died,
Colette did not attend the funeral.
</P>
<P>
   She displays an equal lack of sympathy to the nascent feminist
movement. While women were fighting for economic and political
equality, Colette found their interest in such matters unseemly.
Women involving themselves in politics undermined what she believed
were the feminine virtues of ``incompetence, timidity, silence.''
In this book, Colette is revealed in all her contradictions _ a
woman who demanded her freedom above all else, yet denounced women
who publicly campaigned for social independence. But Francis and
Gontier are not as apt in analyzing such inconsistencies as they
are in detailing Colette's actions and saucy observations.
</P>
<P>
   But just as Colette's self-centeredness threatens to overcome
the book, there comes the true centerpiece of Colette's story. It
is not found in her writings, though the inspirations and
influences of such acclaimed works as ``Gigi,'' ``The Break of
Day,'' and ``The Pure and the Impure'' are thoroughly discussed.
(On the event of her 80th birthday, the New Yorker hails her as
``France's writing genius.'') It comes in her relationship with
Maurice Goudeket, whom she met in 1925 and with whom she would
remain for the rest of his life. In 1941, Goudeket, who was Jewish,
was arrested by the Nazis in Paris. It was Colette, then suffering
from debilitating arthritis, who worked tirelessly to gain his
release. When told Goudeket could be saved from a trip to Auschwitz
if he accepted a job as a detention-camp snitch, Colette said, ``We
both choose death.'' This display of selflessness and integrity,
absent from much of the rest of Colette's life, redeems her, and
restores her to the feisty, even endearing woman of this
biography's first volume.
</P>
<P>
   Colette died in 1954, at 81. She was the first woman writer
honored with a state funeral _ though Goudeket's request for a
religious ceremony as well was denied by the archbishop, who was
dismayed that she never showed ``repentance for her sins.'' So
instead of the cross he wanted on her granite tomb in Paris's Pere
Lachaise cemetery, Goudeket instead summed up the complicated life
of the woman he (and countless others) loved with the simple
inscription: ``Here Lies Colette.''

ENJOY ADS FOR `DOT COM' UNTIL THE SHAKEOUT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   You can't turn on the television, listen to the radio or drive
down the highway without being bombarded by advertisements for
``dot com'' companies.
</P>
<P>
   Brokerage firms, banks, toy companies, and job-finding services
are spending money at a furious clip. The wave of e-spending has
been wonderful for anyone with ad space to sell, including The
Boston Globe. It has also been fun for viewers, because much of the
e-advertising is very clever.
</P>
<P>
   The question is: Is it good for investors who have made bets on
the e-commerce sector? Is all the spending a sign of strength or a
signal that the brutally competitive world of the Internet is
getting even more brutal and unprofitable?
</P>
<P>
   It isn't hard to figure out why we are seeing the explosion of
``dot com'' advertising. ``It used to be that you could build a
brand name over time. Now you have to do it overnight,'' said
Edward Boches, executive creative director at Mullen, an
advertising agency based in Wenham that handles many ``dot com''
clients.
</P>
<P>
   Brand name is everything in the Internet era. ``Dot com'' firms
need to build brand names to create customer loyalty, and they have
to do it fast, before the competition catches up. Advertising is
the obvious solution. The ``dot com'' companies can afford it. Many
have raised tens or even hundreds of millions of dollars from
venture capitalists and initial public offerings.
</P>
<P>
   MotherNature.com, a Concord, Mass. company that sells natural
products on line, has raised $61 million in venture financing. The
company expects to spend $25 million on promotion this year, much
of it on radio ads.
</P>
<P>
   ``By talking to people through media they know, you convince
them that you are for real,'' Michael Barach, the firm's chief
executive, said in an interview this summer.
</P>
<P>
   But what happens if everyone in the business has the exact same
strategy? The electronic brokerage industry is a perfect example.
According to The New York Times, the top 10 players in the industry
will spend $1.5 billion in advertising over the next year. E-Trade
was the first to the airwaves with a zippy ad campaign, but since
then Charles Schwab, Ameritrade, and others have followed with
campaigns of their own.
</P>
<P>
   The e-brokerage companies say they are spending $400 to $500 to
attract each new customer. The numbers are probably smaller in
other businesses, but the basic trend is the same. ``Customer
acquisition costs are skyrocketing,'' said Nick Moore, a money
manager with Jurika &AMP; Voyles in Oakland, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Eileen Leary, who follows retailing for State Street Research,
looks at the same numbers and worries about profitability. ``You
could spend $100 to get a customer who spends $50 a year,'' she
said. If the customer stays loyal for 10 years, the investment
might make sense, she says. But who can say how loyal customers
will remain in a world with so many choices?
</P>
<P>
   Rising advertising budgets are also driving up the cost of
advertising. A 30-second spot on next year's Super Bowl will cost
$2 million, up 25 percent from a year ago. Demand for the spots is
intense, especially from ``dot com'' companies. Boches says
television and radio stations are getting premium prices for
advertising this Christmas season. The culprit? The same
e-companies.
</P>
<P>
   In effect, the ``dot com'' companies are in an arms race. They
keep spending more on advertising because they have to keep up with
the competition. They can't afford to stop, but many probably can't
afford to keep going.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a Darwinian business,'' Barach said. ``There are only
going to be a few electronic winners in each category. Everyone
else will die or merge.''
</P>
<P>
   In truth, it's hard to see how things can play out any other
way. The Internet is a marvelous medium, but it has virtually no
barriers to entry. Categories can get crowded very quickly with
competitors who make the same product or offer the same service.
Clever advertising is one way to distinguish yourself from the
crowd, but when everyone else is running clever ad campaigns, who
is going to remember yours?
</P>
<P>
   ``The shakeout is coming,'' predicted Ned Riley, chief
investment officer at BankBoston.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, investors should enjoy those witty ``dot com''
commercials. In some cases, that may be the only return on
investment they ever see.

SO FAR, A DISAPPOINTING SEASON FOR ALL-PRO TY LAW 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ART ADV.: A photo is being sent to NYTNS clients. Non-subscribers
can make individual purchases by calling 212-556-4204 or -1927.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ The gray T-shirt was darkened by a free flow
of sweat running down Ty Law's head, face, and neck. The water
cooler in the back of the locker room was chugging down as Law kept
reaching for more cups of water to replenish his fluids.
</P>
<P>
   After a morning practice walkthrough, the Patriots cornerback
stayed behind and ran 100-yard sprints. After that, he ran up and
down the stadium stairs, reminisicent of ``Rocky.''
</P>
<P>
   And then he headed out to practice in full pads.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got to get into better shape,'' said Law, an astonishing
statement. ``Maybe people think I'm in great shape, but it's not
good enough for me. I've got to keep running until I'm not tired
anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   In Law's eyes, the season is a 15-round heavyweight fight.
There's no cheating, no room for rest and relaxation. He doesn't
like the way he's played in the Patriots' 4-0 start. He doesn't
particularly care for the zone defenses the Patriots have been
playing, which have taken him out of his true element: man-on-man
coverage. But he's not mad at anyone but himself, because he feels
he simply hasn't played as well as he should have.
</P>
<P>
   He describes his play as ``average.''
</P>
<P>
   Law, an All-Pro, hates average.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've played average and I'm not going to stand for being
mediocre,'' said Law. ``In zone coverage I was an average
cornerback. I didn't do anything poor; I didn't do anything great.
I didn't play up to my expectations. The coaches are saying you're
playing well, don't get mad or frustrated. But I've been average
and I'm not going to stand for it. I always wanted to be an
above-average corner and player, and that's what I'm gonna do.''
</P>
<P>
   When you're considered the league's second-best cornerback based
on nine interceptions the previous season, have shut down each
opponent's best receiver, and draw the second-highest paycheck at
your position (seven years, $50 million), what's happened thus far
has to be aggravating.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talked to Deion (Sanders) in the offseason and he said,
`Don't get frustrated.' He said nine interceptions are gonna be
hard to come by again. Coach (Pete) Carroll told me the same thing.
It's all about making plays. If I could put a patch on one of the
quarterback's eyes and minimize the opportunities, I've done my
job. If I'm playing average and winning, it's better than getting a
lot of interceptions and losing,'' said Law.
</P>
<P>
   Carroll claims Law is seeing as many balls thrown his way as he
did a year ago. But Law said he hasn't noticed that teams are
trying to beat him, per se.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think they're trying to throw it at me,'' he said.
``As you can see, we haven't been playing bump and run. They pick
and chose. I take a lot of pride in my man-to-man coverage, but I
have to seize the opportunity when I'm playing zone. If they attack
me, I welcome it because I'm eager to make plays.''
</P>
<P>
   Except for the second half of Week 2's 31-28 win over the
Indianapolis Colts, Law has not received the same man-to-man
chances as a year ago. The Patriots' staff has been trying not to
coach so predictably, switching to a zone and forcing the
opposition to change its plan of attack. But it seems the Patriots
are most effective in man-to-man.
</P>
<P>
   Law made that clear when the Patriots were down, 28-7, at the
half to Indianapolis. Marvin Harrison had caught six first-half
passes for 100 yards. In the second half, the Patriots switched to
a man-to-man, and Harrison caught one pass for 5 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were more effective when we switched to the man coverage,''
said Law. ``I was having a hissy fit at halftime because I didn't
like the way things were going. Hopefully I get to do it more
often.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always look forward to playing one on one, but I have to
play what the coaches call. I got to do some things last year I
never got a chance to do. I know we can't do the same things all
the time because the other teams watch the film, too. I'm not
saying I'm frustrated by it, but you give up too many easy passes
when you're playing off on zones and stuff. If a guy catches a ball
off me, I'd rather make him earn it and make him play tough for
it.''
</P>
<P>
   And he knows that people who don't understand the Patriots'
defense are going to think the catches made by Keyshawn Johnson,
Harrison, and Kevin Johnson are his fault.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the thing, people are gonna think because of last year
I'm going to match up man to man all the time,'' he said. ``I can
handle it. I know I can play. My teammates know we've had different
responsibilities from last year, when I had someone man to man
80-90 percent of the time. But I have to do a better job doing my
job.''
</P>
<P>
   Law said some responsibilities have shifted because Chris Carter
is new to free safety.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a factor because we have Chris Carter, who is a great
talent and a great physical specimen. Like anybody, it takes time
to learn and play with the guys who have been out there. With
Willie Clay, he had been there and we could do certain things,''
said Law.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we take a different approach when Lawyer (Milloy) is on
your side and when Chris is on your side. We simplify it a bit with
Chris. Willie was Einstein back there; he was able to do so much.
Chris is coming along well and playing great ball, but pretty soon
we're going to throw the kitchen sink at him and say, `Take
control.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Law said he needs to do more, especially this week against
Kansas City. In a 40-10 Patriots victory last year, he shut down
Andre Rison, holding him to one catch for 5 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is gonna be a great matchup physically and mentally.
Kansas City is 28-6 the last four years at home, they have fan
support, and they have players who can beat you on both sides of
the ball. I played against (wide receiver) Derrick Alexander in
college for two years and I know his capabilities. He can burn you.
He's fast, strong, and quick, and he's probably the most underrated
receiver in the league. Andre Rison knows who he is. He's been
around the league. We're going to have our work cut out,'' said
Law.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody really knows whom Law will match up against most of the
time Sunday. All Law knows is he'll be there for Round 5 when the
bell rings. And this week, he's looking for a knockout.

HOPING THE NEW ENQUIRER KEEPS ITS ODDBALL APPEAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE WHITE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here's the new, revamped National Enquirer hot off the
supermarket newsstand and the change is . . . am I missing
something? This week's new Enquirer appears to be much the same as
last week's old one.
</P>
<P>
   The type on the cover is slightly larger. They've added a
definite article to the name, so now it's The National Enquirer.
That's a big change. Inside the layout looks cleaner, the
photographs brighter. That seems to be about all, change-wise.
</P>
<P>
   A story in Friday's Wall Street Journal reported that the
Enquirer's new owners, Evercore Capital Partners, are ``aiming to
gain respectability and new readers'' by creating a fresh look for
the tabloid and increasing its credibility.
</P>
<P>
   New publisher David Pecker told the WSJ, ``In a year's time, I
want people to think of the National Enquirer as a credible
newspaper and a credible news-gathering force where everything you
read is absolutely true.''
</P>
<P>
   You mean until now everything I've read in the Enquirer hasn't
been absolutely true? Why, I'm shocked.
</P>
<P>
   The new emphasis on credibility must be why the editors chose to
run another JonBenet Ramsey-related story on the cover, this one
headlined ``Mental Disorder Made Mom Kill.'' Says who? Say a couple
of ``mental health experts'' who've never met the woman.
</P>
<P>
   Sensational? Sleazy? Of course. But as an Enquirer devotee I
find the story perversely heartening. The Enquirer may be
undergoing an identity crisis, but it hasn't yet gone completely
mainstream. I hope it never does.
</P>
<P>
   The WSJ story seemed to confuse the Enquirer with its sister
organ, The Weekly World News, because the headline on the story
read, ``Reincarnated Supermarket Tabloid Kills Elvis!'' Any tabloid
addict knows the Enquirer gave up resurrecting Elvis long ago. You
have to read The Weekly World News to keep abreast of the latest
sightings. There are no Elvis-related bulletins in the current
issue, but there is a most compelling story headlined, ``Washington
Think Tanks are Riddled With Space Aliens.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as I've always suspected. But back to the Enquirer. The
space alien story is the sort of piece we won't be reading in the
new Enquirer, but we wouldn't have read it in the old Enquirer
either, not in recent years. The Enquirer has gradually shed much
of its old weirdness. It's becoming a celebrity-driven gossip
magazine. In the transition it's losing some of its peculiar
appeal, and perhaps not coincidentally, its circulation.
</P>
<P>
   According to the WSJ story, the new Enquirer is trying to
compete for readers and advertising with People. So is every other
publication. People and its ilk are fine, if you like that sort of
thing, but the celebrity-lifestyle magazine genre is a crowded
field. I hate to see the Enquirer completely abandon its eccentric
editorial personality to become just another People clone.
</P>
<P>
   When I turn to the Enquirer, I don't want to read yet another
fawning profile of Gwyneth Paltrow or Kevin Spacey or whichever
celebrity is ``hot'' on a given week. I open the Enquirer hoping to
find the odd stories I won't read elsewhere. This week, tucked away
among the celebrity gossip (``Monica's $ Million Diet''), the
celebrity lifestyle pieces (``Inside Rosie's Mansion''), the
uplifting celebrity human interest stories (``Welfare Mom Finds
Fame &AMP; Fortune as Best-Selling Author''), I found a classic
supermarket tabloid story: ``The Tomato Patch Murder: Family Blows
Away Grandpa and Turns Him into Fertilizer.''
</P>
<P>
   So the Enquirer hasn't totally abandoned its strange mission. I
hope it never does.

TULIP TIME: HERE, NOW, DUSTY AND SWEATY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE HATCH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There's tulip time in Holland in the spring. And there's tulip
time here and now.
</P>
<P>
   Then and there is famously gorgeous. What I'm up to is dusty and
sweaty, but digging is good exercise and will lead to at least one
season of outstanding display.
</P>
<P>
   That's the way of it with tulips. Put in the work to plant them,
and almost without fail you will get one season of incredible
bloom. That's because when you buy a bulb, the flower is already
formed inside. Unless the bulb rots in soil that's too soggy (don't
plant it there), is ``blasted'' by heat because you don't plant it
upon receipt (get digging), or is devoured by wildlife (get the
shotgun, Maude), you will have a flower.
</P>
<P>
   And maybe you'll have one the following year as well, and maybe
not. Tulips have a reputation as being short-lived perennials,
though it is somewhat exaggerated.
</P>
<P>
   The Darwin hybrids are the most reliable repeaters, though
Pieter Messelaar of the Messelaar Bulb Co. in Ipswich, Mass.
cautioned that ``it depends a lot on the garden situation, too. You
don't want an acid soil, for example.''
</P>
<P>
   Does burying tulips extra deep (a few inches, don't go crazy)
work? ``I haven't found that it does,'' Messelaar said. ``Some
people believe that.'' I have believed that, but then my reliable
returners, planted extra deep, have been Kaufmannianas and
Greigeiis, which are more likely than some others to repeat.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's botanical species that are pretty good, too, the
little multiflowering ones,'' Messelaar said, referring to the many
species of small tulips. He likes Tulipa bakeri ``Lilac Wonder,''
which has rosy lilac flowers with yellow bases, and Tulipa
dasystemon, which is whitish with golden centers and naturalizes
just great in sunny, gravelly spots, such as where I grow it amid
cactus and yuccas.
</P>
<P>
   Dirk Visser of Dirk Visser's Holland Bulbs, also in Ipswich,
said cottage tulips and Triumphs will return a few times, which is
good, since I just planted 300 of them.
</P>
<P>
   He likes Darwin hybrids for their repetition but also for their
overall strength. ``They're strong growers, strong stems, they last
a good while, and there are some real nice colors in there,'' said
Visser, who has both a catalog- and Internet-based retail business,
as well as a wholesale operation, supplying parks, college,
landscapers, and other large consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Institutional users often go for the show, dig up the spent
bulbs afterward, and replace them in the fall. Which is fine with
Visser, noting with a laugh, ``otherwise we'd be out of business
pretty quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   Messelaar spoke of the Parrots, which have showy, fringed
flowers with striking striations: ``They're very, very beautiful,
they're great cut flowers, but they don't tend to come back at
all.''
</P>
<P>
   His advice is to have a cut-flower garden. Put the ``spent''
tulips in there. If some don't flower again, so what? If some do,
you have a source of tulips for inside.
</P>
<P>
   Visser said it is difficult to project trends in tulips, and he
simply carries hundreds of varieties.
</P>
<P>
   Messelaar, whose bulb company is a family-run retail operation,
selling from a barn in Ipswich, said he had noticed that species
tulips are becoming very popular. Also, ``Apricot Beauty,'' a
Triumph, is still very popular, ``and then there's the one called
`Angelique,' which is a double pink that is very popular.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Angelique'' is a double late tulip, a beautiful delicate pink
with a creamy pink edge. I grew it until the neighboring cherry
tree and clerodendron shaded it out. Its flowers were like small
peonies, and ``Carnaval de Nice,'' which I just planted under a
rose off the back deck, should be similar, except white with
brilliant red flames.
</P>
<P>
   Also part of this year's planting are two species tulips,
``Little Beauty'' (scented, cherry-red with a blue center) and
``Little Princess'' (orange and yellow with a black center). They
went in two spots, mixed, and should return reliably and may well
naturalize.
</P>
<P>
   The big planting was the Triumphs. My wife and I came up with a
blend too delicious to resist, and if they peter out in two or
three years, we'll dig them up and replace them with something
else. But around the first of May, in a bed along the driveway, we
should have a swath of ``Meissner Porzellan,'' a rose and creamy
white flower, surrounded by a mix of deep purple ``Negrita'' and
soft pink ``Jo Ann.''
</P>
<P>
   Tulips are special. They are worth the trouble at tulip time.

BEAUTY RUNS DEEP, FAST IN HIGH-PERFORMANCE ACURA NSXT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROYAL FORD  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Acura NSX has always been a car out there on the periphery
of my interest.
</P>
<P>
   Great looking car. Heard it was fast. Heard it ate up tires.
</P>
<P>
   But like many people, when I heard the price _ approaching
$90,000 _ I tuned out, assuming that anything that costs that much
must, by definition, be of German or Italian manufacture.
</P>
<P>
   Shows you what I know.
</P>
<P>
   The Acura NSXT, a finely sculpted piece of sizzling aluminum,
belongs right up there among the finest high-performance sports
cars.
</P>
<P>
   It is incredibly fast, incredibly comfortable (slip into it and
you feel as if you're wearing the car), and impeccable in its
handling. And talk about delicate feel. You can sense even the
slightest changes in the texture of the road through your hands on
the wheel.
</P>
<P>
   This is a handcrafted car, and aluminum is used wherever
possible: aluminum unit body construction; all-aluminum engine,
aluminum suspension. Helps keep the car light (just over 3,000
pounds) for the nearly 300 horses that propel it. When they build
these at a special plant in Japan, each car is moved individually
from station to station. Acura will sell only about 500 of them in
the United States this year. That will be 500 lucky buyers.
</P>
<P>
   As I said, you wear this car when you sit in it. Inside, it's a
cocoon of leather: firm leather seats with strong thigh support and
flanges outside the legs and up each side of the back and
shoulders. Slam the door and you're in tight, with every seam of
leather _ dash, doors, seats _ finely stitched.
</P>
<P>
   Grab the leather steering and look around. Every gauge you need
while driving is right behind the wheel. A yoke, much like an
airplane yoke, sits behind the wheel, and that's where you'll find
the command center for lights, windshield wipers, and cruise
control.
</P>
<P>
   In a wonderful bit of ergonomics, the center console ramps down
from the dash toward the stick shift. On it are controls for the
audio system and climate. Buttons are minimal and four knobs, each
with a button at the middle and a pivoting wheel circling it,
control the basics of sound and climate. Punch the climate buttons
and you switch to automatic climate control or turn the fan off. To
change temperature, spin a wheel. To boost the fan, spin a wheel.
</P>
<P>
   Same with the audio. On-off and AM-FM are button-punches. Manual
tuning and volume are wheel-spins. In no time at all, you can run
this whole setup without taking your eyes off the road.
</P>
<P>
   Arm rests slant down on the doors from dash to back of the door
and in them are window, lock, and mirror controls and, ingeniously,
vents to better move the air through the cockpit.
</P>
<P>
   The view from that cockpit is racer-like: You see the fat bulges
of each front fender, but the hood virtually disappears and you are
looking at nothing but road straight ahead, aiming down the fenders
as though they are sights as you corner.
</P>
<P>
   At idle, the engine is deceptively quiet. But get on the gas at
speed _ say fourth gear on your way up to sixth _ and the rumble
from the engine behind you is deep and loud, remarkably so for a
car redlined at 8,000 rpms.
</P>
<P>
   The speedometer goes to 180. I did not go that fast. But the car
leaped ahead and then held its speed effortlessly when I did push
it. The 3.2-liter, DOHC, 24-valve V-6 never lagged, never
hesitated, never so much as complained. And the six-speed manual
shift is as nifty as I've enountered. Fast, smooth clicks up and
down the gears were simple. And with its high revs, shifting up and
down a lot in the NSX means you are driving it right.
</P>
<P>
   So you're wearing the car. You're driving it fast.
</P>
<P>
   How's it handle? Like it's on rails. Stiff, like a car of this
sort should be. It's got 4-wheel, aluminum, double-wishbone
suspension with gas-filled dampers and large antiroll bars front
and rear. Variable assist power steering and traction control (if
you want it) only add to the effect.
</P>
<P>
   It's got ABS for its four-wheel, ventilated disc brakes _ each
nearly a foot in diameter _ and they bring it down from high speeds
crisply and to sudden stops without a wobble.
</P>
<P>
   For the safety of driver and passenger, its got air bags, front
and rear crumple zones, and side-impact door beams.
</P>
<P>
   It sits very low, so getting in and out of the NSX can be an
adventure. But, hey, getting dressed in the morning can require
some contortions as well.
</P>
<P>
   And yes, what I had heard was true. It does, apparently, eat up
tires. A warning on the sales sticker says that the rear
high-performance tires may wear out in substantially less than
10,000 miles. But if you can afford almost $90,000 for a car,
what's a few extra tire purchases?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Nice Touches:
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --The soft, pleated leather sewn into the door panels where they
are scooped out for elbow room.
</P>
<P>
   --The air vents high in the armrests.
</P>
<P>
   --The paint is so rich and deep it looks like a pool you could
dive into.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Annoyances:
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --The pop-up headlights. They ruin the looks of the car when
they're up.
</P>
<P>
   --The lack of storage space inside: A wallet won't fit into the
center console, the glove compartment has been eaten up by the
airbag. The biggest available space is the ashtray built into the
dash. I'd do away with the ashtray and use even that little bit of
space for a storage compartment.
</P>
<P>
   --The $89 add-on cost for floor mats; $88,725 for a car, and
they want another $89 for floor mats. A joke, right? &QL; 
 &QL; 
THE NUMBERS &QL;

NO AUCTION SITE IS AN ISLAND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I have never bought or sold anything at the eBay Internet
auction site, but I'm beginning to like those guys.
</P>
<P>
   I've been terrified of eBay because I work at a newspaper. Web
sites that hand out free news still aren't much of a threat; given
the real cost of producing newspapers, we practically give away
information too. No, the real threat comes from Web services that
devour the advertising that makes up our chief source of income.
And eBay does just that. How would you rather sell your stamp
collection _ with a costly newspaper ad that reaches just a few
people in one city, or an eBay auction that reaches collectors
worldwide, with bidders driving the price higher and higher?
</P>
<P>
   The growing popularity of eBay is scary for newspapers, which
get a third or more of their revenues from classified ads. Never
mind the motherly visage of eBay chief executive Meg Whitman
surrounded by Beanie Babies. EBay is The Enemy.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe not. Perhaps I've misjudged the folks at eBay. Suddenly
it seems that they're not at all interested in gobbling up the
maximum amount of auction business. The eBayers are actually taking
steps to drive business away.
</P>
<P>
   The company has declared war on a number of Internet sites that
strike me as eBay's natural allies. You might call them auction
search engines. These sites let you punch in a particular item,
like ``Pedro Martinez baseball cards,'' and find hundreds of
ongoing auctions among dozens of Internet auction sites. A single
Web page displays the latest auctions on uBid, Yahoo Auctions,
Amazon.com and eBay.
</P>
<P>
   Well, maybe not eBay. It hates this idea, and is demanding that
auction search engines stop listing eBay auctions. According to
eBay, the constant hits from the search engines were slowing down
eBay's servers.
</P>
<P>
   The chief of one of the search engines says this is bunk, but he
has knuckled under anyway _ for now.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a technical issue,'' says James Carney of
Burlington-based Bidder's Edge Inc. Carney claims his system grabs
only a few bytes of data from each of eBay's 3 million auctions,
and does this gradually over the course of a day.
</P>
<P>
   So why did eBay demand to be removed from the Bidder's Edge
service? Carney thinks the company is terrified of competition. New
auction sites are rearing up all over the landscape and services
like Bidder's Edge put them all on an equal footing.
</P>
<P>
   So eBay issued a cease-and-desist demand to Bidder's Edge. And
Bidder's Edge, a start-up with little money to waste on lawyers,
meekly complied. But maybe not for long. ``We're not going to
guarantee we're going to stop forever,'' says Carney.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issues at stake here are larger than auctions,'' he warns,
noting that eBay's position is a threat to all kinds of Internet
search services. ``You've got all these people doing searching
without express approval'' _ Yahoo, Lycos, AltaVista and so forth.
``So all of a sudden somebody says no, and you stop?''
</P>
<P>
   AuctionWatch.com Inc. of San Bruno, Calif., operator of another
auction search engine, also got a shutdown demand from eBay but so
far has thumbed its nose at it. ``We believe that we are in
compliance with all applicable laws,'' says vice president of
marketing, Dan Neary. ``A library does not need to get the
permission of all the books in the library to index them.''
</P>
<P>
   Now he says eBay is threatening to program its computers to
block all search requests from AuctionWatch. If that happens,
there's little the company can do.
</P>
<P>
   I'd have loved to get eBay's view of the matter, but they didn't
return my calls. That's unusual for them, but perhaps this is part
of their new ``Fortress eBay'' policy. While rival auction firms
happily list their steals and deals on AuctionWatch and Bidder's
Edge, eBay sails on in sovereign isolation _ a recipe for corporate
stagnation on the Net.
</P>
<P>
   This Pat Buchanan-esque strategy may be good for their market
share in the short run, but as rival auctions catch on, eBay will
miss out on thousands of likely customers. We newspaper folk will
still have reason to fear on-line auctions. But by driving off the
search engines, eBay could make itself the least threatening
company in the business. Thanks, guys.

WIRELESS NETWORKING HAS ARRIVED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SIMSON L. GARFINKLE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you have more than one computer in your household, one of the
easiest ways you can increase the value of your investment is by
setting up a local area network. A network lets you share printers
and hard disks, so family members can print and access their files
without having to move around floppy disks. You can also use a
network to share an Internet connection. This is especially useful
if you have a high-speed cable modem or DSL connection, but it's
also useful if you have just one phone line and three people want
to read their mail at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   The easiest and cheapest way to set up a network is to buy a
pair of Ethernet cards ($20 each), a pair of cables ($10 each), and
a low-cost 4-port hub ($50 or so). For roughly $120, you'll have a
network capable of transmitting data at up to 100 megabits per
second. This works great if all of your computers are in the same
room, but if you want to connect computers across your house,
you'll soon find yourself tacking wires along your floorboards or
pulling them through the walls. This can be a lot of work, and if
you hire someone to do it the cost to network more than a few rooms
can reach $1,000 or more.
</P>
<P>
   Another way to network your computers is to dispense with the
cables and the hubs altogether and go wireless. Wireless network
cards have been available for years, but recently their price has
plunged. Low-cost cards now are available from several
manufacturers, including Apple, HomeFree, and ZoomAir. For this
column, I looked at the Acer WarpLink, which costs $200 to network
a pair of desktops, or $225 to network a desktop system and a
notebook computer.
</P>
<P>
   Wireless network cards work similar to high-speed Ethernet
cards, with some important differences. The first is obvious:
instead of sending information through a wire, they send it through
the air. As a result, you don't need a special hub to connect the
network. You also don't need to pull wires.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, wireless systems also have drawbacks. The first
is speed. Although $20 Ethernet cards run at 100 megabits per
second, the $100-$200 wireless cards only run at one, two, or 11
megabits per second. That's not a big difference if you are
browsing the Web, since you're limited by the speed of your
Internet connection, but it makes a big difference when you are
sharing files among your PCs.
</P>
<P>
   Another problem is range. Unless you use a special antenna, most
of these systems can only transmit between 500 and 1,000 feet
through open air _ and much less if you are trying to send a signal
through a wall or two. In my tests, I got decent connectivity
between wireless devices in the same room or on the same side of my
house, but signal quality degraded going from the front of my house
to the back. Sometimes it was good, but other times it was pretty
mediocre. Poor radio signals make the network slower. For example,
instead of having my Web pages snap into place over the cable
modem, they sometimes took three or five seconds to download over
the wireless link.
</P>
<P>
   But don't think that wireless is just for inside users. Using
the Acer cards I also was able to pick up the signal from my back
yard, from my street, and from nearly a block away. There's really
no way to know ahead of time what your reception will be like
unless you try it. You'll get better reception in the country than
in the city, and you'll see better results if your house or
apartment building is made of wood and not from brick or concrete.
</P>
<P>
   The fact I could pick up the signal outside the house raises
security concerns, of course. What prevents a neighbor from
eavesdropping on my data, or eve, accessing my wireless hard drive?
</P>
<P>
   When you set up a wireless network, you need to create a network
password that will be used by all of the computers in your wireless
``cloud.'' The password provides a good first level of security.
Unfortunately, no consumer system that I have seen backs up this
password with encryption. This means that it is possible for a
sophisticated attacker to build a radio that could sniff the
password as it travels on your network, then use it to gain access.
As far as I know, no wireless password sniffers have yet been
created, but it is only a matter of time.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to share an Internet connection, you'll also need
some sort of program on your computer that is connected to both the
Internet and your internal network. One of the most popular gateway
programs for the PC is WinGate. The Acer cards come with a program
called SyGate _ it has fewer features than WinGate, but it is still
completely usable. I tested an early-release version of SyGate that
still had some bugs _ it didn't automatically turn on the
Distributed Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) server, for example,
and it didn't forward Domain Name System queries _ but I was able
to work around the problems and it now performs fairly flawlessly.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, I think wireless networks are really neat. It's a
thrill to be able to take your laptop around the house or out on
the patio without having a tether. But it is important not to
underplay the security issues, which the industry is largely
ignoring. And it's important to realize that these wireless systems
are much slower than hard-wired Ethernet cards, while being nearly
twice as expensive.

KOREA MASSACRE STORY PRODUCED STRIFE AT THE AP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK JURKOWITZ  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The trail began with a small April 1998 Associated Press feature
from South Korea mentioning claims of a wartime massacre. It ended
Sept. 30, when a solidly documented AP investigation detailed how
in the early days of the Korean War, US servicemen slaughtered
perhaps hundreds of Korean civilians at a bridge in the hamlet of
No Gun Ri.
</P>
<P>
   News of a civilian massacre second only to the infamous 1968 My
Lai case exploded in the American media, generating headlines,
front page stories in papers like The New York Times and The
Washington Post, and a government investigation. Only a week old,
the story _ by AP staffers Sang-Hun Choe, Charles J. Hanley, Martha
Mendoza, and researcher Randy Herschaft _ is already creating a
Pulitzer Prize buzz inside the news industry.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the AP is deservedly basking in journalistic kudos. But
according to the former head of the investigative unit that
produced the story, the 17 months between April 1998 and last
week's release of the story represented a time of fierce turmoil
within the news organization.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Port, who left the AP in mid-June after his investigative
unit was disbanded, says that top AP executives were very reluctant
to give the go-ahead to the highly sensitive story, delayed its
publication for months, and put reporters through ``journalistic
hell'' before their work saw the light of day. AP officials say
they were just applying due diligence to a very difficult story.
</P>
<P>
   ``It became a question of what do we stand for,'' says Port.
``When the facts are put in front of you, you shouldn't run away
from it. . . . I'm sad that it was so difficult. I'm sad they
didn't want to do investigative reporting.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The piece took a long time to put together for obvious and
sensible reasons,'' responds AP managing editor Jonathan Wolman.
``It can be a cantankerous process and it can be an argumentative
process. But the commitment to the project was absolute.'' Asked
whether AP was reluctant to release the story he says: ``Reluctance
to put out a story before it was ready, sure.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether the AP was being timid or prudent, observers say the
dramatic story is atypical fare for an outfit more accustomed to
basic, nose-to-the-grindstone reportage and that it placed strains
on a conservative corporate culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``This story was not AP's cup of tea,'' says Kevin Noblet, AP's
deputy international editor, who is on leave as a visiting
professor at Ohio University. ``I think an organization more
accustomed to being out in front on such a big story could have
handled these concerns more quicky and smoothly than we did.
</P>
<P>
   ``It involved a lot of pain and a lot of bitter fighting,'' he
continues. ``But how can you be too prudent?''
</P>
<P>
   According to a time line recounted by Port, his investigative
unit began digging into the massacre story in the spring of 1998
and quickly began hitting pay dirt. Port says that ``we felt we had
the essence of it nailed down'' quickly and by July, the team had
produced an early rough draft.
</P>
<P>
   But despite what Port insists was solid reporting, he says the
top AP brass _ including executive editor William Ahearn and
president Louis Boccardi _ expressed grave and what he considered
unfounded reservations. The final months of 1998 were spent
``arguing'' over the story, he adds. ``There was a great skepticism
and fear that we were (getting) carried away. I did not see that.''
</P>
<P>
   When Boccardi met with Port early this year to discuss the
matter, the AP president ``said our story belonged in Rolling Stone
magazine,'' according to Port. Wolman, the AP official who
responded to questions about Boccardi and Ahearn, says, ``A lot of
frustration is going to set in when something is simmering on the
stove for this long,'' says Wolman. ``We felt like the end result
speaks for itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Reid Miller, a recently retired AP Seoul bureau chief, says, ``I
think AP management quite properly initially wanted to be damn
careful with this story.'' But he says he was ``surprised and
disturbed'' by the delay before publishing. ``I didn't feel that it
needed that long. All the essential details were there in July
1998.''
</P>
<P>
   Two crucial factors most likely influenced AP's internal
handling of the story. As evidence of this military massacre was
being amassed by its reporters, CNN's ill-fated Operation Tailwind
story _ alleging US use of illegal nerve gas during the Vietnam War
_ was blowing up in the network's face and proving to be a
cautionary tale. Significantly, retired Air Force major general
Perry Smith, who resigned as CNN's military adviser out of anger
with the Tailwind story, gives his blessing to No Gun Ri.
</P>
<P>
   ``My gut feeling was it most likely happened. Then I did some
research and talked to some people and I'm even more convinced that
it happened,'' says Smith, who spoke at Tufts University's Fletcher
School of Law and Diplomacy on Tuesday. ``This has the ring of
credibility to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there is AP's reputation as a rock-solid but cautious
organization that is not really comfortable with investigative
blockbusters. ``The culture of the AP is one where you tend to
follow, but not lead,' says investigative journalist Robert Parry,
who did some groundbreaking work on the Iran-contra scandal for AP
in the '80s. ``They also don't want
</P>
<P>
   to show up the clients. . . . There's a culture of journalistic
conservatism.''
</P>
<P>
   Wolman counters that at AP, the ``small `c' stands for careful
and we try to be that.''
</P>
<P>
   And, as he and others point out, the bottom line is that the AP
produced a powerful piece of journalism. Even Port acknowledges
that the wire service ``deserves credit for running that story.
They should have said it a little more strongly than they chose to.
But it got the job done.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The writers should be incredibly proud of putting up with all
our crap,'' adds Noblet. ``In the end, it was a triumph.''

RACEWAY PUTS CARS -- AND DRIVERS -- TO THE TEST 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROYAL FORD  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   POCONO, Pa. _ The cars are lined up in the pits at Pocono
Raceway, and on this early morning in September, it is hard not to
feel like a kid at Christmas, a kid opening that first slot race
car track and fighting with brothers and sisters over who gets
which car when we race.
</P>
<P>
   But these are real cars, queued up for the taking: Vipers and
Porsches and 'Vettes and souped-up Subarus (the surprise of the
test fleet) and Jaguars and trucks and vans and big American cars
with big horsepower under the hood.
</P>
<P>
   It is International Motor Press Association test day and we'll
be driving as many cars as we can slip into through a road course
that meanders over much of the expansive infield, forcing 90-degree
turns, hairpin turns, and lots of shifting; and for that pure rush
of adrenalin, we'll break onto the three-turn NASCAR track and rip
down the backstretch as fast as the cars will go and their brakes
will stop them for a snap turn back onto the road course at the end
of the straightaway.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the cars are better suited for the straight. Others for
the road course. Some for both. Some for neither.
</P>
<P>
   To find out which is which, grab one. And since we don't know
the course yet, we grab an Audi Quattro first, hoping for the
stability of all-wheel drive and a certain snap to the car as we
explore.
</P>
<P>
   The track officials launch you from a two-line staging area at
the end of the pits, cars going off at about 20-second intervals
(lengthened if, say, a Viper will be following a Miata off the
line).
</P>
<P>
   There are waiting lists to get into some cars: the Viper; the
Porsche Carrera 4; the new screamer, the Honda S2000, which
redlined at nine honkin' grand (we drove it down here on civilian
roads, and the car is a total blast).
</P>
<P>
   Other cars sit waiting as you roll in from each circuit of the
course. So many cars. Only one day to drive as many as
concentration and stamina allow.
</P>
<P>
   Some quick-test highlights:
</P>
<P>
   Audi Quattro _ Maybe it's because the course is new to me, but I
find the Audi spongy in the corners of the road course. Am I
jerking it through the turns, or is it really that soft? And, on
the straightaway its power is unimpressive.
</P>
<P>
   Plymouth Prowler _ Its look _ open cockpit, open front wheels
capped with fenders _ screams Hot Rod. But it's not. It doesn't
have the requisite muscle. It behaves more like a sports car.
Still, it is eye-catching.
</P>
<P>
   Lexus GS400 _ Smooth, powerful, a sports sedan with one
troubling characteristic: a strange delayed response when you get
on the gas pedal to accelerate.
</P>
<P>
   The Viper RT/10 _ Scary when you first get in to drive. Wants to
leap ahead. Even the burble of the motor sends a warning chill
through you as you sit in the staging area. How will all this power
do on the turns? Had to be very careful, owing as much to my
unfamiliarity with the car as to any traits of its own. How will it
do on the straightaway? Came out of the banked turn at an
effortless 89 miles per hour, drifted up to the wall of the
straightaway and hit 127 before it was time to start slowing
(again, unfamiliarity played a role here) for the snap turn that I
knew was coming. This can be a dangerous car in the wrong hands.
Ask the guy who drove it not long after me, came off the road
course, and got into the gas too much. He fishtailed, spun, and hit
the wall. The Viper? Totaled.
</P>
<P>
   Volkswagen VR6 GTI _ A sure-footed screamer. Ate up the road
course with its front wheels grabbing for purchase all the way.
Good but not remarkable acceleration out of the banked raceway turn
and down the straightaway.
</P>
<P>
   Jaguar XK8 _ Great looking. Plenty of power on the straight.
Unsettling on the road course as it seemed to unweight up front in
sharp corners.
</P>
<P>
   Oldsmobile Allero _ For a $17,000 car (cheap these days) a truly
surprising drive. Throaty sound. Quick on the corners and stable,
too. Steady surge down the straightaway.
</P>
<P>
   Pontiac GTX Ram Air _ Think 1970s muscle car. Alto gurgle from
the exhaust. Tops 100 on the straightaway with not much effort. On
the road course, it reminds you why so many muscle cars and pony
cars got wrecked over the years not on big highways but on local
roads with sharp curves.
</P>
<P>
   Chevrolet Corvette _ Fancy pewter-colored job. Lots of power.
Stiff on the corners and feeling like the back wants to break away
at any moment. Powerful down the straightaway. But what's that
Subaru doing screaming by me as I hug the wall?
</P>
<P>
   Mitsubishi Eclipse _ Careful, the Mitsubishi guy told me as I
climbed in, don't want to knock my competitors, but this car, when
you punch the gas, responds immediately. I found it disappointing.
At 205 horsepower this buggy shouldn't bog the way it does. I felt
I was in the way of other drivers out there.
</P>
<P>
   Ford Mustang _ Pony car power. Pony car speed. A squeal through
every corner of the road course.
</P>
<P>
   Buick Regal _ Supercharged. 260 horses. Powerful, fairly fast,
but one unsettling quirk. You can drive this as an automatic or
shift it yourself. I chose to do my own shifting. Scorching down
the straightaway, I slowed, downshifted, and tried to power through
the first turn, stomping the gas in second gear. The car shifted up
automatically, and what should have been a power-dig through the
turn became a soft, unsettling drift.
</P>
<P>
   Hyundai Tiburon _ The loneliest looking car in the pits. Sat
there unused most of the day. Inside, it's a knockoff of the Audi
TT's distinctive dimpled-chrome look. On the track, it was quick
and a better car than I expected.
</P>
<P>
   And finally, that Subaru 2.5 RS Imprezza all-wheel drive. Stiff
race suspension. Turbocharged. Racing seats so tight you had to be
surgically removed after a test drive. What a car. Screamed through
the road course, redlined most of the way. Second and third gear,
tops. Whipped out of the corner onto the big track and ran right up
to the wall, almost kissing it down the backstretch, eating up
pavement at well over 100 and snapping back onto the road course
without missing a beat.

HOOKED ON THE EASY DIAL 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEPHANIE SALTER  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ As one of America's most vociferous and
relentless critics of cellular phones, I must make a confession:
Last month, during a three-week working vacation in Italy, I used a
cell phone and it felt really, really good.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, I used it during a meal in a public restaurant, an act
for which I once suggested prison time.
</P>
<P>
   I ask not for mercy _ cell phone abuse remains a blight on
civilized society _ but I would at least like to explain what in
the world came over me.
</P>
<P>
   You see, I was sitting in the sun in a tiny trattoria that
fairly hangs from a cliff on the Isle of Capri. I was in my
swimming suit (this was the vacated part of the working vacation),
which was still wet with my first-ever dive into the Mediterranean
Sea.
</P>
<P>
   Although I'd been prepared for the beauty of the Mediterranean,
that dive and subsequent swim dazzled me. The water off Capri is a
spectacular blue on the surface, clear as a mountain spring once
you are in it, and so salty that one need only lie back and breathe
normally to float forever.
</P>
<P>
   If that were not enough, on this particular day a small band of
60-something, sun-bathing women sat upon the dark rocks that lie
just below the little restaurant and sang Neapolitan folk songs.
</P>
<P>
   Their four-part harmonies and spirited tunes conjured up images
of 20th Century Sirens, sent not to entice sailors to doom but to
delight a handful of folks who dined above or sunned on the
surrounding rocks.
</P>
<P>
   It turned out the women were a company of professional
entertainers, but it was their day off. Their music was free for
anyone in earshot to enjoy.
</P>
<P>
   The eatery I have mentioned actually looked more like a shack
than a restaurant and had a visible staff of one old man _ the
owner _ and an amiable young waitress. When my companion suggested
we lunch there, I assumed we would get cellophane-wrapped
sandwiches, bags of chips and _ if we were lucky _ a warm can of
beer.
</P>
<P>
   I had forgotten this was Italy. Out came the tablecloth and
napkins (cotton, not paper), the cold liter of crisp white wine,
the antipasto of grilled vegetables and prawns, the perfectly al
dente pasta with fresh tomatoes and basil, then the main course of
grilled and fried fresh fish.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere, during the second liter of wine, my friend picked up
the cell phone he'd bought in Italy for his work portion of the
working vacation and handed it to me.
</P>
<P>
   ``You ought to call your parents and say hi,'' he said. ``Just
dial 001 and the number.''
</P>
<P>
   I looked out at the blue sea and down at the singing Neapolitan
grandmas. I took another sip of wine and dialed.
</P>
<P>
   It was 7:30 a.m. in Indiana and my dad answered in a voice still
fuzzy with morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm calling you from a restaurant hanging over the
Mediterranean on the Isle of Capri,'' I said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're kidding,'' Dad said. ``You sound like you're across the
street.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he began singing the '40s song about the Isle of Capri.
</P>
<P>
   My mom got on the extension phone and listened as I tried to
describe everything I could see, taste and hear. I even held the
phone out toward the rocks so the singing ladies could register in
the Hoosier state.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just lying in bed thinking about you and wondering if
you were having a good time,'' Mom said.
</P>
<P>
   Then she burst into tears and said what a marvel modern life is
that we could share such a moment so many thousands of miles apart.
</P>
<P>
   After a few minutes more, we said ``I love you'' about 50 times
and finally hung up. I pushed the antenna of the little green phone
back into its hard little plastic body and held the whole thing in
my hand. It felt like a candy bar.
</P>
<P>
   ``What a miracle,'' I told my friend, as I handed him back his
phone. No wonder half the Western world is hooked.
</P>

ON SNOOPING, SLANG AND TALK ABOUT DEATH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA F. MELTZ  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I often read my daughter's diary as a way to keep in touch
with what she's thinking. She's 12. When I mentioned this to other
mothers with daughters the same age, some said they do the same
thing, but others were appalled. We'd like some guidance.
</P>
<P>
   A. Reading your daughter's diary definitely comes under the
category of snooping. In other words, a no-no. Despite that, there
may be times when snooping is necessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would never endorse a parent routinely reading a diary,''
says clinical psychologist Roni Cohen-Sandler of Weston, Conn.,
whose practice specializes in adolescent girls. For one thing, she
says, if you gain information you are morally obligated to act on_
that your daughter's best friend is being sexually abused, for
instance _ you help the friend but hurt your daughter by violating
her trust.
</P>
<P>
   Another problem is that the information you act on may not be
true. ``Girls this age are melodramatic, and their feelings change
rapidly,'' says Cohen-Sandler. ``What a girl writes is not
necessarily what she believes; she may just be trying on ideas.
Plus, what she writes one moment may not be what she feels the
next. You have no way of knowing that.''
</P>
<P>
   If, however, you are concerned about her safety _ you find drug
paraphernalia, smell alcohol, notice unusual behavior _ then the
diary is a valid source, she says. In fact, if you find the diary
in a public place in the house where your daughter knows you'll see
it, consider it her subconscious invitation for you to read it.
``At some level, she wants you to find out what's going on so you
can rescue her,'' says Cohen-Sandler.
</P>
<P>
   If you learn something worrisome, work it into a conversation:
``I'm wondering if you know any kids who steal liquor from their
parents . . . '' If she asks you if you've read the diary, don't
lie, but also don't get bogged down on that. ``Some mothers feel so
guilty, they're apologetic, and the discussion ends up focused on
Mom-how-could-you-do-this while the dangerous behavior, which is
the more important issue, gets sidetracked,'' says Cohen-Sandler.
She is a coauthor of `` `I'm Not Mad, I Just Hate You': A New
Understanding of Mother-Daughter Conflict'' (Viking).
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My question is about language: How do you know what's
appropriate and what's not? By this I mean slang, especially body
slang and expletives. There's ``butt'' and ``weiner'' that I hear
now. When I start to hear the f-word, which is a staple now and may
be deflated in its overuse, what can I do? My son is 6.
</P>
<P>
   A. As with so many things in our culture, there's been a lot of
slippage. Language once unimaginable in the mouth of a 6-year-old _
``That sucks'' comes to mind _ is now widely socially accepted.
That doesn't mean you have to accept it, however.
</P>
<P>
   ``As soon as you hear language you don't like, make it clear
this is not an acceptable word in your family,'' says Debra
Haffner, president of the Sexuality Information and Education
Council of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   That's doable, of course, only if you don't use the word.
</P>
<P>
   One of the reasons young children use slang and expletives is to
imitate what they hear in the culture from older kids and from us,
especially if they perceive it as more grown-up, like swearing when
they're angry. If you realize you're guilty, make a point of
saying, ``It's not a nice word, and I'm going to stop saying it
myself.'' Haffner suggests a fine box, where you drop a quarter
every time you say it.
</P>
<P>
   Children frequently use a word without knowing what it means.
Haffner's advice is threefold. ``Ask: `I'm wondering if you know
what it means'; clarify: `The f-word is a very ugly word for when
two married people make love'; and place your value around it:
`It's not a word parents or adults like to hear children use.' ''
</P>
<P>
   A pitfall to avoid is getting caught up in its meaning, for
instance, a discussion of intercourse. Stay focused instead on
values around language and public versus private behavior: ``This
is a word you can think in private in your head. It's not a word to
speak in public.'' If language gets out of hand, Haffner suggests
immediate consequences, such as removing TV or computer game
privileges for that day.
</P>
<P>
   You can legislate language at home but not with friends. Talk
about that, she says: `` `I know your friends use this word. I
can't control what you say with them, but I still don't like it,
and you'll get in trouble using it at home or with other adults.''
Haffner has written several books for parents, including ``From
Diapers to Dating: A Parent's Guide to Raising Sexually Healthy
Children'' (Newmarket).
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am the grandmother of a 2 1/2-year-old boy. Last week, my
father-in-law died. We went to my mother-in-law's, and within two
minutes, Joshua asked where his great-grandpa was, because he was
not sitting in the den where he always found him. Needless to say,
my daughter and I were floored that he made the connection between
the empty chair and his great-grandpa. My response was simply,
``He's not home.'' Can you suggest a book for Joshua?
</P>
<P>
   A. Children this age are very literal, taking our words at face
value. As a result, when someone dies, we inadvertently create
problems if we use euphemisms to soften the blow, says children's
grief specialist Maria Trozzi, director of the Good Grief Program
at Boston Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   Not only that, but when children have inaccurate or incomplete
information, they embellish it with their imagination. Joshua, for
instance, may think great-grandpa isn't home because he chose to
leave, and maybe he left because he's mad at someone in the family.
Because young children are so egocentric, he could easily make the
leap to this thought: ``I wonder what I did that he doesn't want to
come home anymore?''
</P>
<P>
   Trozzi recommends a simple but truthful explanation, even after
the fact: ``Great-grandpa isn't in his chair because he died. That
means his body has totally stopped working. Every single part of
his body has stopped. His body doesn't get hungry or thirsty, his
body doesn't have to go to the bathroom or get sleepy. When the
body dies, it doesn't come alive again. I'm glad we will always
have memories of great-grandpa.''
</P>
<P>
   If you believe in heaven, Trozzi suggests talking about it after
your concrete explanation. ``Otherwise, what does heaven mean? He
went to California, he went to heaven, what's the difference? He'll
still think he's coming back,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   She also tells parents not to say, ``He died because he was
sick.'' ``The next time he's sick, he'll worry he's going to die,
too. You need to distance this sickness from what happens every day
to children: `Great-grandpa was very very very very very sick,' ''
says Trozzi. She is the author of ``Talking with Children about
Loss'' (Perigee Paperback).
</P>
<P>
   A book the Good Grief Program recommends for young children is,
ironically, ``Daddy's Chair'' by Sandy Lanton (Kar-Ben, 1991),
about a young boy who won't let anyone sit in his father's chair
after the father dies.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My husband and I are trying to figure out a structure for
allowance. We have a son who just started second grade and
unfortunately is motivated by money.
</P>
<P>
   A. Take advantage of it! ``The younger children learn how to
manage money, the better,'' says Debra Sherwin. She is an associate
professor of economics and money management at Goucher College in
Baltimore and counsels parents on helping children handle money.
</P>
<P>
   Her advice is to start off slow and low: ``If you give too much,
undoing it feels like a punishment. But you can always increase.''
For a 7-year-old, she suggests $2.50 or $3 a week. The amount
depends on what peers get (better to be in the middle of the group
than on the high or low end); on your finances (even if you can
afford more, don't be out of proportion to what he can handle
developmentally); and on your expectations for his spending (if he
has to pay for lunch, $3 may not be enough).
</P>
<P>
   Problems occur when parents aren't clear about how money should
be spent and then get angry over foolish spending. ``Once it's his
money, you can't tell him how to spend it,'' says Sherwin. ``Your
chance to shape spending habits comes from negotiating in advance
what is and isn't appropriate spending.''
</P>
<P>
   She says a good question to start with is, ``What do you think
an allowance is for?'' Even a 7-year-old may have an agenda. ``What
if he wants to save for something big that you won't buy, like
Nintendo? If you don't know that up front, it's harder to deal
with.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a matter of family values whether allowance is tied to
chores, but Sherwin is against it: ``You do chores because you are
part of the family, not because we pay you. Also as part of this
family, you are entitled to an allowance.' ''

EPICURES FIND SAN FRANCISCO IRRESISTIBLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAVID ARMSTRONG  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ They'll drive more than 50 miles for foie gras.
They want a fine wine, not fries, with that. They don't necessarily
make more money than other people, but they spend more on food.
</P>
<P>
   They think San Francisco is an absolutely fabulous restaurant
town _ the nation's best, even better than runner-up New York.
</P>
<P>
   These are among the key findings in a new nationwide study of
epicures. The study was released Wednesday by the San Francisco
Convention &AMP; Visitors Bureau, which commissioned an Ohio research
firm to quiz 3,000 American adults about their eating and traveling
habits.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco has been recognized before for its fine
restaurants, notably by Conde Nast Traveler, Gourmet and other
magazines. But tourism officials say the new study is the most
broadly representative poll ever done.
</P>
<P>
   David Bratton, the bureau's vice president for research, said
the poll confirmed numerically what San Franciscans have long heard
anecdotally. The survey also helps restaurateurs get their arms
around trends. For example, microscopic portions and heavy foods
are currently out, while lighter, flavorful foods and vegetarian
dishes are in.
</P>
<P>
   ``This gives us a better sense of where to dig for tourists,''
Bratton said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to study and pursue foodies the way Las Vegas
studies and pursues gamblers,'' said Laurie Armstrong, the bureau's
vice president for public relations.
</P>
<P>
   A surprisingly high 38 percent of the randomly selected adults
identified themselves as epicures _ a person who enjoys food and
has a discriminating taste.
</P>
<P>
   The bureau, which promotes San Francisco worldwide as a business
and leisure destination, wanted to know more about the travel
habits of pleasure-loving, free-spending epicures, according to the
vice president for marketing, Brian Baker.
</P>
<P>
   Baker said epicures spend more per meal, are more likely to
order wine with their meals and are more likely to complain if they
feel something is off. They also put an especially high value on
professional service.
</P>
<P>
   Citing figures compiled from three-page questionnaires mailed
over the summer by National Family Opinion Inc. of Toledo, Baker
said that epicures took an average of 3.2 leisure trips in the past
year; that compares with 2.6 trips for non-epicures. Epicures also
took 1.7 business trips a year, compared with just 1.0 for others.
</P>
<P>
   As it is, the bureau actively touts the city's gastronomic
delights to travel agents, tour operators, conventioneers and
others wondering where to deposit their travel dollars.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco edged out New York in the survey, which the bureau
said was the first major national study of roadwise gourmets. Among
the respondents, 53.2 percent said San Francisco was a great
restaurant town, compared with 53.1 percent for New York. New
Orleans placed third, Chicago fourth and surging Las Vegas fifth.

RUSSIA'S CAUCASUS TACTICS: DIVIDE AND CONQUER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID FILIPOV  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Whether Russia's latest military push into the Caucasus
will succeed or fail may depend on which of two hardened Chechen
fighters who go by their tough-sounding nicknames _ ``Killer'' and
``The Executioner'' _ is right.
</P>
<P>
   ``Killer'' is one of a Chechen separatist militia that numbers
anywhere from 10,000 to 20,000, an experienced fighting force made
up of men who would rather die for an independent Chechnya than
live under Russian rule.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Executioner'' is also an experienced fighter, but he and
the 390 commandos he leads believe Chechnya's future lies with
Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Russia is trying to split the separatist Caucasus region into
pro-Moscow zone in the plains to the north, while establishing a
heavily fortified ``security zone'' that would surround the
rebel-controlled area in the mountainous south.
</P>
<P>
   Moscow's plan appears to involve resettling refugees from the
fighting into the northern zone, then showering them with the
benefits of Russian statehood they have gone without since Chechnya
won unrecognized independence when rebels forced federal troops out
of the region after a brutal 1994-1996 war.
</P>
<P>
   Under the plan, Moscow would reopen schools and hospitals, pay
pensions, create jobs and switch on the heat, light, and gas. And
the so-called ``Wahhabis,'' Islamic militants who have controlled
much of Chechnya for two years, would be kept out.
</P>
<P>
   As he sat on the roadside out of Chechnya's capital, Grozny,
last week, one of over 125,000 people who have fled the fighting,
The Executioner nodded approvingly at this plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chechens are tired of the Wahhabis,'' said The Executioner,
whose real name is Hadzhi. ``They are tired of war. Our only way is
with Russia.''
</P>
<P>
   Moscow is banking that most Chechens think that way. But a
recent three-day swing through Chechnya indicated most people agree
with Killer, born Aldi, when he says that ``Chechens will never
agree to live with Russia.''
</P>
<P>
   Killer's rationale is that Moscow's campaign against the
Chechens went too far during the last war. Then, too, the Russians
tried to set up a pro-Moscow Chechen government in Grozny while
launching raids against the separatists.
</P>
<P>
   But the improvements in life never came. Moscow sent a billion
dollars to the loyalist government to finance the reconstruction of
the city. Most of the money was siphoned away by greedy officials;
Grozny remains in ruins today.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's paramilitary police force behaved like an occupying
army. Incidents of drunkeness, pillaging, even murder, were
frequent. Rather than winning the hearts and minds of the Chechen
people, the Russian force earned the locals' hatred.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the end of the war, the Russians had turned nearly every
Chechen into a separatist militant,'' Killer said. ``We are a
nation of people who have already lived through the worst Russia
can do to us.''
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear what Russia will do better this time. But it is
evident that the army is repeating some of the tactics that helped
lose the last war. Moscow's policy toward Chechen civilians
includes branding them criminals by ethnicity and keeping them from
freely traveling or choosing their place of residence throughout
Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Moscow's tactic for ``protecting ordinary people in Chechnya
from the bandits,'' as Russia's top police official, Vladimir
Rushailo, called it Wednesday, includes surrounding Chechen
settlements with massive military force and pummeling them
indiscriminately. Many of the refugees fled after bombs began
killing civilians in their homes.
</P>
<P>
   Killer agrees that the Russians have the military might to drive
the lightly armed Chechen militia out of any village or town they
like. ``But they will lose a lot of men if we fight,'' he said
during a chat in a barracks outside Grozny last week. ``And when
the Russian troops are gone, we can always come back.''
</P>
<P>
   The Russian generals in charge of the latest Caucasus operation
_ in many cases the same people who lost the last conflict _ like
to talk about how they would have won the 1994-1996 war if the
politicians had let them. They forget that in mid-1995, when
Russian troops had occupied nearly all of Chechnya, the night still
belonged to the Chechen rebels.
</P>
<P>
   Russian troops truly controlled, as one Chechen commander put it
then, ``the ground they stand on.'' The Chechens were in bad shape,
but able to carry out destructive raids by night and hide in
villages and mountains during the day. The Russians would respond
by surrounding and shelling into submission villages where rebels
were believed to be hiding _ a tactic that killed few fighters but
worked against that hearts-and-minds campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The Executioner, who supports Russia's effort, thinks that if
the Russian army succeeds in setting up a dividing line at the
Terek River, about 10 miles north of Grozny, it will be able to
hold the ground.
</P>
<P>
   But Killer, sworn to fight Moscow, echoes the sentiment of the
separatists' elected leader, Aslan Maskhadov, when he says that
``we will give up no ground to the Russians.'' By that, the rebels
mean they will infiltrate and strike at the Russians, exacting
heavy casualties and turning Moscow's Chechen strategy into a
costly quagmire.
</P>
<P>
   One of the things that persuaded Russia to end the last war was
the Chechens' ability to launch daring raids on Russian territory
outside of Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   Military analysts say that as many as 50,000 troops are needed
to guard all of Chechnya's borders to prevent infiltration into
Russia. Moscow has probably sent that many to the border of
Chechnya. But with some of its troops involved in fighting Chechen
militia, the likelihood that some Chechens will get through is high
_ assuming they are not already in place, as the Chechen defense
minister, Mogamed Khambiyev, insisted in an interview in Grozny on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Another factor Moscow has to consider is the quality of its
troops. Russia has said it would rely on seasoned troops, not
recent draftees, who are not regarded as competent soldiers. There
are two problems with that: One is that Russia does not have that
many tested troops (and plans to increase military spending by $1
billion, announced Wednesday, will not immediately help). And the
other, as one former Russian security official said this week, is
that ``no commander wants to commit all his experienced troops and
be left with just young ones.'' The inexperienced draftees will be
used, and once again will face off against highly trained, highly
motivated killers like Killer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't wait,'' said Killer. The Executioner had nothing to
say to that.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the action in Chechnya has been a near total success
from the Kremlin's point of view. It has distracted public
attention away from the embarassing scandals involving money
laundering and corruption in President Boris N. Yeltsin's family
and Kremlin inner circle. It has all but extinguished calls for
Yeltsin to quit, and distracted attention from what appears to be
another health crisis for the Russian president, who has made
several hospital trips and been largely out of the public eye for
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The war has boosted Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, the bland
former KGB agent and Yeltsin's designated successor. Putin has
talked tough, looked competent, and pushed his popularity rating
from a miniscule percentage point to 7 percent, according to a
recent poll by the Public Opinion Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the Chechnya conflict has created what has become an
increasingly rare phenomenon in Yeltsin's Russia: the Kremlin's
political needs have coincided with the public's demands. People
want the government to put an end to ``Chechen terrorism,'' a mood
that formed after apartment bombs that killed nearly 300 were
attributed to ``Chechen terrorists.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But in a month _ as soon as a large amount of funerals for
Russians soldiers start _ it will be clear that this strategy is
not effective, his rating will go down and people's mood will
change,'' said Nikolai Petrov of the Carnegie Center in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Petrov and other analysts fear that Putin may use the worsening
situation for either of two scenarios: as an excuse a crackdown
throughout Russia, or to justify an even harsher campaign against
Chechens.
</P>
<P>
   Killer and The Executioner disagreed on most issues, but like
most Chechens, they agreed on two things.
</P>
<P>
   Both say that the Kremlin has provoked this conflict for the
first scenario; and both say that if Moscow chooses the second, as
The Executioner said, ``Of course we will unite and fight the
Russians to the death.''

 NOT A BAD LAPTOP, iBOOK ALSO IS A PEOPLE MAGNET  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MATT BEER  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ ``Can I touch it?''
</P>
<P>
   Not the usual sort of reaction you get when carrying around a
laptop computer, but that is pretty much the response I got with
the iBook, Apple Computer Inc.'s stylish new laptop.
</P>
<P>
   The iBook is Apple's final piece of a four-part strategy. As
Apple chief executive Steve Jobs has said over and over, the
computer maker has radically pared down its once-chaotic product
line to four basic categories of machines.
</P>
<P>
   The G3/G4 desktop boxes and the Powerbook laptops are muscle
machines intended for the publishing and graphics industry.
</P>
<P>
   For consumers, former bathroom sink designer Jonathon Ive and
his Apple team have created the iMac line. The iMac theme has been
an industry success story, with its able-bodied computers in
translucent candy-color plastic covers.
</P>
<P>
   The iMacs have been credited with bringing the Cupertino company
back from the brink.
</P>
<P>
   The new iBook completes Apple's latest marketing campaign. And
though it is no earth-shaking event like the iMac, the iBook does
succeed in some ways.
</P>
<P>
   There is nothing really outstanding about any one iBook spec.
There are plenty of PC laptops with oomph enough to keep up with
the iBook's 300 MHz PowerPC G3 chip. The machine's 12.5-inch screen
is a somewhat paltry portable landscape, considering the sprawling
14-inch displays of, say, the 14.1-inch, top-of-the-line IBM
Thinkpads.
</P>
<P>
   There are now plenty of machines, including the ultra slim
3.5-pound Sony VAIO notebooks, that easily beat the iBook's hefty
6.6 pounds. It's the same all the way down the list of technical
features: 3.2 GB hard drive, 24x CD-ROM drive, included 32MB SDRAM.
</P>
<P>
   Yet when gathered together and wrapped up in a blue or tangerine
rubberized skin, the iBook becomes one incredible machine.
</P>
<P>
   It is a collection of the little touches that make the iBook
almost a sensual object of desire.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, when you put the iBook to sleep, either by closing
the lid or picking that function from an on-screen powerbar, the
screen goes blank and a small greenish light pulses slowly, like a
resting heartbeat. The small socket where you plug in the power
cord is ringed in a glowing light. Red for recharging, green for
charged.
</P>
<P>
   The nearly clear-white plastic keyboard is soft to touch. The
power cord comes wrapped around a slick little flying-saucer-shaped
reel. There also is a strong plastic handle that folds out from the
iBook's hinge.
</P>
<P>
   In keeping with the iMac theme of an easy out of-the-box set-up,
the iBook comes fully charged. It includes an array of connections
on-board and ready to go, such as an Ethernet port for network
hookups (including DSL) and a USB port for adding a mouse or other
peripherals. It comes with a good array of software and a few
games.
</P>
<P>
   Some minor quibbles: The single speaker is teeny tiny, so don't
count on using this as a boom box. Speaking of which, the CD tray,
like those in the iMac, is pretty fragile, especially for a machine
intended for road work. The new iMac models, slated for this
Christmas, will sport a CD drive that is just a slot that you feed
disks into. The iBook could benefit from this improvement.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the trackpad is not my favorite way of moving a cursor
around the screen, though some prefer it. But the keyboard-mounted
button that substitutes for the button on the mouse takes more than
the usual effort to push down. Be prepared to build up some thumb
muscles.
</P>
<P>
   Another concern: The recent earthquake in Taiwan has disrupted
the production of computer processor chips, including those slated
for the iBook. Jobs said earlier this week that production has
resumed on the iBook. But expect some scarcity of iBooks in the
short term.
</P>
<P>
   With a retail price of $1,599, the iBook is not the cheapest
laptop. But as a complete package, you would be hard pressed to
find a cooler, more functional machine.
</P>
<P>
   Unless you don't like people feeling your iBook.

OFFICERS VOICE OPPOSITION TO PROSECUTOR IN UNION VOTE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JIM HERRON ZAMORA  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Nearly all of the San Francisco police officers
who chose a candidate in their union's endorsement poll this week
want to oust District Attorney Terence Hallinan and replace him
with former prosecutor Bill Fazio in the Nov. 2 election.
</P>
<P>
   Sources within the San Francisco Police Officers Association
said that out of 2,100 eligible members, 983 voted for Fazio, 18
voted for Hallinan, and one for Matt Gonzalez, a public defender
who is attacking the incumbent from the left. An undetermined
percentage of officers returned ballots that declined to endorse.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a staggering vote of no confidence in Hallinan,'' Fazio
said of the endorsement vote by the police union. ``I'm elated.
This may be the biggest thing for my campaign. It tells me that the
men and women who protect the streets of San Francisco have no
faith in the current district attorney.''
</P>
<P>
   Hallinan campaign manager Ross Mirkarimi said his boss was not
surprised by the endorsement since the police union backed Fazio in
1995. He also noted that most officers live outside the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``The POA vote does not reflect the vast majority of San
Francisco citizens,'' Mirkarimi said.
</P>
<P>
   Hallinan was not immediately available for comment, but before
the endorsement vote was announced he said, ``I have a great
working relationship with the Police Department and I expect that
to continue. I have nothing but respect for the police officers who
protect this city.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The rank and file have made it clear that they want Bill Fazio
to be the next district attorney,'' union president Chris Cunnie
said.
</P>
<P>
   Fazio, who worked as an assistant district attorney for 20 years
until he was fired in 1995 by Hallinan's predecessor, Arlo Smith,
noted that he has received support from a variety of groups who
work in the criminal justice system, including the deputy sheriffs'
union.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether it's cops on the street who arrest criminals,
attorneys who defend them or deputies who keep them in jail, they
all think I can do a better job,'' Fazio said.
</P>
<P>
   The endorsement of Fazio was widely expected. Four years ago,
the police union endorsed him by a vote of 90 percent, snubbing
Smith, the incumbent, and challenger Hallinan, who at the time was
a member of the Board of Supervisors.
</P>
<P>
   The union did not invite candidates to make their case to the
rank and file officers. Gonzalez and Steve Castleman, another
former prosecutor and a candidate for the job, said they wished
they had had the opportunity to address the police union.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm delighted to have received one vote,'' Gonzalez said.
``It's not surprising to me. Bill Fazio is taking the more
conservative position on issues. I wonder what would happen if you
took Fazio out of the equation and it was between me and Hallinan.
I'm the only candidate who is talking about the problem of police
brutality, so it doesn't surprise me not to be endorsed by them.''
</P>
<P>
   Officers have complained that Hallinan is too soft on drug
cases. They say that he should go for jail time instead of offering
probation or pretrial diversion programs for small-scale dealers.
</P>
<P>
   Police Sgt. Reno Rapagnani, a Hallinan supporter, said he was
not surprised at the endorsement vote. He said there is a natural
tension between street officers and prosecutors that can be
particularly frustrating in a liberal city such as San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our work product is making arrests,'' Rapagnani said. ``We
take a lot of pride in our arrests, and when we see that a case is
not prosecuted, it gets officers really angry. ... But in the
bigger picture, DAs have to look at other things. They simply
cannot prosecute every case. There isn't room in the courts. There
isn't room in the jails and the voters have made it clear they
don't want more jails.''

BERKELEY GETS $50M FOR MEDICAL RESEARCH PROJECT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ULYSSES TORASSA  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERKELEY, Calif. _ The University of California at Berkeley has
received $50 million, its largest gift ever, to help construct one
of two new buildings for a program to bring together physical and
biological scientists in pursuit of medical innovations.
</P>
<P>
   University officials announced the anonymous gift and the
school's new Health Sciences Initiative on Wednesday. Envisioned as
a $500 million program, the initiative will unite scientists from
fields such as mathematics, engineering, physics and computer
science to work on increasingly complex problems in biology and
medicine.
</P>
<P>
   UC-Berkeley is one of a handful of large universities that are
trying to bring the physical and biomedical sciences more closely
together. For instance, a Nobel-winning physicist at Stanford
University and one of its top biochemists are proposing a research
center that would house 50 faculty members. Similar ideas are being
pursued at Harvard, the University of Chicago and the University of
Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   The projects envisioned at Berkeley include designing artificial
tissues and joints, advancing computer imaging of the living brain,
figuring out better diagnostic tests and extracting useful
information from the mountain of data coming from sequencing the
human genome.
</P>
<P>
   Some cross-disciplinary collaborations are already under way,
such as joint programs on bioengineering with the University of
California at Francisco School of Medicine, and between UC-Berkeley
chemists and UC-San Francisco's pharmacology department.
</P>
<P>
   University officials expect more will follow as new technology
and understanding of molecular mechanisms in the body revolutionize
medicine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Increasingly, the truly breakthrough technologies that drive
better health are coming from fundamental sciences like physics,
chemistry and engineering,'' said Edward Penhoet, dean of the
School of Public Health at Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   Without a medical school to focus research, and tagged with a
highly regarded reputation in the physical sciences, Berkeley is
rarely thought of as a hotbed of medical research. But it has
strong programs in neuroscience and immunology, and scientists
there and at the nearby Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory are
playing leading roles in sequencing the human genome, or complete
set of chromosones.
</P>
<P>
   The ambitious program at Berkeley has already attracted $100
million in private donations and $24 million from the state. In
addition to the $50 million gift made this summer, $20 million has
come from William V. Power, co-founder of the insurance brokerage
company Power and Dalziel, to support the neuroscience portion of
the initiative.
</P>
<P>
   That program will be named after Helen Wills Moody, the late
tennis star and Berkeley alum, whose estate is donating $10
million. Another $10 million is from an anonymous source.
</P>
<P>
   On the engineering side, Intel Corp. co-founder Gordon Moore has
donated $10 million.

VIRTUAL REALITY   FLESHED OUT IN   CARTER'S NEW TV VISION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVID KRONKE 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Chris Carter's batting .500 to date. After making
paranoia sexy with ``The X-Files,'' he managed to drag the
convoluted, dreary ``Millennium'' through three seasons _ but not
up to the new millennium itself.
</P>
<P>
   His new series, the comic-book-inspired ``Harsh Realm,'' is more
a straightforward action series, with the requisite Y2K twist _ it
all takes place inside a virtual-reality game developed by the
military. Scott Bairstow stars as Tom Hobbes, an Army lieutenant
recruited _ just before he is about to leave the service and marry
his sweetheart, Sophie (Samantha Mathis) _ to enter the game, Harsh
Realm, and make the cyber-world once again safe for geeks.
</P>
<P>
   Seems the game has been hijacked by Omar Santiago (Terry
O'Quinn), a decorated soldier who has apparently gone mad, taken
over the world inside the game and brought it up to his own
fascistic standards. The many soldiers dispatched to within the
game's cyberscapes invariably give up and focus on their own
survival. Hobbes meets Mike Pinocchio (D.B. Sweeney), one of those
soldiers, and rekindles his passion for the mission, as well as the
mute Florence (Rachel Haywood): They believe Hobbes is ``The One''
who will restore peace within Harsh Realm.
</P>
<P>
   OK, so we have a computer game controlled by an enemy _ it
certainly seems a problem we need to worry about out here in the
real world, huh? And maybe whatever danger there is could be
averted by, oh, say, (ITAL)unplugging the game?(END ITAL) And, once
again _ this game is supposed to help stop terrorism in the real
world how?
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, Carter makes the show exciting, smart and edgy
enough that, for the time being, viewers should be willing to
suspend their disbelief over such matters and be intrigued enough
to see how this ordeal will play out. Carter should, however, also
eschew slow-motion action sequences _ they only underscore how
unlikely his characters' escapes truly are.
</P>
<P>
   He could also lay off the dopey, small-world plot twists _ a man
Hobbes saved in combat just (ITAL)happens(END ITAL), in the game,
to be allied with Santiago and married to Sophie. (The series'
opening sequence in 1994 Sarajevo is pointless and, really, not all
that interesting _ two lines of dialogue could filled us in on the
back-story, given how indifferently rendered these plot twists play
out).
</P>
<P>
   Since Carter's likely to be heavily invested in making what is
probably ``The X-Files' '' final season a memorable one, the
question is whether he'll have enough energy to likewise imbue
``Harsh Realm'' with a sense of focus and urgent melodrama. Its
premise is rife with potentially maddening narrative
inconsistencies, and the Hobbes-Sophie relationship could get
unduly mopey. But Carter has a feature film-quality cast, a talent
for making his shows belie their TV budgets and a way of absorbing
viewers into worlds a mere step removed from our own _ don't expect
that plug to be pulled on ``Harsh Realm'' any time too soon. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
The show: ``Harsh Realm.'' &QL; 
What: Chris Carter's new cyber-paranoid action-drama.  &QL; 
Who: Scott Bairstow, D.B. Sweeney, Terry O'Quinn, Samantha Mathis. &QL; 
Where: Fox  &QL; 
When: 9 tonight. &QL; 
Rating: 3 stars &QL;

GUARD CREW TO ATTEMPT SOUTH POLE RESCUE MISSION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LINDA TRISCHITTA  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SCHENECTADY, N.Y. _ A New York Air National Guard crew will try
to make an unprecedented landing at the South Pole next week,
braving extreme weather conditions to evacuate an ailing physician
who discovered a lump in her breast earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, two C-130 cargo planes operated by members of the
109th Airlift Wing began a five-day journey from the Schenectady
County Airport to a region of the world where current temperatures
are around 85 degrees below zero. Dr. Jerri Nielsen, a researcher
working at the National Science Foundation's Amundsen-Scott South
Pole Station, has been trapped by the extreme environment, unable
to obtain medical care other than treatment she could administer to
herself.
</P>
<P>
   Nielsen, 47, received worldwide attention in July when the U.S.
Air Force delivered medical supplies to her in a dramatic airdrop
made in darkness and severe cold. Nielsen is the lone physician to
the 41 employees of the research facility who discovered a hole in
the ozone layer.
</P>
<P>
   The National Guard planes are scheduled to arrive at
Christchurch, New Zealand, this weekend after making several stops.
</P>
<P>
   ``They could be at the South Pole on the fifth day (Sunday) if
they have good weather,'' said Maj. Bob Bullock, spokesman for the
109th Airlift Wing.
</P>
<P>
   The flight crews will wait at Christchurch, and at McMurdo
Station, located on an ice shelf on the southern coast of
Antarctica, until the mercury climbs to 58 degrees below zero
before they attempt a rendezvous that should last about half an
hour, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Bullock tried to downplay any risk with cautious optimism.
</P>
<P>
   ``Technically it's classified as a medical evacuation and we're
trying to underscore that there is almost a routine nature about
this,'' he said. ``But, we are doing this mission at a time of year
when the world does not have a lot of experience flying into the
South Pole. It's two weeks early, and without precedent.''

   No wonder so many people can't stand the national media, often
ranking ``journalist'' below ``sewage maintenance technician'' on
those lists of the most desirable occupations.
</P>
<P>
   So many big guns in the media seem to be completely out of touch
with mainstream America. They get so worked up over stuff the rest
of the country hardly cares about.
</P>
<P>
   Case in point: Jesse ``The Oddity'' Ventura, the
refrigerator-sized novelty act who continues to dazzle the New York
and Washington press corps, even as the rest of us are yawning and
thinking, ``Stone Cold Steve Austin has a better act than this
guy.''
</P>
<P>
   If you were watching any of the network morning talk shows on
the morning of Oct. 7, you could not avoid Ventura.
</P>
<P>
   On CBS's ``This Morning,'' they were showing footage of
Ventura's appearance the day before at Harvard University, where he
wowed the brainy kids with his forthright style and happily signed
copies of Playboy, which of course features the now-famous
interview in which he said organized religion is a ``crutch for
weak-minded people,'' defined gun control as being able to hit a
target twice from 25 meters, mocked overweight people, claimed John
F. Kennedy was assassinated by the military-industrial complex and
said he'd like to be reincarnated as a 38DD bra.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, the same stuff you'd hear if you were sitting in
a bar named McDrunky's with a couple of overserved guys wearing
construction boots and John Deere baseball caps.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the effete elite in the media are still in the
honeymoon phase with Ventura. Isn't he the cuddliest? What'll he
say next? I wonder if I can hire him out for my next holiday party.
</P>
<P>
   On NBC's ``Today,'' they showed highlights from Ventura's
appearance on a special edition of ``Hardball'' with Chris
Matthews. And then Matt Lauer interviewed Matthews about his
interview with Ventura.
</P>
<P>
   On ABC's ``Good Morning America,'' they played excerpts from a
Q-and-A session featuring George Stephanopoulos and Ventura.
</P>
<P>
   Just think, a few years ago that would have meant a Democratic
consultant was talking with a wrestler/actor. Now Georgey's a
journalist and Jesse's a governor.
</P>
<P>
   Progress? You decide.
</P>
<P>
   In the same manner in which NBC's Lauer queried his colleague
Matthews about the experience of questioning Ventura, ABC's Sawyer
asked fellow reporter Stephanopoulos about his experience with the
big bald blowhard.
</P>
<P>
   Talk about overkill. You would have thought these guys had
scored a one-on-one with the pope, rather than yet another in a
seemingly endless series of media splashes by the new poster boy
for the Reform Party.
</P>
<P>
   (By the way, members of the Reform Party are said to be furious
with Ventura about that Playboy interview because it hurts their
credibility. This from an organization founded by Ross Perot, who
is from Mars.)
</P>
<P>
   Stephanopoulous concluded his chat with Sawyer by giving her a
scooplet: That very night, Ventura planned to be dining with Donald
Trump, presumably to talk about which oafish vulgarian would best
represent the Reform Party in the presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd buy a ticket to that,'' said a giddy Sawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Sure you would. With those two guys, one could expect topics
like, ``Arena Football: A Good Idea?'', ``When It Comes to Rating
Broads, Are You a Chest Man or a Legs Man?'' and ``Think We've Ever
Slept With the Same Bimbo?''
</P>
<P>
   What fun for the media. And why spoil the party by pointing out
that in a recent Newsweek poll, a grand total of 2 percent said
they'd vote for Trump in a presidential race? (To be fair, in an
appearance on ``Dateline,'' Trump proudly pointed out that he did
win the consensus of National Enquirer readers in a recent poll. Go
Donald!)
</P>
<P>
   The current frenzy about potential ``celebrity candidates,'' of
course, doesn't just stop at Jesse the Oaf. It ranges from Warren
Beatty to Donald Trump to Oprah Winfrey _ whose name has been
bandied about as presidential timber even though the woman has
expressed less than zero interest in running for the job. (And why
would she? It'd be a demotion from her current reign as Queen of
the Country.)
</P>
<P>
   But, in fact, let's not mention that none of these would-be
candidates _ not Ventura, not Trump, not Beatty, not Winfrey, not
Cybill Shepard, not the cast of ``Three Kings,'' none of them _ has
a snowball's chance in Aruba of actually contending for national
office.
</P>
<P>
   Let's not admit that we know these fringe characters could never
get as much as 20 percent from the actual voting public. It's too
much fun gabbing and writing about them. We've got to fill space
somehow when the real contenders are three stiffs, and the blasted
election is still a full year away.

<TEXT>
<P>
   `LOVE &AMP; MONEY' &QL; 
``Love &AMP; Money'' has a premise that could've played at any point in
the history of television, which means it seems awfully musty in
1999: A young woman from a rich family who lives in the penthouse
of a tony New York residential building (Allison, played by Paget
Brewster) is in love with the working-class superintendent (Eamon,
played by Brian Van Holt).
</P>
<P>
   Tonight's pilot relies upon the hackneyed, artificial drama of
Eamon disrupting Allison's impending marriage to a man she doesn't
love; next week, Allison tries to get her family to share their
true feelings, with antiquated comic results.
</P>
<P>
   Van Holt and Brewster make for an appealing enough couple, but
they're surrounded by disapproving cartoon cutouts: David Ogden
Stiers as her stuffed-shirt stiff of a dad, Swoosie Kurtz as her
blowsy souse of a mom and Brian Doyle Murray as his dad, whose
philosophy seems to be, if something's worth saying, it's worth
barking out at top volume. John Livingston, as Allison's slacker
brother, gets what few funny lines the writers can muster; needless
to say, he doesn't turn up much. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The show: ``Love &AMP; Money.'' &QL; 
What: Sitcom about a wealthy young woman, her working-class
boyfriend and their disapproving families. &QL; 
Who: Brian Van Holt, Paget Brewster, Swoosie Kurtz, David Ogden
Stiers, Brian Doyle Murray. &QL; 
Where: CBS  &QL; 
When: 8:30 tonight. &QL; 
Rating: 3 stars &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
`THE CHRIS ROCK SHOW'
</P>
<P>
   Apologies to Dennis Miller and Bill Maher, but Chris Rock may be
the smartest comedian on TV these days. He's certainly the
funniest, as viewers of his HBO stand-up specials can readily
attest. And on ``The Chris Rock Show,'' he pokes, gently yet
insistently, at pernicious racial issues still tormenting America
(he went down South to suggest to supporters of the Confederate
flag that they replace the stars with faces of stars on the WB).
And he maintains a modest public face, repeatedly paying homage to
Richard Pryor and other comics who inspired him and, upon winning
an Emmy for writing last month, declaring that Conan O'Brien's
staff deserved the trophy.
</P>
<P>
   Where Miller and Maher make their points with joke-laced
harangues, Rock does so more tactfully, with inspired absurdist wit
_ gun violence was skewered with reports of an attacker entering a
building and hitting people upside the head.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike other talk-show hosts, he's not afraid to
thrust-and-parry with his interview subjects. Thus far this season,
Rock's asked Spike Lee why most black-themed films stink, told
basketball star Allan Iverson that his staff locked up its
valuables when they saw his entourage and observed to the Rev. Al
Sharpton that he actually seems sane compared to New York Mayor
Rudy Giuliani. Rock has gone from languishing during one of
``Saturday Night Live's'' routine lousy eras to making anything he
does worth investigating. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The show: ``The Chris Rock Show.'' &QL; 
What: Talk show starring the hot comic.  &QL; 
Where: HBO. &QL; 
When: 11:30 tonight. &QL; 
Rating: 3 1/2 stars &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
`SPACE GHOST COAST TO COAST'
</P>
<P>
   TV simply doesn't get much more dadaist than ``Space Ghost Coast
to Coast,'' a semi-animated and repurposed (and much more inspired
than David E. Kelley's ``Ally'') concoction returning for a fourth
season tonight on the Cartoon Network. Space Ghost, a former
Saturday-morning star-turned-self-satisfied hack, lords over his
talk-show realm with two of his embittered villains as lackeys _
Zorak on keyboards, Moltar in the control room.
</P>
<P>
   Space Ghost insults or, more frequently, ignores his guests
(this month's include Bob Costas, Steven Wright and Hanson) to
reflect, insipidly, on matters imbecilic. S.G. once asked a guest,
``If I hugged you, would you realize that I was simply being
European?'' Long, embarrassed pauses are part of the shtick. It's
as whacked-out as TV gets, but it's also very funny. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
The show: ``Space Ghost Coast to Coast'' &QL; 
What: Talk show starring the has-been cartoon hero.  &QL; 
Where: Cartoon Network. &QL; 
When: 11 tonight. &QL; 
Rating: 3 1/2 stars &QL;

HAPPY TO DO A TURN-AROUND ON STRATEGIC MISSILE SHIELD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CECIL JOHNSON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Whether the interceptor hits the missile or the missile hits the
interceptor, it's curtains for the missile.
</P>
<P>
   One can derive considerable comfort from the news that this
country has demonstrated the capability to cause such collisions in
the stratosphere at a time of increasing concern about nuclear
proliferation.
</P>
<P>
   It is, of course, a long way from the successful interception of
one Minuteman missile 140 miles above the Pacific to the deployment
of an operational anti-ballistic missile system.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, that singular achievement demonstrates
conclusively that the deployment of an effective anti-ballistic
missile shield is possible, if enough resources and national will
are directed toward that objective.
</P>
<P>
   There was a time when I would have argued that those resources
could be better used to lift Americans out of poverty, improve
education, protect the environment and rebuild the nation's
infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
   I'd still prefer having the huge expenditures that would be
required to develop and deploy such a system put to different
purposes. But there comes a time when national security, even
global security, must take precedence.
</P>
<P>
   This, some of my critics will note, represents a dramatic
turnaround for me on this issue. In the past I lambasted the ``Star
Wars'' initiative as unrealistic and misguided. And I was right at
the time.
</P>
<P>
   I correctly assessed Star Wars as the fantastical obsession of a
president with a too-strong attachment to the world of
make-believe.
</P>
<P>
   But the times have changed. So have the global challenges
confronting this nation. And so has the kind of nuclear peril that
glimmers on the horizon of the dawning new century.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Reagan wanted to build a shield to protect the country
from a nuclear attack from the Soviet Union, which possessed a
plethora of intercontinental ballistic missiles, most of which were
tipped with multiple nuclear warheads.
</P>
<P>
   The effort could have bankrupted the nation. Fortunately, the
Soviet Union collapsed and spared us the expense. It is well,
however, that the research continued on a reduced scale. Now, to
the chagrin of those of us who said it couldn't be done, verifiable
missile interception was achieved.
</P>
<P>
   And I say ``hallelujah'' as I wash the egg off my face. I
welcome this achievement, realizing that the nation faces the
growing peril of being subjected to a nuclear attack by a rogue
state that has attained that capacity by purchasing nuclear and
missile hardware and know-how from the Russians.
</P>
<P>
   Building on the successful intercept, it should be possible to
build a shield to protect against such an attack in time to
convince the leadership of any rogue state of the folly of such a
course.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, resources and imagination need to be focused
on establishing a more elaborate and sophisticated system to defend
against the growing threat of a nuclear missile attack from China,
which continues to improve and increase its nuclear missile
arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   Understandably, the Russians are upset about the possibility
that this country will deploy such a system. In their view, it
violates the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty. Perhaps it would,
if the Soviet Union, which signed on to that agreement, still
existed.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and Russia need to come to another
accommodation that takes into consideration the changed nature of
the current nuclear peril. Perhaps the Russians can be shown that
the greater threat to them comes from the East and not from the
West.
</P>
<P>
   With the Senate almost certain to reject the Nuclear Test Ban
Treaty, the need for a nuclear shield is intensified. That
irresponsible action will exacerbate nuclear proliferation and
severely undermine U.S. efforts to curb it.
</P>
<P>
   If the Senate does reject the treaty, how hypocritical this
nation will look in light of the stern admonitions and punitive
measures that it leveled against India and Pakistan because of
their recent nuclear tests.
</P>
<P>
   In a world bristling with nuclear weapons, the United States has
little choice but to try to protect itself from surprise attack.
</P>
<P>
   But we need somehow to that challenge without shortchanging
other priorities that are crucial to continued progress in
improving the quality of life and expanding opportunities for all
Americans.

YOUNG LIKELY TO SIT OUT GAME FOR 49ERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN CRUMPACKER  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA CLARA, Calif. _ Jeff Garcia will in all likelihood get his
second start for the San Francisco 49ers while Steve Young gives
his head a second week of rest from its Sept. 27 concussion.
</P>
<P>
   It is clear the 49ers are preparing Garcia to start the game in
the Trans World Dome. He got most of the practice time with the
first offense. As for Young, he's scheduled to see his neurologist,
Dr. Gary Steinberg of Stanford Medical Center, on Friday before the
team leaves for St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   It's hardly the stuff of intrigue. It simply makes sense to sit
Young for another week, especially since the game is on artificial
turf, which is to the head what a windshield is to a bug. The 49ers
want to avoid a big splat
</P>
<P>
   ``Jeff is getting most of the snaps to get ready in case he's
the starter,'' coach Steve Mariucci said. ``Steve is getting snaps
here and there. He will be ready to play. He feels better than he
did last week, but we're going to get Jeff ready.''
</P>
<P>
   While all backups theoretically have to be prepared to play,
there's more urgency with Garcia. This is an NFC West game against
a 3-0 Rams team eager to put an end to San Francisco's 17-game
winning streak against them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm approaching it as if I'll start,'' Garcia said. ``That's
the only approach I can take. I'm going to put my head into the
game plan, prepare hard and let everything fall into place. ... It
would be good to play two in a row. I'm here because I'm a
competitor. It's fun to be out there making plays.''
</P>
<P>
   Steinberg examined Young on Tuesday and saw nothing to indicate
a problem, but nevertheless he wants a return visit Friday to see
if the quarterback has improved from earlier in the week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to be ready to play,'' Young said. ``I want to make
sure I'm ready. I feel better. I just know we'll talk about the
process of healing. That's what I'm most interested in. I tell him
how I'm feeling, he'll say, `That sounds about right.' That's what
I'm looking for. It's all that post-concussion stuff, the
headaches, the sleepiness, the haziness.''
</P>
<P>
   Young said ``there's a certain severity'' to every concussion he
suffers and he is well aware that people are calling for him to
retire. However, ``I hope I'm the best judge, with the experiences
I've had.''
</P>
<P>
   Mariucci said he hoped to have a definitive answer about his
team's quarterback situation by Friday.
</P>
<P>
   And what of Young if he does play? Several scenarios could
unfold.
</P>
<P>
   Young could be active for the game as the No. 3 quarterback; he
could be inactive and in street clothes as the third quarterback;
or, with a roster spot available, the 49ers could sign another
quarterback, as they did Pat Barnes last week before releasing him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Steve has to go through the meeting on Friday,'' Mariucci
said. ``It's another evaluation. He's making progress every day. He
(Steinberg) feels he will be better Friday than he was early in the
week. He seems fine to me. Last week he seemed to be a little
tired. He seems to be livelier, more energetic.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether that's enough to be named the starting quarterback,
well, that's a secret.

RAIDERS FACE A HAPLESS DENVER TEAM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK FAINARU-WADA  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. _ They're throwing coins or batteries _ or
battery-powered coins? _ at their own players. They're being given
the bird by the backup quarterback. They're booing incessantly,
they're shredding their once-genius coach on all the call-in shows
and, for goodness sakes, they're leaving early.
</P>
<P>
   These things happen everywhere because, frankly, these are the
things fans do because, frankly, fans are nuts.
</P>
<P>
   Except in Denver, where they're not supposed to be nuts because,
frankly, they're supposed to be giddy over back-to-back Super Bowls
and, at the very least, understanding that you just don't replace
John Elway every day.
</P>
<P>
   But, a funny thing has happened in the land of Mile High.
</P>
<P>
   Funny strange, not funny ha-ha. The fans are revolting _
figuratively and literally.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been one of the very weirdest stories in Denver
sports history,'' said Sandy Clough, a popular radio personality
who has been on the scene for two decades.
</P>
<P>
   Simply, the Broncos are bad right now. And seemingly getting
worse as they head to Oakland for a Sunday meeting against the
Raiders that just doesn't feel right: Oakland looking formidable
and hopeful in the AFC West, Denver looking futile and hopeless.
</P>
<P>
   First, Elway retired. Then coach Mike ``The Mastermind``
Shanahan stirred things up with a preseason yanking of veteran
Bubby Brister in favor of 24-year-old Brian Griese, who threw all
of three passes during his rookie season last year; Brister
responded by ripping Shanahan in the news media. Then last week,
running back Terrell Davis, the man most responsible for finally
getting Elway a Super Bowl ring, was lost for the season with a
knee injury. And, finally, just Wednesday, Shanahan reversed field
and decided Brister should be his starting quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   Said Brister, hours after being named the new starter: ``Terrell
Davis is out, we're 0-4, we're at the Raiders this week. ... It
doesn't get much tougher than this.''
</P>
<P>
   Here's a thought: Maybe the Raiders are exactly what the Broncos
need right now. Maybe a little genuine hatred and bitterness,
wrapped in a tidy package of bile, are just what Shanahan and his
team need to begin to revive themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, maybe the Broncos can't even muster that much. In a
Sports Illustrated story this week, the ubiquitous anonymous player
on a team whose wheels are coming off was quoted saying that the
Broncos are finished for the season and they could wind up 0-8 by
the time they hit November.
</P>
<P>
   To which Shanahan responded, ``I don't know if someone said
that, but if someone feels like we're gonna be 0-8 or we're gonna
wind up 3-13, please let me know. I'll send you outta here so
quick, I don't care if it's a bus ticket or a plane ticket, just
let me know.''
</P>
<P>
   Things have changed in Denver, where eight months ago the town
was an extra mile high over its second consecutive Super Bowl win
and clinging to hopes that Elway would try for a three-peat.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Elway opted for the serenity of his 5-iron, and now
the Broncos are everybody's fodder. Really, 0-8 doesn't sound so
ludicrous when you consider the next four: At Oakland, home vs.
Green Bay, at New England, home vs. Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   As Raiders linebacker Richard Harvey said, ``They had a machine
for the last two years. Now they're just a team.''

HARDY VIBURNUMS ADAPT WELL TO REGION 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By KATHY HUBER 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ I moved to Humble, Texas, from Michigan two years ago.
I had beautiful, fragrant, 8-foot tall viburnums there. I bought a
viburnum here, but it does not bloom. Are these plants hardy here,
and where can I find the fragrant variety?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes, there are viburnums that work fine in our area. This
versatile group of deciduous and evergreen shrubs is underused in
our growing area. Heights vary, as do the leaf textures. Some have
fragrant blooms, and some have good fall color. Birds love the
berries. Some are excellent candidates for a hedge, while others
serve better as specimens.
</P>
<P>
   Viburnums adaptable to our area include:
</P>
<P>
   _ Walter's viburnum (V. obovatum), an evergreen/semievergreen
that matures to 10 or more feet, but it can be kept shorter. The
foliage is dense, small and dark green, contrasting nicely with
large clusters of small white blooms in spring. The birds are drawn
to the purple berries in fall. You'll like the maroon fall color.
Plant in sun or partial sun in a well-draining, organically
enriched soil. Good as a hedge or specimen.
</P>
<P>
   _ Rusty blackhaw (V. rufidulum) is a deciduous Texas native that
is excellent for this area. Mature height can reach 25 feet, or it
can be kept as a 10-foot shrub. The foliage is dark and glossy and
finely toothed, and turns red, orange, yellow and purple in fall.
The white flower clusters in spring are showy; the blue-purple
berries draw birds to the garden.
</P>
<P>
   _ Possumhaw (V. nudum) produces olive-green to dark-green,
glossy foliage that turns red in fall and drops in winter. The
spring flowers are white; the fruit is a bluish-black and
attractive to several species of birds. This native tolerates poor
drainage.
</P>
<P>
   _ Arrowwood (V. dentatum) is an upright, multibranched 10-foot
shrub with foliage that turns red, orange, yellow and/or purple in
fall. The small, whitish flowers appear in spring, followed by
bluish-black fruits that attract birds.
</P>
<P>
   _ Sweet viburnum (V. odoratissimum) is an evergreen that can
reach a height of about 10 feet. It prefers partial shade and
produces fragrant white flower clusters.
</P>
<P>
   _ Burkwood viburnum (V. x burkwoodi) is a deciduous 6-foot shrub
with pink buds that open to fragrant white flowers. Plant in sun or
partial shade. This one is linked to your favorite, V. carlesii,
supposedly the most fragrant viburnum, but unfortunately not one we
see here. Burkwood viburnum just squeezes into our growing area.
</P>
<P>
   _ Laurustinus (V. tinus) has leathery, dark-green foliage. New
stems are a wine-red; pink buds open to lightly fragrant white
flowers. Some say this is not as summer hardy as other viburnums.
</P>
<P>
   Ask your nurseryman to help you track down one or more of these
species.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is the scaly white stuff on my three hibiscus? There are
lots of flakes on the buds; some may fall off before opening. I
have used a pesticide to no avail and have clipped and destroyed
many of the infected buds. Many leaves on one have fallen off.
</P>
<P>
   A: I asked hibiscus experts Pat and Roz Merritt for their advice
on your problem. They think snow scale is the problem, as this pest
has been particularly bothersome this year. But we can't overlook
the possibility of mealy bugs. To determine which of the two is
bugging your plants, consider the following:
</P>
<P>
   Is the scale on the trunk and/or branches sometimes extending up
the stems and onto the leaves _ and on occasion to the buds? If so,
and it resembles powdered sugar or the stuff people spray on their
windows at Christmas for decoration, the pest is snow scale and can
be treated several ways, the Merritts say.
</P>
<P>
   The least toxic, they add, but most time-consuming, is a hard
stream of water actually blasting the insects off. This process
must be repeated until scale is eradicated.
</P>
<P>
   A mixture of equal parts of baby oil and rubbing alcohol,
applied with a toothbrush, is a good treatment, too. Scrub the
pests off, then hose the plant down after waiting 30 minutes. Keep
the plant out of the sun during treatment and at least until hosing
off. Leave the plant in shade much longer if possible. Applications
on cloudy days are ideal.
</P>
<P>
   The easiest treatment is the one the Merritts use _ a vegetable
cooking spray, applied with a light hand and at a spraying distance
of at least 12 inches from the affected area. Be careful. This,
too, must be sprayed in the shade, with the plant kept in the shade
until it can be washed off about 30 minutes after application.
</P>
<P>
   The cooking spray works like a dormant oil and smothers the
scales, but will also fry the plant if left in the sun. Don't kill
what's not there. Spray only where you see the scale.
</P>
<P>
   While snow scale is smooth, mealy bugs look like fuzzy cotton.
Mealy bugs appear on stems and buds and sometimes on succulent
stems. If the infestation is not too severe, dip a cotton swab in
rubbing alcohol and scrub the mealies off.
</P>
<P>
   Note on mushrooms: Gardeners with mushrooms in your lawns _
don't worry. These fungal growths are feeding on decomposing
organic matter, so I take that as a good sign. Organically enriched
soil is one component of a healthy garden.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, the mushrooms we find in our gardens are
mycorrhizal. These have a beneficial relationship with green
plants. One such mushroom is the ash bolete, which like many
boletes, are associated with specific trees. The ash bolete has a
gill-like pore structure and light-brown caps that darken with age.
The stalks are short and range from yellow to a deep brown.
</P>
<P>
   This bolete, like many, is edible. In fact, boletes are rated
tops among edible wild mushrooms. Do not eat any mushroom unless
identification is confirmed by a mushroom expert.
</P>
<P>
   Q: There are eight sagos growing on my property. I did not plant
the specimens, but I love their prehistoric look. Unfortunately,
the tips of all the plants but one are brown. They appear healthy
otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   A: Brown tips or margins are usually a sign of moisture stress.
These edges are farthest from the plant's roots, so they dry out
first and get water last.
</P>
<P>
   Either your sagos have gotten too dry (at least once), been
overfertilized, or there's some damage to a plant part that's
preventing water from reaching the tips. Hot winds can also burn
leaf tips.
</P>
<P>
   I might guess, however, that with the terrible long dry spells
we've experienced the past three years, your plants are reacting
accordingly. Just try to maintain good moisture.

   INGRES-FRENCH-ART (Undated) _ Before he was the great man of

was living in Italy. He hoped the drawings would lead to more
important commissions, and sometimes they did. He also drew friends
for pleasure, but generally he regarded portrait drawing of this
sort as a waste of time. The people who commissioned him often had
no idea who he was or what they had bought, and many of the
portraits disappeared or turned up years later in the hands of
families who didn't realize that they had inherited works of value.

HEARST-ARGYLE AND GEOCAST JOIN IN DIGITAL TV SERVICE FOR PCS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Hearst-Argyle Television, Inc. and Geocast Network
Systems, Inc., announced Thursday that they plan to deliver
over-the-air digital broadcasting to desktop computers in the 24
U.S. markets served by Hearst-Argyle.
</P>
<P>
   The marriage of digital TV with computers is a major step in
media convergence and means that PC users would be able to easily
download broadcast TV into their desktop computers.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, Hearst-Argyle, the second largest
independent station group owner in the United States, will allow
Geocast to use a portion of Hearst-Argyle television stations'
digital broadcast spectrum to deliver programming such as
personalized news clips, live video traffic reports, real-time
stock quotes and sports highlights, among others.
</P>
<P>
   Geocast is developing the hardware, software and network
infrastructure to deliver the service based on a ``black box''
device that includes an antenna and that connects directly to a PC.
This device will accept live feeds and will also contain hard drive
capacity to store programming for on-demand retrieval.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement is believed to be the first arrangement involving
a television broadcaster's expanded use of the digital broadcast
spectrum.
</P>
<P>
   Hearst-Argyle said it will invest ``up to $10 million'' for an
equity interest in Geocast, a privately held company based in Menlo
Park, Calif. Geocast was formed earlier this year with backing from
three venture capital firms, the Mayfield Fund, Kleiner Perkins
Caufield &AMP; Byers, and Institutional Venture Partners.
</P>
<P>
   Hearst-Argyle Television is a leader in the development of
advanced digital television (DTV) and high-definition digital
television (HDTV). The company's station KITV in Honolulu was the
first U.S. commercially licensed DTV station and Hearst-Argyle now
has four additional DTV stations currently on the air.
</P>
<P>
   All U.S. commercial television stations are required to be
DTV-ready by November 2002, with those serving the top 30 TV
markets to be upgraded by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``This marks the creation of a new, convergence-based business
for us,'' said Bob Marbut, chairman and co-chief executive officer
of Hearst-Argyle Television, who will join the Geocast board of
directors. He said the combination would open new revenue streams
for Hearst-Argyle, such as e-commerce, to supplement traditional
broadcast advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Geocast Chief Executive Officer Joe Horowitz said the
partnership enables Geocast to make programming with full-motion
video and CD-quality sound instantly available to PC users. The
Geocast device also allows the PC user to access the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Horowitz, who is a 20-year veteran venture
capitalist, Geocast's principals include Tom Paquin, vice president
of software development; Charles Jablonski, vice president of
network engineering and operations; John Abel, vice president of
business development; Anita Wallgren, vice president, business
affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Geocast's directors include Kleiner Perkins partner William
Randolph Hearst III, who is also a Hearst-Argyle director.

`HAPPY' CREW TALKS OF LOVE AND COMEDY 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By LOUIS B. PARKS 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO: A movie about a sleepy little Texas town could be one
of the sleeper comedy hits of the year.
</P>
<P>
   That's the bet Miramax Films made on ``Happy, Texas,'' which
opens this weekend. After this independent film with a cast of
top-flight character actors was shown at the Sundance Festival
early this year, Miramax snapped it up for national distribution.
The studio even paid for reshoots and new scenes the director
wanted.
</P>
<P>
   Judging from the rousing audience response the revised movie
received at the Toronto International Film Festival last month, the
gamble could pay off.
</P>
<P>
   Despite being shot for a bare-bones $1.7 million, the movie
stars William H. Macy (Fargo), Steve Zahn (Out of Sight), Jeremy
Northam (An Ideal Husband), Illeanna Douglas (Action) and Ally
Walker (Profiler). Needless to say, none of them got their usual
salaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``If `Happy, Texas' goes over the way I think it's going to,
it's money in my pocket at some point (because it will lead to
other things),'' said Macy, who read the script and asked the
thrilled filmmakers to let him be in the film. ``The only rule that
makes sense to me is, do the good stuff, and don't do the bad
stuff. If you do the good stuff, you make a fortune (down the
line).''
</P>
<P>
   Two small-time criminals escape from a Texas prison. They end up
in a small Panhandle town, mistaken for a gay couple that has been
hired to help the town's girls do well in an upcoming pageant.
</P>
<P>
   What is intended as a short-term charade turns into a longtime
commitment, complete with several romances, a bungled bank robbery,
a road trip to a gay dance hall, a Texas sheriff with a broken
heart and some affectionate humor about small-town life.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I hate about a lot of films is, we portray middle America
as being dumb, which this movie doesn't,'' Zahn said the day after
the Toronto screening. Zahn, one of Hollywood's hottest comedic
character actors (That Thing You Do, You've Got Mail) had come to
Toronto straight from his farm in New Jersey, where he'd been
cutting hay the day before.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody in Happy is pretty smart,'' said Zahn, who plays a
feisty little scrapper named Wayne Wayne Wayne Jr. ``They treat
these complete strangers who are supposedly a homosexual couple by
how they do their work. That's what small towns are kind of like.''
</P>
<P>
   That may be an over-idealized vision, but it plays well in
``Happy, Texas.'' First-time screenwriters and co-producers Ed
Stone and Mark Illsley (who also directed) were careful not to mock
the town natives.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to work in Plainview and Lubbock,'' Stone said. ``I
went to school in Plainview and Lubbock. I drove to Amarillo a lot,
and I'd drive though Happy (on Interstate 27, 40 miles south of
Amarillo). I just loved the town. A long time ago one of the grain
elevators was painted pink, so it became one of the landmarks in
the distance.''
</P>
<P>
   The filmmakers admitted they also picked the town because they
thought its name would sound great in the title. They wanted to
shoot the movie there, too, but that was not to be.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real town of Happy was great, just what I wanted,''
Illsley said on a recent visit to Houston. ``I took photos of it _
put the photos on the wall. Every time Ed would write he would
imagine the characters in those locations.''
</P>
<P>
   But budget restrictions forced them to stay in California, where
the town of Piru stood in for Happy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to be really careful with my money,'' said Illsley, who
has worked as a stuntman and as second-unit director on films such
as ``Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves'' and ``Rapa Nui.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Shooting in Happy would have added $100,000 to $150,000 to my
budget. I said I want to shoot there, but really, I would rather
have an extra day of shooting.''
</P>
<P>
   The movie was shot in 26 days, a short schedule for a feature
film.
</P>
<P>
   ``One day we did over 50 (camera) setups,'' Zahn said. ``That's
incredible. I was like, `What are we doing?'''
</P>
<P>
   Zahn's character has facial hair at the beginning of the movie
but not the end. He was always trying to remember in which scenes
he needed to put it on or take it off.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was like, `Mustache? No mustache?' Independent films are
crazy. Jeremy and I were literally on set doing each other's hair,
doing each other's makeup. `OK, get this scar.'''
</P>
<P>
   Zahn and Macy, who plays Chappy, the town sheriff, wanted to do
the film because they loved the script and the affection it had for
the characters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ed Stone loves all the characters in this movie,'' Macy said.
``He even loves the bad guys. I think that's the key to its
success. They are all so lovingly drawn. It kind of suckers you
into the film.
</P>
<P>
   ``Especially Chappy. I love this guy so much. I wept myself when
I saw it last night. It's a great feeling when your own scene makes
you weepy.''
</P>
<P>
   Macy had another reason for doing the movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm way sick of homophobia in the movies and on television,
and this was refreshingly void of that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, Illsley and Stone originally had problems getting
the movie financed and cast because no one would read the script.
They spent a frustrating year trying. Finally, they decided to just
lie, telling actors' agents it was already fully financed and they
were ready to start casting. Then the agents started reading the
script and showing it to their clients.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the script that sold the actors,'' Illsley said. ``We
did not make an offer to Bill Macy. The part was written for a
300-pound man. His people called and asked if we would consider
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Macy said, `I'll be in this little body, but when I walk in a
room, I'm going to be the biggest, fattest guy around.'''
</P>
<P>
   Zahn, who was just beginning to make an impact in films at the
time, sent the filmmakers an audition tape that his wife shot in
their kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   ``He started the tape by introducing himself and his three dogs,
and had a five-minute conversation about his dogs,'' Stone said.
``We said that's Wayne Wayne Wayne Jr. That's the guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Zahn had been auditioning for the other convict, Harry Sawyer, a
part that was eventually played by the tall, handsome and very
English Northam. But that was not how the writers envisioned that
part, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had looked at a lot of American actors, a lot of comics,''
Illsley said.
</P>
<P>
   The part called for Harry to have two romances, one intentional,
one sort of, well, accidental.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most important scene for that character is when he has to
break (another character's) heart,'' Illsley said. ``I needed an
actor that you could see the harder he was pushing to get rid of
(the lover), the more it was killing him. He's hating it.''
</P>
<P>
   They saw Northam romancing Gwyneth Paltrow in ``Emma'' and knew
he was the right guy.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; `` &LR; Jeremy was the bravest of the actors in our movie,'' Illsley
said. ``Bill Macy read the script and said, `I can do that part.'
Steve Zahn read the script and said, `I can do that part.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Jeremy Northam reads this script about two escaped convicts in
a small town in Texas in a comedy? e used to come up to us on the
set and go, `Now, why was it you guys wanted me in this?'''
</P>
<P>
   ``Happy, Texas'' is a good example of how small changes can have
a big impact on a movie. Though response to the film was generally
good at Sundance, Illsley and Stone felt it needed improvements
they just couldn't afford to make.
</P>
<P>
   ``In post-production we realized not everything worked as we
imagined it. We noticed one relationship, between Jeremy and Ally
Walker, wasn't working like the rest of the movie. It was very
somber.''
</P>
<P>
   The off-tone took the air out of the movie's high spirits.
</P>
<P>
   ``The scenes Jeremy and Ally shot before were great scenes, but
they didn't work with the movie,'' Zahn said. ``It was a tiny
fine-tuning, and it truly changes everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Stone and Illsley kept telling Miramax head guys Harvey and Bob
Weinstein that they should reshoot the scenes. To their delight,
the Weinsteins agreed. They reshot about 80 percent of the troubled
relationship, making it more buoyant. They also trimmed a long,
slapstick car chase at the end of the movie and finally reshot the
opening escape, making it faster and funnier.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to start the movie quickly, but we also wanted to
start it with a laugh as early as possible so you understood the
movie was a comedy,'' Illsley said.
</P>
<P>
   They had only one day to reshoot the opening _ Zahn had to fly
in overnight from another film set in Canada and do it with no
sleep _ so they tossed subtlety out the window and started with a
dead-armadillo sight gag and a knock-knock joke.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey,'' Stone said in shameless self-mockery, ``that's genius
writing.''

RAIDERS FACE A HAPLESS DENVER TEAM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK FAINARU-WADA  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. _ They're throwing coins or batteries _ or
battery-powered coins? _ at their own players. They're being given
the bird by the backup quarterback. They're booing incessantly,
they're shredding their once-genius coach on all the call-in shows
and, for goodness sakes, they're leaving early.
</P>
<P>
   These things happen everywhere because, frankly, these are the
things fans do because, frankly, fans are nuts.
</P>
<P>
   Except in Denver, where they're not supposed to be nuts because,
frankly, they're supposed to be giddy over back-to-back Super Bowls
and, at the very least, understanding that you just don't replace
John Elway every day.
</P>
<P>
   But, a funny thing has happened in the land of Mile High.
</P>
<P>
   Funny strange, not funny ha-ha. The fans are revolting _
figuratively and literally.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been one of the very weirdest stories in Denver
sports history,'' said Sandy Clough, a popular radio personality
who has been on the scene for two decades.
</P>
<P>
   Simply, the Broncos are bad right now. And seemingly getting
worse as they head to Oakland for a Sunday meeting against the
Raiders that just doesn't feel right: Oakland looking formidable
and hopeful in the AFC West, Denver looking futile and hopeless.
</P>
<P>
   First, Elway retired. Then coach Mike ``The Mastermind``
Shanahan stirred things up with a preseason yanking of veteran
Bubby Brister in favor of 24-year-old Brian Griese, who threw all
of three passes during his rookie season last year; Brister
responded by ripping Shanahan in the news media. Then last week,
running back Terrell Davis, the man most responsible for finally
getting Elway a Super Bowl ring, was lost for the season with a
knee injury. And, finally, just Wednesday, Shanahan reversed field
and decided Brister should be his starting quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   Said Brister, hours after being named the new starter: ``Terrell
Davis is out, we're 0-4, we're at the Raiders this week. ... It
doesn't get much tougher than this.''
</P>
<P>
   Here's a thought: Maybe the Raiders are exactly what the Broncos
need right now. Maybe a little genuine hatred and bitterness,
wrapped in a tidy package of bile, are just what Shanahan and his
team need to begin to revive themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, maybe the Broncos can't even muster that much. In a
Sports Illustrated story this week, the ubiquitous anonymous player
on a team whose wheels are coming off was quoted saying that the
Broncos are finished for the season and they could wind up 0-8 by
the time they hit November.
</P>
<P>
   To which Shanahan responded, ``I don't know if someone said
that, but if someone feels like we're gonna be 0-8 or we're gonna
wind up 3-13, please let me know. I'll send you outta here so
quick, I don't care if it's a bus ticket or a plane ticket, just
let me know.''
</P>
<P>
   Things have changed in Denver, where eight months ago the town
was an extra mile high over its second consecutive Super Bowl win
and clinging to hopes that Elway would try for a three-peat.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Elway opted for the serenity of his 5-iron, and now
the Broncos are everybody's fodder. Really, 0-8 doesn't sound so
ludicrous when you consider the next four: At Oakland, home vs.
Green Bay, at New England, home vs. Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   As Raiders linebacker Richard Harvey said, ``They had a machine
for the last two years. Now they're just a team.''

GARR WENT FAR, THANKS TO `FRANK' 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BRUCE WESTBROOK 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the mid-1970s, after a decade in show business, Teri Garr
hadn't gone far.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, she'd graduated from being a dancer in Elvis movies to
being an actress.
</P>
<P>
   But most of her gigs were guest spots on TV shows (``Batman,''
``Star Trek''), and she had only one line in ``Head,'' the Monkees
movie co-written by a friend from her acting class, Jack Nicholson.
</P>
<P>
   Then Garr joined a ``cattle call'' to play Inga, a scientist's
assistant in Mel Brooks' ``Young Frankenstein.''
</P>
<P>
   She won the part, the comedy was a smash, and her career finally
took off.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was my first big movie,'' Garr said. ``I can't say if I'd
have gotten (roles in) `Close Encounters' or `Tootsie' without it.
There are a million girls who come to Hollywood every day trying to
get into movies. I just finally got my chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Garr hadn't seen ``Young Frankenstein'' in years until she heard
it was getting a reissue on video. Then she caught it on cable with
her 5-year-old daughter and felt it ``still holds up. It's still
funny.''
</P>
<P>
   In stores this week, the video ($14.98 on VHS, $34.98 on DVD)
adds 17 minutes of unused scenes and five minutes of outtakes at
the end of the movie.
</P>
<P>
   In one such scene, Baron Frankenstein's will is read for eager
relatives. In another, his scientist grandson (Gene Wilder) meets a
street violinist playing a melody that affects him strangely.
</P>
<P>
   After he moves to his granddad's castle to carry on his work _
animating dead tissue _ Wilder is seen in new footage slyly wooing
Garr outside her door at night. Later they embrace as she asks _ as
if it's a sexy question _ ``How fast is the speed of light?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't even remember those scenes,'' Garr said. ``It's like a
dream. Is that me?''
</P>
<P>
   But she does recall favorite scenes, such as when Wilder enlists
her help in opening a trapdoor. (``Put _ the candle _ back!'')
</P>
<P>
   Wilder wrote the script, but Brooks improvised while directing
and got partial credit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mel did a great job,'' Garr said. ``But Gene deserves a lot of
credit. He kind of held back Mel's pie-in-the-face humor to do a
more witty story.''
</P>
<P>
   The biggest challenge was keeping a straight face.
</P>
<P>
   One outtake shows the cast breaking up as Madeline Kahn arrives
and Igor (Marty Feldman) bites her fur. Another shows the cast
traipsing down stairs in a curtain call.
</P>
<P>
   ``We laughed a lot,'' Garr said. ``Mel would have us doing all
this funny business, then expect us to work without laughing.
</P>
<P>
   ``He kept having to say, `Can we just do this scene? Will
everyone please stop laughing?' And that just made us laugh
harder.''
</P>
<P>
   For all its zany humor, Brooks gave ``Young Frankenstein'' a
strong feel for the original 1931 horror movie starring Boris
Karloff.
</P>
<P>
   On a Fox soundstage, Brooks reproduced the original castle sets,
complete with props. (Their designer had kept them for years in his
garage.) He also shot in black-and-white, a commercial no-no even
in '74.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Brooks didn't have to fight the studio to get
black-and-white, Garr said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'd just done `Blazing Saddles,' a big hit, and Mel pretty
much got what he wanted,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Fox playfully calls this the ``25 1/2 anniversary'' of ``Young
Frankenstein.'' Actually, it premiered at the end of 1974, making
this the 24 3/4 anniversary.
</P>
<P>
   Garr, 49, has been performing since she joined a dance company
at age 14.
</P>
<P>
   Other credits include ``Dumb &AMP; Dumber,'' ``Michael'' and ``Full
Moon in Blue Water.''
</P>
<P>
   She also co-starred with Hilary Duff in ``Casper Meets Wendy'';
appeared in this year's Watergate comedy, ``Dick''; and provides a
computer's voice for the upcoming sci-fi film ``Supernova.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's about it for now _ just being a parent keeps me busy,''
said Garr, who is divorced. ``I'm one of those people who had a
career first and then decided to have children.''
</P>
<P>
   She often sees Brooks, who's a neighbor, and sometimes runs into
fellow cast members Peter Boyle or Cloris Leachman (Frau Bluecher).
But Garr hasn't seen Wilder in years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got along fine, though,'' she said. ``We had fun. We
laughed so hard making that movie that we almost couldn't do the
scenes.''
</P>

`THE THIRTEENTH FLOOR' &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; 1999, R, Columbia TriStar, CC, VHS priced for rental, DVD priced
for sales &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Douglas Hall has a problem.
</P>
<P>
   His boss, who created a computer-reality existence set in 1937
Los Angeles, has been murdered, and it looks like Doug did it.
Seeking answers, he explores the cyberworld like a computer-geek
gumshoe.
</P>
<P>
   But ``The Thirteenth Floor'' also has a problem: It's dull.
</P>
<P>
   As Douglas, Craig Bierko has all the charisma of a flat tire,
and the flimsy plot is stretched over a premise that lacks much
meaning or even cheap thrills.
</P>
<P>
   Like ``Dark City,'' ``The Thirteenth Floor'' fashions a handsome
otherworld, and Vincent D'Onofrio is reliably sinister as a '30s
bad guy.
</P>
<P>
   But Gretchen Mol is wasted in a love-interest part, and none of
the equation adds up to much. Try ``The Matrix'' for better
cyberthrills, or ``The Maltese Falcon'' for a better noirish
mystery.
</P>
<P>
   Rating: 1 1/2 stars.

   NY-MOMA-MILLENIUM (New York) _ The Museum of Modern Art has
launched its contribution to the millenium furor: a 17-month series
of exhibitions under the umbrella title ``MOMA 2000.'' In addition
to being a summing up of this venerable institution's past, it is
also a rehearsal for its future. By Holland Cotter.

<P>
   CLEMENTE-GUGGENHEIM (New York) _ Francesco Clemente is the
youngest artist to be given the full-rotunda treatment by the
Guggenheim Museum. In recent years, Claes Oldenburg, Ellsworth
Kelly and Robert Rauschenberg have filled the place to overflowing
and, in particular have imprinted the rotunda with an indelible
sense of their different styles. Now Clemente, the Italian painter
of East-meets-West dream images that delve into the mind, the body
and many forms of love, is taking his turn. By Roberta Smith.
</P>
<P>
   INGRES-FRENCH-ART (Undated) _ Before he was the great man of
French art, Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres drew pencil portraits to
make money. They were souvenirs on letter-size sheets of paper. He
was living in Italy. He hoped the drawings would lead to more
important commissions, and sometimes they did. He also drew friends
for pleasure, but generally he regarded portrait drawing of this
sort as a waste of time. The people who commissioned him often had
no idea who he was or what they had bought, and many of the
portraits disappeared or turned up years later in the hands of
families who didn't realize that they had inherited works of value.

PLASTIC SURGEON SAYS CASE HAS RUINED HIS PRACTICE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ELIZABETH FERNANDEZ  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. _ Following the post-op death of a patient, the
once flourishing practice of prominent San Francisco plastic
surgeon John Emery has dwindled to the point where he now wants to
close his clinic, which pioneered outpatient cosmetic surgery in
Northern California, and become what he calls a ``country doctor.''
</P>
<P>
   In a disciplinary hearing this week to determine his
professional future, Emery testified that he was devastated
professionally, personally and financially by the baffling death of
Myra Ruskin, who died overnight in Emery's clinic after face-lift
surgery in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Her death was caused by a massive overdose of Demerol, the
medical examiner ruled, but authorities could not establish how she
got the lethal dose or who administered it.
</P>
<P>
   Emery testified that he feels no responsibility for Ruskin's
death.
</P>
<P>
   The physician, who has practiced in San Francisco for more than
three decades, testified that fellow doctors had stopped referring
patients to him and that patients had stopped seeking his care. So
far this year, he said, he has operated on only 11 patients.
</P>
<P>
   ``My wife and I were very high profile in the community,''
Emery, 67, said. ``It's been very difficult for us to adjust to the
social discrimination.''
</P>
<P>
   Once society fixtures and charity fund-raisers, Emery and his
wife, Deborah, a former beauty queen, are now undergoing the
indignity of being in ``extensive debt'' of hundreds of thousands
of dollars, Emery said. His malpractice carrier has a $300,000
claim against him, he said, and he owes $24,609 in back rent for
his clinic.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been an incredible experience to see how society that
once loved you abandons you,'' said Emery, who voiced pride in his
years of community service. ``We've lost our friends, our social
contacts, respect in the community both in San Francisco and in
Marin County. ... I've lost a lot of my dignity.''
</P>
<P>
   In its case against the physician, the Medical Board of
California says Emery's care of Ruskin, ``constituted repeated acts
of negligence.''
</P>
<P>
   Ruskin, a licensed family therapist, sought the $21,900 face
lift for her 57th birthday. Her four-hour surgery seemed
uneventful, but Ruskin died during the night as the medical
assistant slept in a bed next to her. Ruskin had paid extra for the
overnight stay.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Emery settled a civil lawsuit filed by
Ruskin's family. The terms of the settlement are confidential.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy attorney general Lawrence Mercer said Emery violated
regulations concerning the use of medical assistants. During the
hearing, the assistant testified that she used her discretion,
based on ``standing orders,'' to give Ruskin a 75 milligram
injection of Demerol. The assistant said she could give between 50
and 100 mg of the painkiller depending on her assessment of a
patient's discomfort. Emery was not at the clinic when she gave the
injection, she testified.
</P>
<P>
   Emery also violated accreditation rules, standard of care
regulations and medical record-keeping statutes, Mercer charged.
</P>
<P>
   ``The public is concerned that plastic surgery is not safe, that
plastic surgery clinics are not safe,'' Mercer told the court.
</P>
<P>
   During the hearing, Emery agreed not to challenge two of the
state's three accusations: that he committed gross negligence in
his care of Ruskin, and that he aided and abetted in the unlicensed
practice of medicine by allowing an unlicensed medical assistant to
serve as overnight caretaker for Ruskin.
</P>
<P>
   But he said he had mitigating evidence, presenting other doctors
who touted Emery's surgical skills and testified they too were
unaware of regulations requiring the presence of a physician when
medical assistants give injections.
</P>
<P>
   They also bolstered Emery's argument that medication logs were
not exempt of ``human error.''
</P>
<P>
   ``As surgeons, we believe we are God, but we are frequently
proven not to be,'' said Dr. Charles Allen Wall, a cardiovascular
surgeon who practices in Emery's medical building.
</P>
<P>
   He attributed discrepancies in his drug records, and missing
records, to clerical errors.

THE ORIGINAL FUNK SOUL BROTHER 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOEY GUERRA 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   James Brown is a man with a lot on his mind.
</P>
<P>
   During the course of a roughly 20-minute interview, he offers
often-unprovoked musings on education (``We gotta give those
teachers a pat on the back''); the Vietnam War (``We're all people
that got a stake in America, and we love it, and we fight for
it''); and how today's performers should go to music school before
thinking about making records.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the 66-year-old Godfather of Soul is also ready to
offer plenty of thoughts on his own music, even before the first
question is asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Papa's got a brand new bag! It's a man's world!'' he exclaims,
calling from his offices in Augusta, Ga. ``You know `Try Me' was
voted the No. 1 love song of all time? That's a great honor. I love
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Uh, OK. So Brown is a decidedly happy camper, and why not? He
has plenty of reasons to be: Soul Brother No. 1 is among pop
music's undisputed great influences, one of the most important
musicians in the rock era.
</P>
<P>
   With his stamina and impeccable timing on display in front of an
audience, Brown's live shows are known to sizzle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I enjoy (performing) because God has been good to me and the
people have been good to me. I still get excited 'cause I'm human
and the good Lord keeps me human,'' Brown said. ``The countries and
the cities need me to perform because it puts you in an `up' mode.
I perform because it's a need. Financially, I don't have to work,
but all the input I can give to this country, I'm gonna give it.''
</P>
<P>
   Such patriotism! Such pride! Guess Brown really meant every word
when he sang the 1986 Top 10 hit ``Living in America.''
</P>
<P>
   It hasn't always been an easy road, however. Brown's career has
been marked by legal and personal troubles since the mid-'70s.
There have been problems with the IRS, a prison sentence in the
late '80s for illegal possession of drugs and firearms, and
hospitalization in 1998 for an addiction to pain-killers.
</P>
<P>
   But Brown doesn't want to talk about all that. He'd rather
reminisce about his early days in Houston, when he played such
venues as the Coliseum, Rockefeller's, the Continental Ballroom, El
Dorado Ballroom and Jones Hall.
</P>
<P>
   ``I go waaaay back when nothin' was built in Houston,'' Brown
said. ``I used to live in the Third Ward and all those places.
Houston's always been one of my pet places. I always wanna say
thanks to people in Texas for lookin' out for me and helpin' me
through those rough years.''
</P>
<P>
   The rough years included a time before hits such as ``Good Good
Lovin','' ``I'll Go Crazy,'' ``Think,'' ``Night Train'' and ``I Got
You'' (I Feel Good), when Brown worked as a janitor at a school in
Georgia. It was then when he recorded his first hit, ``Please,
Please, Please.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A janitor,'' Brown said with disbelief. ``What could ya do
with a seventh-grade education? Nothing. Every mornin' at 8 o'clock
... I'd play for the kids before they got to school. When I got a
decent meal and got my rent paid, that way I could buy a car, I
knew (music) was the thing for me. I thank God for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Since music became the thing for him, Brown has influenced
countless artists over the decades, many of whom sampled Brown's
hooks and drew on his sounds for their own music. Brown insists
that he doesn't mind, even if he doesn't always get credited for
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I really took over with `Papa's Bag' in 1965, from that
time on it's been all James Brown. Ninety-five percent of the music
_ country, gospel, everything _ is using my licks,'' Brown said.
``That changed all the music around.
</P>
<P>
   ``You got that James Brown lick in almost everything you do. I
don't care whether they like me or not. If I was a greedy man, I
would throw a patent on anything from '65 on and collect zillions
of dollars. But I don't want that. I don't need it. I'm fine with
it.''
</P>
<P>
   One thing that does bother Brown is the overall state of today's
music. In the gospel according to Brown, America's sound lags far
behind the music coming from England, Germany and Japan, where he
can still pack in arena-size crowds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm familiar with all the artists (today), but I tell ya, I'm
not gonna talk about anybody, bein' the Godfather,'' Brown said.
``We're gonna bring back records that make sense. Stop the cursin'
and degrading the ladies. They (today's musicians) need some
hands-on training, and they ain't got that. They take one note and
make a whole song. You can't do that. They really don't know
anything about music _ can't play and dealin' with these
synthesizers. They need to go to music school.''
</P>
<P>
   From here, the inevitable (at least in Brown's mind) segue into
education comes into focus. Academics first, then music, then
sports.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to put music back in the school 'cause music is not a
way of life but the way of life right now,'' Brown said. ``It
should be the first thing to give you a second shot at life. I tell
no kid to quit school and go to music, but I tell 'em to take music
in school 'cause you got 'em like a sponge at that point.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown, it seems, has soaked up plenty himself. But alas, the
time has come to say good-bye. As expected, he offers a last-minute
parting thought:
</P>
<P>
   ``May I close out by sayin',`God Bless America'?''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, you may.

 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
Runs with CREAMPUFF-RECIPES  
By NATALIE HAUGHTON  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ When I grew up, many a mom or cook knew how to
make cream puffs _ those mysteriously billowy, golden, airy flights
of fancy that so fascinated children and guests alike. The recipe
was a dessert and appetizer staple, especially when entertaining.
The larger cream puffs could be filled with assorted ice creams or
custards or vanilla, chocolate or coffee pastry creams and drizzled
generously with hot fudge sauce. The smaller, miniature sizes were
stuffed with crab or curried chicken salad for parties, weddings
and teas or with ice cream to make the classic French dessert,
profiteroles.
</P>
<P>
   At our house, one of my mother's signature dessert offerings for
company was one large puff split and filled with pink peppermint
stick ice cream, then topped with homemade hot fudge sauce (a
must!). Guests found them heavenly _ and so did I. Desserts didn't
get much better in those days.  &QL; 
Cream puffs are made from a soft-batter pastry dough known as choux
pastry or pate a choux, which translates from the French as cabbage
pastry because the appearance of the finished product bears a vague
resemblance to a miniature cabbage. Besides simple cream puffs and
eclairs, the dough is the foundation of lavish structures like the
towering tree-shaped croquembouche held together with carmelized
sugar, the crownlike dessert gateau Saint-Honore or the
Paris-Brest, a cream filled cream-puff pastry ring. And whimsical
choux paste swans filled with sweetened whipped cream were all the
rage at parties in the late '70s and early '80s.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow over the years, cream puffs have disappeared from the
home cooks' repertoire. But the classic pastry is worth
resurrecting or giving another look. Not only is it one of the
easiest doughs to make, but it can be prepared in just a few
minutes. ``It's the most versatile of French pastry doughs,'' wrote
Richard Grausman in his cookbook, ``At Home With the French
Classics,'' (Workman Publishing), and ``it can be baked in a
multitude of forms.''
</P>
<P>
   The pastry goes together in a jiffy on the stove-top. Just add
flour to boiling water and butter and cook the mixture until a
thick paste or ball is formed. In most recipes, the eggs are then
beaten in one at a time, until smooth, but in the more recent
editions of the Betty Crocker cookbooks, they're added all at once
_ as you'll notice in the recipe included today. I've had success
both ways, but prefer adding the eggs all at once. Use a heavy
wooden spoon to blend smooth.
</P>
<P>
   Baking directions also vary in recipes. Some recommend baking
the dough in mounds at a constant temperature throughout. Others
start baking in a hot oven, then reduce the oven temperature to
finish. Also to dry out the insides, some recipes direct cooks to
remove the puffs from the oven and cut a slit in the sides with a
sharp knife, and then return them to a turned-off oven with the
door ajar for 10 minutes. Others simply remove the puffs to racks
to cool. Experiment and suit yourself.
</P>
<P>
   But how does this dough seem to puff up almost magically? ``The
dough is leavened by steam, which expands the product rapidly and
forms large holes in the center of the item (puff),'' noted Wayne
Gisslen, in ``Professional Baking, Second Edition'' (John Wiley &AMP;
Sons). ``The heat of the oven then coagulates the gluten and egg
proteins to set the structure and make a firm product.''
</P>
<P>
   Once cooled, cut the tops off the cream puffs and fill as
desired _ or make a hole in the side and use a pastry bag and tip
to pipe in the filling.
</P>
<P>
   You can still find cream puffs at selected bakeries and
restaurants in an array of forms and sizes and with various
fillings.
</P>
<P>
   When diners are presented with the dessert selections at Chaya
Brasserie in Los Angeles, Le Petit Bistro in Sherman Oaks, La
Cachette in Century City and Bouchon in Los Angeles, they'll find
profiteroles among the choices. Most restaurants serve three on a
plate, sometimes stacked in a little pyramid, filled with ice cream
and topped with chocolate or hot fudge sauce.
</P>
<P>
   One of the fanciest presentations can be found at Chaya
Brasserie where Pistachio Ice Cream Profiteroles With Hot Fudge and
Cinnamon Biscotti have been a dessert menu mainstay for 10 years.
Designed by the French-trained executive chef, the creation
($7.50), which is topped with a sugar-cookie flower design and a
chocolate cookie cone, is one of the three most popular from among
the 12 desserts offered nightly, according to general manager
Lawrence Moore of Chaya Brasserie.
</P>
<P>
   She credits the popularity to the presentation and adds the
dessert is fun, playful and truly amazing-tasting with freshly made
pistachio ice cream zipped up with a splash of brandy. The
restaurant will fill the cream puffs with any flavor ice cream or
sorbet available. Some diners have requested honey ice cream or
raspberry sorbet.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're a dessert you remember from your childhood _ and are
similar to a sundae,'' added Allie Ko, general manager of La
Cachette.
</P>
<P>
   Now give cream puffs a whirl at home _ you may be surprised at
the myriad combinations you can create. Included in today's
collection are basic recipes for the puffs along with a variety of
traditional and easy upscale fillings _ both sweet and savory.
Remember you can also use your favorite chocolate mousse or ice
creams and sorbets for desserts. Toppings for sweet variations
include raspberry, hot fudge and caramel.

Runs with CREAMPUFF-RECIPES; has art

   LOS ANGELES _ When I grew up, many a mom or cook knew how to
make cream puffs _ those mysteriously billowy, golden, airy flights
of fancy that so fascinated children and guests alike. The recipe
was a dessert and appetizer staple, especially when entertaining.
The larger cream puffs could be filled with assorted ice creams or
custards or vanilla, chocolate or coffee pastry creams and drizzled
generously with hot fudge sauce. The smaller, miniature sizes were
stuffed with crab or curried chicken salad for parties, weddings
and teas or with ice cream to make the classic French dessert,
profiteroles.
</P>
<P>
   At our house, one of my mother's signature dessert offerings for
company was one large puff split and filled with pink peppermint
stick ice cream, then topped with homemade hot fudge sauce (a
must!). Guests found them heavenly _ and so did I. Desserts didn't
get much better in those days.  &QL; 
Cream puffs are made from a soft-batter pastry dough known as choux
pastry or pate a choux, which translates from the French as cabbage
pastry because the appearance of the finished product bears a vague
resemblance to a miniature cabbage. Besides simple cream puffs and
eclairs, the dough is the foundation of lavish structures like the
towering tree-shaped croquembouche held together with carmelized
sugar, the crownlike dessert gateau Saint-Honore or the
Paris-Brest, a cream filled cream-puff pastry ring. And whimsical
choux paste swans filled with sweetened whipped cream were all the
rage at parties in the late '70s and early '80s.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow over the years, cream puffs have disappeared from the
home cooks' repertoire. But the classic pastry is worth
resurrecting or giving another look. Not only is it one of the
easiest doughs to make, but it can be prepared in just a few
minutes. ``It's the most versatile of French pastry doughs,'' wrote
Richard Grausman in his cookbook, ``At Home With the French
Classics,'' (Workman Publishing), and ``it can be baked in a
multitude of forms.''
</P>
<P>
   The pastry goes together in a jiffy on the stove-top. Just add
flour to boiling water and butter and cook the mixture until a
thick paste or ball is formed. In most recipes, the eggs are then
beaten in one at a time, until smooth, but in the more recent
editions of the Betty Crocker cookbooks, they're added all at once
_ as you'll notice in the recipe included today. I've had success
both ways, but prefer adding the eggs all at once. Use a heavy
wooden spoon to blend smooth.
</P>
<P>
   Baking directions also vary in recipes. Some recommend baking
the dough in mounds at a constant temperature throughout. Others
start baking in a hot oven, then reduce the oven temperature to
finish. Also to dry out the insides, some recipes direct cooks to
remove the puffs from the oven and cut a slit in the sides with a
sharp knife, and then return them to a turned-off oven with the
door ajar for 10 minutes. Others simply remove the puffs to racks
to cool. Experiment and suit yourself.
</P>
<P>
   But how does this dough seem to puff up almost magically? ``The
dough is leavened by steam, which expands the product rapidly and
forms large holes in the center of the item (puff),'' noted Wayne
Gisslen, in ``Professional Baking, Second Edition'' (John Wiley &AMP;
Sons). ``The heat of the oven then coagulates the gluten and egg
proteins to set the structure and make a firm product.''
</P>
<P>
   Once cooled, cut the tops off the cream puffs and fill as
desired _ or make a hole in the side and use a pastry bag and tip
to pipe in the filling.
</P>
<P>
   You can still find cream puffs at selected bakeries and
restaurants in an array of forms and sizes and with various
fillings.
</P>
<P>
   When diners are presented with the dessert selections at Chaya
Brasserie in Los Angeles, Le Petit Bistro in Sherman Oaks, La
Cachette in Century City and Bouchon in Los Angeles, they'll find
profiteroles among the choices. Most restaurants serve three on a
plate, sometimes stacked in a little pyramid, filled with ice cream
and topped with chocolate or hot fudge sauce.
</P>
<P>
   One of the fanciest presentations can be found at Chaya
Brasserie where Pistachio Ice Cream Profiteroles With Hot Fudge and
Cinnamon Biscotti have been a dessert menu mainstay for 10 years.
Designed by the French-trained executive chef, the creation
($7.50), which is topped with a sugar-cookie flower design and a
chocolate cookie cone, is one of the three most popular from among
the 12 desserts offered nightly, according to general manager
Lawrence Moore of Chaya Brasserie.
</P>
<P>
   She credits the popularity to the presentation and adds the
dessert is fun, playful and truly amazing-tasting with freshly made
pistachio ice cream zipped up with a splash of brandy. The
restaurant will fill the cream puffs with any flavor ice cream or
sorbet available. Some diners have requested honey ice cream or
raspberry sorbet.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're a dessert you remember from your childhood _ and are
similar to a sundae,'' added Allie Ko, general manager of La
Cachette.
</P>
<P>
   Now give cream puffs a whirl at home _ you may be surprised at
the myriad combinations you can create. Included in today's
collection are basic recipes for the puffs along with a variety of
traditional and easy upscale fillings _ both sweet and savory.
Remember you can also use your favorite chocolate mousse or ice
creams and sorbets for desserts. Toppings for sweet variations
include raspberry, hot fudge and caramel.
</P>
<P>
   For appetizers, cheese spreads, chutney cream-cheese combos, red
pepper cream cheese spread and even picadillo-style mixtures would
be delicious fillings. Mix and match to suit personal tastes. Also
included are a couple of renditions of the pastry dough that have a
few different ingredients baked in _ Sun Dried Tomato Cream Puffs
and Italian Cheese Puffs.

   NEW YORK _ It wasn't actually their idea to tell the newspapers
about what they call their wedding, say New York City Police
Officers Elizabeth Bryant and Marilyn Trapanotto. The president of
the Gay Officers' Action League approached them a couple of days
before the ceremony in June 1997, saying it would be a good thing,
so they agreed. As it turned out, Ms. Bryant and Ms. Trapanotto
liked the New York Post article about two lady cops who ``tied the
lavender knot'' so much, they framed it.
</P>
<P>
   A week later the honeymoon, you might say, was over.
</P>
<P>
   Officer Trapanotto, then working the Manhattan North scooter
task force in Central Park, had no problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gee, Trap, back so soon? How was the honeymoon?'' Or, ``You're
married? That's great.''
</P>
<P>
   Officer Bryant was not so lucky.
</P>
<P>
   Returning to work in the 42d Precinct in the Bronx, she found an
obscene poster of a male bodybuilder on which someone had
superimposed Officer Bryant's face. The harassment, Officer Bryant
says, went on for more than a year; officers refused to ride with
her, and at one point an officer put his hands around her throat.
When she complained to her superiors, she says, she was cited for
bad behavior. Now Ms. Bryant, claiming her civil rights were
violated, has brought a $5 million lawsuit against the city, the
department, three officers and Commissioner Howard Safir.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only did the Police Department turn their backs on her,
they punished her for coming forward,'' says her lawyer, Joseph
Tacopina.
</P>
<P>
   The Deputy Police Commissioner for Public Information, Marilyn
Mode, says she cannot comment on the suit, but did say:
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to point out that it was Police Commissioner Safir who
said `Why shouldn't gay police officers be allowed to march in
uniform at the Gay Pride parade?' We recruit vigorously in the gay
community. And actually _ I'm happy to fax it to you _ in the Sept.
27 issue of Newsweek, the NYPD was listed as one of the
gay-friendly police forces.''
</P>
<P>
   Some people have the stomach for bringing a lawsuit, some don't,
and if you had to choose who would prefer not to sue, you would
probably pick Police Officer Bryant, 34, a woman who goes out of
her way to please.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's offensive, I can take it down,'' she says of a Picasso
poster of a nude woman in her apartment, in the Gravesend section
of Brooklyn, as the photographer is deciding where to shoot.
</P>
<P>
   Officer Trapanotto, 35, is the more aggressive and protective.
She wears the short, slicked-back hair favored by juvenile
delinquents of the 50's, she chain-smokes Marlboros, and her accent
is pure Brooklyn _ so powerful that her Southern-born companion has
picked it up. It is sometimes difficult for her to restrain herself
from answering for Officer Bryant.
</P>
<P>
   When Officer Bryant found the obscene poster, it was Officer
Trapanotto who sagely told her to save the evidence. She loves the
department, Officer Trapanotto says, but she couldn't take what the
harassment was doing to her partner.
</P>
<P>
   What is the more important question for this couple: When did
you know you wanted to be a police officer, or when did you know
the nature of your sexuality?
</P>
<P>
   Both women, at any rate, knew they were gay when they were still
in elementary school.
</P>
<P>
   Officer Trapanotto, whose strict Sicilian-born father was a
construction worker, reports that three of the five children in her
family were gay. She married at 19 ``to get out of the house,''
divorced, had a stint in the Navy, then joined the force in 1994.
There were occasional comments, and when there were, Officer
Trapanotto confronted them on the spot. ``Oh, she's a dyke'' she
might hear during roll call. ``And what's the problem with that?''
she'd snap back.
</P>
<P>
   Officer Bryant grew up in a Baptist household in the small Smoky
Mountain city of Franklin, N.C. Her father had a five-and-dime
store, her mother kept the books. She hoped to be an actress. After
graduating from high school, she told her family she was gay.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a lousy experience, to be honest,'' she says. ``They
kicked me out of the house. I said: `OK, no problem. I understand
this makes you uncomfortable, I'll move out.' It wasn't as bad as
it sounds. I still went home on vacation.''
</P>
<P>
   The career in acting was brief _ if you look carefully, you'll
see her in a crowd scene in ``Weekend at Bernie's'' _ but it led to
undercover work rooting out theft in New York City department
stores. That led to the police force. Officer Bryant met Officer
Trapanotto in a coffee bar in Greenwich Village four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just about to graduate from the Academy; she was a
cop,'' Officer Bryant says. ``You know how it is when you're about
to graduate; you can't stop talking about it, and she listened, she
was terrific. I was on my way to meet a blind date and I never got
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Why did they feel they had to have the wedding ceremony?
</P>
<P>
   ``I love her,'' Officer Trapanotto says.
</P>
<P>
   ``The week we got married was very uplifting,'' Officer Bryant
says. ``It was Gay Pride week, we marched for the very first time
in uniform ..'' Officer Trapanotto, interrupting again:
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very, very special to show you're proud to be a gay
police officer, not only a gay couple.''

 `THE   LIMEY'9: TOURING SHOW-BUSINESS ROYALTY AND ITS UNDERWORLD 
</HEADLINE>
   (  Eds10: Production notes are at end of review)  
 (  af11)  
 By JANET MASLIN

<P>
   The flinty modernism that looked so bold on screen in John
Boorman's &UR; 12 &LR;  1967 nouveau-noir classic ``Point Blank'' has become
innocently nostalgic in Steven Soderbergh's hands. ``The
Limey &UR; 9 &LR; ,'' which could be called the latest directorial oddity
from Soderbergh if that were not such a redundancy, is a piquant
throwback to that style.
</P>
<P>
   And among Soderbergh's widely varied films (``sex, lies and
videotape,'' ``Kafka,'' ``The Underneath,'' ``Schizopolis &UR; 13 &LR; ,''
``Out of Sight''), this one actually has the best chance of
becoming anyone's sentimental favorite.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind the revenge plot: this film's real goal is revisiting
two charismatic stars of the '60s &UR; 14 &LR; , Terence (``Billy Budd'')
Stamp and Peter ``Easy Rider'' Fonda. For walking Proustian
evocations of the era, you can't get much more iconic than this.
</P>
<P>
   Stamp plays the title role furiously, with single-minded
intensity, wild blue eyes and a stentorian roar shown off in the
film's early moments. Having already made a memorable drag comeback
in ``The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert,'' he takes a
more traditional route this time.
</P>
<P>
   Stamp is cast as an English ex-convict named Wilson, a name that
is a holdover of the character he played while starring with Julie
Christie &UR; 15 &LR;  in Ken Loach's &UR; 16 &LR;  1967 ``Poor Cow.'' Glimpses of
young, dreamily beautiful Stamp and his no less imposing latter-day
presence are used by Soderbergh with touching efficacy.
</P>
<P>
   The screenplay by Lem &UR; 17 &LR;  Dobbs sends Wilson on the trail of a
super-sleek record producer named Terry Valentine. Fonda plays that
role with what seems to be a sense memory of every Hollywood-style
rich hipster he ever encountered, which is to say that he gets
right into the spirit of things.
</P>
<P>
   It's worth mentioning that both these actors are extremely
engaging memoirists, and that Stamp, whose tales of being on top of
the world in Austin Powers' London are particularly vivid, has a
cookbook to his credit too.
</P>
<P>
   What pits Wilson and Valentine against one another is the death
of Wilson's daughter, Jennifer, who was one of Valentine's many
young girlfriends. Like each of the film's characters, she is
studied by Soderbergh from every possible angle, seen back and
forth through time and from assorted perspectives.
</P>
<P>
   The film's dissecting tactics are so relentless that Stamp
delivers one monologue with a different shot for each sentence,
which ought to be terribly distracting. The filmmaker's &UR; 18 &LR; 
technical experiments do intrude, but they suit the meticulously
hard, distant tone of the material.
</P>
<P>
   As in ``Point Blank'' and those tactics of Jean-Luc Godard that
are also echoed here, sharp juxtapositions and architecturally
daunting settings can be as memorable as the people. As shot with
cool panache by Ed Lachman &UR; 19 &LR; , ``The Limey' &UR; 9 &LR; ' offers a guided
tour through the upper echelons of show-business royalty, and into
the underworld where their dirty work gets done.
</P>
<P>
   Enlivening the periphery of the film are Barry Newman as
Valentine's lawyer and fixer, Nicky &UR; 20 &LR;  Katt &UR; 21 &LR;  as a
ponytailed &UR; 22 &LR;  hit man, Luis Guzman &UR; 23 &LR;  as a reluctant accomplice
and Amelia Heinle &UR; 24 &LR;  as Valentine's latest arm candy. Stamp's
sardonic, relentless Limey &UR; 9 &LR;  is enough to make mincemeat of them
all. &QL;

`FIVE WIVES, THREE SECRETARIES AND ME:' THE MAN, THE TEXAN AND THE 
 MULTIMILLIONAIRE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas)  (Production notes at end of review.) 
(DW) 
 By ANITA GATES    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The first time Thomas Blake is seen on screen, in what appears
to be a tiny office, he looks like an elderly small-city insurance
salesman, the kind of guy who never got the promotion he deserved
and can't afford to retire. In fact, he's an 89-year-old Texas
multimillionaire with a photograph on the wall of himself with
Clark Gable and Gary Cooper on a hunting trip in Mexico. This
information lends a lot of weight to Blake's business advice to his
daughter: ``Whatever you do, make money. Because that's the only
recognition you're ever going to get.''
</P>
<P>
   Blake is the subject of ``Five Wives, Three Secretaries and
Me,'' an oddly charming documentary written and directed by his
daughter Tessa, whose motives may not all have been noble.
</P>
<P>
   Blake's self-satisfied tone is clear from the first scene, when
he starts telling Tessa how to do her job (making the movie). When
asked if he has any regrets in life, he says with a grin, ``A few
girls I missed along the line.''
</P>
<P>
   Of those he didn't miss, four of his five wives aren't talking
(Ms. Blake's mother, Sandra Tessman Blake, the fourth wife, is the
exception) but the secretaries are.
</P>
<P>
   The other wives are shown, in photographs or filmed at parties.
The current Mrs. Blake, Muffet (whom people keep accidentally
calling Muffin), is a baby-faced blonde of a certain age, seen at a
family Christmas gathering. Sandra, who married 56-year-old Tommy
when she was 22, is a self-proclaimed character who put Tessa into
boarding school in Scotland when she was 7 and neglected to tell
her when she and Blakie, as she calls her ex-husband, got a
divorce.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Blake, the filmmaker, sees all of her father's marrying and
remarrying and the resulting extended family as comical, at least
on one level. A relative is introduced as ``my
ex-half-sister-in-law.'' People in the film have superimposed ID's
on screen like ``my father's fifth wife's ex-husband.''
</P>
<P>
   In a way, ``Five Wives'' could be seen as a childish project
intended to do nothing more than expose Daddy for what he is:
womanizing and apparently racist. In fact, Blake disapprovingly
refers to ``the mixing of the races'' and says of blacks, ``They
don't assimilate very well.'' He even defends a relative who was a
member of the Ku Klux Klan and, as one might guess, does not
approve of Tessa's longtime boyfriend, who is black. But Ms.
Blake's film does convey a sense of the man and, without overt
commentary, a sense of the wealthy Texas culture in which she grew
up.
</P>
<P>
   The film loses energy at times, but it maintains its point of
view, and there's something impressive, playful back-and-forth
editing in which one person starts a sentence and another person
(in another setting and time) appears to finish it. Blake, despite
having agreed to be filmed almost naked doing his daily exercises,
emerges with a certain amount of dignity intact. Or is it just
because we know he's filthy rich?

CLUNKY `RANDOM HEARTS' MISSES MANY A BEAT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAULA NECHAK  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Once upon a time, director Sydney Pollack kept us laughing, on
the edge of our seats and grabbing for the Kleenex with masterful
cinematic creations such as ``Out of Africa,'' ``Tootsie,'' ``Three
Days of the Condor,'' ``The Way We Were'' and ``They Shoot Horses,
Don't They?''
</P>
<P>
   One thread that linked a number of his movies was that reluctant
movie idol, Robert Redford, who was a frequent Pollack leading man
(the pair made seven films together over three decades).
</P>
<P>
   In the '90s, Pollack gravitated toward a new star, Harrison
Ford, who first stoically forged through a static remake of the
Billy Wilder classic ``Sabrina'' for the director. And if you're
one of the few who hasn't glimpsed the thousands of TV commercials
that tell us everything we need to know (and more) about ``Random
Hearts,'' well, Ford stars in it as well.
</P>
<P>
   Word had it that the film was a yawn prior to its preview
screening earlier this week, and word on the street has proved
correct.
</P>
<P>
   ``Random Hearts'' is a long, clunky, slow-paced, talky film that
could have been an insightful look at how different people respond
to sudden tragedy and the ghosts that result, but as scripted by
the usually reliable Kurt Luedtke (he won an Oscar for the ``Out of
Africa'' screenplay), it doesn't have much to say.
</P>
<P>
   It depends purely on the star power of its leads, Ford and
English actor Kristin Scott Thomas who, try as they may, don't
generate much heat outside of a single scene that's set in a car
and comes, almost humorously, right out of the blue.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Random Hearts'' Ford is Dutch van den Broeck, a sergeant in
the D.C. Internal Affairs Department who lives a nice life with his
beautiful wife, Peyton (Susanna Thompson). She's the top catalog
designer for Saks Fifth Avenue and has suddenly been called away to
Miami because a photo shoot isn't going well. Across town, busy
U.S. Rep. Kay Chandler (Scott Thomas) is saying goodbye to her
husband, high-powered lawyer Cullen (Peter Coyote), who is about to
fly to New York on business.
</P>
<P>
   Dutch and Kay go through their day trying to, respectively,
thwart a standoff and raise money for re-election. But their
spouses have deceived them; these two apparent strangers have been
having an affair for some time and are jetting off to a hotel in
Miami for an illicit weekend. But they never arrive because the
plane they're on crashes.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a perfect world they would have never met,'' says the
film's tagline. But Dutch and Kay do meet and, bound by
incomprehension and grief, have an unlikely romance that helps them
sort through not only the twisted metal of the plane, but also the
twisted mettle of their marriages.
</P>
<P>
   ``Random Hearts'' inhabits that world of civilized perfection.
These are perfect-looking people with great jobs, stylishly neat
apartments and gorgeous clothes. And it's easy to be distracted by
all that gloss and polish because it's an attractive, sophisticated
veneer. But in truth, ``Random Hearts'' is a sloppily scripted film
that contains a silly and superfluous subplot about a crooked cop.
It's also creakily constructed and seems to be running on slow
speed.
</P>
<P>
   That may be intentional for the characters, who are shocked by
their mates' infidelities and could be suffering from some sort of
delayed reaction, but for the audience, it is numbing.
</P>
<P>
   Even Ford, who rarely seems comfortable onscreen, and Scott
Thomas, who is saddled with some truly dumb lines, can't make the
loose threads and gaps of logic come together. They look great,
sure, but they're given so little to work with that even they can't
rescue ``Random Hearts.'' It resembles the wreckage of the downed
plane more than a tale of redemptive romance.
</P>
<P>
   It looks great but there's little logical resolution to this
talky, slow and unsatisfying film that purports to delve into how
people respond to tragedy and the ghosts that result.
</P>
<P>
   Random Hearts. Directed by Sydney Pollack. Written by Kurt
Luedtke. Cast: Harrison Ford, Kristin Scott Thomas. Columbia
Pictures. 131 Minutes. Rated R for nudity, violence and language.

CARTER'S `HARSH REALM' IS RIDDLED WITH MYSTERIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Reviews of CBS' ``Love &AMP; Money'' and PBS' ``Aristocrats'' 
 follow.)  
 By JOHN CARMAN  
 c.1999, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   What happens inside ``Harsh Realm'' really matters, somehow, and
the show's creator, Chris Carter, promises to explain why,
sometime.
</P>
<P>
   Until then, ``Harsh Realm,'' premiering Friday on Fox, is about
as appealing as spit on a stick.
</P>
<P>
   Carter's latest enigma, after ``The X-Files'' and
``Millennium,'' features a virtual-reality war game the Pentagon
has designed because ... uh, because ... well, for some excellent
reason, you can be sure.
</P>
<P>
   Ace Army Lieutenant Thomas Hobbes (series star Scott Bairstow)
is eager to get on with his life and marry his fiancee, Sophie
(Samantha Mathis), but is persuaded first to take a little crack at
the game.
</P>
<P>
   Zap, he wakes up inside Harsh Realm, which is what the
computer-driven game is called, and other soldiers are shooting at
him.
</P>
<P>
   Hobbes' mission is to find the game's high scorer, a Vietnam
veteran named Omar Santiago (Terry O'Quinn), and terminate him.
Virtually, that is.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, Hobbes forms a shaky alliance with another
warrior, Mike Pinocchio (D.B. Sweeney) _ they're forever
threatening to shoot each other _ and briefly encounters a version
of Sophie, his real-life love.
</P>
<P>
   The main pieces of information he picks up are that Santiago
runs the world within the game and that Harsh Realm isn't easily
escaped.
</P>
<P>
   Based on a comic book, ``Harsh Realm'' is an ambitious TV
program but also dark, violent and massively confusing.
</P>
<P>
   What are all those little glitches in the Harsh Realm computer
software? Who is the mysterious presence that heals Hobbes' gunshot
wound? Why are some ``virtual characters'' cognizant of their
dilemma, while others are clueless? What's the point of the game
and its tie to real life? Why are characters named Thomas Hobbes
and Pinocchio? Has Carter ever met a damp, murky British Columbia

   ``Love &AMP; Money,'' premiering Friday on CBS, is a nicely cast,
moderately funny sitcom that seems instantly old and shopworn.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to explain why an ordinary sitcom should suddenly seem
so dated. Perhaps it's because the presence of a few older stars is
so startlingly out of whack with the season's tilt toward teens and
20s. Or maybe TV's most hallowed program genre really is tapped
out.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the reason, ``Love &AMP; Money'' is apt to elicit a few
chuckles and a lot of shrugs.
</P>
<P>
   Former San Franciscan Paget Brewster, who was starring on a
local cable access show barely four years ago, is the show's
central character.
</P>
<P>
   She plays the daughter of a billionaire couple (David Ogden
Stiers and Swoosie Kurtz) who, on her wedding day, jilts her
bridegroom in favor of the janitor (Brian Van Holt) at her New York
luxury highrise.
</P>
<P>
   Brewster and Van Holt are likable in the ``Love'' half of the
comedy, but Stiers and Kurtz get most of the laughs as the
``Money'' figures.
</P>
<P>
   Kurtz counts on fine comic timing and puts an aristocratic
stretch into her vowels. Stiers can play a rich, pompous WASP in
his sleep, and may be doing exactly that.
</P>
<P>
   Judy Greer and John Livingston play Brewster's siblings, and
veteran character actor Brian Doyle-Murphy is Van Holt's father,
the doorman.

</P>
<P>
   After thousands of miles of exquisite costume dramas, our
British cousins finally puncture a tire with ``Aristocrats,'' a
``Masterpiece Theatre'' three-parter beginning Sunday on PBS.
</P>
<P>
   A co-production of the BBC and WGBH-TV in Boston,
``Aristocrats'' is adapted from a novel by Stella Tillyard. Her
novel, in turn, was based on the true lives of four 18th century
sisters, the great-granddaughters of King Charles II.
</P>
<P>
   Caroline Lennox (Serena Gordon) enrages her aristocratic father
(Julian Fellowes) by eloping with a free-thinking, middle-aged
politician (Alun Armstrong). Her sister Emily (Geraldine
Somerville) marries an Irish lord (Ben Daniels) with an apparent
foot fetish.
</P>
<P>
   (The mere mention of women's stockings makes him feel ``what is
not to be expressed.'' The phrase ``shake your booty'' would
probably send him through the roof.)
</P>
<P>
   The next sister, Louisa (Anne-Marie Duff) marries a rich
simpleton (Tom Mullion). And then sister Sarah (Jodhi May), after
briefly catching the eye of the future King George III (Luke De
Lacy), ends up instead embroiled in sexual scandal and banished
from English society.
</P>
<P>
   It's frothy stuff, and seemingly a perfect PBS complement to all
those sex-saturated network shows this fall. If common Americans
can breed like monkeys on network TV, the English ought to be
allowed to get down and wiggle in the muck too, albeit with far
more delicacy.
</P>
<P>
   But aside from Sarah's scandalous saga, ``Aristocrats'' never
hits on a satisfying story line. It just trudges along ornately,
with the sisters aging in a strange leapfrog fashion. Wink once,
and one of them is a young mother. Wink again, and she's a matron
contemplating old age.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the middle-aged Emily is making discreet glances at
her children's tutor (George Anton) and wondering aloud to us ``if
marriage should be a hindrance to desire,'' the miniseries seems
out of story and out of steam.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there are all those beautiful silk dresses, elevated
bosoms and lovely country settings. ``Aristocrats'' was filmed in
Ireland; some scenes were shot at the estate where the real Emily
lived.

`HOLY SMOKE': FOR ENLIGHTENMENT, HER HEART WILL GO ON 
</HEADLINE>
   (Production notes are at end of review)  
 (af)  
 By JANET MASLIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the trippy opening moments of Jane Campion's ``Holy Smoke,''
Kate Winslet can be found in the midst of another bohemian
rhapsody. Having roamed so gorgeously through North Africa as a
young hippie mother in ``Hideous Kinky,'' Ms. Winslet this time
appears in India as Ruth Barron, a headstrong young Australian
seeking enlightenment.
</P>
<P>
   And the film's delirious credit sequence, complete with the
film's title written in blow-away smoke letters, captures the full
ecstasy of Ruth's adventure. Among the more lovable things about
Ms. Campion's new film is its knowing why a grandiose Neil Diamond
hit on the soundtrack will make this voluptuous, giddy sequence
complete.
</P>
<P>
   But all is not well in the Sydney suburb of Sans Souci, where
Ruth's relatives are wringing their hands about her spiritual
awakening. Miriam (Julie Hamilton), Ruth's timid mother, actually
ventures to India to coax her daughter back home.
</P>
<P>
   The mother's Indian visit ends badly, to the point where she
exclaims ``Thank God it's Quantas!'' while being hoisted on a
stretcher onto the airplane home.
</P>
<P>
   Ruth accompanies her mother back to Sydney, and it is here that
the film's battle of wills begins. Ruth's family has hired a
self-styled ``cult exiter,'' played by Harvey Keitel in cowboy
garb, to wean Ruth away from her Indian guru.
</P>
<P>
   Retreating to the outback, to the picturesque environs of ``Mt.
Emu Farm, Wee Waa'' (the film's identifying titles are nothing if
not fun-loving), the two of them square off for a mighty struggle.
Assorted emus and oddball relatives are assembled there to keep the
film fizzing as they watch Ruth come around.
</P>
<P>
   But as ``Holy Smoke'' moves from its early mix of rapture and
humor into this more serious, confrontational stage, it runs into
trouble. For one thing, the characters as written are an
impressionable young woman and a tough older man. There are two
fine actors here, but it doesn't help the story that Ms. Winslet's
obvious strength and beauty leave Keitel's P.J. Waters looking
overmatched. (Ms. Winslet is stunning in this role all the same.)
</P>
<P>
   And it doesn't help that the screenplay, by Ms. Campion and her
sister, Anna Campion, threatens to become heavy-handedly
ideological beneath its outward whimsy. This is a movie in which
Keitel winds up in lipstick and a red dress, and in which that is
seen as just deserts for his tyrannical machismo.
</P>
<P>
   Although ``Holy Smoke'' bears a surface resemblance to
``Sweetie,'' with its willful, misunderstood heroine and its
engaging quirks, it turns out to be more fundamentally conventional
than might be expected.
</P>
<P>
   The balance of power shifts schematically as Ruth starts
rattling P.J. in ways he had not anticipated. Ms. Winslet's
powerfully carnal presence dominates their scenes together, to the
point where P.J. is eventually drawn to violate whatever code of
ethics cult exiters have.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was trying to be comforting,'' he later explains. As a
smart, outspoken heroine of Ms. Campion's, Ruth is not about to
fall for that.
</P>
<P>
   Shot so beautifully by Dion Beebe that it seems bathed in divine
light, ``Holy Smoke'' has a sensual allure that transcends its
deep-seated ponderousness. The richly colored Indian scenes have a
hallucinogenic magic, while exquisite desert vistas radiate an
attunement with nature.
</P>
<P>
   And the steamily claustrophobic look of the intense scenes
between Ms. Winslet and Keitel have an eroticism that will not
surprise viewers of ``The Piano.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, there are some lovely flashes of visual wit here,
as when Ruth insists that she has had spiritually meaningful
relationships in the past. Ms. Campion flashes on a desperately
funny glimpse of high school Romeos who are forced to sparkle in
Ruth's imagination.
</P>
<P>
   The underpinnings of ``Holy Smoke'' can be found in a none too
readable current novel by the Campion sisters, which does not
benefit from any such directorial magic. Nor is the book graced by
Pam Grier in a tiny but piquant role, the zany crowd that
constitutes Ruth's extended family or the kewpie-doll sister-in-law
(Sophie Lee) who finds Keitel's character tempting.
</P>
<P>
   She engages with him in one memorably unorthodox breathing
exercise that may be intended as a feminist indictment, but plays
very nicely as a comic scene. &QL;

BELL-RINGING IDIOM DOESN'T COMPUTE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating for all needing.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAN FREEMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the usage game, even the simplest question is often more
complicated _ and more interesting _ than it looks. Take this query
from Art McDevitt, who writes from Flower Mound, Texas, to ask
whether All told, all totaled, or all tolled is the preferred
idiom.
</P>
<P>
   ``A case can be made for the first example, meaning when
everything is said,'' notes McDevitt. ``The second example could
mean when everything is added up.'' But his favorite is the third
version, which would derive from ``the tolling of a bell counting
the hours.''
</P>
<P>
   Preference has nothing to do with it, of course _ all told is
the correct version, a synonym for in all or in sum. But unless
you're an etymology buff, you may not have noticed that it doesn't
really mean ``when everything is said.'' Yes, all told has the same
verb as ``Daddy told the bedtime story yesterday,'' but that verb
has a boatload of other meanings, and the one in all told relates
to counting, not chatting.
</P>
<P>
   Tell meant enumerate as early as the ninth century, and we still
use it that way when we speak of bank tellers _ though few of us
see them in their human form these days. The teller in the ATM is
supposed to be counting out your cash, not spinning a yarn.
</P>
<P>
   A related sense of tell shows up in blood will tell, meaning
that good breeding (in horses or humans) will make a difference,
will count for something. It's a proposition more often invoked at
the racetrack than on the street, at least in our sneaker-shod
democracy. But it's familiar enough still as an aristocratic
slogan: Tarzan, writes a Dallas Morning News reviewer, ``reassures
modern audiences that, down deep, there is still a natural order to
things. Blood will tell. Tarzan was raised by apes, but he is still
Lord Greystoke.''
</P>
<P>
   All told is still used mostly in counting contexts _ ``All told,
the Democratic Party returned $2.8 million in questionable
donations that year'' _ but it does show up in non-numerical
environments as well. Theodore Bernstein, who was an etymology
buff, may be the only usage authority who has bothered to object to
this extension: In ``The Careful Writer,'' he declares that ``All
told, it took a lot of skill'' is incorrect, while ``All told,
fifty-two men worked on the garment'' is correct. But even writers
who've never heard of the ``rule'' seem to follow it most of the
time: ``All told, they took two weekends pulling the stunt off,''
wrote one journalist of ``The Blair Witch Project.'' Sometimes,
it's true, all told is just filler: ``All told, enough synergistic
opportunity exists that we believe it is possible to entirely
offset the dilutive effect of the additional Motorola shares to be
issued,'' said Motorola's president last month. But that whole
sentence begs to be translated into English; a meaningless opening
is the least of its problems.
</P>
<P>
   Total, whose origins are Latin rather than Germanic, tells
another story. It arrived in English as an adjective, then became a
noun in the 16th century and a verb in the 18th _ though it wasn't
till the 1950s that you could slangily total your dad's
fin-bedecked Oldsmobile. Total is also the origin of totalizator,
the long name for the tote board you see out at the track, where
blood will (or won't) tell. (The 18th century shortened total to
tot and the verb to tot up, but these variants never caught on in
US English. And don't even ask about tote bags: That tote is a
mystery, perhaps an import from West Africa.)
</P>
<P>
   As for tolled, those church bells also count, no question about
it _ they even tell time. But tolled is a different verb entirely
from told _ it's a 15th-century extension of an Old English verb
meaning ``pull,'' since the ringer had to pull the bell-rope to
toll the bell. (And the toll the turnpike takes, literally and
figuratively, is still another word, probably with Latin ancestry.)
</P>
<P>
   If there were no historical record, a plausible folk etymology
could justify any of McDevitt's three versions _ all told, all
totaled, all tolled. For that matter, facts don't always stop the
tall tales: E-mailers have been circulating a document called
``Life in the 1500s,'' a potpourri of folk etymology
``explaining,'' for instance, that ``raining cats and dogs'' comes
from the shower of housepets sliding off the thatched roofs that
turned slippery when wet. (For a thorough treatment of the
``etymological spooks'' haunting ``Life in the 1500s,'' see Richard
Lederer's Verbivore Web site,
http://pw1.netcom.com/rlederer/index.htm).
</P>
<P>
   But in the matter of told vs. totaled vs. tolled, the historical
record is reasonably complete. All told has an airtight case, and
if the bell tolls, it tolls for two alternative proposals that just
didn't add up.

`RANDOM HEARTS': TOGETHER BY A TWIST OF FATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Production notes at end )  
 (af)  
 By JANET MASLIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a nutshell, Sydney Pollack's new film, ``Random Hearts,'' is
about two people from different worlds, a Washington policeman
played by Harrison Ford and a New Hampshire congresswoman played by
Kristin Scott Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   They meet when their spouses die in the same plane crash. Then
they discover that the spouses were having an affair. Then they
have an affair of their own.
</P>
<P>
   But ``Random Hearts'' is the kind of movie that won't fit into a
nutshell. Pollack's films, from ``They Shoot Horses, Don't They?''
to ``Three Days of the Condor'' to ``Tootsie'' to ``Out of
Africa,'' have always refused to work that way.
</P>
<P>
   They have managed to be linear while also drifting thoughtfully
through the nuances of their characters' behavior, with a stylistic
polish and keenness of observation not often found in American
films any more. The ostensibly high-concept ``Tootsie'' is probably
the only film of Pollack's that could easily be made today.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the liability of a certain sogginess accompanies
Pollack's brand of thinking-man's romanticism (as it did in
``Havana''). And there is a sizable segment of the moviegoing
audience with no interest in watching Ford go through the agonies
of a cuckolded husband.
</P>
<P>
   But the tough, laconic Ford is wrenchingly effective throughout
most of ``Random Hearts,'' and the story in which he figures is a
strong one. As a hard-boiled middle-aged character who took his
marriage for granted and now finds himself wondering which was the
last honest moment he and his wife actually spent together, he has
quite a lot to work with this time.
</P>
<P>
   The film is at its best in its first hour, as it details the
busy lives of its star-crossed principals and watches disaster
inexorably approach. Ms. Scott Thomas' businesslike Kay Chandler is
so busy that she considers it good planning to arrange being in the
same state with her husband (Peter Coyote) for their teen-age
daughter's birthday.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Ford's Van Den Broeck (``They call me Dutch _ it's
easier'') is a mean cuss when it comes to Internal Affairs at the
Police Department, but a domesticated specimen at home. Sweaty in
the morning after a long run, he feels entirely confident of the
devotion of his wife (Susanna Thompson).
</P>
<P>
   She, meanwhile, casually tells him that she has to be in Miami
for a department-store catalog shoot and winds up side by side with
her lover on an airplane, nicely dressed, perfectly groomed and
deep under water.
</P>
<P>
   ``Random Hearts'' watches as news of the plane crash creeps into
the dramatic foreground. It takes a while for either Dutch or Kay
to notice the bulletins on television and feel connected to the
disaster.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in a scene that mixes Pollack's instinct for the ineffable
and his skill with the mundane, Dutch finds himself incongruously
at the dress department where his wife worked, asking about her
business in Miami and finding out that she had none. ``We think we
know,'' says a saleswoman sadly. ``Nobody knows. You just don't
know.''
</P>
<P>
   The film watches Dutch fall into a baleful rage, as when a plane
crash investigator sensitively tells him that he shouldn't be alone
at such a time. ``Oh yeah?'' growls Dutch. ``I was alone before you
got here.'' And it watches as he crosses paths with Ms. Thomas'
briskly efficient widow, who happens to be in the midst of a
re-election campaign.
</P>
<P>
   (Pollack makes an amusing appearance as her media consultant.)
At first, he decides not to tell her what he knows. Then he can't
help it, and the two of them are drawn together in ways not even
the movie can explain.
</P>
<P>
   The latter part of the film, in which Ford is forced to say
things like ``I was thinking of your mouth,'' is a good deal iffier
than the first. It's not much of a stretch to imagine Dutch and
Kay's consoling each other, but the film confines them to an affair
that is the sexual equivalent of Easy Listening.
</P>
<P>
   And it saddles them with a lot of talk. Having already gone this
route in ``The Horse Whisperer,'' Ms. Scott Thomas must struggle
with both an uneven American accent and a strong sense of deja vu
in the audience. Ford, who gives one of his best and most intense
recent performances, remains more plausible and affecting.
</P>
<P>
   Handsomely photographed by Philippe Rousselot and with its minor
roles notably well cast (Dennis Haysbert, Edie Falco, Lynne
Thigpen, Brooke Smith and Richard Jenkins are among the secondary
players), ``Random Hearts'' has a screenplay by Kurt Luedtke and is
adapted by Darryl Ponicsan from a novel by Warren Adler.
</P>
<P>
   It incorporates a full reserve of hard-won wisdom about the
perils that can befall a marriage. One woman speaks of having found
her husband in flagrante delicto in their bedroom one afternoon.
``I kept my mouth shut,'' she says of the aftermath. ``And I never
went home again without calling first.''

 &HT;    POST-BHOPAL REFORMS PREPARE U.S. FOR Y2K
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    By MARILYN GEEWAX
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Fifteen years ago this December, a Union Carbide
pesticides plant in Bhopal, India, spewed out a toxic gas that
killed more than 6,000 people. That terrible tragedy triggered the
industry reforms that may help protect lives at this year's end
when managers at U.S. chemical plants face the Y2K computer bug,
according to the director of chemical emergency preparedness and
prevention for the federal Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).
</P>
<P>
   Jim Makris, speaking Thursday on a panel assembled by the
President's Council on Year 2000 Conversion, said the 85 million
Americans living within five miles of chemical plants have less to
fear now because of reforms, such as the 1986 Emergency Planning
and Community Right-to-Know Act, and new technologies that make
plants safer. ``The last 15 years have made a difference,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Y2K software flaw will create some risks by causing
older computers and embedded chips to misread the date 00 as 1900,
rather than 2000. That seemingly small problem could lead to
equipment malfunctions on Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
   To avoid problems, many chemical plants have announced they will
not operate Dec. 31 and Jan. 1. Others with continuous
manufacturing processes say they will operate, but with extra staff
on duty and contingency plans in place for emergencies. Texas,
Illinois and California, in that order, are home to the highest
concentrations of the roughly 14,000 plants regulated by the EPA.
</P>
<P>
   President's Council Chairman John Koskinen said that, while a
single Y2K failure within a chemical plant is not likely to cause
safety problems, multiple failures or other Y2K-related problems,
such as a loss of electricity, could combine to create hazards.
``The stakes are very large,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gerald Poje, a member of the Chemical Safety and Hazard
Investigation Board, agreed that the greatest fear is a cascade of
equipment failures. ``You can withstand a single bee sting, but if
you get 100 bee stings,'' you could be facing a catastrophy, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Panel participants generally agreed that large manufacturers
have made enough progress against Y2K that such cascading failures
should not occur. But relatively little information has been
gathered about the readiness of small chemical companies.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Makris said that enough precautions are taken by small
firms every day, regardless of Y2K, that safety levels are high.
``Systems fail all the time'' because of earthquakes, ice storms,
power surges and other problems, he said. But those disturbances at
chemical plants do ``not result in catastrophic releases,'' he
said.

when managers at U.S. chemical plants face the Y2K computer bug,
according to the director of chemical emergency preparedness and
prevention for the federal Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).
</P>
<P>
   Jim Makris, speaking Thursday on a panel assembled by the
President's Council on Year 2000 Conversion, said the 85 million
Americans living within five miles of chemical plants have less to
fear now because of reforms, such as the 1986 Emergency Planning
and Community Right-to-Know Act, and new technologies that make
plants safer. ``The last 15 years have made a difference,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Y2K software flaw will create some risks by causing
older computers and embedded chips to misread the date 00 as 1900,
rather than 2000. That seemingly small problem could lead to
equipment malfunctions on Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
   To avoid problems, many chemical plants have announced they will
not operate Dec. 31 and Jan. 1. Others with continuous
manufacturing processes say they will operate, but with extra staff
on duty and contingency plans in place for emergencies. Texas,
Illinois and California, in that order, are home to the highest
concentrations of the roughly 14,000 plants regulated by the EPA.
</P>
<P>
   President's Council Chairman John Koskinen said that, while a
single Y2K failure within a chemical plant is not likely to cause
safety problems, multiple failures or other Y2K-related problems,
such as a loss of electricity, could combine to create hazards.
``The stakes are very large,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gerald Poje, a member of the Chemical Safety and Hazard
Investigation Board, agreed that the greatest fear is a cascade of
equipment failures. ``You can withstand a single bee sting, but if
you get 100 bee stings,'' you could be facing a catastrophy, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Panel participants generally agreed that large manufacturers
have made enough progress against Y2K that such cascading failures
should not occur. But relatively little information has been
gathered about the readiness of small chemical companies.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Makris said that enough precautions are taken by small
firms every day, regardless of Y2K, that safety levels are high.
``Systems fail all the time'' because of earthquakes, ice storms,
power surges and other problems, he said. But those disturbances at
chemical plants do ``not result in catastrophic releases,'' he
said.

RUDE `ACTION' TURNS OFF VIEWERS _ BUT IF IT WERE ON CABLE ...
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEN PARISH PERKINS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Action?'' None for Anne Edie, thank you. She finds Jay Mohr's
Peter Dragon interesting ``but crude,'' Illeana Douglas' Wendy
funny ``but sleazy,'' the bleeped-out profanity ``unnecessary, a
gimmick, a turnoff.''
</P>
<P>
   But she likes the Fox comedy, airing Thursdays on Fox, in all
its loudmouth, speedy glory. Loved the pilot, in fact. ``Laughed
out loud,'' she says by e-mail. ``Haven't done that since my
husband declared his wishes to cook Thanksgiving dinner for 12.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, ``Action'' ``leaves me wondering if this is something I
should support. I've never considered myself to be conservative or
a prude, but to watch each week people conniving in the name of
money is simply something I don't want to digest, whether I find it
interesting or not. Is it true that certain things get in our
psyche and stay there? I think about that when I watch this show.''
</P>
<P>
   Praised by critics and even given the greenlight by advertisers,
``Action,'' which zeros in on an unscrupulous Hollywood film
producer navigating an unscrupulous town, has been surprising in
its inability to attract an audience.
</P>
<P>
   It's still early, but ``Action'' is being hammered by NBC's
``Stark Raving Mad,'' the lifeless Neil Patrick Harris sitcom, and
hasn't shown much of a ratings pulse in three airings, falling from
No. 53 in the Nielsen ratings to 72 and then to 95.
</P>
<P>
   That means trouble, which would suit Robert Sargeant just fine.
``I think it's a funny show, actually,'' he said by e-mail. ``I
lived in Los Angeles for five years and while I didn't work in the
film business, I knew many who did. The backstabbing, the absence
of integrity and morals, is right on. But I had to say that I felt
like taking a shower afterwards.''
</P>
<P>
   From Louise Stammers, by e-mail: ``My friends have watched and
enjoyed `Action,' but none of us came back to it the second time.
We talked about it, remembering lines and everything, and laughing
our heads off. But there comes a time when crudeness shouldn't be
rewarded. I watched Craig Kilborn on Comedy Central, but now that
he's on CBS, I don't watch as much. He's one of those snide
smart-----, and what's odd is that it was OK for him to do it on
Comedy Central but not OK for CBS, where, for some reason, even
late at night, I think impressionable minds are watching. It's
almost as if I feel that the people who watch network TV need to be
protected.''
</P>
<P>
   Some consider it the sensibility gap between network and cable
television. This issue came into sharper focus during the
nominations for the coveted Emmys, when ``The Sopranos'' racked up
16 nominations. Pay cable doesn't have to worry about bleeping its
profanity (a clear example of cable's freedom was last week during
``The Chris Rock Show,'' when basketball star Allen Iverson asked
Chris Rock, ``I can curse, right, this is cable?'' and then did
just that). So the networks, concerned with advertiser response and
special interest groups, consider their position a disadvantaged
one.
</P>
<P>
   A disadvantage to what? Not being able to give viewers
profanity, violence and sex?
</P>
<P>
   ``Action'' arrives at a time when network television is
desperately trying to join, not fight, its cable competition, by
offering more adult subject matter and moving away from the
traditional half-hour series of setup, punch line, setup, punch
line way of doing things. It's no surprise that this series was
conceived with cable sensibilities or that it ended up on a network
whose programming division is now headed by the former head of
Comedy Central.
</P>
<P>
   At its core, ``Action'' is exactly what we've been yelling for.
Its renewed energy is exhilarating to watch, because it has been
accomplished with a certain amount of conceptual daring. By this I
mean some of the biggest laughs of the season thus far have come
from situations in which Peter Dragon is behaving badly.
</P>
<P>
   A young woman I ran into recently said she'd found the series
``offensive,'' though not to her personally. That sort of thing
``shouldn't be on TV. It's like teaching bad behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   Another example is e-mailer Henri Alexander, who said she was a
rabid watcher of HBO's ``The Sopranos,'' where, like ``Action,''
backstabbing, literally and figuratively, in the name of money, is
commonplace.
</P>
<P>
   Having watched the first two episodes of ``Action,'' ``I thought
it was clever,'' Alexander wrote, ``but it felt out of place. I
suppose it had something to do with it being on Fox and not HBO.''
</P>
<P>
   Writing Alexander back, I asked whether she'd watch ``Action''
if it were on HBO. ``This sounds strange,'' she replied. ``But I
probably would. And after thinking about your question a bit, this
is why. `Action' on Fox makes me feel like it's a gimmick and less
real. That it's just something trying to be bad for the sake of
being bad. There's a dishonesty in that.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if it were on HBO, it would be what it is. Just a clever
series that, by and large, goes after the film industry system, and
does so in a terrific way.''
</P>
<P>
   Is this the disadvantage the networks are screaming about?

`PLAINSONG:' EVERYONE'S A NEIGHBOR IN A SMALL PRAIRIE TOWN 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Publication notes appear at end of review.) 
(DW) 
 By MICHIKO KAKUTANI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The title ``Plainsong,'' Kent Haruf explains in an epigraph to
his new novel, refers to those simple, vocal melodies used in the
Christian church from earliest times. As it turns out, it is a
wonderfully fitting title for this plainspoken and moving novel _ a
novel that weaves together the voices of half a dozen people living
in a small Colorado town and turns their overlapping stories into a
powerful portrait of a community bound together by history, memory
and the simple bonds of neighborly responsibility and affection.
</P>
<P>
   The novel begins by giving us three seemingly separate tales of
people caught up in their own domestic problems.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Guthrie, a teacher at the local high school, is trying to
raise his two young boys, Ike and Bobby, by himself: his wife has
withdrawn into a lingering depression and decided to move to Denver
to live with her sister.
</P>
<P>
   Seventeen-year-old Victoria Roubideaux, a high school student,
is trying to cope with the news that she is pregnant and on her
own: her mother has kicked her out of the house, and she has not
seen the baby's father in weeks.
</P>
<P>
   As for elderly Harold McPheron and his brother, Raymond, they
have long since grown accustomed to a solitary existence: since
their parents died in a truck accident many decades ago, they have
lived quietly by themselves on the family ranch, tending to the
cattle and their pastures and rarely venturing into town.
</P>
<P>
   Although the intersection of these three sets of lonely lives
might normally have all the melodramatic makings of a provincial
soap opera, Haruf orchestrates their convergence with such
authority and grace that their stories materialize before the
reader's eyes without a shred of contrivance. As his critically
acclaimed first novel, ``The Tie That Binds'' (1985), demonstrated,
he possesses an intimate knowledge of farm and small town life, and
in this novel, he uses that knowledge to immerse the reader in the
daily rhythms of life in Holt, Colo. His language borrows the
spareness and measured cadences of Hemingway, but it has a folksy,
down-home inflection, the sound of the prairies and great plains.
</P>
<P>
   Holt, we quickly learn, is the kind of small town where
everybody knows everybody else, if not intimately then at least by
sight or rumor. When Bobby and Ike's mother moves out, everyone _
from the local barber to people on their paper route _ knows what
happened. And when their father clashes with one of his students _
a notorious bully named Russell Beckman _ everyone knows that, too.
</P>
<P>
   It is this sort of small-town closeness that enables the
homeless Victoria to seek refuge with one of her teachers, Maggie
Jones. And it is that same sort of small-town closeness that
impells Maggie to ask Harold and Raymond McPheron to take Victoria
in at their farm: she knows the brothers well enough to know that
they will be kind to the frightened girl and that Victoria will, in
turn, help alleviate the loneliness in the old men's lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``She needs a home for these months,'' Maggie tells them. ``And
you'' _ she smiled at them _ ``you old solitary bastards need
somebody too. Somebody or something besides an old red cow to care
about and worry over. It's too lonesome out here. Well, look at
you. You're going to die some day without ever having had enough
trouble in your life. Not of the right kind anyway. This is your
chance.''
</P>
<P>
   As ``Plainsong'' progresses, it becomes something of an echo
chamber. The shared experience of familial loss that binds the
McPheron brothers together is mirrored by the experience of Ike and
Bobby Guthrie, as they attempt to cope with their mother's
leave-taking, just as the loss of innocence they suffer in their
9th and 10th years is mirrored by Victoria's painful initiation
into the disillusionments of grown-up life. Victoria's acrimonious
relationship with the father of her baby is echoed by Tom Guthrie's
painful separation from his wife, just as her determination to
build a new life is echoed by Maggie Jones' steady resolve to
pursue a romance with Tom.
</P>
<P>
   There are moments of shocking brutality in ``Plainsong'' _ the
brutality of life on a farm (the death of a horse, the breech birth
of a calf) and the brutality of people being cruel or callous to
one another. Ike and Bobby witness a malicious sexual assault
through the window of a neighbor's house, and they will be beaten
and humiliated by Russell Beckman, the student their father is
feuding with at school.
</P>
<P>
   Yet if Russell Beckman's behavior sometimes seems over the top,
if the McPheron brothers' good-natured good-old-boy routine
sometimes seems like an outtake from a Bartles &AMP; Jaymes commercial,
such missteps on Haruf's part are easily enough overlooked, given
his sheer assurance as a storyteller. With ``Plainsong,'' he has
conjured up an entire community, and ineluctably immersed the
reader in its dramas. He has written a compelling and compassionate
novel.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Museum of Modern Art has cut the ribbon on its
contribution to the millennium furor: a 17-month series of
exhibitions under the umbrella title ``MOMA 2000.'' In addition to
being a summing up of this venerable institution's past, it is (or
so we are told) a rehearsal for its future.
</P>
<P>
   The completed project will mix hundreds of objects from the
permanent collection _ some of them chestnuts (Rodin's ``Balzac,''
Picasso's ``Three Musicians,'' Gaugin's ``Moon and the Earth (Hina
Tefatou),'' others unfamiliar _ into three successive chronological
chunks. Those chunks will be subdivided into thematic units titled
``People,'' ``Places'' and ``Things,'' each of which will fill a
floor of the museum for a few months.
</P>
<P>
   That's the big picture; the final results are still in the
stars. But from the first increment, which is called ``Modern
Starts: People'' and focuses on the human figure in art from 1880
to 1920, one can glean some hint of what to expect from the whole.
</P>
<P>
   The main idea is to cast an impressionistic glance backward at
modern art as a phenomenon, and at the museum that has done much to
create and promote that phenomenon, or at least a somewhat Olympian
version of it. But the real news may lie in what the show says
about the shape of things to come.
</P>
<P>
   In 2001 the Modern is scheduled to break ground on a building
that will house, among other things, permanent-collection
galleries. Such galleries are a museum's core identity, its
official statement about how it sees art: what it deems important,
what goes with what. Any tinkering with this statement, never mind
a complete overhaul, demands hard, subtle, consensual thought.
</P>
<P>
   This is especially true after critical theory in the last few
decades has thrown the very terms ``museum,'' ``modern'' and
``art'' into question. By now, it seems, everyone knows that art
institutions are impure, driven by social and economic agendas.
Every collection and installation is an interpretation. And any
historical account based on a linear progression of one era's
notion of main events is, at best, provisional.
</P>
<P>
   The Modern, for its part, has long been in the canon-making
business. Its curatorial house style might be summed up in the
phrase ``neatness counts.'' Its view of 20th-century art as a
carefully calibrated flow chart of successive avant-garde movements
has, until recently, been unswerving, some would say doctrinaire.
</P>
<P>
   On the evidence of ``Modern Starts'' _ which has been organized
by the curatorial team of John Elderfield, Peter Reed, Maria del
Carmen Gonzalez, Mary Chan and Elizabeth Levine _ efforts are being
made, however cautiously, to give such certainties a shake.
</P>
<P>
   Right off the escalator to the second floor it is clear that
something is up. A mural-like drawing by Sol LeWitt suggests that
the show's historic time frame isn't hard and fast. Inside the
galleries the pristine white walls that have always framed the
permanent collection are painted in greens, browns and grays.
</P>
<P>
   And then there's the art. The opening image _ a life-size
undated painting by Leon Bakst of the dancer Nijinsky as a
strapping young man in scarlet trunks, one hand raised in salute _
is bound to be a novelty even to die-hard Modern denizens. The
portrait has been in the collection for years, but the Modern has
never shown it.
</P>
<P>
   You can see why. A cross between a 19th-century academic study
and a Hollywood hunk, a little heroic and a little absurd, this
figure is too far outside the mainstream to fit any aesthetic
pigeonhole. But the work is an ideal lead-in for a show that has
declared its intention to bring together diverse and unexpected
art.
</P>
<P>
   Eclecticism of style, date and medium pervades the first
galleries of ``Modern Starts,'' devoted to the theme ``Actors,
Dancers, Bathers.'' Picasso's 1915 ``Harlequin'' hangs beside a
``Hamlet'' poster produced around 1884 by the British designers who
called themselves the Beggarstaffs (real names: William Nicholson
and James Pryde). Cezanne's seminude male ``Bather'' (circa 1885)
is accompanied by a 1993 photograph by the Dutch artist Rineke
Dijkstra of a boy in a swimsuit on a beach.
</P>
<P>
   The pairing is a neat demonstration of how a single classic
pictorial motif can recur, which is nice to see, in a textbooky
way. The pictures are far more interesting, though, as studies in
the eroticized male body, a subject that might easily have been
pushed a lot further but, in a show that in general treads timidly
over potentially risky ground, it is not.
</P>
<P>
   Eroticism is explored more forcefully in images of the reclining
female nude in an adjoining gallery. These range from Erich
Heckel's woodcut portrait of his feral-looking 12-year-old model
Fraenzi, to Paul Klee's grotesque ``Virgin in the Tree,'' to a
magnetic Titianesque Modigliani nude stretched across a red ground
that looks like swiped-on blood.
</P>
<P>
   The overall effect is striking and theatrical. The gallery, with
its gray-brown walls, has a penumbral, sickroom feel. A sense of
the neurasthenic mystery of early modernism _ feverish and creepy _
comes through. And one realizes afresh how much this art is a
product of male-generated sexual fantasy.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Fantastic or otherwise, the modern body is an organism under
transformation, and this is the main theme of the rest of the show.
Change can occur through metamorphosis, as in Matisse's series of
five bronze heads of a young woman named Jeanette: in the first,
she looks more or less like you and me; in the last, done six years
later, she is a conflation of abstract swells and bumps, like a
pileup of breakfast rolls.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes figures dissolve like ectoplasm into their
environment: Vuillard depicts his sister being sucked into the
wallpaper behind her. Most often, though, the figure is fragmented:
shattered into bits, truncated, scrambled.
</P>
<P>
   The result can look comedic in a proto-Junk Art sculpture by
Vladimir Baranoff-Rossine. It turns slightly brutish in Francis
Picabia's little painting, ``Conversation II,' with its limbless
torsos lying about like chops on a grill. The effect is somewhere
in between these two poles in a 1990 video by Gary Hill in which a
male body is carved up among several screens, tummy here, nose
there.
</P>
<P>
   The title of the final section, ``Composing With the Figure,''
implies that what comes apart can be reassembled, although
radically changed. Entered in evidence are three big paintings:
Picabia's wild-and-crazy ``I See Again in My Memory My Dear Udnie''
(1914), all nozzles and fleshy polyps; Leger's ``Three Women''
(1921), with their sheet-metal hair and stainless-steel limbs, and
Picasso's ``Desmoiselles d'Avignon,'' which is, in essence, the
restitched and revivified post-mortem corpse of the premodern human
form.
</P>
<P>
   By the time we arrive at this monument, displayed like an
altarpiece, where have we been? Through a series of stylishly
installed, atmospheric installations. And through a number of
perceptive thematic groupings, some of which set up extended
rhythms that run through the show. (Remember the raised hand of the
Bakst Nijinsky? It is there again in ``Desmoiselles.'')
</P>
<P>
   But has the standard view of modernism, the one delivered for
generations from on high in authoritative MOMA-ese, been revised?
Not really. To be sure, the museum has made a point of saying that
``MOMA 2000,'' in sum and in parts, is not intended as a grand,
definitive statement. So if this first installment looks more like
a cosmetic make over than a structural shift, we have been warned.
</P>
<P>
   Yet one can still not help asking for something different, and
more. Bland, old-fashioned formalist and iconographic themes still
prevail. And the mix of artists is not all that much of a mix.
Mostly it is major work by famous artists and minor works by famous
artists, often the same artists.
</P>
<P>
   To some degree this is dictated by the shape of the Modern's
holdings. But surely the museum has oddball material tucked away,
stuff that must have seemed decent enough when it was acquired but
later got the ``reject'' stamp and might not look half-bad now.
</P>
<P>
   The cornucopian ``Art of the '40s'' exhibition in 1991 suggested
as much. It would be good if a few more early-modern unknowns and
irregulars had been brought out to join the fray, or to create a
fray, which is exactly what's missing.
</P>
<P>
   But there are very promising things, too. One, predictably,
comes in a section devoted to photography. Here voices otherwise
absent are heard, including those of women, from Frances Benjamin
Johnston to Tina Barney, and non-Europeans like Martin Chambi of
Peru and Seydou Keita of Mali. One assumes many more such
inclusions are planned for coming installations, which will carry
the modernist saga beyond 1920 and into the present.
</P>
<P>
   And at least one section, a compact minishow of work by James
Ensor (1860-1949) and Jose Guadalupe Posada (1852-1913), points to
depths in the museum's holdings that could, if explored,
significantly broaden the historical picture while remaining within
the parameters of the collection.
</P>
<P>
   These two artists lived on opposite sides of the world, Ensor in
Belgium, Posada in Mexico. They probably never saw each other's
work, although their moralizing, politically pointed, death-riddled
humor is close in form and spirit. Shown together, the evoke a kind
of transcultural Day of the Dead, and they have much to say about
institutionally redefining early modernism as an international
phenomenon, with popular roots and diverse audiences.
</P>
<P>
   Ensor was connected with the European Symbolist avant-garde;
Posada emerged from a regional art tradition. While Ensor worked in
relative isolation and in small print editions, Posada produced
more than 20,000 engravings in a broadsheet medium that appealed to
a mass audience, rich and poor.
</P>
<P>
   The influences of both artists can, to varying degrees, be found
in Latin American art to this day. And their pairing here proposes
a widening view of modernism, past and present, only sporadically
suggested in the surrounding galleries.
</P>
<P>
   The Modern has suggested that the new permanent-collection
galleries, which are several years down the line, will incorporate
pocket-size installations like this one; and that's a promise we
should hold it to. As the museum expands, it only makes sense that
its view of art should expand, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Modern Starts: People'' tiptoes in this direction and gets by
more on new style than on new substance. But as the larger canvas
of ``MOMA 2000'' unfolds, this first step could turn out to be the
start of something new.
</P>
<P>
   ``Modern Starts: People'' remains at the Museum of Modern Art,
11 West 53rd St., (212) 708-9480, through Feb. 1. ``Modern Starts:
Places'' opens on Oct. 28; ``Modern Starts: Things'' on Nov. 21.

X-PHILES WILL APPRECIATE INTRICATE `REALM' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Army has lost control of its virtual-reality war simulator
and Lt. Thomas Hobbes is the game boy du jour, ordered to win back
the game from the renegade major who has been operating it for his
own personal amusement.
</P>
<P>
   Hobbes learns soon enough that he's not in New Jersey anymore.
Harsh Realm isn't on any maps _ military, Rand McNally or Yahoo.
He's on his own in a world that seems familiar but doesn't quite
behave like the one he left behind, the one where his fiancee is
planning their wedding and awaiting his imminent release from
military service.
</P>
<P>
   In this odd new world, his fiancee or the woman who looks like
his fiancee, is married to the guy who was his best friend on the
outside, a soldier whose life he saved in Sarajevo but who is now
sworn to kill Hobbes inside Harsh Realm.
</P>
<P>
   But are these real people, or are they very convincing products
of this virtual-reality construct? It's the sort of disquieting
question that, if mulled too long, can give you a headache. Or get
you killed.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone expecting a quick answer shouldn't bother tuning in.
``Harsh Realm,'' premiering Friday on Fox, is from Chris Carter,
creator of ``The X-Files,'' where reasonable questions go to die.
The truth may be out there, but Carter won't say where.
</P>
<P>
   Viewers who like Carter's government-conspiracy paranoia and his
penchant for confusing plots will embrace ``Harsh Realm.'' It
requires close attention to details that propel the story, and it
has instantly likable characters in Hobbes (Scott Bairstow) and
Mike Pinocchio (D.B. Sweeney).
</P>
<P>
   Pinocchio, another soldier who was sent into Harsh Realm to
wrest control of it from Omar Santiago (Terry O'Quinn), now leads a
sort of freedom-fighter existence, trying to stay a step ahead of
Santiago, a megalomaniac who makes sure all threats to his
supremacy are eliminated with prejudice.
</P>
<P>
   Before entering Harsh Realm, Hobbes is told that it's only a
game, that all he has to do is beat Santiago's ``score'' and he can
leave the Army a winner. Trouble is, Santiago is the Army's most
decorated soldier. And he's nuts.
</P>
<P>
   As escapism, ``Harsh Realm'' is more accessible than Carter's
Friday night effort of the past two years, ``Millennium.'' Not as
dark and seemingly less cynical, it's a simple _ well, not that
simple _ man-against-machine saga with a little theology thrown in.
(Residents of Harsh Realm speak of a legendary ``savior'' who will
rescue them from Santiago.) Better still, if this is to be the last
season for ``The X-Files,'' ``Harsh Realm'' may provide Fox and
X-philes with a reasonable substitute.
</P>
<P>
   Harsh Realm. Hourlong drama series about a soldier stuck inside
a virtual-reality war game. Starring Scott Bairstow, D.B. Sweeney,
Rachel Hayward, Terry O'Quinn, Maximilian Martini, Sarah-Jane
Redmond and Samantha Mathis. Series premiere Friday night on Fox.
Parental guideline rating TV-14.

   Grade: B

FAST-MOVING AMAZON.COM CHURNING TOWARD TOP OF E-COMMERCE FIELD
</HEADLINE>

By TERESA MCUSIC 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Like the mighty river it was named after, Amazon.com is forging
a wide path in electronic commerce.
</P>
<P>
   For those who know the Web retailer only as the largest
bookseller in the world, with a $6 billion book value that exceeds
that of Barnes &AMP; Noble and Borders combined, it's time to take
another look.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon.com is now a drugstore, a pet supply store and a
supermarket. Last year, the company bought two more technology
companies to further its retailing abilities: Junglee Corp., which
has developed comparison-shopping technologies, and PlanetAll, an
Internet site that helps people stay in touch with friends.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon.com is quickly becoming a leader in the $43 billion
e-commerce business. Some are comparing it to the giant Wal-Mart in
terms of retailing clout.
</P>
<P>
   ``Amazon has become the default name when you think of buying on
the Net. ... They are the poster child of Internet commerce,'' an
analyst with BancAmerica Robertson Stephens said back in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the company succeeds with its ambitions or not _ it has
yet to post a profit _ Amazon.com is a big player in defining how
retailing, or e-tailing as the industry jargon goes, will work on
the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Mentioned in countless management books on the latest ways to
best treat employees, Amazon.com is now the sole subject of a book
by Rebecca Saunders. It's called ``Business the Amazon.com Way:
Secrets of the World's Most Astonishing Web Business'' (Capstone,
213 pages, $21.95).
</P>
<P>
   This is no doubt the first of a series of books on Amazon.com,
if Microsoft is any indication of what sells in the book world.
Indeed, the author admits upfront that she could not get an
interview with Amazon.com founder and Chief Executive Jeff Bezos,
possibly because he's working with another author.
</P>
<P>
   But Saunders has done her research, and in addition to a lively
history of a company destined to lead in the next century, she has
developed a number of lessons.
</P>
<P>
   Above all, she observes that people developing business on the
Web are literally doing the impossible.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Web allows entrepreneurs to do what wouldn't work in the
real world,'' she writes. ``The opportunities would seem to be
limited only by your imagination and business acumen.''
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, Bezos has both of those in spades.
</P>
<P>
   A former New York hedge fund manager, Bezos ditched it all in
1994 when he came across a statistic that would forever change his
life: He read that Web usage was growing 2,300 percent monthly.
</P>
<P>
   Within two months, Bezos had packed up his wife and dog and was
heading West to launch an Internet company, not even sure of his
destination.
</P>
<P>
   He ended up in Seattle and started his company in his garage
with three other people. Amazon.com went public in 1997 with an IPO
price of $9 a share. The stock is now trading around $66, although
it was as high as $209 this year. Bezos is predicting that by 2000,
his company will have $1 billion in annual sales.
</P>
<P>
   After a brief corporate history, Saunders takes off on 10
strategy ``secrets.''
</P>
<P>
   Most are the regular fodder of management books, such as finding
and retaining customers by offering value, being frugal, branding,
constantly reinventing and so on. Those broad business rules are
often talked about, but Saunders shows how Bezos implements them,
which is far more interesting.
</P>
<P>
   For example, visitors to Amazon.com have helped finish a chapter
of a book by John Updike and helped write the first ``Doonesbury''
comic strip created online. Children looking in on the Amazon.com
kids section can enter the ``Be a Poet'' contest.
</P>
<P>
   Although the book is not as complete as I would have liked,
Saunders does have a good feel for what makes Amazon.com and its
leader so important.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bezos is likely to have the same impact that Sears' catalog
had on the retail industry, and his online store may grow into the
Sears or Woolworth of the new millennium,'' she writes.
</P>

<P>
   NEW YORK _ The most potent antidepressant available in this city
at the moment can't be had by prescription, and it isn't measured
in milligrams. It is being marketed under the name ``Contact'' and
is the manufacture of Susan Stroman, a director, choreographer and
inspired alchemist. Advertising has it that ``Contact'' is a
``dance play,'' but those words hardly capture how the show makes
you feel. ``Contact'' is a sustained endorphin rush of an evening,
that rare entertainment that has you floating all the way home.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, that sound you hear is of expectations shattering over at
Lincoln Center, where ``Contact'' opened Thursday night at the
Mitzi E. Newhouse Theater, and for once, it's a joyful noise. Ms.
Stroman (the choreographer of ``Crazy for You'' and ``Steel
Pier''), aided by the dramatist John Weidman and a dream ensemble
of dancing actors and acting dancers, has created the unthinkable:
a new musical throbbing with wit, sex appeal and a perfectionist's
polish.
</P>
<P>
   Brimming with a sophistication that is untainted by the usual
fin-de-siecle cynicism, ``Contact'' restores the pleasure principle
to the American musical. It's the kinetic equivalent of Rodgers and
Hart.
</P>
<P>
   The timing is merciful indeed. It had been looking as if the
red-blooded American musical would succumb to fatal anemia before
the century's end. What had the form mustered up the last several
years? Puppet shows, pageants, textbook anthologies of past hits
and dour civics lessons. If you wanted that blissful adrenaline
kick that was once the genre's hallmark, you bought tickets to the
revitalizing Encores series of vintage musicals in concert at City
Center.
</P>
<P>
   In literal terms, of course, ``Contact'' isn't at all in the
tradition of the shows seen at Encores. A theatrical portfolio of
three seemingly unrelated vignettes set in different time periods,
it has no original score, using instead an ingeniously selected
medley of recordings ranging from Bizet to the Beach Boys.
Weidman's script is agile and clever, but most of the narrative
burden rests on the choreography.
</P>
<P>
   Yet ``Contact'' fills the same emotional needs once served by
the sassy conventional book musicals of the 1930s and their more
sentimental descendants of the 1940s and '50s. It converts the
messy daily ingredients of sexual attraction and conflict into
something as smoothly sweet and tart as a Key lime pie. Both the
intoxication of love and the hangover of loneliness are given
idealized, elegant form. Like the most satisfying kinds of
escapism, ``Contact'' weaves romance from a reality we are all
familiar with.
</P>
<P>
   In this musical universe, anxious, fumbling klutzes walk into
fantasies in which they acquire the physical eloquence of Fred and
Ginger, in dances that define character with the conversational
ease that Ms. Stroman brought to Trevor Nunn's first-rate revival
of ``Oklahoma!'' in London. And when the klutzes in question are
embodied by Karen Ziemba and Boyd Gaines, who in separate segments
give the performances of their careers, the transitions acquire a
psychological steam that is as affecting as it is entertaining.
</P>
<P>
   This metamorphosis is most pointedly achieved in the playlet
that gives ``Contact'' its umbrella title, the evening's longest
segment and its entire second act. In it, Gaines plays Michael
Wiley, a successful advertising executive who feels that life is a
party to which he hasn't been invited.
</P>
<P>
   The show begins with a robustly satiric scene in which a drunken
Michael accepts yet another Clio award, after which he goes to his
Manhattan apartment to kill himself. Somehow he winds up instead in
a pool hall that becomes a swing dance club at night, and there he
inevitably meets the woman of his dreams, a statuesque knockout and
swing queen who is identified simply as the Girl in the Yellow
Dress (Deborah Yates). There's only one problem: Michael can't
dance.
</P>
<P>
   On one level, this playlet recalls Gene Kelly's great danced
film noir spoof in ``Singin' in the Rain,'' with Ms. Yates
substituted for Cyd Charisse, the mystery woman who ``came at me in
sections'' in the movie. But ``Contact'' also has a pulsing urban
anxiety, a feeling of being alone in a crowd that will be familiar
to anyone who has ever spent time in a singles bar with nothing to
talk to but his glass and the bartender (given quirkily appealing
life here by Jason Antoon, of the undulating eyebrows).
</P>
<P>
   Gaines' preternaturally blue eyes seem electrified by both
timidity and painful desire as the dancers around him merge into an
excluding orgy of synchronized movements that bring a cocky,
contemporary sting to classic swing. It hurts to identify with him
and it's impossible not to.
</P>
<P>
   The process of Michael's finding his feet provides deep
vicarious satisfaction. Gaines, who is not a professional dancer,
makes whatever tentativeness he's feeling in the part work like
gangbusters. He turns in the top-drawer performance you wish he had
given in ``Company.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Yates has the daunting assignment of incarnating the woman
whom every man wants, and remarkably that is exactly how she comes
across. She's not only dangerously beautiful, suggesting a
razor-edged Grace Kelly; she also has an exquisite balletic poise
and extensions to die for. She can act, too, projecting the
requisite fire of wistfulness beneath the icy exterior. A pinup
girl for straight men in a New York musical: who would have thought
it?
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The dancers who make up the ensemble in the swing club are much
more than background. Though they move with coordinated precision
in Ms. Ziemba's exuberant routines, which evoke the vibrancy and
varied vocabulary of Jerome Robbins' work on Broadway, each
performer registers with a firm stamp of individuality.
</P>
<P>
   Even without lines to speak, they're all distinct personalities,
evident in William Ivey Long's characterful costumes. The attention
to detail throughout this episode is delicious, by the way, with
Thomas Lynch (sets) and Peter Kaczorowski (lighting) making most
inventive use of the color yellow, whose appearance signals the
opening of that particular stairway to paradise that only musicals
can build.
</P>
<P>
   If Gaines represents the lost soul in search of his rhythm in
life, the three characters in the felicitously titled ``Swinging,''
the vignette that opens the show, would seem to feel no such
uncertainty. Inhabiting Lynch's and Long's sumptuous re-creation of
Fragonard's painting ``The Swing,'' an aristocratic young man and
woman (Scott Taylor and Stephanie Michels) and a studly servant
(Sean Martin Hingston) perform a rococo mating ritual in which all
involved would seem to know their respective moves in advance.
</P>
<P>
   Or do they? Without breaking the tempo set by the swing of the
title, variations do occur, including one startling role reversal.
``Swing,'' which is both the evening's iciest and most erotically
explicit episode, is more of a gimmick than the others, but it is
executed to sly perfection by its trio of dancers.
</P>
<P>
   It's a provocative curtain raiser, and by the evening's end, you
see how it fits into the show's context as a study in confinement
and escape. The selection of Stephane Grappelli's jazz take on
Rodgers and Hart's ``My Heart Stood Still,'' over a
period-appropriate harpsichord piece, is dead on, a canny mirror of
the vignette's improvisations within a fixed form.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is ``Did You Move?,'' which closes the first act with
its own piquant blend of wistfulness and exhilaration. The setting
is now an Italian restaurant in the 1950s. Enter a thuglike man (
Antoon), exhaling machismo and menace, and his submissive and
terrified wife (Ms. Ziemba).
</P>
<P>
   While the husband stalks the buffet, we are escorted into the
mind of Ms. Ziemba's cowed character in reveries in which she
becomes a prima ballerina, turning every prop, patron and employee
in the restaurant into part of the grand mise en scene. (The
excellent David MacGillivray is the headwaiter who metamorphoses
into Ms. Ziemba's passionate partner.) Once again, you're
astonished by the clear, distinct presence of every performer on
stage, each of whom hints at a myriad of untold stories.
</P>
<P>
   Moving to triumphant orchestral strains from Grieg, Tchaikovsky
and Bizet, Ms. Ziemba's graceless wife assumes instant, effortless
grace of the highest order. The appeal of this fine actress-dancer
has always lain in the contrast between her aura of apple pie
normalcy and prodigious technical skills. Here that opposition
becomes the very point of ``Did You Move?'' Ms. Ziemba projects a
madcap self-delight that brings to mind the Lucille Ball of ``I
Love Lucy'' and implicitly suggests just how subversive the zany
sitcom heroines of that repressed era were.
</P>
<P>
   ``Contact'' deserves the larger audiences and the Tony
nominations that a move to a Broadway house would allow, but there
will inevitably be some sacrifice in losing the intimacy of the
Newhouse, where you somehow feel personally involved with each
performer.
</P>
<P>
   The rapturous gleam of surprise flashed by Ms. Ziemba as she
sails into a jete; the startled smile that sneaks over Gaines'
features when his feet catch up with his mind: glance around you,
and you'll see similar expressions on the faces of the
theatergoers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Contact'' achieves what few musicals do these days: a sense of
euphoric connection between the audience and what is happening on
the stage. To dance is to live in Ms. Stroman's world. ``Contact''
lets you feel that you've joined that dance.

INGRES: AN ICY EYE FOR PEOPLE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Italy)   By MICHAEL KIMMELMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Before he was the great man of French art,
Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres drew pencil portraits to make money.
They were souvenirs on letter-size sheets of paper. He was living
in Italy.
</P>
<P>
   He hoped the drawings would lead to more important commissions,
and sometimes they did. He also drew friends for pleasure, but
generally he regarded portrait drawing of this sort as a waste of
time. The people who commissioned him often had no idea who he was
or what they had bought, and many of the portraits disappeared or
turned up years later in the hands of families who didn't realize
that they had inherited works of value.
</P>
<P>
   His sitters were foreigners: people in the French community in
Rome, and then, after Napoleon's administration was expelled,
British tourists. Ingres, a student of Jacques-Louis David, had won
the Grand Prix de Rome in 1801 and arrived in Italy triumphant in
1806, only to learn that the works he had exhibited at the Paris
Salon that year, in particular a giant portrait of Napoleon
enthroned, had been savaged by the critics. Devastated, he finished
his term at the French Academy in 1810 and, partly to avoid
returning to France, he stayed in Italy for 14 more years, moving
from Rome to Florence in 1820.
</P>
<P>
   Along with his portrait paintings, the exhibition of Ingres'
portraits now at the Metropolitan Museum through Jan. 2 includes
several dozen drawings from throughout his career. Ingres would be
appalled. He took pride in his painted portraits, which are some of
the greatest ever made. But like other academics he wanted to be
remembered above all as a history painter, not a portraitist. Least
of all would he have imagined that posterity might admire his
portrait drawings as much as, if not more than, his history
paintings.
</P>
<P>
   But tastes change. His drawings are attuned to modern
sensibilities and look even more impressive than many of the
paintings, among other reasons because they suggest what Ingres
could do when he was not really trying.
</P>
<P>
   There is very little like them in history. He almost never
corrected himself or hesitated in the middle of a line.
</P>
<P>
   Drawing after drawing is perfect: perfect not only in the sense
that there isn't a false step but also in that each one looks true.
We assume these people must have looked exactly like this, because
we know that Ingres could be brutally honest about a sitter. (His
famous drawing of an obese, mustachioed Madame Bertin, for example,
is one of the memorable curiosities of 19th-century art.)
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, there is something inhuman and unbelievable
about the pictures. Technique on Ingres' level is always
discomforting and spooky at first. Ingres, to use a familiar
metaphor, seems to breathe the air of some icy summit of art where
normal humans gasp, which is clearly what he expected people
looking at his work to do. Even Degas can seem down to earth by
comparison.
</P>
<P>
   So it takes a while to realize that these are not all cold
pictures, at least the best of them are not _ including the one of
Madame Bertin, which, after the shock, we see is respectful for not
dissembling. When he had the right subjects, like friends and other
artists whom he admired, his portraits convey a clear warmth and
humor that belies the usual tendency to equate mechanical precision
with lack of emotion. The equation makes no more sense with Ingres
than the standard art historical split in early 19th-century French
art between the advocates of Classicism and line (Ingres) versus
the exponents of Romanticism and color (Delacroix).
</P>
<P>
   Ingres was, like other perfectionists, egomaniacal, insecure,
intolerant and easily upset, to the point that he could become
physically ill in times of stress. There are stories about his
developing boils while he was painting ``The Apotheosis of Homer.''
Art critics drove him mad, and who can blame him? During most of
his career he was attacked for the predictable reasons (chilliness,
fussiness, exaggeration of form) by critics, whose words he stewed
over for years and whose attacks sometimes made it painful for him
to work.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, he described being ``love struck by painting _
I don't possess it, it possesses me.'' His habits were regular. The
antithesis of a bohemian, he embraced every bourgeois comfort,
which he expected his wife to provide for him at home, in return
for which he was a devoted husband. He had no children. When he
became the director of the French Academy in Rome, he played the
part of the stern parent. Even his relatives were supposed to call
him Monsieur Ingres.
</P>
<P>
   He was also a social climber, obsessed about awards and titles
(``I am devoured by ambition,'' he said), but never more content
than when he was making or listening to music with a few friends at
home. He kept friends for life, unless one crossed him. A friend
described him as ``choleric, impatient, obstinate, good, naive,
righteous and lazy.''
</P>
<P>
   We look for signs of the vulnerable and touching Ingres behind a
few of the implacable portraits in this exhibition. He peeks out in
the very early paintings, dogged and endearingly precise, like
early American pictures, and in some of the mature works, like the
portrait of Jeanne-Suzanne-Catherine Gonin, the daughter of a
friend, whom he presents intimately and as if without artifice.
</P>
<P>
   The most touching thing about Ingres' art is the degree to which
all of it survives under the impossible pressure of his own
expectations. He was a laborious artist burdened by what he
perceived to be the gap between himself and his heroes, whom he
nonetheless believed he could exceed. His famous portrait of the
seated Madame Paul-Sigisbert Moitessier is more psychologically
fascinating in terms of the artist than of his sitter: the pose is
based on the figure of an enthroned goddess in an ancient Roman
painting, the sitter's reflection in a mirror echoing a
self-portrait by Poussin, her flowered silk dress, the height of
fashion in 1856, and a riot of flabbergasting trompe l'oeil effects
meant to convey her wealth and Ingres' own even greater wealth of
talent.
</P>
<P>
   With 40 paintings and 92 drawings, the show at the Met spans six
decades, from the works Ingres did as a prodigy in Montauban and
Toulouse through the celebrated portrait he did of the newspaperman
Louis-Francois Bertin (Madame Bertin's husband), in 1832, which was
his first popular success. (The critics still hated it.) The
exhibition ends, in a shimmer of satin and jewels, with the late
portraits of Madame Moitessier, the Vicomtesse d'Haussonville and
the Princesse Albert de Broglie, and with his last work, a
self-portrait, calculatedly humble, which he finished in 1865, two
years before he died, at 87.
</P>
<P>
   The portrait of Monsieur Bertin, massive with claw hands clamped
to knees, one eyebrow raised, has come to symbolize bourgeois power
generally and in particular the no-nonsense reign of the July
Monarchy, which Bertin's newspaper supported. Bertin seems as
immediate and human as Napoleon does not in that early portrait of
him, enthroned like God the Father in a Gothic altarpiece, although
one shouldn't overstate the difference.
</P>
<P>
   There is the same shallow space, a kind of flat, nowhere zone,
and the same fetish with dazzling the eye (David called it Ingres'
``tendency toward exaggeration''), which pushes even Bertin's
picture toward a kind of abstraction that takes the form of
hyper-realism. It's often said that the Bertin portrait looks like
an early photograph, down to the sepia-toned background, but really
it goes farther than any photograph could in creating the illusion
of a figure. It's intensity of optical fireworks, distilled and
concentrated, actually puts us back in a realm of disbelief, where
we always end up with Ingres.
</P>
<P>
   Critics finally, mostly, came around to Ingres in his last
years, having decided that he represented the only remaining hope
against the deluge of Degas, Cezanne and company. This didn't stop
Degas, Cezanne and almost every other thinking modernist from
revering Ingres.
</P>
<P>
   Degas at one time even owned five of the portraits in the Met's
exhibition. He paid the most extraordinary tribute to Ingres in
1911, when as an old man he went every day to visit an Ingres
exhibition at the Galerie Georges Petit in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   Degas was blind. He went to run his hands over the pictures.  &QL;

`CHINA: FIFTY YEARS INSIDE THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC:' A MOST
APOLITICAL CHINA  
 (EDITORS: ORIGINALLY SKEDDED AS CHINA-ART-REVIEW)  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Pa., Mass., Calif., Brazil, The Czech Republic)   By GRACE GLUECK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It's a little hard to imagine that a photographic
show pegged to the 50th anniversary of the People's Republic of
China could give no idea of Communist misrule. But the organizers
of ``China: Fifty Years Inside the People's Republic'' at the Asia
Society have accomplished that feat.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the aim is not to offer a documentary but _ in the
words of Vishakha N. Desai, senior vice president for cultural
programs and director of the Asia Society Galleries _ ``a highly
personal, engaged, insiders' view of China and the Chinese during a
time of unprecedented change.'' So this group of images by 33
photographers _ ranging from those as well-known as Robert Capa and
Eve Arnold to native-born Chinese whose work has rarely been seen
outside of the country _ is a misleadingly low-key representation.
It gives no hint of the violence at times engendered by the zeal of
``Communist reforms.''
</P>
<P>
   There is in fact a curious discrepancy between the show's
discreet visuals and the candid text for its catalog by Rae Yang.
Ms. Yang, 49 and the chairwoman of the East Asian studies program
at Dickinson College in Carlisle, Pa., was a Red Guard in her youth
and she freely discusses the excesses of the Mao-decreed 1960s
Cultural Revolution and her own (small) role in them.
</P>
<P>
   But from this show, you would scarcely know that the Cultural
Revolution and other depredations occurred causing the death of
millions.In fact, the only photograph of Tiananmen Square _ which
achieved international notoriety in 1989 when government soldiers
fired on reformist supporters gathered there _ is a 1981 view by
Liu Heung Shing. It shows students studying in its vastness at
night to prepare for high school entrance exams, which were allowed
after years of official education-bashing that made learning a
dirty word.
</P>
<P>
   So aside from the work of Antonin Kratochvil, a Czech
photographer whose five exhibited pictures from 1978, taken in
Guangdong Province , could be said to mildly reflect the angst and
despair of the Cultural Revolution's aftermath (compare these with
Eve Arnold's upbeat views on the same subject, taken around the
same time), the show is squeaky clean of politically embarrassing
material.
</P>
<P>
   Even operating under Ms. Desai's rubric, one would think that in
a half-century of lensed images there might be a few that more
sharply reflected the down side of the Chinese government. The
show, incidentally, is sponsored by the Ford Motor Co., which does
extensive business with China. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It begins strongly with a historical section, a cluster of
black-and-white images made before the founding of the People's
Republic in 1949 (including a rare close-up of the young Mao Zedong
and Zhou Enlai, already plotting revolution in Yan'an, taken in
1937 by Owen Lattimore, a Far East scholar who was a target of Sen.
Joseph R. McCarthy in the 1950s. There are poignant photographs of
refugees displaced by the civil war between Mao's forces and those
of Chiang Kai-shek, and Communist victory celebrations and even a
shot of a smiling Mao presiding at a swimming party with members of
the Communist Youth League in the late 195Os.
</P>
<P>
   But there Mao's visibility all but ends. The show shifts to
become an often fascinating essay on the China of later years, but
without much edge. Grouped by individual photographers and
unconcerned with chronological order, it concentrates more on
China's recent years, with many works dating from the 1990's. They
range from a 1998 essay on ``Parents'' by a young Chinese painter
and photographer, Wang Jinsong, a look at older couples of
differing social status whose children have flown the nest, to
views of paintinglike landscapes in starkly beautiful black and
white, taken from 1984 to 1995 by Lois Conner, an American
photographer. Several of the photographic essays here, by Reagan
Louie, Mark Leong and Richard Yee, deal with the return of
Chinese-Americans to the haunts of their immediate ancestors.
</P>
<P>
   The Brazilian-born photographer Sebastiao Salgado is represented
by one of the liveliest ``takes:'' nearly a dozen black-and-white
views of Shanghai, made in 1998. Skyscraper panoramas, street
scenes, huge factory interiors, old-style markets and the day and
night life of its people show a city of vast ambition, future-bound
at a dizzying rate. The frantic pace and sprawling reach of cities
is also forcefully portrayed by Macduff Everton, an American, in
his big photo of a crowd crossing a garish Hong Kong street (1997)
and the broad boulevards of Shenzhen (Special Economic Zone) in
Guangdong Province (1995).
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Robert Glenn Ketchum's beautiful explorations
of the Grand Canal and affiliated waterways of Suzhou (1986-95),
show a Venice-like city whose canal network forms one of the great
industrial transportation systems of Western China, but whose
ancient houses, bridges and culture still resist the modernization
that creeps in relentlessly.
</P>
<P>
   The persistence of tradition is cherished by Richard Yee, born
in Guangzhou and living in Massachusetts since 1952. He keeps
returning to document old ways, and his 1997 essay on Yunnan
Province shows the land and people unchanged: an infant slung over
its young mother's shoulder, both dressed in richly embroidered
central Asian garments; a straw basket roped to a man's back, a
gunny sack worn by a walker in the rain, a delicate snowy landscape
that could have been painted a thousand years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Born in California in 1966, Mark Leong also revisits his family
turf in Guangdong Province (1989-97) to record an ancestor worship
ritual, his oldest living relative in China the life of a grungy
street and the home of a village chief. More attuned to the
present, Brian Palmer, an American who lives in Beijing, has
photographed some American-style rites (1996-97), including the
crush at a subway stop and svelte young things at a modeling
competition.
</P>
<P>
   To prove that religion is still alive in China, Xiao-Ming Li, a
Bejing-based Magnum photographer, searched out pockets of secret
Catholicism (1993-95): a nun preparing rice cakes for Mass in
Shaanxi Province; a cluster of congregants saying funeral prayers
aboard a fishing boat in Jiangsu Province, a man carrying a statue
of the Virgin through an ancient, rubble-strewn courtyard in Yunnan
Province.
</P>
<P>
   Few countries are as photogenic as China, and the infectious
empathy with which most of the photographers view their subjects
makes for some compelling images. In short, the show undemonizes
China, giving a very human dimension to the struggles of a vast
population adapting to a tidal wave of change. But in leaving out
direct references to authoritarian brutality over the half-century,
it weakens itself, revealing only part of the picture.

<P>
   MESHELL NDEGEOCELLO: ``Bitter'' (Maverick). &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In this season of blockbusters, as Garth Brooks morphs into
Chris Gaines and Trent Reznor crawls forth to top the charts again,
subtler artistic transformations may be overlooked. Consider
``Bitter,'' the third album by Meshell Ndegeocello.
</P>
<P>
   The willfully elusive ``Bitter'' is the inverse of
sensationalistic art. Yet it is a bold move from Ms. Ndegeocello,
who rose to prominence as an innovator with a wild streak. An open
bisexual and religious seeker who intertwined biblical references
with politics and sass, Ms. Ndegeocello raised issues that
heightened her profile. ``Bitter'' takes similar chances in a far
less flashy way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bitter'' examines romantic loss and rebirth within music
structured to mirror introspection. Its rhythms flow in circulatory
patterns guided by Ms. Ndegeocello's bass playing; guitars, strings
and her guarded vocals intertwine like brain waves.
</P>
<P>
   The songs dissect passion touch by touch, as the skilled
musicians Ms. Ndegeocello has assembled encounter one another note
by note.
</P>
<P>
   Those collaborators include the former Prince inspirations Wendy
and Lisa, the guitarists Doyle Bramhall II and Ronnie Drayton, and
the producer Craig Street. Street gives Ms. Ndegeocello room to
emote, as he has done with Cassandra Wilson and K.D. Lang.
</P>
<P>
   She chose stillness as her metier, and in doing so created
something worth bothering to notice.

`LOVE &AMP; MONEY' WON'T APPEAL TO MUCH OF ANYBODY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's too bad ``The Mike O'Malley Show'' won the trophy as first
new fall series to be canceled. CBS's ``Love &AMP; Money'' deserved the
chance.
</P>
<P>
   If ever a comedy was put on the air without hope of a future,
this is it. Sandwiched between ``Kids Say the Darndest Things,''
which targets a family audience, and ``Now and Again,'' which skews
smarter than the average CBS drama, ``Love &AMP; Money'' is your basic
dumb comedy that isn't likely to appeal to either audience. Or to
anyone else, for that matter.
</P>
<P>
   Its premise of mismatched lovers is as fresh as anything on the
day-old rack. Worse, its execution is standard, by-the-numbers
sitcom. Even the laughter sounds half-hearted.
</P>
<P>
   Paget Brewster plays a rich young woman who leaves her rich
young husband-to-be at the altar so she can be with her true love,
who happens to be the superintendent of her family's apartment
building. Her family is stuffy and rich, his family isn't (his
father is the doorman), and if you really like this idea, go watch
``Dharma &AMP; Greg.''
</P>
<P>
   Love &AMP; Money. Half-hour comedy series about an heiress who's in
love with the superintendent of her apartment building. Starring

   COLLEGES-ECONOMY (Cambridge, Mass.) _ The much-trumpeted
``knowledge'' (or information or innovation) economy consists of
much more than Silicon Valley. Across America, researchers say,
high-tech is creating localized boomlets like the one here in
Kendall Square, which houses not only biotech but software and
other companies. And if there is one never-fail factor at work on
these silicon corners, it is the nearness of a research university
shifting from ivory tower to revving economic engine. By Carey
Goldberg.

   SWEDEN-ECON (Stockholm, Sweden) _ At a time when world leaders
are fixated on the United States' economic success and its credo of

to be defying gravity. In a turnaround that has surprised Swedes as
much as anybody else, this largely unreconstructed welfare state is
suddenly one of Europe's most vibrant economies. And after nearly
three decades of sluggishness in which the output per person
slumped from third highest in the world to 18th, just behind Italy,
the Swedish economy is in the midst of a powerful transformation.

   A Stanley Kubrick trivia question. In ``2001: A Space Odyssey,''
what's the last thing that HAL the computer does? Give up? As the
astronaut Dave performs the final shutdown of the rogue computer,
HAL experiences a moment of childhood regression and haltingly
sings an old-fashioned ditty it learned when it was only a
microchip, which carries the refrain: ``But you'll look sweet upon
the seat, of a bicycle built for two.''
</P>
<P>
   Always a master of detail, Kubrick reached back to the turn of
the century for an ironic counterpoint, a reference to a technology
that's quaint and outdated, but particularly human in scale.
</P>
<P>
   As I donned my helmet and gloves in the parking lot at the
Country Inn in Millville, N.J., I remembered this scene and came to
the conclusion that Kubrick wouldn't have believed his eyes. In a
minute, 40 bicycles built for two, or more, would roll out, kicking
off the annual Tandem Weekend sponsored by Tandems East, a local
bicycle shop.
</P>
<P>
   But the bikes that took off into the South Jersey countryside
weren't the kind of slow, stately boardwalk cruisers Kubrick had in
mind. No, these were sleek, special-purpose fin-de-millenium
machines.
</P>
<P>
   A good road tandem bike features a frame precision-welded of
high-tensile steel or aircraft-grade aluminum and components of
space-age alloys that keep the weight down to under 40 pounds, a
little more than some department-store single bikes. To handle the
hills, a quality tandem has more gears than a tractor-trailer, 27
in all. This kind of technology doesn't come without a price: a
quality road tandem starts at more than $2,000, and the best models
run $5,000 or more.
</P>
<P>
   I began Tandem Weekend as a spectator. For the first segment of
the 53-mile excursion _ a loop of rural roads that start and end in
Millville _ I tagged along on my single bike. ,
</P>
<P>
   It afforded me a firsthand look at a little-known truth: tandems
are fast. It's simple physics. Twice the horsepower plus only about
25 percent more wind resistance equals an aerodynamic advantage
that can offset a lot of training miles. ``A good tandem team can
hit 25, even 30 miles an hour on the flats,'' said Mel Cornbluh,
owner of Tandems East and organizer of the event. This is almost 10
miles per hour faster than a fit single rider can do. Even average
teams roll along at almost 20 mph. The faster tandems left me in
the dust.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, you forgot someone,'' one team said, cheerfully passing
me as though I were standing still. ``I lost my second engine,'' I
replied, slightly out of breath. But, thankfully, this was a ride
and not a race, so I hung with the slower teams, drafting as close
as I could to their rear wheels to gain aerodynamic advantage _
racers derisively call it wheel sucking _ and observing tandem
teamwork firsthand.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the teams on the ride were mixed-gender couples with the
man riding in the captain's position and the woman in back as the
stoker. This is because most tandems are designed to put the taller
rider in the front. For many, tandeming becomes a way for couples
of unequal ability to ride together without having to shout, ``Wait
up!''
</P>
<P>
   Tandems encourage, and even demand, conversation. ``The money we
spent on the bike was originally slated for my patio,'' one stoker
confessed with hardly a trace of regret. Who needs marriage
counseling when you can ride a bicycle built for two?
</P>
<P>
   At the lunch stop, I transferred to a triple _ three pedalers on
two sets of wheels _ ridden that morning by Steve and Cindy
Malriat, a young couple from outside Philadelphia. Their 6-year-old
son, Jonathan, pedaled in the center stoker position with the aid
of special cranks designed for his short legs, while 18-month-old
Daniel was towed along in a bike trailer mounted on the back. (For
the second leg of the trip, they allowed me to be the man in the
middle.)
</P>
<P>
   The triple offered me an extraordinary perspective. I could see
what the captain does. I could see what the stoker does. My only
responsibilities were to pedal and carry a map in my rear jersey
pocket where Cindy could reach it.
</P>
<P>
   My first reaction? I was reminded of that old dog-sledding
adage, ``Unless you're the lead dog, the view never changes.'' From
my obstructed-view seat, all I could see was Steve's Ferrari-red
jersey. But after a couple of miles, I realized I could peer over
Steve's shoulder or even turn to the side without shirking my
steering duties, since I had none. Still, I'm told, it's customary
for the stoker to choose the captain's jersey, since it makes up so
much of the view.
</P>
<P>
   The economist Adam Smith would have loved tandeming because it
is division of labor come to life. Steve did all the steering and
braking and balancing, while Cindy and I provided propulsion and
navigation. With my additional thrust, we really motored. When all
three of us pounded hard, we would flex the back end of the bike
enough so that the chain rubbed the derailleur cage with every
pedal stroke.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   We consistently topped 25 mph on the flats, easily hitting 30 on
short downhills, and powered up the short grades as if they weren't
there. Before long, we began catching tandem teams that we had
spotted a 15-minute head start.
</P>
<P>
   Riding a tandem, and especially a triple, also demands
communication, so we chattered more than a sailboat crew getting
ready to tack. ``Right turn ahead, on the brakes, coasting,'' Steve
said. ``Car back,'' Cindy countered. ``Now it's clear.''
</P>
<P>
   As captain, Steve would let us know every time he shifted up or
down, tapped the brakes, or even if he reached for a water bottle.
He would also inform the stokers when there was broken pavement
ahead, although Cindy confessed that he sometimes forgot, which
resulted in her fillings' getting rattled by an unexpected pothole.
Cindy would check for passing cars, apprise drivers of our stops
and turns with hand signals, and check the maps and cue sheets so
we avoided wrong turns.
</P>
<P>
   When Jonathan is riding the middle stoker position, Cindy also
serves as the entertainment committee, playing ``Itsy Bitsy
Spider'' on his back. The view and the big bike's speed provided
sufficient amusement for me. But tandeming (and tripling), I soon
discovered, takes more than simple communication. It takes blind
faith.
</P>
<P>
   Our initial trial of trust took place at the first stoplight.
When the bike came to a full stop, Steve straddles the bike,
supporting more than 300 pounds of bike and rider while we stokers
stayed clipped into the pedals. If he slipped or stumbled, we would
all go down.
</P>
<P>
   The real test came when it was snap decision time. As we headed
for home, an oncoming Chevy tried an ill-advised pass of another
car across the center line on the two-way road. So we found
ourselves facing a Cavalier going 65 mph, flashing its lights, its
left fender aimed directly at our left handlebar.
</P>
<P>
   My first instinct was to turn my handlebars right, except that
they're there strictly for show. Steve stayed the course, inching
the bike to the right, and the car whizzed by, its door handle
coming within 18 inches of my left hip.
</P>
<P>
   I gained new respect for Steve's captaining skills the next
morning, when I went out on the front of a tandem with Norman
Toplosky, a Connecticut engineer. A 20-year veteran of tandeming,
he had brought two tandems to the event _ for his wife and two
children _ including one he had built himself. He had toured Europe
on tandem, but he rarely rode stoker, so this was a new experience
for him too.
</P>
<P>
   At first, steering the big bike felt a little like driving a
Ryder truck. The controls were heavy, and when Norman and I really
pounded, the rear end felt as if it had a mind of its own. It
wasn't unlike learning to ride all over again, albeit at 25 mph.
</P>
<P>
   But I soon began to trust the bike more _ understanding that the
rhythmic swaying of the back end was a sign of power, not a threat
to our balance _ and loosened my death grip on the bars. As I
enjoyed the uncharacteristically rapid rush of breeze across my
cheeks, I thought, ``Hey, this is kind of like riding a single bike
on steroids.'' Except, of course, for the running commentary:
``Down one, left turn ahead, cars back?''
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the ride, my throat was almost as tired as my
legs. The urge to communicate, I'm embarrassed to say, became so
ingrained that even after Tandem Weekend was over and I was back on
my single bike, I occasionally found myself calling out turns and
shifts to a nonexistent stoker, eliciting strange looks from
passing motorists.
</P>
<P>
   Ready for a new verse, HAL? ``You're not complete, upon the
seat, of a bicycle built for one.''  &QL;

BROTHER SENTENCED IN BORDER SMUGGLING CASE 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   BROWNSVILLE, Texas _ A federal judge on Thursday sentenced three
brothers to prison and scolded their elderly parents for a family
operation that for years helped thousands of illegal immigrants
sneak into the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a family-run enterprise. The chickens have come home to
roost,'' U.S. District Judge Hilda Tagle said as she pronounced
sentence.
</P>
<P>
   The parents _ Abel Contreras Sr., a former Raymondville city
commissioner, and his wife, Olga _ face sentencing later for their
parts in the scheme that lasted about 15 years before their arrests
in July. They and the others pleaded guilty to charges of
conspiracy to harbor undocumented immigrants as part of plea
bargains with prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   Tagle delayed sentencing the parents and one daughter until the
ownership of an apartment complex and a motel in Raymondville could
be resolved so the federal government can level them with
bulldozers. The buildings were way stations for illegal immigrants
who crossed the border into Texas illegally and were awaiting
transportation to the interior of the country.
</P>
<P>
   But Tagle sent Abel Jr., David and Daniel Contreras to prison
for terms of slightly more than one year to slightly less then
three years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your parents took everybody under their wing and said it is OK
to break the law, we are all making money,'' Tagle told the
brothers as she encouraged them to set better examples for their
children.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sentences here do not do justice to what has been
happening for years,'' Tagle said. ``It has stopped and hopefully
won't happen again.''
</P>
<P>
   The Contreras family was arrested after a two-year initiative
known as ``Operation Snake Pit,'' which was spearhead by undercover
Border Patrol agents.
</P>
<P>
   Rumors about the Contrerases had circulated in Raymondville for
years before federal authorities began investigating and launched
the undercover operation. Agents posed as illegal immigrants and
smugglers as they infiltrated an underground network that pumped
people through Raymondville, a city of 9,400 people about 50 miles
north of Brownsville.
</P>
<P>
   At one point in its investigation, the Border Patrol discovered
356 illegal immigrants in shacks owned by the Contreras family in
Raymondville.
</P>
<P>
   Abel Contreras Sr., 61, and Olga, 60, sat silently in the front
row at the federal courthouse as their sons were ordered to prison.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am very sorry about what happened. It will never happen
again,'' a solemn Abel Contreras Jr. said.
</P>
<P>
   Abel Contreras Jr., whom prosecutors said played a minor role in
the outfit, was sentenced to 14 months in federal prison and 200
hours of community service upon his release. Daniel Contreras
received 24 months in prison, and David was sentenced to 33 months.
</P>
<P>
   Their sister, Yolanda Hernandez, whose sentencing also was
delayed, wiped tears from here eyes as Tagle sent her brothers to
prison.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are hoping to God that things work in our favor,''
Hernandez said before the hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Others who have been sentenced include two cooperating
witnesses, who led illegal immigrants to the Contreras compound,
and a cook.

   POCONO, Pa. _ The cars are lined up in the pits at Pocono
Raceway, and on this early morning in September, it is hard not to
feel like a kid at Christmas, a kid opening that first slot race
car track and fighting with brothers and sisters over who gets
which car when we race.
</P>
<P>
   But these are real cars, queued up for the taking: Vipers and
Porsches and 'Vettes and souped-up Subarus (the surprise of the
test fleet) and Jaguars and trucks and vans and big American cars
with big horsepower under the hood.
</P>
<P>
   It is International Motor Press Association test day and we'll
be driving as many cars as we can slip into through a road course
that meanders over much of the expansive infield, forcing 90-degree
turns, hairpin turns, and lots of shifting; and for that pure rush
of adrenalin, we'll break onto the three-turn NASCAR track and rip
down the backstretch as fast as the cars will go and their brakes
will stop them for a snap turn back onto the road course at the end
of the straightaway.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the cars are better suited for the straight. Others for
the road course. Some for both. Some for neither.
</P>
<P>
   To find out which is which, grab one. And since we don't know
the course yet, we grab an Audi Quattro first, hoping for the
stability of all-wheel drive and a certain snap to the car as we
explore.
</P>
<P>
   The track officials launch you from a two-line staging area at
the end of the pits, cars going off at about 20-second intervals
(lengthened if, say, a Viper will be following a Miata off the
line).
</P>
<P>
   There are waiting lists to get into some cars: the Viper; the
Porsche Carrera 4; the new screamer, the Honda S2000, which
redlined at nine honkin' grand (we drove it down here on civilian
roads, and the car is a total blast).
</P>
<P>
   Other cars sit waiting as you roll in from each circuit of the
course. So many cars. Only one day to drive as many as
concentration and stamina allow.
</P>
<P>
   Some quick-test highlights:
</P>
<P>
   Audi Quattro _ Maybe it's because the course is new to me, but I
find the Audi spongy in the corners of the road course. Am I
jerking it through the turns, or is it really that soft? And, on
the straightaway its power is unimpressive.
</P>
<P>
   Plymouth Prowler _ Its look _ open cockpit, open front wheels
capped with fenders _ screams Hot Rod. But it's not. It doesn't
have the requisite muscle. It behaves more like a sports car.
Still, it is eye-catching.
</P>
<P>
   Lexus GS400 _ Smooth, powerful, a sports sedan with one
troubling characteristic: a strange delayed response when you get
on the gas pedal to accelerate.
</P>
<P>
   The Viper RT/10 _ Scary when you first get in to drive. Wants to
leap ahead. Even the burble of the motor sends a warning chill
through you as you sit in the staging area. How will all this power
do on the turns? Had to be very careful, owing as much to my
unfamiliarity with the car as to any traits of its own. How will it
do on the straightaway? Came out of the banked turn at an
effortless 89 miles per hour, drifted up to the wall of the
straightaway and hit 127 before it was time to start slowing
(again, unfamiliarity played a role here) for the snap turn that I
knew was coming. This can be a dangerous car in the wrong hands.
Ask the guy who drove it not long after me, came off the road
course, and got into the gas too much. He fishtailed, spun, and hit
the wall. The Viper? Totaled.
</P>
<P>
   Volkswagen VR6 GTI _ A sure-footed screamer. Ate up the road
course with its front wheels grabbing for purchase all the way.
Good but not remarkable acceleration out of the banked raceway turn
and down the straightaway.
</P>
<P>
   Jaguar XK8 _ Great looking. Plenty of power on the straight.
Unsettling on the road course as it seemed to unweight up front in
sharp corners.
</P>
<P>
   Oldsmobile Allero _ For a $17,000 car (cheap these days) a truly
surprising drive. Throaty sound. Quick on the corners and stable,
too. Steady surge down the straightaway.
</P>
<P>
   Pontiac GTX Ram Air _ Think 1970s muscle car. Alto gurgle from
the exhaust. Tops 100 on the straightaway with not much effort. On
the road course, it reminds you why so many muscle cars and pony
cars got wrecked over the years not on big highways but on local
roads with sharp curves.
</P>
<P>
   Chevrolet Corvette _ Fancy pewter-colored job. Lots of power.
Stiff on the corners and feeling like the back wants to break away
at any moment. Powerful down the straightaway. But what's that
Subaru doing screaming by me as I hug the wall?
</P>
<P>
   Mitsubishi Eclipse _ Careful, the Mitsubishi guy told me as I
climbed in, don't want to knock my competitors, but this car, when
you punch the gas, responds immediately. I found it disappointing.
At 205 horsepower this buggy shouldn't bog the way it does. I felt
I was in the way of other drivers out there.
</P>
<P>
   Ford Mustang _ Pony car power. Pony car speed. A squeal through
every corner of the road course.
</P>
<P>
   Buick Regal _ Supercharged. 260 horses. Powerful, fairly fast,
but one unsettling quirk. You can drive this as an automatic or
shift it yourself. I chose to do my own shifting. Scorching down
the straightaway, I slowed, downshifted, and tried to power through
the first turn, stomping the gas in second gear. The car shiftedup
automatically, and what should have been a power-dig through the
turn became a soft, unsettling drift.
</P>
<P>
   Hyundai Tiburon _ The loneliest looking car in the pits. Sat
there unused most of the day. Inside, it's a knockoff of the Audi
TT's distinctive dimpled-chrome look. On the track, it was quick
and a better car than I expected.
</P>
<P>
   And finally, that Subaru 2.5 RS Imprezza all-wheel drive. Stiff
race suspension. Turbocharged. Racing seats so tight you had to be
surgically removed after a test drive. What a car. Screamed through
the road course, redlined most of the way. Second and third gear,
tops. Whipped out of the corner onto the big track and ran right up
to the wall, almost kissing it down the backstretch, eating up
pavement at well over 100 and snapping back onto the road course
without missing a beat.

BEAUTY RUNS DEEP, FAST IN HIGH-PERFORMANCE ACURA NSXT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROYAL FORD  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Acura NSX has always been a car out there on the periphery
of my interest.
</P>
<P>
   Great looking car. Heard it was fast. Heard it ate up tires.
</P>
<P>
   But like many people, when I heard the price _ approaching
$90,000 _ I tuned out, assuming that anything that costs that much
must, by definition, be of German or Italian manufacture.
</P>
<P>
   Shows you what I know.
</P>
<P>
   The Acura NSXT, a finely sculpted piece of sizzling aluminum,
belongs right up there among the finest high-performance sports
cars.
</P>
<P>
   It is incredibly fast, incredibly comfortable (slip into it and
you feel as if you're wearing the car), and impeccable in its
handling. And talk about delicate feel. You can sense even the
slightest changes in the texture of the road through your hands on
the wheel.
</P>
<P>
   This is a handcrafted car, and aluminum is used wherever
possible: aluminum unit body construction; all-aluminum engine,
aluminum suspension. Helps keep the car light (just over 3,000
pounds) for the nearly 300 horses that propel it. When they build
these at a special plant in Japan, each car is moved individually
from station to station. Acura will sell only about 500 of them in
the United States this year. That will be 500 lucky buyers.
</P>
<P>
   As I said, you wear this car when you sit in it. Inside, it's a
cocoon of leather: firm leather seats with strong thigh support and
flanges outside the legs and up each side of the back and
shoulders. Slam the door and you're in tight, with every seam of
leather _ dash, doors, seats _ finely stitched.
</P>
<P>
   Grab the leather steering and look around. Every gauge you need
while driving is right behind the wheel. A yoke, much like an
airplane yoke, sits behind the wheel, and that's where you'll find
the command center for lights, windshield wipers, and cruise
control.
</P>
<P>
   In a wonderful bit of ergonomics, the center console ramps down
from the dash toward the stick shift. On it are controls for the
audio system and climate. Buttons are minimal and four knobs, each
with a button at the middle and a pivoting wheel circling it,
control the basics of sound and climate. Punch the climate buttons
and you switch to automatic climate control or turn the fan off. To
change temperature, spin a wheel. To boost the fan, spin a wheel.
</P>
<P>
   Same with the audio. On-off and AM-FM are button-punches. Manual
tuning and volume are wheel-spins. In no time at all, you can run
this whole setup without taking your eyes off the road.
</P>
<P>
   Arm rests slant down on the doors from dash to back of the door
and in them are window, lock, and mirror controls and, ingeniously,
vents to better move the air through the cockpit.
</P>
<P>
   The view from that cockpit is racer-like: You see the fat bulges
of each front fender, but the hood virtually disappears and you are
looking at nothing but road straight ahead, aiming down the fenders
as though they are sights as you corner.
</P>
<P>
   At idle, the engine is deceptively quiet. But get on the gas at
speed _ say fourth gear on your way up to sixth _ and the rumble
from the engine behind you is deep and loud, remarkably so for a
car redlined at 8,000 rpms.
</P>
<P>
   The speedometer goes to 180. I did not go that fast. But the car
leaped ahead and then held its speed effortlessly when I did push
it. The 3.2-liter, DOHC, 24-valve V-6 never lagged, never
hesitated, never so much as complained. And the six-speed manual
shift is as nifty as I've enountered. Fast, smooth clicks up and
down the gears were simple. And with its high revs, shifting up and
down a lot in the NSX means you are driving it right.
</P>
<P>
   So you're wearing the car. You're driving it fast.
</P>
<P>
   How's it handle? Like it's on rails. Stiff, like a car of this
sort should be. It's got 4-wheel, aluminum, double-wishbone
suspension with gas-filled dampers and large antiroll bars front
and rear. Variable assist power steering and traction control (if
you want it) only add to the effect.
</P>
<P>
   It's got ABS for its four-wheel, ventilated disc brakes _ each
nearly a foot in diameter _ and they bring it down from high speeds
crisply and to sudden stops without a wobble.
</P>
<P>
   For the safety of driver and passenger, its got air bags, front
and rear crumple zones, and side-impact door beams.
</P>
<P>
   It sits very low, so getting in and out of the NSX can be an
adventure. But, hey, getting dressed in the morning can require
some contortions as well.
</P>
<P>
   And yes, what I had heard was true. It does, apparently, eat up
tires. A warning on the sales sticker says that the rear
high-performance tires may wear out in substantially less than
10,000 miles. But if you can afford almost $90,000 for a car,
what's a few extra tire purchases?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Nice Touches:
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --The soft, pleated leather sewn into the door panels where they
are scooped out for elbow room.
</P>
<P>
   --The air vents high in the armrests.
</P>
<P>
   --The paint is so rich and deep it looks like a pool you could
dive into.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Annoyances:
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --The pop-up headlights. They ruin the looks of the car when
they're up.
</P>
<P>
   --The lack of storage space inside: A wallet won't fit into the
center console, the glove compartment has been eaten up by the
airbag. The biggest available space is the ashtray built into the
dash. I'd do away with the ashtray and use even that little bit of
space for a storage compartment.
</P>
<P>
   --The $89 add-on cost for floor mats; $88,725 for a car, and
they want another $89 for floor mats. A joke, right? &QL;

TANG HORSES ARE OUT IN FULL FORCE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Pa.)   By WENDY MOONAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   According to the Chinese zodiac, this is not the Year of the
Horse. But it should be. Ancient Chinese horse sculptures are
showing up all over.
</P>
<P>
   There are four life-size terra-cotta chariot horses from the Qin
dynasty (221-207 B.C.) in ``The Golden Age of Chinese Archeology,''
a show at the National Gallery of Art in Washington that opened on
Sept. 19 and runs through Jan. 2. These horses, with ears forward
and nostrils dilated, are part of a group of 500 horses and
soldiers excavated from tombs in Shaanxi province in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   Ten horses from the Tang dynasty (618-906 A.D.) are among the
works in ``Abstraction and Reality: Chinese Art From the Warring
States to the Liao,'' which opened two days ago at the Chinese
Porcelain Company, a gallery at Park Avenue and 58th Street. Some
of the horses are glazed, in glorious blue, green, amber and cream,
with tasseled bridles and elaborate saddle blankets. Others are
unglazed, which makes them look modern to Western sensibilities.
</P>
<P>
   One unglazed pale taupe horse has its head raised, neighing.
Another twists its neck to catch a fly. Still another has its
muzzle to the ground. They are subtly modeled to catch the light
and create shadows.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are very rare models,'' said Jim Lally, who runs J.J.
Lally, at 41 East 57th St., and specializes in ancient Chinese art.
``The Tang was a moment in Chinese art when there was a strong move
toward realism and a strong decorative impulse. Horses imported
from the Near East were precious. In Tang China, the horse was the
emblem of wealth and power. They are meant to embody rank and
speed.''
</P>
<P>
   Lally, who sells Tang horse sculptures, currently has a classic
example in pale green glaze with an amber saddle cloth, for
$100,000.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, there is a herd of nine Tang horses for sale at E.&AMP;
J. Frankel Oriental Art at 1040 Madison Ave. and there are a few
more at the Alvin Lo Gallery, 5 East 57th St.
</P>
<P>
   China's love affair with the horse probably began in the Shang
dynasty (circa 1600 to 1100 B.C.), when real horses and human
charioteers were interred with Shang emperors. Initially, the
Chinese had only small, sturdy horses they used as draft animals.
After the Chinese were attacked by enemies riding larger, stronger
horses, they began importing horses from the Middle East, breeding
them and training them for warfare and sport.
</P>
<P>
   This all came together in the Tang dynasty. Mario Prodan wrote
in ``The Art of the Tang Potter'' (Viking, 1961), ``This is China's
moment of greatness, artistic, political, military and cultural.''
He continued, ``Whenever the Chinese dream of imitating nature, of
achieving the unbroken line, may have begun, it is certain that it
is at last fulfilled in the art of the Tang potter.''
</P>
<P>
   The horse was a favorite subject of these artists, but the horse
has always been a source of inspiration in China. Chinese composers
and poets wrote songs and poems about horses, and artists painted
them, carved their portraits in stone and created pottery
sculptures.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Tang pottery pieces are the most valued of Chinese horse
sculptures. They range in price from a few thousand dollars to
millions. Unlike jade, a Tang horse offers a buyer a certain
comfort level because thermoluminescence tests can prove its age
and fakes can be detected.
</P>
<P>
   The popularity of these works was proved again in Christie's New
York sale of Chinese sculpture on Sept. 16. One horse, which was
estimated to sell for $60,000 to $80,000, went for $266,500.
</P>
<P>
   Unglazed, it had its head lowered toward its left foreleg, which
was slightly raised. There was a grooved channel running the length
of the arched neck, where a real horsehair mane would have been
inserted, and there was a hole for a horsehair tail.
</P>
<P>
   An amber glazed horse with a textured fur saddle blanket glazed
green went for $310,000. It was not unlike one that Sotheby's
London sold in 1989 for the British Rail Pension Fund for $6.1
million, the world record for a Chinese work of art.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tang horses are the most widely popular image of Chinese
art,'' Lally said, ``because they are immediately accessible to
everyone. You don't have to read a book on Chinese art to love a
Tang horse.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the horses in the Chinese Porcelain Company show is a
cream-colored, glazed one decorated with splashes of cobalt blue.
Khalil Rizk, co-owner of the gallery, said: ``Only 5 percent of
Tang horses have blue glaze. Cobalt was put on during the last
firing. Cobalt was a treasured commodity imported from the Middle
East; it was more valuable than gold. Its use means the horse was
for someone of the highest rank.''
</P>
<P>
   This horse is 15 inches tall and turns its head to the left. It
has an ornamental harness and bridle. Originally, Rizk said, it
would have had bronze decorations as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Generally speaking, glazed horses used to be more sought
after, especially in Japan,'' Rizk said. ``But some horses were so
well sculpted they may have been deliberately left unglazed.''
</P>
<P>
   One unglazed horse at the show has bent its head back toward its
left shoulder in a natural pose. It would be considered a fine work
of art in any culture.
</P>
<P>
   The show continues through Oct. 28. Prices for the horses are
$35,000 to $2 million.
</P>
<P>
   CHAIRS WITH CURVES
</P>
<P>
   American antique chairs can have more curves than Marilyn
Monroe.
</P>
<P>
   As the American furniture sale at Christie's New York, set for
Thursday, approaches, Christie's experts are touting the virtues of
a high-style, finely carved Philadelphia mahogany side chair
commissioned by Gen. John Cadwalader about 1769. It is magnificent,
but the star of the sale may be Lot 185, a Queen Anne carved walnut
armchair that has been on display in the Diplomatic Reception Rooms
of the State Department for the last 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   The chair, circa 1740-1760, belongs to George G. Meade Easby, a
descendant of its original owner, Robert Waln, a Quaker merchant in
Philadelphia. It is a study in well-executed, bold S-curves.
</P>
<P>
   The arms have knuckle grips that look like fiddlehead ferns. The
cabriole legs have shells carved on the knees. The crest has double
scrolls, and the elbow rests are rounded and concave. The estimate
is $600,000 to $900,000.
</P>
<P>
   The chair is marked No. 1, and thought to be part of a set that
is represented in the Chipstone Foundation and the Kaufman
collection, two important American furniture repositories.
</P>
<P>
   The Queen Anne chair could be paired with a handsome Queen Anne
carved walnut games table, circa 1740, in Sotheby's sale of
American furniture next Friday. The table has rounded ``turret''
corners, carved shells on its knees, and claw and ball feet. The
estimate is $30,000 to $50,000. This pair could really make a
statement in the right environment.

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   On Saturday beginning at 3 p.m. Eastern standard time, millions
of people worldwide are expected to log on to their computers for a
seven-hour concert billed by its promoters as the largest Internet
event in history.
</P>
<P>
   The concert's Web site _ NetAid.org _ is poised to handle one
million hits per minute, delivering 125,000 streams of live video
per second of music megastars from David Bowie to Sheryl Crow
performing in New York, London, and Geneva.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, sites for the 1998 Winter Olympic games and World
Cup soccer matches were each configured to handle less than
one-tenth of the traffic expected for NetAid, which, in addition to
being a benefit for poverty eradication programs worldwide, is also
meant to be the ultimate test of the Internet's capacity.
</P>
<P>
   What's expected to keep NetAid's Webcast from melting under the
intense heat of unpredictable surges of traffic? The ``secret
sauce'' is a mathematical equation developed by professors and
students at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
</P>
<P>
   That equation, now embodied in a mindboggling computer program
tens of thousands of lines long, belongs to Akamai Technologies
Inc., a small startup nestled in Cambridge's Technology Square and
founded by MIT whizzes.
</P>
<P>
   Here's how it works. Traffic for any Web site is handled through
computers called servers that can be located anywhere. Generally,
however, each Web site's traffic and its servers are centrally
coordinated by a single traffic cop. Akamai's algorithm
dramatically multiplies the number of traffic cops by giving each
server the ability to direct data by independently calculating a
workable route. This helps to keep information flowing and prevent
flash crowds from crushing the site.
</P>
<P>
   Sounds simple. But the ability to accommodate uncontrollable,
unpredictable, massive flows of traffic is tremendously complex
because it involves an infinite number of constantly changing
variables.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, events such as the Victoria's Secret Webcast
fashion show in February and the Olympics site crumpled un-
</P>
<P>
   der the burden of unforeseen traffic.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, computer scientists have been stymied over the
problem of figuring out the best way to prevent crashes on the Web.
That dilemma prompted a conversation on the topic in 1995 between
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, and Tom
Leighton, a tenured math professor at MIT.
</P>
<P>
   As it turns out, the best answer is not the most perfect answer,
according to Paul Sagan, president of Akamai and a second cousin of
Carl Sagan, the late astronomer. So instead of relying on an
equation that required knowledge of all variables, the Akamai
network functions on computers that require a far more limited
amount of information to make routing decisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``A partial answer based on limited information works just as
well as a perfect answer based on all the information,'' Sagan
said. ``Now what you have is a global solution that can fix
Internet traffic problems now demonstrated in what will be the
largest Internet event ever.''
</P>
<P>
   So on Saturday, all hands will be on deck at Akamai for NetAid,
the most public test thus far of the company's abilities.
Technicians will huddle in Akamai's network operations center, a
room that resembles a NASA command control center. Filled with
about 30 monitors, the room's computers function as air-traffic
control for the entire Internet, monitoring data flows, checking on
the status of the Internet, and calculating the capacity of any
given node on the 'net _ all in real time. (On any given day,
Akamai's network manages Internet traffic flows for megasites such
as CNN, Yahoo!, and Go Network, sometimes steering as much as half
a billion hits in just 24 hours.)
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the concert, the NetAid site is set up to handle
1,000 donations per second in a virtual marriage of e-commerce and
entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   The site's sponsors, Cisco Systems Inc., Akamai, KPMG Peat
Marwick, and the United Nations Development Programme, won't say
how much money is likely to be raised to combat poverty. But every
dollar donated will go directly into a foundation, rather than be
used to help pay for the event. Cisco, which spearheaded the event
as a way to show off its technological prowess, is donating 1,500
servers housed in 90 data centers in 15 countries. Akamai will
donate its ``secret sauce,'' as Sagan puts it, to keep data flowing
at the Web site, which was desgined gratis by KPMG.
</P>
<P>
   The concert is expected to culminate in a simultaneous crooning
by dozens of pop artists of ``New Day,'' a song by Wyclef Jean and
Bono.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the scenes, making sure that Internet surfers catch every
note, will be Sagan and his crew of programmers. Asked what it was
like to be involved in the event, Sagan recalled a day in August
when the site was announced and he found himself sitting on a dais
for a press conference with Kofi Annan, secretary general of the
United Nations, rap musician Puff Daddy, and rock star David Bowie.
The glue for his brief conversations with the celebrities turned
out to be the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``The common ground, it turned out, wasn't politics or
Hollywood. It was the Internet,'' said a star-struck Sagan. ``It
was being Web-aware.''

 &HT;    MOST ELDERLY NOT TREATED FOR DEPRESSION
 &HT;    By SUE SCHULTZ
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Most of the nearly 2 million elderly Americans who
suffer from severe depression are not treated, the National
Institute of Mental Health reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Left untreated, depression has major implications for the
elderly, whose rates of suicide in 1996 were more than five times
the national average of 10.8 per 100,000 Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Depression often goes undetected because few people recognize
that it is a real, common, and diagnosable illness that can be
effectively treated,'' said Michael Faenza, president and chief
executive officer of the National Mental Health Association.
</P>
<P>
   Over all, 19 million Americans experience depression each year,
but the nation's senior citizens are the hardest hit. Only 10
percent of the elderly with depression receive treatment, Faenza
said.
</P>
<P>
   Seniors who suffer from heart disease, strokes, cancer, chronic
lung disease, arthritis, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease are
more likely to suffer from depression, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The elderly represent a population where the hidden symptoms
of depression can unfortunately be even further hidden behind other
illnesses that commonly occur with increasing age,'' Faenza said.
</P>
<P>
   Surgeon General David Satcher said that while the elderly make
up 13 percent of the nation's population, they account for 20
percent of all suicides.
</P>
<P>
   A report by the surgeon general showed that the highest rate of
suicide occurs in white males over the age of 85 and that suicide
rates tend to be higher among senior citizens who are divorced or
widowed. The report also found that nearly three-fourths of elderly
suicide victims had visited a doctor within a month before their
deaths.
</P>
<P>
   More than half of older Americans treated for mental illnesses
received care from general physicians, while 3 percent were treated
by mental health professionals, according to Faenza.
</P>
<P>
   The National Mental Health Association and other health
organizations offered educational meetings and screening sites
throughout the country at local senior centers, churches, and many
businesses Thursday, which was National Depression Screening Day.

`SENSATION' IN A CHILD'S EYES 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By CAROL VOGEL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ From the inception of ``Sensation: Young British
Artists From the Saatchi Collection,'' the Brooklyn Museum of Art
has planned extensive educational programs to explain to the public
_ and to schoolchildren _ what this show of young British artists'
work is all about.
</P>
<P>
   Although the museum always offers educational programs pegged to
specific exhibitions, given the provocative nature of ``Sensation''
and the fact that Mayor Rudolph Giuliani declared that the show
includes ``sick stuff'' and cut off the museum's financing,
decoding the art seems more important than ever.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to a comprehensive array of lectures and films with
artists, critics and curators, the museum also has what it calls
its ``Ask Me Team,'' volunteers, many of them graduate students in
art history, who are visible in the galleries wearing T-shirts that
say ``Ask Me'' on them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've never done this before,'' said Deborah Schwartz, the
museum's vice director for education and program development. ``But
this show just cried out for it.''
</P>
<P>
   In order to be part of the ``Ask Me Team,'' Ms. Schwartz said,
the volunteers were briefed by curators and made to read critical
articles pertaining to the artists' works. They discussed with
museum experts the kinds of questions they should expect and how to
respond.
</P>
<P>
   The curators also wrote different kinds of labels than they
would have for a tamer show. ``They're not the predictable
art-historical labels,'' Ms. Schwartz said. ``Besides giving the
background of the works, each label is riddled with questions that
throw the ball back in the viewer's court.''
</P>
<P>
   Educating educators is also part of the museum's agenda. On Oct.
21, it is holding an open house for college students and faculty to
explain the exhibition. So far, Ms. Schwartz said, the museum has
had a handful of high school groups scheduled to see the show and
have received inquiries from about 25 more schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just revving up,'' she said, adding that the museum makes
sure the teachers have seen either the exhibition or the catalog
before taking their classes. They have also drafted a letter for
teachers to send to parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a recommendation on how to deal with all of this,''
Ms. Schwartz said. ``Often schools want to take children to this
show to discuss the art, but some teachers are interested in seeing
it as a current affairs trip, given all they've read in the
newspaper.'' All school tours are guided by a museum educator.
</P>
<P>
   The museum is also implementing a student critics' program,
where interested high school students will have the chance to
explore the exhibition in an eight-week after-school course that
will teach them not only how to look at art, but also how to write
about it and criticize it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel these programs are particularly important,'' Ms.
Schwartz said. ``This is a special exhibition. It's not
`Impressionists in Winter.''' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A Test for Lead
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 27, the New York City Department of Health received a
complaint about ``144 Lead Squares'' a 1969 sculpture by the
minimalist artist Carl Andre that was displayed on view on the
Museum of Modern Art's third floor.
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 28, inspectors went to the museum to look at the piece
and performed what they called a ``dust wipe test.'' The test
revealed that the sculpture contained in excess of 1,000 micrograms
of lead per square foot, which could be dangerous if children
touched the sculpture and then put their hands in their mouthes.
</P>
<P>
   So the Health Department asked the Modern to change the label on
the sculpture, which had read, `This may be walked on.''
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Addison, the Modern's deputy director for marketing
and communications, said that after the inspection, curators
removed the label that had encouraged visitors to walk on the
sculpture and posted a guard nearby.
</P>
<P>
   After all the fuss, the museum closed the third floor as planned
so it could install ``Modern Starts: Places,'' a show that opens
later this month.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was in response to a mother and her child who were in the
museum,'' said Sandra Mullen, a spokeswoman for the health
department. ``Obviously we're in the business of monitoring
situations where lead dust could pose a hazard. We worked out an
agreeable solution with the museum.'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A Rauschenberg Gift
</P>
<P>
   The San Francisco Museum of Modern Art's recent acquisitions all
come from trustees. Except one: Robert Rauschenberg's ``Hiccups,''
a 1978 work consisting of 97 drawings on sheets of handmade paper
that extends nearly 63 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Although a collector had approached Arne Glimcher, Rauchenberg's
dealer, wanting to buy ``Hiccups,'' the artist gave the work to the
San Francisco museum in honor of its greatest benefactor, Phyllis
Wattis.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Wattis, a museum trustee, has helped the board buy countless
artworks. Most recently, she was the driving force that enabled the
institution to acquire Eva Hesse's ``Sans II,'' from 1968, and
``Cold Mountain 6 (Bridge),'' a 1989-91 painting by Brice Marden,
which comes from the artist's own collection.
</P>
<P>
   The museum has also been given a fractional gift of 19 works by
contemporary British artists. They are being given over time by
Vicki and Kent Logan, Bay Area collectors who have already donated
works from their vast contemporary art collection to the museum.
</P>
<P>
   Many artists that make up the gift are currently in the
``Sensation'' show at the Brooklyn Museum. Included in the group is
Damien Hirst's ``Philip (The Twelve Disciples),'' a 1994 work of a
skinned bull's head suspended in formaldehyde in a white-framed
vitrine.
</P>
<P>
   There are also works from other young British artists like
Tracey Emin, who is a finalist for this year's Turner Prize, along
with Gary Hume, Marc Quinn and Rachel Whiteread.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our focus on contemporary collecting remains rather intense,''
said David A. Ross, the museum's director. ``It's one area where we
can still compete with other museums.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Despite initial success, some films lose their
luster or fall in critics' eyes over time. Two recent remastered
DVD releases _ the 1939 ``Gulliver's Travels'' (WinStar; $19.99)
and the 1937 ``Lost Horizon'' (Columbia; $27.95) _ are good
examples.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gulliver'' was America's second fully animated color feature,
following Disney's 1937 ``Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.''
According to Tom Reich, the man behind the remastering of this 60th
anniversary version, ``Gulliver'' was the third-highest-grossing
picture of 1939, behind ``Gone With the Wind'' and ``The Wizard of
Oz,'' but since then has largely been forgotten. The cartoon
version of Jonathan Swift's tale was created by the Fleischer
brothers _ Max and Dave _ who were also behind Betty Boop and
Popeye.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Disney, who Reich considers always ``kiddie friendly,''
the Fleischer studios had more of an edge to their stuff _
especially with the Boop cartoons. ``The Fleischers had a New York
vaudeville sensibility,'' says Reich, ``while Disney had a
Midwestern one.'' This meant that the Fleischers' cartoons were
more adult and often had political and social relevance, which is
probably one of the reasons the brothers couldn't break Disney's
hold on the animation world. (They wouldn't be the last to fail.)
Reich believes it was just bad timing, since their second animated
feature, ``Mr. Bug Goes to Town,'' came out on Pearl Harbor Day.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly much of ``Gulliver's'' animation is impressive. Reich
points out that while ``A Bug's Life'' boasts how each blade of
grass moves due to the use of computers, ``Gulliver'' did the same
thing _ except that more than 700,000 frames were hand-drawn. And
Reich's remastering on the DVD, which also includes a number of
extras, is also impressive, with the color and sound seeming new.
</P>
<P>
   But the question remains whether ``Gulliver'' deserved to be
mostly ignored for the past 60 years, or is a forgotten
masterpiece. For my part, it falls somewhere in between, more a
technical wonder and part of film history than compelling. Still,
it's commendable that the film has been restored, and it deserves a
new look.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lost Horizon'' is a different story. Frank Capra's film has
been a staple of late shows, revival houses and cable channels for
years. But critics are split over its merit. Pauline Kael called it
``part popular adventure and part prissy, high-flown cracker-barrel
sentimentality.'' Others loved its spectacle. For Capra _ who is
best-known for his heartland comedies like ``It's a Wonderful
Life,'' ``Meet John Doe'' and ``Mr. Smith Goes to Washington'' _ it
was a way to present his vision of Utopia. And he did so with one
of the most lavish sets ever built in Hollywood up till that time.
</P>
<P>
   Much care was taken to restore ``Lost Horizon'' to its 1937
form. Some 24 minutes were trimmed during a World War II re-release
so that the film's pacifistic message wouldn't be as strong. Some
of those scenes were never recovered, but UCLA film preservationist
Robert Gitt managed to put back about seven minutes of missing
scenes.
</P>
<P>
   The DVD also includes an alternative ending, three deleted
scenes, photo documentary with narration by historian Kendall
Miller and restoration commentary by film critic Charles Champlin
and Gitt.
</P>
<P>
   While ``Lost Horizon'' has a number of things to recommend it _
especially performances by Ronald Colman and Sam Jaffe _ it's not
Capra at his best. It's too ponderous at times. Capra was better at
making statements in comedies.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Gitt deserves credit for restoring ``Lost Horizon,'' and
the DVD with all its extras is a wonderful treat for film buffs.
</P>
<P>
   This leads us to wonder why we aren't seeing more DVDs like
``Gulliver'' and ``Lost.'' Earlier this year, MGM released the 1951
Oscar-winning film ``An American in Paris'' on DVD ($24.99). It is
essentially the same as the VHS version. It was not remastered, nor
is there any commentary. Directed by Vincent Minnelli, starring
Gene Kelly and filled with music by the Gershwins, it was
essentially Kelly's attempt to turn the filmed dance number into
high art. The 17-minute ballet sequence toward the film's end is
breathtaking. Considering that MGM put out ``That's
Entertainment,'' it would seem like they would have plenty of stuff
in their vaults to add.
</P>
<P>
   So while it's great that ``Gulliver'' and ``Lost'' were
remastered, hopefully, studios will take time to remaster films
that deserved it, like ``An American in Paris.'' &QL;

   Final Bow? Not for Now &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The end, it seems, is not quite nigh for ``Epic
Proportions.''
</P>
<P>
   At first glance, things didn't look good for the Larry
Coen-David Crane comedy that opened last week at the Helen Hayes
Theater.
</P>
<P>
   The play, about the filming of a 1930s biblical epic, received
some scathing reviews, a lukewarm box office during previews and
speculation was rife that the intermission had been cut to keep
audiences from fleeing.
</P>
<P>
   But this week its producers were maintaining a beatific outlook,
saying that those expecting a quick exit would be disappointed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely not,'' said Mark Schwartz, a producer, when asked
if the show would close soon. ``We have no intention of closing at
all. We have every indication that we'll run.''
</P>
<P>
   Chief among the positive signs that Schwartz cited are the
consistent increase in daily sales, or wraps, from about $18,000 on
Oct. 1, the day after opening, up to about $26,000 on Tuesday.
While those figures are peanuts by Broadway standards, Schwartz
says they signal a strong word of mouth for the show.
</P>
<P>
   Good television reviews and kind words from Rosie O'Donnell were
helping the box office, he said, as was Crane's reputation as a
creator of the television show ``Friends.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If we'd gone the other way, if we took any steps backward,
that would be a signal to worry,'' Schwartz said. ``But that didn't
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Also in the show's favor, he said, is a low running cost _ about
$130,000 a week _ plus generally fawning reviews for Kristin
Chenoweth, the show's star. (A review in Variety described her as
``charm incarnate.'')
</P>
<P>
   The good spin notwithstanding, the Broadway community doesn't
seem to be betting on ``Proportions.'' Martin Markinson, who owns
the theater, said that the day the play's reviews came out he was
approached by at least half a dozen producers looking for homes for
their shows if ``Proportions'' closed.
</P>
<P>
   ``But there's no indication to me at all that they're leaving,''
he said. ``They seem to be sticking around.''
</P>
<P>
   A Space Problem
</P>
<P>
   Things were not so upbeat for the thriller ``Voices in the
Dark,'' the first show of the season and its first casualty; it
will close on Sunday. Like the ``Proportions'' people, the
producers of ``Voices'' said they had hoped their play would
overcome its generally poor reviews with good word of mouth. That
didn't happen. Crews will start striking the play's hot tub, fake
snow and stage blood on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The closing makes the Longacre Theater available and by all
accounts a strong contender for the theater is ``Jar the Floor,''
Cheryl West's comedy about four generations of African-American
women.
</P>
<P>
   The play finished a monthlong run at Second Stage in
mid-September, and the producer, Elizabeth McCann, is to meet with
the Longacre's owner, the Shubert Organization, next week. Ms.
McCann was making no predictions, but said on Wednesday that she
had ``a sneaking hunch'' the play would get a green light.
</P>
<P>
   But Broadway was not the first choice. Ms. McCann had approached
the Promenade, which is Off Broadway, but that theater was promised
to ``If Memory Serves,'' a play by Jonathan Tolins.
</P>
<P>
   ``And there aren't any other Off Broadway theaters available,''
Ms. McCann said.
</P>
<P>
   That is a complaint echoing across the city, as producers
scramble to shift well-reviewed, good-selling shows to larger
spaces.
</P>
<P>
   In the East Village, for example, ``Do You Come Here Often?,''
by the British comedy duo the Right Size, will close at Performance
Space 122 this weekend. Despite positive response from ticket
buyers and critics, a transfer to another theater has not
materialized.
</P>
<P>
   Ben Sprecher, owner of the Promenade and Variety Arts and
manager of the Lucille Lortel, said there were a dozen shows
financed and ready to go that could not find theaters.
</P>
<P>
   And that even with new spaces emerging. The Salon, a 270-seat
house at 49 Bleecker Street in Greenwich Village, opened last month
with an adaptation of ``Tale of Two Cities.'' The theater was built
over the summer in a space previously occupied by a lumberyard. In
November it will be home to the performance group Squonk, which
finished a successful run at Performance Space 122 in August.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some veterans of the Off Broadway scene say a surfeit
does not guarantee satisfaction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is there an enormous glut of shows?'' said Alan Schuster, the
manager of three Off Broadway theaters. ``Yes, but not quality
shows. If I had empty theaters, I wouldn't be rushing to book
them.''
</P>
<P>
   And She Bakes
</P>
<P>
   Well, just call her Betty Crocker.
</P>
<P>
   For the last month, Amy Sedaris has been serving double duty on
the set of ``The Country Club,'' Douglas Carter Beane's play at the
Greenwich House Theater. First, she acts. Then, every night after
the show, she helps to sell her homemade vanilla cupcakes in the
lobby.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's great,'' Ms. Sedaris said, in her typically high (OK,
atmospheric) spirits. ``And I go home with 25 bucks in my pocket.''
</P>
<P>
   It is this kooky comic demeanor that Ms. Sedaris is channeling
into the character of Froggy, an uptight, unhinged party planner.
In particular, critics have adored Ms. Sedaris' use of her jaw,
which juts and ruts throughout her performance. ``It's called ...
`mugging,''' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The role is a departure for Ms. Sedaris, who generally performs
in shows written by herself and her brother, the writer David
Sedaris.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm so used to making it all up in my head,'' she said. ``This
is like, `No pressure.'''
</P>
<P>
   She leaves the show on Oct. 23 to continue work on her Comedy
Central show, ``Strangers With Candy,'' in which she plays a
46-year-old high schooler. She says she'll miss the play. ``It's
nice,'' she said. ``I get to wear clothes that fit me and play a
grown-up.''
</P>
<P>
   A Hit
</P>
<P>
   A candidate for Off Broadway's first commercial hit of the
season: ``The Vagina Monologues,'' Eve Ensler's one-woman show,
which opened on Sunday on the downstairs stage at the Westside
Theater. The advance has topped $200,000, said David Stone, the
show's producer.  &QL;

 &HT;    Family business ranks high on 'Forbes' 500
 &HT;    By Fred Cohen
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TULSA _ Based in Wichita, Kan., Koch Industries is the
second-largest privately held company in the United States, after
Cargill. According to a December article in Forbes magazine, it is
a $35 billion business with estimated profits of $700 million. The
company ranks 18th on the Forbes 500, right behind Chevron, Procter
&AMP; Gamble and DuPont.
</P>
<P>
   The company's main business is oil and gas. It has refineries in
Corpus Christi, Texas, and near St. Paul, Minn., and is among the
world's largest oil traders. It is also produces chemicals, asphalt
and building materials. Koch Beef Co has 12,000 head of cattle on
450,000 acres. Last year Koch Industries bought Purina Mills Inc.,
which had $1.2 billion in sales of animal feed.
</P>
<P>
   Koch Industries employs 16,000 people worldwide and practices a
philosophy it calls Market Based Management.In contrast to
traditional military style command-and-control management, this
system encourages employees to think like business owners _ with
bonuses that can reach seven figures, according to Forbes.
</P>
<P>
   The Forbes article said all voting stock in the company is held
by two of Fred Koch's four sons _ Charles of Wichita, the company's
chairman and CEO, and David of Palm Beach, its executive vice
president _ and by Houston investor E. Pierce Marshall.
</P>
<P>
   Koch Industries was founded by Fred C. Koch, who, in the 1920s,
invented a process for increasing the amount of gasoline that could
be extracted from crude oil. Refiners with competing technologies
filed 40 suits against him alleging patent infringement. Although
he won them all, he could not do business in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   He went to the Soviet Union, where he helped modernize 15
refineries _ and witnessed Stalin's purges, in which several
Russians he had worked with were killed.
</P>
<P>
   He returned to the United States a staunch anti-communist and
became a founding member of the John Birch Society. He founded the
Rock Island Oil and Refining Co. in 1940 and turned control of the
company over to his son Charles in 1961. After he died in 1967,
Charles renamed the company Koch Industries.

HOME VIDEO: FOR HALLOWEEN, UNIVERSAL STUDIOS HORROR, OLD AND NEW

   It Was Dark And Stormy. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Call it horror for the whole family. ``For the collector and the
nostalgia buff, we've got these classic monsters,'' said Craig
Kornblau, president of Universal Studios Home Video. ``For the
broad audience we've got `The Mummy,' and then we have a new
direct-to-video title, `Alvin and the Chipmunks Meet Frankenstein,'
for the kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Video has opened the Halloween spigot. From New Line comes a DVD
set of all seven ``Nightmare on Elm Street'' films; from Anchor
Bay, John Carpenter's ``Halloween'' (1978) and Sam Raimi's ``Army
of Darkness'' (1993). From Artisan there are ``The Blair Witch
Project'' and ``Curse of the Blair Witch Project,'' the 44-minute
fictional documentary, a hit on the Sci-Fi Channel, that follows up
on the disappearance of the three filmmakers in the original film.
</P>
<P>
   Universal's Classic Monster Collection (on tape, no DVD)
includes ``Dracula'' (1931), ``The Wolf Man'' (1941), ``Phantom of
the Opera'' (1943), ``Creature From the Black Lagoon'' (1954),
``The Invisible Man'' (1933), ``The Mummy'' (of 1932 and not to be
confused with the 1999 ``Mummy'' mentioned above by Kornblau, which
is currently a best seller), ``Frankenstein'' (1931) and ``The
Bride of Frankenstein'' (1935).
</P>
<P>
   The last three films starred Boris Karloff. ``He was the typical
English gentleman,'' said his daughter, Sara Karloff, this week.
``Well educated, articulate, very conservative in his life style, a
very gentle human being.'' One of Karloff's last films was Peter
Bogdanovich's ``Targets'' (1968), about a horror star who quits
because he and his films can't compete with real life. ``There was
more horror on the streets than on screen,'' Ms. Karloff said.
</P>
<P>
   Karloff's 1930s horror, of course, reflected a gentler time, and
horror then and now mix interestingly in this Halloween's video
releases. ``There wasn't the promotion of violence then,'' Ms.
Karloff said. ``I would wonder about the longevity of some of
today's films 65 years later.'' However that works out, today's
horror, perhaps best exemplified by ``The Blair Witch Project,'' is
definitely of the moment. ``The classics aren't getting a new
audience,'' said critic Joe Kane, a student of the genre and editor
of the magazine Phantom of the Movies' Videoscope. ``There's
another generation now that's ripe for a certain kind of horror.
It's horror about them.''
</P>
<P>
   He dates the movement to ``Scream'' in 1996. ``We've gone to
youth horror, away from Gothic into this kind of out-there-alone
horror for a sheltered generation,'' he said. This is youth brought
up by the media, for whom reality is scary and unreal to begin
with. Fiction and nonfiction tend to blur as they do with the Blair
witch tale. ``It's sort of a mood almost,'' Kane said.
</P>
<P>
   Often it leads to extreme violence. ``I just close my eyes,''
Ms. Karloff said. ``I don't have to ride on outside elevators, and
I don't have to have to be discomfited in a movie theater.''

   Suggesting a down-market offshoot of James Cameron's
blockbuster, Bigas Luna's film actually stays ashore. An
impoverished foundry worker named Horty (Olivier Martinez) goes to
Southampton, England, to watch the Titanic depart. At his hotel he
is approached by a beautiful young French chambermaid (Aitana
Sanchez Gijon, above) from the ship who needs a place to stay
before embarkation. Later in his room she tries to seduce him, but
he refuses. After the sinking, though, his recollection of that
night takes on such embroidered proportions that it draws crowds
and eventually becomes a theater production. Stephen Holden wrote
in the New York Times that the movie ``never finds a visual
vocabulary to match the elegance of its ideas.'' &QL;

High School (somewhere around Seattle). Yes, it's an adolescent
turn for Shakespeare's Kate, and in this taming she'll finally
succumb to a local rogue named Patrick Verona (Heath Ledger). Until

   THE EMPEROR'S SHADOW
</P>
<P>
   After an assassination attempt, the Chinese Emperor Ying Zheng
(Jiang Wen) orders that everyone within three miles of his retinue
be put to death. Of another bent entirely is Gao Jianli (Ge You),
Ying's boyhood friend and a musical genius who is opposed to any
form of violence. Ying would like to make Gao his court composer,
but Gao would rather die. Faced with an intractable power struggle,
``this heaving, nostril-flaring historical drama asks big questions
about imperial ambition and art, about the value of friendship
versus loyalty to one's principles'' (Holden).

   JUST A LITTLE HARMLESS SEX
</P>
<P>
   Out of their customary sitcom setting, the travails of 20- and
30-somethings reach for a movie twist. After a night in a topless
bar, Alan (Robert Mailhouse) is driving home to his wife (Alison
Eastwood) when he gives a lift to a woman with car problems. She
turns out to be a prostitute and gives him oral sex. He gets
arrested and the film settles in for the battle between him and his
wife and his friends and her friends. ``But on the big screen,
`Just a Little Harmless Sex' looks like just a little more
television'' (Lawrence Van Gelder).

   1999. PM. $102. 98 minutes. R. Release date: Oct. 12.

   THE INHERITORS
</P>
<P>
   A somber rural allegory with the palette and compositional sense
of the Dutch masters, Stefan Ruzowitzky's film creates an
interesting situation when a landowner in the 1930s leaves his
property divided among seven workers who have labored on it. As if
organizing themselves into a new order weren't enough of a problem,
a mysterious old lady turns up. But, Janet Maslin wrote in The New
York Times, ``what starts out as an arrestingly sharp film with
strong political undercurrents winds up increasingly unfocused as
it goes along.'' 1998. Columbia Tri-Star. $99.36. 93 minutes.
Closed captioned. Release date: Tuesday.

<P>
   LADIES AND GENTLEMEN . . . MR. LEONARD COHEN

NEW &AMP; NOTABLE: ANNE STEPHENSON'S BOOK REVIEWS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BY ANNE STEPHENSON  
 c.1999 Special for The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here are Anne Stephenson's capsule book reviews:
</P>
<P>
   ``OLD MAN IN A BASEBALL CAP'' &QL; 
By Fred Rochlin (HarperCollins, $20)
</P>
<P>
   Fred Rochlin was born and raised in Nogales, Ariz. In 1942, when
he was 19, he went to Italy with the Army Air Forces and became
navigator on a B-24 bomber, flying hideously dangerous missions
over Germany. He survived (many of his crewmates did not), and
after the war, he moved to California and became an architect,
husband and father. Years passed, until in 1994, at age 70, Rochlin
took a storytelling workshop with actor/author Spalding Gray
(``Swimming'' ``to Cambodi''a). The result is this memoir _ a
collection of stories about what happened to Rochlin during World
War II _ and a one-man show of the same name, which Rochlin has
performed in cities throughout California. There's no great finesse
to the way these stories are written nor is there any sign that
Rochlin pulls punches in offering his memories of a war that was
fought by young men in circumstances that were often as surreal as
they were horrifying. New &AMP; Notable read the book in one sitting,
which was a mistake because each story is better when it is taken
on its own terms. Some contain simple scenes that steal the thunder
of any philosophical questions that Rochlin raises. His description
of his participation in the emergency delivery of an Italian baby
is funny, moving and far more effective than the young Rochlin's
subsequent discussion with an American medic about the insanity of
war. The best moments are mere flashes _ of a young man far from
home, staying alive while his friends die and craving women,
craving sleep and doing what he's told. Today that soldier is an
old man in a baseball cap, and he has stories to tell. &QL; 
 &QL; 
``BLUE DOG MAN'' &QL; 
By George Rodrigue &UR; (STC, $50) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Explain it to us. What do you see in this little blue dog? We
know what Rodrigue sees. Dollar signs. Easy Street. He was an
established artist in Louisiana before he began painting Blue Dog
15 years ago (inspired, he says, by his deceased terrier, Tiffany,
who was black and white _ go figure), but nothing brought in the
paying customers like this stunned-looking little yipper. The
financial power of Blue Dog has become legendary: A Japanese buyer
is said to have paid $250,000 for one canvas (they start at
$10,000). Whoopi Goldberg owns one. Tom Brokaw owns one. YOU can't
own one unless you have a spare fortune sitting around, BUT YOU CAN
BUY THIS BOOK. It contains 70 new Blue Dog paintings as well as a
Blue Dog mask and some Blue Dog postcards, and darned if the dog
doesn't look pretty much the same in all of them. She is, after
all, a visual mantra, a prop dropped into changing circumstances.
The paintings are paired with Rodrigue's schlocky, autobiographical
narration, in which he tries to impart some mystical meaning to
Blue Dog and to his art. ``Deep in Blue Dog's eyes,'' he writes,
``will always lurk the hopes and longings of a melancholy people,
but, like the Cajuns, who always trained their eyes on the future,
Blue Dog must move forward.'' We don't get it, and from the look in
Blue Dog's eyes, we'd say she doesn't either. &QL; 
``THE CODE BOOK'' &QL; 
By Simon Singh (Doubleday, $24.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Singh (``Fermat's Enigma'') provides an irresistible opportunity
at the end of this volume about codes and their role in history: He
invites readers to try ``The Cipher Challenge,'' a 10-stage
progression of ciphers that will test your code-cracking skills.
The first person to submit correct answers to all stages of the
cipher will win a $15,000 prize offered by Singh, who is apparently
using his own money. As you might guess, triumph will not come
easy. Singh anticipates it will take up to a year for a winner to
emerge (New &AMP; Notable was out of the running early, left utterly
confused by the contest rules). The rest of Singh's book is
challenging reading but fascinating. He includes a section on the
Navajo code talkers of World War II, whose code was one of the very
few in history never broken. Singh also details the work of Alan
Turing, a mathematical genius whose contributions as a code breaker
during World War II were unparalleled. As with that of the code
talkers, Turing's work was kept secret for years. And although the
Navajo men eventually were honored for their efforts, Turing never
received the recognition he deserved. Instead he was persecuted for
his homosexuality, and he committed suicide at age 46. Singh traces
the human drama of secret writing from ancient Greek military
espionage to present-day computer science. Code breakers, he says,
are ``literary alchemists, a mystical tribe attempting to conjure
sensible words out of meaningless symbols.' &QL; 
 &QL; 
``POP GOES THE WEASEL'' &QL; 
By James Patterson &UR; (Little, Brown, $26.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This, we'd guess, is how James Patterson starts a novel: He
imagines the worst possible thing that can be done to a human body,
then assigns a villain to the task. In this book, there are lots of
bodies. Patterson must be exhausted. If violent death disturbs you,
it helps to imagine Morgan Freeman as Patterson's deeply moral,
likable hero, Detective Alex Cross (Freeman played Cross in the
film version of Patterson's ``Kiss the Girls''). Here Cross
investigates a series of murders and proposes marriage to his lady
friend, Christine. We know the villain is Geoffrey Shafer, a
British diplomat with a wealthy and connected wife, a computer and
a taste for what he likes to call ``fantasy murder.'' We also know
that Christine is at risk. Far be it from us to tell you what
happens, but we bet you can guess. Patterson will sign books at two
Valley stores on Oct. 27 _ the Poisoned Pen in Scottsdale and
Waldenbooks &AMP; more at 302 E. Bell Road in Phoenix. Watch the Books
calendar for details. &QL;

SHANNON'S SCHOOLGIRL STRIKES UNIVERSAL CHORD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAULA NECHAK  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Finally, a comedy for lapsed Catholics. ``Superstar'' finds
laughs in the trauma and ordeal of Catholic school, its repression
and, most of all, its bad plaid uniforms.
</P>
<P>
   Molly Shannon reprises her ``Saturday Night Live'' character,
plain Jane Irish Catholic school girl Mary Katherine Gallagher, who
energetically dreams of being a superstar and receiving her very
first grown-up kiss in this often hilarious, always yearning vision
of adolescence.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Katherine knows she is destined for something better than
the confines of her small town.
</P>
<P>
   Nightly she flops into bed breathily whispering ``superstar'' as
she hits the mattress. She practices kissing with the corner stop
sign and the big tree on her Catholic high school campus.
</P>
<P>
   It's at the local video store, where she works part time as a
rewinder, that Mary Katherine's big screen dreams originate.
</P>
<P>
   Lost in the splendor of Hollywood with its epic, grand romances
and satisfying tales of high school vengeance in films like
``Carrie,'' Mary Katherine redefines her own life.
</P>
<P>
   And when she spies campus jock Sky (Will Ferrell), she knows
he's the one she wants for that initiating kiss.
</P>
<P>
   But Sky's popular, pretty girlfriend, Evian (Elaine Hendrix),
stands in the way. And lurking in the wings is a mysterious
stranger who rides into town on a Harley (Harland Williams) and who
has a tie to Mary Katherine's murky past.
</P>
<P>
   Director Bruce McCulloch, who made his directorial debut with
``Dog Park'' and his mark in comedy as a part of the troupe Kids In
the Hall, pushes all the irreverent buttons to keep ``Superstar''
just a bit on the edge while still exploring the sweet fantasies of
every misfit, guilt-laden Catholic school girl.
</P>
<P>
   Molly Shannon, who created the character when she attended New
York University, gives Mary Katherine a spine of steel that allows
her to break free from her soft-spoken, insecure veneer.
</P>
<P>
   There are the predictable lags in ``Superstar,'' the result of
taking a ``skit'' that works well within a 3-minute TV segment and
trying to flesh it out into a feature film.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly everything that doesn't deal directly with Mary Katherine
herself _ such as her life with her grandmother, played by veteran
actress Glynis Johns _ feels tacked on, incidental and unfunny.
</P>
<P>
   While fellow ``Saturday Night Live'' actor Ferrell (``A Night At
the Roxbury'') helps with his prissy characterization of a popular
jock, it's Shannon who reigns over the 80-minute running time.
</P>
<P>
   Her Mary Katherine is so full of belief in herself, and so
unwilling to give up despite obstacles galore, that she moved the
preview audience (mostly female) to interact and talk back to the
screen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Superstar'' strikes a universal chord, no matter what rung of
the popularity ladder we were on in high school.
</P>
<P>
   Superstar. Directed by Bruce McCulloch. Written by Steven Wayne
Koren. Cast: Molly Shannon, Will Ferrell, Elaine Hendrix, Harland
Williams. Paramount Pictures. 82 minutes. Rated PG-13 for sexual
content.
</P>
<P>

   WIRED-CITIES _ Atlanta ranks fifth among the nation's most

specialists at Ohio State University. The other top five cities, in
order, are Washington, Chicago, Dallas, and New York The rest of
the top ten are San Jose, Los Angeles, Houston, San Francisco and
Phoenix. Researchers measured accessibility by the number of
Internet connections to and from each city through 31 major
commercial Internet backbones, ranging from giants like AT&AMP;T and
Sprint as well as ISPs like Mindspring. Cities with the most
connections were rated as most accessible. According to the survey,
``In general, cities with more linkages to the Internet backbone
will have faster access and more reliable connections to global
information. This enhanced access results in a comparative
advantage will grow in importance with the continuing global
computerization of information.'' (Holsendolph, Atlanta

 &HT;    Damage report: Islands bouncing back

<P>
   NASSAU _ The Bahamas' colonial capital is quiet now.
</P>
<P>
   Hurricane Floyd's 150-plus-mph winds have ceased; the seas are
as calm as a lake, and at most hotels it's business as usual,
although the pools and beaches are far from crowded.
</P>
<P>
   But evidence of Floyd's visit Sept. 14 is everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   White sand, heaved onto land by a 15-foot ocean surge, was
shoveled off West Bay Street and piled 2 feet high along the sides
of the road, like snow on a Minnesota winter day.
</P>
<P>
   Trees with 5-foot-thick trunks, ripped out of the ground and
flung into front yards and parking lots, wait to be hauled off.
Most standing trees are stripped of leaves.
</P>
<P>
   On the popular esplanade west of Arawak Cay, sunbathers have to
walk around two freighters and a fishing boat that were tossed onto
the beach.
</P>
<P>
   But the bumper-to-bumper traffic is back on downtown Bay Street,
the straw market is open, and the yachts are docked in the marinas.
</P>
<P>
   Most hotels had landscape and cosmetic damage, and many had
minor roof damage, but only the Sheraton Grand is closed until next
year.
</P>
<P>
   Atlantis, the country's largest resort, is open, but the
resort's exclusive Ocean Club, hideout for celebrities such as
Denzel Washington and the setting for Cindy Crawford's wedding,
won't open until Dec. 22. Hotel officials say there was no
structural damage but a lot of downed trees and some beach erosion.
</P>
<P>
   Usually 90 percent full, Atlantis had plenty of rooms available
in all price categories last week, but there were no discounts, and
rooms were being filled for the weeks ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Compass Point, the exuberantly colored complex of cottages 12
miles west of town, was open, and rooms were booked. Some of the
cottages had saltwater damage but have been repaired.
</P>
<P>
   At Cable Beach, the Radisson and Marriott resorts were welcoming
conventions into their ballrooms, and the casino had plenty of
business.
</P>
<P>
   The Yoga Retreat on Paradise Island is open, but there was
substantial damage to the dock and to some of the cabins on the
beach.
</P>
<P>
   The only problem during my visit was an aborted trip on the new
Bahamas Fast Ferries' 177-passenger catamaran that makes daily
trips from Nassau to Eleuthera and Harbour Island. We had to turn
back because the debris in the ocean caused problems in one of the
engines.
</P>
<P>
   All cruise ships have returned to Nassau, and duty-free shops
are filled with passengers buying liquor, perfume and jewelry.
</P>
<P>
   Paradise Island Airport closed the day before the hurricane hit
and will not reopen. Sun International, owner of the airport, plans
to build condominiums on the site of the runways and terminal.
Nassau International Airport is open and busy.
</P>
<P>
   The only inconvenience tourists may experience is the noise
workmen make as they repair roofs and railings. The phone service
is working, but lines are often busy, and some hotel swimming pools
are being resurfaced.
</P>
<P>
   When making reservations, ask about the extent of the work being
done.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   ISLAND BY ISLAND
</P>
<P>
   Most of the Bahamas Out Islands had little damage from Hurricane
Floyd, although power and phone service are a problem in many
places.
</P>
<P>
   The Abacos were extremely damaged, and Eleuthera and Harbour
Island were damaged, although not as bad as when Hurricane Andrew
swept through in 1992 and took the roofs off most of the houses.
</P>
<P>
   Here is an island-by-island update.
</P>
<P>
   GRAND BAHAMA ISLAND AND FREEPORT
</P>
<P>
   The airport was flooded for several days following Hurricane
Floyd but is open to emergency flights, domestic flights and small
aircraft. Parts of the island are still without phone service, but
power has been restored.
</P>
<P>
   Most hotels and resorts, including the big Bahamas Princess and
the newly renovated Lucayan Hotel, are up and running. The only
damage was downed trees and landscape burned by wind and saltwater.
The Royal Islander hotel is still being evaluated.
</P>
<P>
   The Island Palm Resort had some roof damage, but all facilities
are open to guests.
</P>
<P>
   A few of the island's beaches were eroded.
</P>
<P>
   ABACOS
</P>
<P>
   Parts of the Abacos islands had extreme damage, and reports are
still coming in. Both airports are open.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly all hotels are closed. The goal for most inns and resorts
is to be open by Nov. 15, but the millennium is the most important
target because every room is booked.
</P>
<P>
   The phones are still down, and there is no electricity in
Hopetown. All hotels that are open are operating on generators.
</P>
<P>
   The Abaco Beach Resort is open but is filled with work crews.
</P>
<P>
   These hotels and inns had little damage and are open to guests:
The Ambassador Motel, D's Guest House, Island Breezes Motel, and
Marsh Harbour Airport Inn in Marsh Harbour; Hopetown Hideaways,
Turtle Hill Cottages and the Dolphin Beach Hotel in Hopetown; and
Walker's Cay Hotel in Walker's Cay.
</P>
<P>
   BIMINI
</P>
<P>
   This small island had little or no damage. All hotels are open.
</P>
<P>
   CAT ISLAND
</P>
<P>
   Both airports are open, but the island still has no power or
phone service.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the hotels are still being evaluated. Most hotels are
closed except for Hawksnest Resort.
</P>
<P>
   CROOKED ISLAND
</P>
<P>
   Information is still coming in. The two main hotels, Crooked
Island Beach Inn and Pittstown Landings, are closed. The extent of
the damage is being evaluated.
</P>
<P>
   ELEUTHERA
</P>
<P>
   The airport at North Eleuthera is open, as is the Governor's
Harbour airport although the customs and immigration building was
damaged. The Rock Sound airport is closed and being evaluated.
</P>
<P>
   The town of Governor's Harbour had severe damage, and the Glass
Window bridge is impassable.
</P>
<P>
   The Club Med here is closed until Nov. 13. Most hotels are
closed but slated to reopen in October and November. The hotels and
resorts that are open include Cambridge Villas, the Duck Inn, the
Tuckaway Hotel and Ethel's Cottages.
</P>
<P>
   HARBOUR ISLAND
</P>
<P>
   The island, which was hit hard by Hurricane Andrew in 1992, had
damage to houses, hotels and roads.
</P>
<P>
   Some hotels, including the Coral Sand Hotels, the Dunmore Beach
Hotel and the Pink Sands Hotel, had little damage but are closed
for seasonal maintenance and will open at the end of this month.
</P>
<P>
   Romora Bay Hotel is open. Valentine's Resort and Marina had
severe damage and has extended its regular seasonal closing from
October until Jan. 15.
</P>
<P>
   The 3-mile-long, pink beach, made of crushed coral, is intact,
with little erosion.
</P>
<P>
   INAGUA
</P>
<P>
   Far from Hurricane Floyd's winds, this island had no damage. The
Crystal Beach View Hotel is open for guests.
</P>
<P>
   SAN SALVADOR
</P>
<P>
   The Club Med Resort had some damage and will be closed until
today. The Riding Rock Inn also was damaged and is scheduled to
open by the end of October.
</P>
<P>
   LONG ISLAND
</P>
<P>
   The airport at Stella Maris is open, and power and phone service
have been restored to the island. All roads and harbors are open.
</P>
<P>
   The Stella Maris Resort and the Cape Santa Maria Beach Resort
had no major damage and are open to guests.
</P>
<P>
   EXUMA
</P>
<P>
   The airport at Georgetown is open; the island has power, and
phone service is being restored.
</P>
<P>
   Most hotels had no damage except for Club Peace and Plenty,
which lost some of its dock. The Palms at Three Sisters Hotel had
minimal damage and is expected to open today.

   WIRED-CITIES _ Atlanta ranks fifth among the nation's most
Internet-accessible cities, and thus is well-positioned to grow
economically in the coming years, according to a study by geography
specialists at Ohio State University. The other top five cities, in
order, are Washington, Chicago, Dallas, and New York The rest of
the top ten are San Jose, Los Angeles, Houston, San Francisco and
Phoenix. Researchers measured accessibility by the number of
Internet connections to and from each city through 31 major
commercial Internet backbones, ranging from giants like AT&AMP;T and
Sprint as well as ISPs like Mindspring. Cities with the most
connections were rated as most accessible. According to the survey,
``In general, cities with more linkages to the Internet backbone
will have faster access and more reliable connections to global
information. This enhanced access results in a comparative
advantage will grow in importance with the continuing global
computerization of information.'' (Holsendolph, Atlanta

 &HT;    `Ropes' portrays game of life as a fight to the finish
 &HT;    By Chris Garcia
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ ``On the Ropes'' is a powerful inner-city
melodrama, whose central subject, boxing, is a self-contained
metaphor for bare-knuckling it out of the projects. Set in
Brooklyn, the engrossing documentary follows three young fighters
and a gentle trainer on their common pilgrimage to bootstrap
redemption. ``The street is tougher than any gym,'' one of them
says, and there you have it.
</P>
<P>
   In Nanette Burstein and Brett Morgen's deft film,
sweat-and-blood pugilism takes ringside, as the human stories bound
into high-relief with each triumph, setback, disappointment and, in
one boxer's case, dream-shattering tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the Ropes'' describes the wavering arcs of its four
subjects over the course of about a year. There's George Walton, a
Golden Gloves winner, whose life is in reasonably good shape as he
aims for the pros. Welterweight Noel Santiago is a flaky,
opaque-eyed teen, who's repeated the ninth grade three times and
lives with his formerly crack-addicted mom. Unlike the others, his
eyes are innocent of fire.
</P>
<P>
   The sole woman, Tyrene Manson, is a fierce, talented boxer
saddled by her duties to her teen sisters and drug-addicted,
AIDS-riven uncle. And trainer Harry Keitt is a former crack-addict
and convicted murderer who hopes to ride one of their stars to
deliverance. When this second-chancer says, ``I want to go forward
so bad,'' it's a jab to the heart.
</P>
<P>
   Bashing bags and crunching abs, the fighters weave through the
Bed-Stuy Boxing Club to train and receive counsel from the stolid
Keitt, who's as much pastor as prodder.
</P>
<P>
   Some situations are out of his hands. Noel cuts school and skips
the gym. George drops Harry for a slick new manager. And Tyrene, in
the film's most compelling plotline, might have to sacrifice her
Golden Gloves bout _ and a chunk of her life _ if she's convicted
of possession of and intent to sell crack. (The filmmakers try to
sway us, but they present a porous case for her innocence. They do,
though, provide a horrifying look at an inner-city court
procedure.)
</P>
<P>
   With all its inherent trials and glints of uplift, ``On the
Ropes'' dispenses the warm satisfaction of full-bodied fiction. A
nit: Some scenes are obviously set up and vaguely choreographed for
narrative fluidity. It amounts to sabotage in a pure documentary,
and makes you wonder what else the filmmakers conveniently
manipulated. Such dishonesty is a bit of raging bull in what's
otherwise a frank and moving knockout.

HILLARY CLINTON COMPLETES LEGAL REQUIREMENT FOR N.Y. CANDIDACY

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton completed the
legal requirements to run for the Senate from New York Thursday by
filing a ``statement of candidacy'' that enables her to double the
amount of money she can legally raise from campaign donors and
political action committees.
</P>
<P>
   While the first lady was traveling in Europe, her lawyer mailed
the legal document to the secretary of the U.S. Senate. The
document is automatically relayed to the Federal Election
Commission (FEC).
</P>
<P>
   The low key approach relying on the U.S. Postal Service was in
sharp contrast to the hoopla that accompanied Clinton's submission
of paperwork to the FEC on July 6 announcing that she was forming
an exploratory campaign committee.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton signed her statement of candidacy on Sunday before
leaving for a six-day trip to Poland, Slovakia, Italy and Iceland.
She returns to the United States on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Howard Wolfson, Clinton's Senate campaign spokesman, called the
filing ``another step forward in the process'' of running for the
Senate, adding: ``Hillary Clinton gets more and more excited about
the possibility of running every day.''
</P>
<P>
   Wolfson said Clinton has not made a decision on the timing of a
public declaration of candidacy _ an announcement that would
trigger the legal requirement that news media outlets provide equal
time to rival candidates.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of her statement of candidacy, Clinton will be
required to submit campaign finance reports to the FEC by Jan. 31
accounting for six months of fund raising between July 1 and Dec.
31.
</P>
<P>
   Since Labor Day she has raised more than $2 million for her
prospective Senate campaign, according to campaign officials, who
spoke on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton plans an ambitious schedule of fund raising after
returning from Europe, with fund-raising events for Democratic
organizations in three New York counties followed by a $1
million-plus ``Broadway for Hillary'' birthday bash on Oct. 25
hosted by talk show host Rosie O'Donnell and actor Nathan Lane.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, a native of Illinois and former first lady of Arkansas,
will celebrate her 52nd birthday on Oct. 26. She and her husband
are buying a $1.7 million five-bedroom home in Chappaqua, N.Y.,
with closing set for Nov. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's expected Republican rival, New York Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani, took the same formal steps of candidacy in April in a
move that required him to submit campaign spending reports to the
FEC on June 30. That report showed that he had raised $2.8 million
in the first six months of 1999 and had $2.6 million on hand.
</P>
<P>
   Experts forecast that each candidate in the showcase Senate race
of 2000 will spend $25 million _ making the $50 million battle to
succeed retiring Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., the most
expensive U.S. Senate race in history.
</P>
<P>
   The declaration of candidacy ``puts us in the same situation as
Giuliani,'' Wolfson said. ``It's what other Senate candidates have
typically done.''

</P>
<P>
   By submitting statements of candidacy, Clinton and Giuliani
become free to double their fund raising take from each donor.
During the exploratory phase of a Senate campaign, each candidate
is limited to accepting $1,000 from each donor for a prospective
Senate primary campaign.
</P>
<P>
   But by filing a statement of candidacy for the general election,
each candidate can then raise $1,000 from each contributor for the
prospective primary contest and another $1,000 for the general
election in November 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Each candidate also can also double the amount of money
permitted to be raised from a political action committee, with
$5,000 for a theoretical primary fight and another $5,000 for the
final campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Clinton nor Giuliani is expected to face a serious
challenger in New York state's primary next September.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's statement of candidacy came amid continuing evidence
in public opinion polls that the Clinton-Giuliani race remains a
statistical dead heat.
</P>
<P>
   Marist College's Institute for Public Opinion reported Thursday
that a statewide telephone poll of 702 registered voters completed
Monday showed Giuliani leading Clinton, 46 percent to 42 percent.
The survey's margin of error was plus or minus 4 percentage points,
meaning that the two candidates are locked in a statistical dead
heat _ a finding replicated by other recent statewide surveys.

   STING/``BRAND NEW DAY'' (A&AMP;M)
</P>
<P>
   New album, same sonic stew of love songs with quirky time
signatures. And that's not a bad thing. Because while you can
always count on Sting to hopscotch between styles (bossa nova,
country, world beat, jazz and gospel all receive workouts here),
you never know what approach he's going to take.
</P>
<P>
   Here, on his seventh solo album, he has jettisoned longtime
collaborator Hugh Padgham in favor of producer/programmer Kipper,
aiming for a sonic-collage feel on several songs. But boomers take
comfort: James Taylor and Stevie Wonder are on hand, too, as well
as trumpeter Chris Botti, who brings noirish Miles Davis shadings
to a couple of tracks. While this may not be a completely brand-new
day, it is another engaging step in the evolution of one of pop's
most compelling personalities. 3 stars

EVE/``LET THERE BE ... EVE _ RUFF RYDERS' FIRST LADY'' (Ruff
Ryders/Interscope)
</P>
<P>
   Hip-hop's latest femme fatale got noticed for a string of cameos
on such projects as the Roots' Top 10 hit ``You Got Me'' and
Blackstreet's ``Boyfriend/Girlfriend.'' The West Philly native's
classy debut album, backed by the Ruff Ryders crew and hitmaking
producer Swizz Beatz, is a hard-core rap fan's delight, bolstered
by such standouts as the remix of the Ryders' smash ``What Y'all
Want,'' which emphasizes the song's salsa flavor by piling on the
instruments and rhythms.
</P>
<P>
   Another goodie is ``Scenario 2000,'' bringing together DMX, the
Lox and Drag-On in a hip-hop super session. Eve's spirited first
single, ``Gotta Man,'' goes against the grain by singing the
praises of monogamy, while ``Love Is Blind'' shows vengeance
belongs to this new star of the Ruff Ryders camp. 3 stars

 &QL; 
GARTH BROOKS AS CHRIS GAINES/``GREATEST HITS'' (Capitol)
</P>
<P>
   First, let's set aside the nonissue of whether country superstar
Brooks is betraying his fans and/or compromising his integrity by
creating a fictional alter-ego and releasing this record under the
name Gaines. Haven't pop performers from the Traveling Wilburys to
KISS been doing similar things for years?
</P>
<P>
   The real problem with Gaines' music is that, excepting two or
three tracks, it sounds too much like Brooks' to justify this new
post-punk persona. Take away the guitar licks, the gritty vocals
and the minimal improvisations of some first-rate jazz and pop
session cats, and you've got a disc that fits easily within Brooks'
country canon. Nothing necessarily wrong with that. Brooks always
has tipped his Stetson to soft-rock and pop, and in tandem here
with producer Don Was he has crafted a smoothly digestible
pop-country confection.
</P>
<P>
   ``Main Street'' laments a downcast Middle American thoroughfare,
``Driftin' Away'' effectively utilizes a Boyz II Men-style falsetto
chorus, and ``Digging for Gold'' offers a growling, Merle
Haggard-esque rebuke to an ambitious female. But ``Unsigned
Letter'' and the retro-'60s ``My Love Tells Me So'' recall the
innocuous '80s pop-rock that Nashville's ``New Traditionalists''
rose to supplant. ``Right Now,'' by far the most venturesome track,
mixes a Brooks rap solo with the chorus to the Youngbloods' 1969
hit ``Get Together'' but is so politically middle-of-the-road it
practically sideswipes itself.
</P>
<P>
   For all its conceptual ingenuity, ``Greatest Hits'' doesn't add
up to a compelling, risk-taking pop statement, but instead is a
cleverly contrived musical pose. 2 stars
</P>
<P>
   _ Reed Johnson &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
PAULA COLE BAND/``AMEN'' (Warner Bros.)
</P>
<P>
   Cole's previous effort spawned the ubiquitous hits ``Where Have
All the Cowboys Gone?'' and ``I Don't Want to Wait'' (the
``Dawson's Creek'' theme). But nothing can explain the nearly
universal sour reviews her ambitious new disc has been drawing.
``Amen'' just isn't that terrible, folks. Really. The nine-song
album often pays tribute to Cole's love for r&AMP;b and other genres,
most successfully on the humid Barry White-style album opener ``I
Believe in Love'' and the velvety African-inspired dirge ``Suwannee
Jo.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the lyrics can get a little banal, but Cole is clearly
stretching here. What'd you want _ six remakes of ``Where Have All
the Cowboys Gone?'' Incidentally, the Cole band appears Oct. 20 at
Vynyl in Hollywood. 3 stars

VARIOUS/``R-E-S-P-E-C-T: A CENTURY OF WOMEN IN MUSIC'' (Rhino)
</P>
<P>
   How do you capture 100 years of female artistry in 114 songs?
You don't, but the archivists at Rhino give it a solid shot with
this five-disc box.
</P>
<P>
   The compilation comes closest to conclusive in its first two
discs, which include a strong sampling of show tunes, vintage
blues, jazz and torch songs. As genres begin to multiply and
splinter, however, the task becomes harder, particularly given
licensing difficulties. Thus, ``R-E-S-P-E-C-T'' has nothing from
Joni Mitchell, Madonna, Annie Lennox or Karen Carpenter (or '90s
divas like Whitney Houston, Mariah Carey or Janet Jackson for that
matter) and often offers lesser songs in the place of more
definitive numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Still, this set boasts a bounty of great material and plenty of
evidence that women were making significant musical moves long
before Lilith Fair came along. 3 stars

 &QL; 
BROOKS &AMP; DUNN/``TIGHT ROPE'' (Arista Nashville)
</P>
<P>
   The odd song out on top-selling country duo Brooks &AMP; Dunn's
sixth studio effort is a soulful remake of John Waite's 1984 hit,
``Missing You,'' which is currently heading straight for the top of
the country charts. The other dozen tracks, co-written by one or
the other of the duo, deal with various phases of love, most
effectively on such laments as ``Hurt Train'' and ``Too Far This
Time.''
</P>
<P>
   There are also a few upbeat party tunes in ``Temptation 9'' and
``Beer Thirty,'' while album-closer ``Texas and Norma Jean'' is a
tender tale of a chance encounter. Kix Brooks and Ronnie Dunn do it
again. 3 stars. &QL; 
_ Fred Shuster &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
JOHN PIZZARELLI/``P.S. MR. COLE'' (RCA Victor)
</P>
<P>
   For his second tribute album of the year (he earlier mined the
Beatles' songbook), jazz guitarist and vocalist Pizzarelli turns in
a charmingly affectionate nod to Nat King Cole's great piano trio.
</P>
<P>
   Accompanied by his bassist brother, Martin, and pianist Ray
Kennedy, Pizzarelli displays a deft knowledge of Cole's catalog as
well as the work of Oscar Moore, Cole's crack guitarist.
</P>
<P>
   Highlights include the carefree ``Walkin' My Baby Back Home,'' a
rollicking ``Indiana'' and ``I Like Jersey Best,'' the hilarious
concert staple that shows up here courtesy of a 1996 date at the
Algonquin Hotel. It has nothing to do with Cole, but everything to
do with Pizzarelli's continued appeal. 3 stars

`LIMEY' FEATURES KNOCK-OUT PERFORMANCES BY STAMP, FONDA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The word is that Steven Soderbergh had so much fun adapting
Elmore Leonard's novel, ``Out of Sight,'' into an Oscar-nominated
critical hit last summer that he decided to try it again _ only
this time without a Leonard novel as his source material.
</P>
<P>
   The result _ ``The Limey'' _ isn't as much fun as Soderbergh's
last sojourn into the Leonard-esque land of small-time hoods and
low-life losers: the dialogue is not as snappy, the plot not as
enjoyably convoluted or emotionally satisfying.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the movie works, and is noteworthy for its daring,
non-linear, story-telling style, and its knock-out performances
from two icon stars of the '60s, who happen to be in the midst of
impressive career comebacks in their 60s _ Terence Stamp and Peter
Fonda.
</P>
<P>
   Stamp plays Wilson, an aging, Cockney ex-con who, after a decade
behind bars, leaves London for Los Angeles, where his beloved
daughter, Jenny, has recently died, according to a letter from one
of her friends, ``under mysterious circumstances.''
</P>
<P>
   In L.A., Wilson quickly concludes that the man responsible for
Jenny's death is wealthy record producer Terry Valentine (Fonda),
who, despite a lavish lifestyle, is financially over-extended and
currently involved in a big drug deal.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the movie follows Wilson _ at first, very much the
fish out of water _ as he adapts to his new jungle environment, and
soon proves brutally effective in it, making his own set of allies
and consistently besting the killers sent to stop him.
</P>
<P>
   As written by Lem Dobbs, it's a familiar enough formula-revenge
piece, and the script lacks both the structural tightness and comic
unity of the Leonard novels, and of the more entertaining of the
Leonard movie adaptations _ ``Get Shorty,'' ``Stick'' and ``Out of
Sight.''
</P>
<P>
   But Soderbergh heightens the material with the kind of fractured
storytelling approach that he hasn't really used much since his
``sex, lies &AMP; videotape'' days _ constantly flashing backward and
forward in time, and deconstructing scenes as we're watching them.
</P>
<P>
   Much more than ``Out of Sight,'' this Soderbergh film is an
actor's movie, and works off the inspired performances from Stamp,
a marvelously determined hero (and totally convincing in his
natural Cockney dialect); and Fonda, as a shallow, charming, rather
silly villain stuck in his glory days of the '60s.
</P>
<P>
   In another of the film's innovations, Soderbergh uses cuts of
the 28 year-old Stamp from the 1967 Ken Loach film, ``Poor Cow''
(in which Stamp also plays a crook named Wilson) as flashbacks and
parts of the character's stream-of-consciousness.
</P>
<P>
   It's a risky device that, in lesser hands, might have seemed a
clumsy gimmick. But Soderbergh makes it work, and it not only gives
his movie a thrilling authenticity, it makes ``The Limey'' a subtle
tribute to Stamp's special contribution to the movies of the past
four decades.
</P>
<P>
   The Limey. Directed by Steven Soderbergh. Written by Lem Dobbs.
Cast: Terence Stamp, Peter Fonda, Barry Newman, Luis Guzman, Lesley
Ann Warren. Artisan. 89 minutes. Rated R for violence.

A DREAMY SENSUALITY BRIDGES TIME AND CULTURE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Italy, India)  (js) 
 By ROBERTA SMITH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Francesco Clemente is the youngest artist to be given
the full-rotunda treatment by the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum. In
recent years Claes Oldenburg, Ellsworth Kelly and Robert
Rauschenberg have filled the place to overflowing and, in
particular, have imprinted the rotunda with an indelible sense of
their styles.
</P>
<P>
   Now Clemente, the Italian painter of East-meets-West dream
images that delve into the mind, the body and many forms of love,
is taking his turn. The show has been organized by Lisa Dennison,
the museum's deputy director and chief curator, and spans 25 years
in more than 400 works. It ranges restlessly from oil-on-canvas to
fresco to pastel and beyond, including clusters of small drawings
and paintings as well as examples of the artist's collaborations.
The work reflects a life divided between New York, Italy and India,
and is by turns mystical, anguished, stylish, simplistically
illustrational and conventionally beautiful; an extended suite of
luscious little watercolors from 1985, for example, could have been
made by almost anyone.
</P>
<P>
   The resulting show is, overall, a sweet, meandering affair that
suggests Clemente as a people-pleasing cross between Andy Warhol
and David Hockney. It is impossible to dislike, but hard to get
passionate about. While the show contains more than its share of
orifices, they rarely shock or disrupt the prevailing gentility.
</P>
<P>
   What would have helped? Judicious editing, a traditionally
chronological rather than thematic installation and a serious
catalog. The existing catalog weighs a ton but is mostly fluff; the
best read is Rene Ricard's doting, dotty but detailed chronology
with its useful outline of the artist's development, interactions
with poets, artists and musicians and many travels.
</P>
<P>
   But a little strangeness counts. Clemente is among the few
figurative painters to be set loose in the rotunda recently, and
his work gives the place a pleasantly old-fashioned feeling, like a
retrospective of Klee or Chagall. (Not surprising, as their
schematized, dreamy images are among his precedents.)
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Clemente is an artist without a formal invention
that one can easily point to or that makes his art sing out in
unison from the museum's spiral. What he has achieved is unusual: a
carefully modulated cacophony of disparate mergers and bridgings
between cultures, periods, media, ways of thought and life. At
their best his works can be richly suggestive as well as
startlingly seamless.
</P>
<P>
   An oil painting like ``Name'' (1983) is a good example. It
depicts a monumental head of the artist, his eyes, ears, nostrils
and mouth filled with at least one small version of the same head.
The Gorgonian suggestion of souls trapped in a larger being
resonates with Eastern philosophy and Western angst, and the
duality seems reiterated by the background. To one side is a vivid
blue sky seen through a horizontal window that suggests a train
barreling across India, to the other side a classical column,
redolent of Italy.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Clemente is that almost unheard of hybrid, a 1980s art
star for the '90s. Unlike many of his contemporaries, among them
David Salle, Julian Schnabel and Anselm Kiefer, he recalls some of
the decade's excitement but is relatively untainted by its
excesses.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Naples in 1952, Clemente grew up in a 17th-century
palazzo, wrote poetry as a child, and at 22 went to Rome to study
architecture. Attracted to the art of Joseph Beuys and Cy Twombly,
he began to draw incessantly, making notational autobiographical
works of a conceptual bent. His chief mentor was Alighiero e
Boetti, an Arte Povera artist who hit on the idea of having maps
and blocky alphabets converted into lavish embroideries or
tapestries by craftsmen in Afghanistan. This arrangement helped
inspire Clemente's early travels to India in the mid 1970s, when he
began to find himself as an artist.
</P>
<P>
   Clemente emerged in the late 1970s and early '80s, first in
Europe and then in the United States, in the ``return to the
figure'' that soon coalesced into Neo-Expressionism. He was a major
player in that swashbuckling episode, but there was always a
difference.
</P>
<P>
   A superficial clue is found in photographs of the artist, who
has melancholic good looks of a wan poet model and impeccable
sartorial instincts. Undoubtedly choreographed, these images tend
to show him against relatively ascetic backgrounds, in quiet,
yogalike poses or with a visionary wideness to the eyes _ a holy
man in a well-tailored suit. (He had a cameo role as a hypnotist in
Gus van Sant's ``Good Will Hunting.'')
</P>
<P>
   Compared with most Neo-Expressionist painting, Clemente's work
has always tended to be a less manly art: kinder, gentler, more
contemplative and inward. He shunned the strategies of
fragmentation, juxtaposition and overt appropriation that became
the stylistic hallmarks of so much art of the 1980s. There is a sly
wit but little irony in his work. Instead such '90s concerns as the
body, sexual ambiguity, otherness, sincerity and a longing for the
feminine guide many of its moods and motifs.
</P>
<P>
   The self-portrait may be Clemente's primary vehicle _ like such
artists as Carolee Schneemann, Hannah Wilke and Lucas Samaras, he
has certainly taken advantage of his own physical beauty. But his
work is also oddly egoless, drawing on timeless symbols and themes,
many non-Western. This has placed him well ahead of the nomadic,
transcultural tendencies of the '90s and reflects his prolonged
stays in India, where he has studied Eastern religion and thought,
been influenced by religious and popular art, and enlisted the
skills of different artisans.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The fruits of his labors with Indian painters and papermakers
include some of his best efforts: suites of finely wrought Indian
miniatures that tackle contemporary themes, big posterish paintings
on handmade paper inspired by the bazaar painters of Madras and at
least one handmade paper environment, his lulling ``Indigo Room''
(1983-84), installed in one of the Guggenheim's tower galleries. A
peculiar blend of painting and decoration, Western avant-garde and
Eastern tradition, it evokes a nocturnal garden. Its expanses of
dark-blue paper painted with ghostly images are finished off with
plant forms of silver that seem touched by moonlight.
</P>
<P>
   Less than a signature look, Clemente has given the Guggenheim
what might be called a signature atmosphere of somnolent
laissez-faire sensuality conveyed by simplified forms, elegant
lines, uncluttered compositions and dense aromatic colors. His
figures and faces continually evoke notions of a consciousness
evolving through love. They embrace one another, meditate, perform
obscure rites or are subjected to them, merge with animals, are
pushed toward hieroglyph or symbol or simply drift across the
surface.
</P>
<P>
   The best levitating image may be ``Semen,'' a spare painting
from 1983-84 in which a simple foreshortened outline of the naked
artist floats on an expanse of raw linen, his eyes closed, his
skull defined by a mysterious wire that ends in an arrowhead. In
more Expressionistic moments, Clemente's figures virtually explode
in thick patches of oil paint and wax laid on so frantically as to
seem clawed or thickly furred. This dual animism is apparent in a
1983 painting of the artist's wife, Alba Clemente, a frequent
subject, in which her torso fills the canvas with an almost savage
power.
</P>
<P>
   The show's thematic arrangement proceeds under headings like I,
Unborn, Bestiary, Conversion to Her, Prayers and Amulets and Sky.
It is strongest in the beginning, tends to wane toward the center
and picks up again toward the upper levels and in the side
galleries. These contain the ``Indigo Room'' as well as ``Francesco
Clemente Pinxit,'' his first series of Indian miniatures (1980-91);
frescoes like ``Priapea'' (1980), where the artist seems to be
gently torn apart by plump putti, and eight paintings from his
highly personal ``Stations of the Cross'' series from 1980-81.
</P>
<P>
   The hyperventilating surfaces of these works, again in oil and
wax, suggest an intense reaction to New York life and New York
painting. Full of garish figures and faces, great gusts of color
and nightmarish urban settings, they are both demonic and
intoxicated, as if painted by someone who couldn't quite believe
what he was seeing, either in the city's streets or the studios of
his fellow artists.
</P>
<P>
   But you have to choose carefully. The first section, for
example, includes a number of small early paintings that are some
of the show's best, among them ``Self-Portrait with a Hole in the
Head'' (1981), in which both the artist and the white Rymanesque
background present bullet wounds. Nearby hang the ``New York
Muses,'' a 1993 series of portraits of women with long necks, big
eyes and bee-stung lips that seem destined for a fashion magazine.
Still, a series of somber self-portraits from 1996 has occasional
moments of emotional power, like the staring, tear-stained face of
``Grisaille Self-Portrait.''
</P>
<P>
   While the show's organization is intended to mimic Clemente's
peripatetic working methods and the multiple strands of his art, it
doesn't work. It obscures a development that personifies the way
many young artists in the late 1970s escaped the attenuated
strategies fostered by Conceptualism to actively re-engage art and
its processes and traditions. It also seems designed to distract us
from the increasing superficiality of Clemente's work after 1990,
if not 1985.
</P>
<P>
   He may have been an idiosyncratic '90s-style Neo-Expressionist,
but he seems to have done his best work during the style's feverish
heyday.

ACTOR EXPECTS TO BE AROUND AWHILE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
By GLENN WHIPP 
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Harrison Ford questions himself incessantly. He
can go along blissfully confident for, say, a good 15 or 20 seconds
before the doubts begin to dog his mind. The misgivings are many
and varied. He wonders about his ability as an actor. He's
skeptical about the lasting quality of his work. Here, at this very
moment, he's dubious about his ability to answer a reporter's
question.
</P>
<P>
   ``Capacity is always an issue,'' the reticent Ford says grimly.
</P>
<P>
   But for a man plagued by questions, Ford seems absolutely
certain about at least one thing _ his longevity. He has often
talked about how he likes to make movies and then ``go away,'' his
preferred method of skirting the machinery and self-absorption of
Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   He has no plans, however, to take a permanent leave of absence
from moviemaking. Sure, he may question his capacity. But he has no
doubts about his durability.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because I have never been fashionable, I can never be
unfashionable,'' Ford says matter-of-factly. ``It seems I'm lucky,
too, in that even though we're in this youth-culture thing right
now, there does seem to be enough support for a few of us
geezers.''
</P>
<P>
   Nobody is ready to label Ford, 57, a geezer, least of all Ford
himself. (He sported a somber smile when making the above comment.)
Ford continues to sport a gold stud in one ear and wears his
graying hair in an upswept, spiked style. The earring, Ford's
``favorite'' fashion accessory, was added two years ago on a whim
(``I just always wanted a pierced ear,'' he says) and wasn't an act
borne out of a late midlife crisis.
</P>
<P>
   That he wears the earring in his new romantic drama, ``Random
Hearts,'' may be part of an ongoing campaign to unsettle his
audience's perceptions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want people to have a particular expectation of me,''
Ford says. ``I think you can see that in the movies I choose. For
me, there's always been a couple of parameters: I don't want to do
something too close to what I've done lately, and I want to do
something with ambition. And I like to skip genres, too. It keeps
people guessing.''
</P>
<P>
   Says Sydney Pollack, who directed Ford in ``Random Hearts'' and
his earlier remake of ``Sabrina'': ``Harrison doesn't get his due
as an actor, often because the roles he chooses don't tap into the
range he's capable of showing. After all, there are only so many
ways you can run from something in a movie.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, many of Ford's biggest roles have him taking flight,
whether it's from the law (``The Fugitive''), society (``The
Mosquito Coast'') or evil (``Witness''). (And let's not forget that
tenacious bounty hunter who kept following him throughout the
``Star Wars'' series.) In ``Random Hearts,'' he plays a man running
from his own perceived failures, both as a husband and as a police
officer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a pretty grown-up concept for a movie,'' Ford says.
</P>
<P>
   He'll keep that mature mood going with his next film, ``What
Lies Beneath,'' a supernatural thriller he's currently shooting
with Michelle Pfeiffer. But despite this raft of character work,
Ford says he isn't ready to turn in his running shoes.
</P>
<P>
   Nor does he necessarily agree with Pollack in assessing his film
work. Ford, Hollywood's most famous former carpenter, approaches
each movie looking to submit himself to the role's particular
logic. It all comes down to detail and problem solving. And, to
Ford, ``Random Hearts'' was no more challenge than ``Air Force
One'' in that regard.
</P>
<P>
   Ford will likely reprise his role as Tom Clancy action hero
(sans earring) Jack Ryan sometime in the near future (probably next
year) and hopes to do another ``Indiana Jones'' movie, despite the
fact the series' producer, George Lucas, won't be free from his
``Star Wars'' commitments until 2004. That would put Ford's Indy at
62 and more likely to wear a fedora to cover a bald spot than to
make a fashion statement.
</P>
<P>
   But if Ford has any reservations about a sexagenarian Jones,
he's keeping them _ like so many other things _ to himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm capable of faking all the things I've faked before,'' Ford
said. ``I mean, I don't want to come to the point where it becomes
ludicrous, but I think we're far from that at this time. There are
a lot of examples of people near my age doing that sort of thing.
Sean (Connery) is one who leaps to mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Kristin Scott Thomas, who remembers thrilling to Ford's heroics
in ``Star Wars'' when she was a 16-year-old girl, says, that as far
as she's concerned, Ford could play Indiana Jones as an 80-year-old
and still bring something to the part.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who are magical on screen sort of stay that way
forever,'' says Scott Thomas, who also played Robert Redford's love
interest last year in ``The Horse Whisperer.'' ``Think about Cary
Grant. When he was ancient, he was still, oooooh, so fabulous.''
</P>
<P>
   Grant was 62 when he walked away from film, bored by the paucity
of challenging roles coming his way. That's not a problem at the
moment for Ford. He makes only one movie a year and tries to work
after his two children, Georgia, 9, and Malcolm, 12, have returned
to school. His 16-year marriage to screenwriter Melissa Mathison
rates as such a priority that Ford will turn down movies he feels
would take away too much time from home. Thus, Ford reportedly
passed when friend Steven Spielberg asked him to go off to Europe
and make ``Saving Private Ryan.''
</P>
<P>
   Through the years, Ford has famously turned down leads in
``JFK,'' ``The Hunt for Red October,'' ``Ghost,'' ``The Mirror Has
Two Faces,'' and (wisely) ``I Love Trouble.'' Limiting his schedule
has not limited his options, however. Oprah Winfrey made that
presumption once, producing the following exchange:
</P>
<P>
   Oprah: Do you accept films that don't have a lot of action in
them? I mean, when they come, do you look for as much action as you
can find?
</P>
<P>
   Ford: Did you ever see me beat Sabrina?
</P>
<P>
   That's where Ford finds himself today _ throwing fewer punches,
dishing out the occasional punch line, but mostly steering himself
toward the sort of decent, distant and cautious characters that
have marked his career. He has always believed himself to be an
actor, not an icon, an ``assistant storyteller,'' if you will.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like being a waiter or a gas station attendant, only I'm
waiting on 6 million people a week _ if I'm lucky,'' Ford says,
again flashing that sad smile.
</P>
<P>
   And if the attractive roles stop coming his way, if he can't
find one script that interests him each year, Ford has an easy
solution. He'll take longer breaks between projects. He'll spend
more time flying his airplanes, watching his two youngest children
navigate through their high school years and enjoying his grandson.
(Ford has two older sons from his first marriage.)
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have a grand plan for my career, never have,'' Ford
says. ``I just make it up as I go along. But, in the end, it's
work. It's not my life. It's just what I do for a living. There are
a lot more important things to worry about.'' &UR;  &QL;

   &UR; !text! &LR;  ``The Mating Habits of the Earthbound Human'' (try
saying  &UR; !ital! &LR; that &UR; !off! &LR;  when you buy your ticket _ then again,
don't) attempts to appeal to people who like to watch animals do
the wild thing on the Discovery Channel. But, at the very least,
nature documentaries have a sense of wonder and surprise, two
qualities in short supply in this drab comedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mating Habits'' purports to be a documentary filmed by
extraterrestrials interested in human behavior. Glibly narrated by
``Frasier's'' David Hyde Pierce, this innocuous movie follows the
relationship of The Male (Mackenzie Astin) and The Female (Carmen
Electra) from their introduction at a ``sacred meeting place''
(nightclub) through courtship and various attempts to perpetuate
the species.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the film's humor is based on the fact that the alien
narrator accepts everything he sees at face value. Thus, birth
control is seen as a natural barrier (there are several too many
shots of men _ dressed up as sperm _ running into a padded wall)
and the humans' moaning and groaning during sex is taken as pain
endured for the sake of reproduction.
</P>
<P>
   As written and directed by sitcom veteran Jeff Abugov (he has
worked as story editor on ``Cheers,'' ``My Two Dads'' and ``The
Golden Girls), ``Mating Habits'' is intermittently amusing, with
Hyde Pierce's droll narration scoring a few points before
eventually becoming tedious. The film doesn't take itself
seriously, but, because it lacks much in the way of fresh insight,
its situations too often play like a bad episode of ``Beverly Hills
90210.''
</P>
<P>
   The two leads are perfectly adequate, although they never rise
above the undemanding material. ``Mating Habits'' features them in
numerous, discretely shot sex scenes, the tameness of which will
likely disappoint nature-loving adolescent boys _ no matter what
galaxy they hail from. &UR; !end! &LR;  &QL;

   &UR; ((EDITORS: RETRANSMITTING THIS INTERESTING PIECE - A SHORT
SIDEBAR, `MAN,'
 &UR; HAS BEEN ADDED AT THE END OF THIS STORY)
</P>
<P>
   TUCSON _ It's just a tiny pile of bone shavings, snug inside a
Tupperware bowl in a University of Arizona file drawer.
</P>
<P>
   But it's also a clue to one of the biggest controversies facing
American anthropology:
</P>
<P>
   Were ancestors of American Indians alone as the first humans in
North America? Or were there also Caucasoids _ people with physical
features generally associated with Europeans _ living here about
the same time?
</P>
<P>
   The scientific, political and legal furor raging over the
skeletal remains called Kennewick Man goes to the heart of humans'
earliest history in North America.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't be really placed in the present and future unless
we're rooted in the past,'' said Alan Schneider, an attorney who
represents scientists demanding a full study of the skeleton.
</P>
<P>
   The battle has reached the highest levels. Last year, the
Clinton administration opposed a bill to allow study of Kennewick
Man. Last week, however, a federal judge ordered that the study go
forward.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since 1996, when two students found the skull to the
10,000-year-old skeleton on the Columbia River near Kennewick,
Wash., the remains have been caught in a tug of war.
</P>
<P>
   On one side are Native Americans and federal officials who are
blocking further study of the skeleton, claiming it should be
reburied under the Native American Graves Protection Act of 1990.
</P>
<P>
   They argue that any human remains determined to have lived
``prior to the documented arrival of Europeans,'' or nearly 507
years ago with the arrival of Christopher Columbus, be considered
indigenous to the United States and therefore, ancestors of modern
Native Americans.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side is a group of eight scientists, including
Arizona State University anthropologist Christy Turner.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, the scientists filed suit in federal court, asserting
that the skeleton, found on federal land, should be studied to
better understand human development and migration in North America.
</P>
<P>
   In connection with the suit, a federal judge has ordered further
testing to confirm earlier findings that Kennewick Man lived about
10,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   That's where UA comes in. Its Arizona Accelerated Mass
Spectrometry Facility, renowned for its radiocarbon dating methods,
was picked among three labs in the world to analyze the Shroud of
Turin in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   The Tucson lab, in the basement of the UA's physics building, is
one of three U.S. facilities now testing Kennewick Man.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas Donahue, director of the UA lab, said the spectrometer
will measure the ratio of stable carbon to carbon-14 in 6.5 grams
of bone from the skeleton's left tibia.
</P>
<P>
   All living organisms absorb the element carbon from the
atmosphere until they die, when they begin to emit it. Because
carbon-14 isotopes decay at a known rate, scientists can measure
the amount of carbon in ancient remains to determine the date an
organism died.
</P>
<P>
   The testing will occur over a series of weeks, with the results
being sent to the U.S. Department of Interior by November.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until it's done, we're keeping it (the testing) as low-key as
possible,'' Donahue said, adding that he plans to publish the
results later in a scientific journal.
</P>
<P>
   But radiocarbon dating is only the first step in determining the
real roots of Kennewick Man, researchers agree.
</P>
<P>
   ``DNA testing needs to be done to see what the lineage is,''
said Donna Kirner, an anthropologist who initially tested the
skeleton at the University of California-Riverside. ``A date is
just a date. It doesn't tell you anything other than a time
frame.''
</P>
<P>
   Department of Interior officials haven't made any promises to
allow DNA testing of Kennewick Man, but it appears a federal judge
will push for it.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, U.S. District Judge John Jelderks ordered that the
government finish the radiocarbon analysis and conduct a
cultural-affiliation assessment, possibly including DNA testing, in
the next six months.
</P>
<P>
   The relatively tight deadline is troubling to federal officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be very tough,'' said Stephanie Hanna, a
spokeswoman for the Department of Interior. ``The Justice
Department explained it takes a least a year to do
cultural-affiliation studies, and now we're looking at less than a
year.''
</P>
<P>
   But Jelderks didn't buy the argument.
</P>
<P>
   ``In sum, the court is concerned by what appears to be a pattern
of unnecessary delay in this action,'' he wrote in his Sept. 21
order.
</P>
<P>
   The decision is a victory for the scientists, but only in part.
They had requested that the judge rule immediately on their request
for full study of Kennewick Man.
</P>
<P>
   But even a partial victory is sweet for Schneider.
</P>
<P>
   ``The early prehistory of this country is as important as
anything else,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``And the truth about the radiocarbon dating and the Kennewick
Man is (that) the government should not be involved in the history
and the prehistory of science.'' &QL;

 &QL; 
 &UR; MAN (SIDEBAR, also by Kerry Fehr-Snyder)  &QL; 
 &QL; 
Artist's &QL; 
view likely &QL; 
incorrect &QL; 
Shortly after the remains of Kennewick Man were found, a forensic
anthropologist noted that the skeleton had Caucasoid features. An
artist's clay ren dering even depicted a Kirk Douglas-style chin
and an overall resemblance to Star Trek's Jean-Luc Picard.
</P>
<P>
   But the anthropologist prob ably got it wrong when he said the
bones belonged to an early White settler.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists caution that, de spite the similarity in words,
``Caucasoid'' is a scientific designation that differs dramat
ically from the popularly used term ``Caucasian.''
</P>
<P>
   Caucasian usually refers to skin color. But Caucasoid is an
anthropological description generally applied to the physi cal
features and skeletal types of people of North Africa and Asia as
well as Europe, accord ing to Christy Turner, an an thropologist at
Arizona State University.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are dark-skinned and light-skinned Caucasians,'' he
explained. ``It is really a geographical designation.''
</P>
<P>
   Scientists won't know for sure whether Kennewick Man was
Caucasoid or related to modern-day Native Americans. Such a
determination will re quire a ``cultural affiliation'' analysis _
possibly including DNA testing _ on the skele ton. A federal judge
has or dered the analysis take place before March. &QL;

COMMENTARY: A BABY-SITTING COOPERATIVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MARY J. LOFTUS   NYT Regional Newspapers   c.1999 N.Y. Times
News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's the first month into our baby-sitting co-op, and things are
going swimmingly.
</P>
<P>
   Well, as swimmingly as any situation can that involves four
active boys and a trio of toddlers.
</P>
<P>
   My neighbors and I had often swapped baby-sitting woes,
complaining that our teen-age sitters had more active social lives
than we did (with the corollary being that they didn't have much
time left over to baby-sit.)
</P>
<P>
   So a few of us decided to use the old ``it takes a village''
approach and pool our resources. Here's how it works, for those
daring enough to try this at home:
</P>
<P>
   Take three families. Family A has two boys, 9 and 12, and a
girl, 2. Family B (us) has one boy, 8, and one girl, 3. And Family
C has one boy, 9, and one girl, 1.
</P>
<P>
   We found it helps to have similar breakdowns in ages and sexes.
Also, all the children _ and parents _ knew each other from school
and Scouts and day care, which made for an easier blending.
</P>
<P>
   Each family took the children from 5 to 8:30 p.m. one Saturday a
month, with one Saturday left for each family to stay together.
</P>
<P>
   My part in the first weekend consisted of dropping my two
darlings off at the appointed hour with Couple A.
</P>
<P>
   Couple B (us) and Couple C (Bruce and Amy) made a hasty retreat,
since we had dinner reservations at 6:00.
</P>
<P>
   As we settled in to dine on lobster and red snapper, Amy raised
her glass in a simple toast: ``Here's to being out.'' Indeed, we
were all pretty glad to be there amid the wine glasses clinking and
the starched linen tablecloths, with no high chairs in our general
vicinity.
</P>
<P>
   Then, of course, came the pay back. Weekend No. 2.
</P>
<P>
   First, I had to do a sweep of the house, since baby-proofing for
my 3-year-old is a bit more lax than for the younger girls that
would be there.
</P>
<P>
   I arranged an area for the boys in the basement, with the TV,
play tent, computer and action figures, and pulled a lot of my
daughter's toys up to the living room for the girls (Duplos, push
toys, stuffed animals and playhouse.) This fell under the theory of
Separate Domains.
</P>
<P>
   And finally, because my husband was away at a business
conference, and I am a chicken, I hired our baby sitter to help
out. Smart move. Two caretakers with seven young charges was a much
better ratio.
</P>
<P>
   The kids ate in shifts, girls first, and the basement strategy
kept the big brothers contained for the entire three hours.
Everybody enjoyed making their sundaes, even if chocolate sauce and
sprinkles did end up spread over several rooms of the house.
</P>
<P>
   But before long, 8:30 rolled around, and the couples dutifully
returned to claim their children _ one with a favorable review of
``The Thomas Crown Affair,'' and the other from an evening of
pressure washing the house and taking in a Tupperware party.
</P>
<P>
   The next weekend, Amy called to confirm.
</P>
<P>
   When I arrived, the boys were playing badminton, and the girls
were in the sandbox. Amy had a racquet and was looking optimistic.
``Have fun,'' I said, smiling, as I dropped a backpack, change of
clothes and sippy cup beside a tree.
</P>
<P>
   Then I walked out the side gate and climbed into my minivan,
three hours of unplanned time stretching ahead of me like an
uncharted highway.
</P>

NFL MATCHUPS FOR WEEK 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By TIMOTHY W. SMITH    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SUNDAY, 1 P.M. GAMES
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta (0-4) at New Orleans (1-2)
</P>
<P>
   Falcons Coach Dan Reeves and Saints Coach Mike Ditka are close
buds. So they will likely commiserate about what has been an awful
season, especially for the Falcons. Reeves is paying for what was a
terrible mistake this offseason in not getting a qualified backup
for the injury-prone Chris Chandler. He will play this week, but
his hamstring will be a continuing problem. Like last week, he
probably won't finish the game.
</P>
<P>
   Saints, 20-19
</P>
<P>
   Chicago (2-2) at Minnesota (2-2)
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to tell which way the Vikings are headed. They had a
nice 21-point, first-half explosion last week against Tampa Bay,
then were held scoreless for the rest of the game. So is the glass
half full or empty? Are the Vikings back on track or still having
problems with their offense? Let's be optimistic and say Minnesota
is due for a 30-point explosion.
</P>
<P>
   Vikings, 31-10
</P>
<P>
   Cincinnati (0-4) at Cleveland (0-4)
</P>
<P>
   Someone please put Bengals Coach Bruce Coslet out his misery. It
is only a matter of time before he is fired. If his team loses to
the expansion Browns, that day will come sooner rather than later.
Coslet made the smart move to start rookie Akili Smith, who is
still angry at the Browns for misleading him during draft-day
contract talks. So Smith will want to prove the Browns made a
mistake in drafting Tim Couch over him. Cleveland has won five
straight home games against the Bengals but that was the old Browns
team. Even Coslet can't mess this game up.
</P>
<P>
   Bengals, 20-3
</P>
<P>
   Dallas (3-0) at Philadelphia (0-4)
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys are off to their best start since going 4-0 in 1995,
the season they went to Super Bowl XXX. Philadelphia won't put up
much of a fight. They have a terrible offense and average defense.
Running back Emmitt Smith averages 109.3 yards a game against the
Eagles, his highest average against any NFC East team. This game
Smith is good for at least 120 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys, 35-7
</P>
<P>
   New England (4-0) at Kansas City (2-2)
</P>
<P>
   The NFL keeps waiting for the Patriots to crash. It won't
happen. This team is for real, mainly because quarterback Drew
Bledsoe is playing great. He has a 93.6 passer rating and has
thrown 120 passes without an interception. They will go 5-0 for the
first time since 1974.
</P>
<P>
   Patriots, 28-21
</P>
<P>
   Pittsburgh (2-2) at Buffalo (3-1)
</P>
<P>
   The Bills might be a tired group following their emotional
Monday night victory at Miami. It was one of the most important
triumphs in years because Buffalo had struggled against Miami. But
the Bills, contrary to what one might think, will still be ready.
In the 1990s, they are 13-5 following games on Monday night. And
Doug Flutie continues to be impressive as a starter for the Bills,
since he is 10-4. Because of Pittsburgh's offensive woes _
quarterback Kordell Stewart has a dismal 57.6 rating _ they won't
be able to keep up with Flutie and the Bills.
</P>
<P>
   Bills, 24-13
</P>
<P>
   San Diego (2-1) at Detroit (2-1)
</P>
<P>
   The home team in this game has won all six meetings. If that
isn't indication enough of a Lions win, Coach Bobby Ross, who
coached the Chargers to Super Bowl XXIX, and then was fired, is
extra motivated to beat his old team. San Diego won't make it easy
since they rarely beat themselves. The Chargers have only three
turnovers, tied for the fewest in the league.
</P>
<P>
   Lions, 19-13
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco (3-1) at St. Louis (3-0)
</P>
<P>
   Incredible as it may seem, the Rams _ the Rams, for goodness
sake _ are in first place in the NFC West. What's next? Aliens land
in Washington? But for St. Louis this is their first big test. The
49ers have always dominated the Rams franchise, winning 12 straight
on the road against them. The last time San Francisco lost to St.
Louis on the road was 1986. That is a daunting history to overcome.
</P>
<P>
   49ers, 30-28
</P>
<P>
   SUNDAY, 4 P.M. GAMES
</P>
<P>
   Giants (2-2) at Arizona (1-3)
</P>
<P>
   Both teams have good defenses. The Giants are ranked third in
the conference while the Cardinals are fourth. And both offenses
have struggled. For the Giants, don't expect Kerry Collins to be a
savior. The true savior, in addition to Michael Strahan and Jessie
Armstead, may be wide receiver Amani Toomer. He is blossoming into
a quality player and Giants coaches plan to get Toomer even more
involved in the offense against Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Giants, 21-20
</P>
<P>
   Baltimore (2-2) at Tennessee (3-1)
</P>
<P>
   This is about the time for one of those Neil O'Donnell
meltdowns. It is true that O'Donnell is 25-12 as a starter against
the AFC Central and equally true that he leads the conference with
a 133.3 passer rating. But the reason the Jets got rid of him was
that he bounced up and down like a yo-yo. Baltimore defensive back
Rod Woodson has six career interceptions against Tennessee. He and
the secondary will have a good day.
</P>
<P>
   Ravens, 16-13
</P>
<P>
   Denver (0-4) at Oakland (2-2)
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback Bubby Brister gets the start over Brian Griese.
Shanahan benched Brister in the preseason because he believed he
was better coming off the bench. Now Shanahan gets to see if his
theory was correct. But there is nothing Shanahan can do to
overcome the loss of Terrell Davis to a season-ending knee injury.
Meanwhile, former Giant Tyrone Wheatley is having the best season
of his professional career. Denver won't be able to stop him;
they'll go to an unbelievable 0-5.
</P>
<P>
   Raiders, 21-10
</P>
<P>
   Miami (2-1) at Indianapolis (2-1)
</P>
<P>
   This is one of the most intriguing games of the weekend.
Dolphins Coach Jimmy Johnson took some serious shots at his offense
this week after their average performance against Buffalo on Monday
night. How the Dolphins respond _ especially quarterback Dan Marino
_ will be interesting to watch. More importantly, offensive tackle
Richmond Webb is out with a bruised knee. Miami historically
dominates the Colts. That will continue.
</P>
<P>
   Dolphins, 24-16
</P>
<P>
   SUNDAY, 8 P.M. GAME
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay (2-2) at Green Bay (2-1)
</P>
<P>
   It is in big games like this one where Tampa Bay has a dramatic
disadvantage. Two words: Trent Dilfer. Or those two words could be
Brett Favre. One is a dud, the other a difference maker. Tampa Bay
does have a tremendous defense, anchored by Warren Sapp, who
returns after missing last week with an injured hand. Tampa Bay
still has not allowed a rushing touchdown. But as long as Dilfer is
the quarterback _ especially when he goes against Favre _ the
Buccaneers will not take that big step forward.
</P>
<P>
   Packers, 21-14
</P>
<P>
   MONDAY NIGHT GAME
</P>
<P>
   Jacksonville (3-1) at Jets (1-3)
</P>
<P>
   Against the Broncos last week, Rick Mirer actually played fairly
well, and that was a result of the Jets finally just getting wide
receiver Keyshawn Johnson the ball. As much as possible. He and
Mirer finally seemed to find some sort of chemistry. Look for that
to continue against Jacksonville. As for the Jaguars, the stories
about the rift between Coach Tom Coughlin and quarterback Mark
Brunell are not exaggerated.
</P>
<P>
   Jets, 24-23

 &HT;    AIRLINES SPENT MILLIONS IN CAMPAIGN AGAINST PASSENGER RIGHTS LAW
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a year of soaring customer complaints, U.S.
airlines grounded a passenger bill of rights movement with help
from a $3 million lobbying effort and $1.3 million in political
donations, says a study by the group Common Cause.
</P>
<P>
   Northwest Airlines, which had been the target of protests from
passengers for holding packed planes on runways last winter, alone
spent $1.3 million for lobbying during the first half of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta-based Delta Airlines made $38,000 in political donations
during the same period.
</P>
<P>
   The Common Cause analysis tracked political spending at a time
when public outrage over treatment by the airlines prompted
promises of new legislation on Capitol Hill. Passengers told of
being held prisoner for hours aboard packed planes that were stuck
on runways by winter blizzards and spring storms.
</P>
<P>
   Complaints filed against airlines doubled to 5,000 compared with
a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   However, the push for new customer protections faded in June,
when the major airlines persuaded Congress to accept their offer to
set up a voluntary improvement plan.
</P>
<P>
   The major airlines issued their so-called ``customers first''
proposals last month.
</P>
<P>
   Critics charged that the plans were weak and unenforceable. Sen.
Ron Wyden, D-Ore., called the airline plans ``legalistic
gobbledygook which do nothing to protect passengers.'' A study by
the General Accounting Office, the investigating arm of Congress,
concluded that most of the rights listed in the airlines' plans do
not go beyond existing legal requirements.
</P>
<P>
   The airlines defend the program as better than one run by the
government. ``It's not weak at all,'' said David Fuscus, spokesman
for the Air Transport Association. ``It's in the the implementation
phase.''
</P>
<P>
   He noted that Congress has ordered the Department of
Transportation's inspector general to review the results and report
back next June.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Transport Association, which is the trade group for the
major carriers, spent nearly $1 million for its lobbying effort
during the first half of this year, according to the Common Cause
study.
</P>
<P>
   Political donations by the industry shot up January-June of this
year, said Common Cause. The airlines contributed $1.3 million to
political parties and candidates in the first half of 1999. In a
comparable period in 1997, they donated $630,000, and in the first
half of 1995, the contributions totalled $306,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like any industry, we participate fully in the political
process,'' Fuscus said. ``There's nothing unusual about that .
We've always been very politically active no matter what the
issue.''

NEW SERIES FROM `X-FILES' CREATOR FILLED WITH ALL THE OLD MOVES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TODD CAMP 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Seems like Chris Carter's ``X-Files'' credo _ ``Trust No One'' _
is quickly becoming the core theme in all his work.
</P>
<P>
   On the ``Files,'' a dark syndicate works within the world's
governments to keep the general public (and especially agents
Mulder and Scully) from discovering the truth about the existence
of extraterrestrial life. On the now-defunct ``Millennium,'' a
shadowy organization called the Millennium Group operating outside
of law enforcement manipulates serial-killer hunter Frank Black for
its own mysterious agenda.
</P>
<P>
   In Carter's new series ``Harsh Realm'' (8 p.m. Thursday on Fox),
the military is his latest target of villainy. Lt. Thomas Hobbes
(Scott Bairstow), a decorated soldier who fought in Sarajevo, is
recruited to test a new military combat-training program _ a
top-secret, virtual-reality simulation game code-named ``Harsh
Realm.''
</P>
<P>
   His mission is to take out the game's highest-scoring player,
Omar Santiago (''Millennium'''s Terry O'Quinn), but as Hobbes
quickly learns, nothing in Harsh Realm is as it seems, and
according to his new companions, this game never ends.
</P>
<P>
   Hobbes becomes the reluctant ally of Mike Pinocchio (D.B.
Sweeney), a grizzled Realmer who knows how to navigate the glitches
in the program allowing access to off-limits areas, and the
mysterious Florence (Rachel Hayward) who's convinced that Hobbes is
the savior they've all been waiting for.
</P>
<P>
   The series premiere has almost all the Carterisms intact: It's
filled with familiar faces (O'Quinn and Lance Henriksen from
``Millennium,'' while ``The X-Files''' Gillian Anderson makes a
cameo in a film voice-over). The hero has an almost blinding
passion to do the ``right'' thing: First you had Mulder's truth,
then Black's justice and now Hobbes' American way. And the whole
thing wraps up with about 50 unanswered questions, leaving viewers
wondering what will happen next. It ends with a typical
``X-Files''-esque shot, an overhead pull-back to reveal hundreds of
soldiers with wires coming out of their heads lying on gurneys in
some top-secret bunker.
</P>
<P>
   Its derivative nature aside, ``Harsh Realm'' isn't to be taken
lightly. Carter has a lot at stake on this new series, especially
with ``Millennium'' canceled and ``The X-Files'' starting its final
season (David Duchovny's leaving the series to pursue a movie
career ... ``Playing God 2'' perhaps?).
</P>
<P>
   But an idealistic soldier battling for control of _ quite
frankly _ a rather ``uninteresting'' alternate reality isn't the
kind of groundbreaking material we've come to expect from a talent
like Carter. It's all stuff that movies (like ``The Matrix'') have
traditionally been better at than television. (Remember ``VR5?)''
</P>
<P>
   In the plus column is Carter's knack for sticking with top
talent. You'll recognize a lot of names from his other shows in the
behind-the-scenes credits _ Frank Spotnitz, Daniel Sackheim, Vince
Gilligan, Tony To _ all of whom have either written or directed
some of the most memorable episodes of Carter's other two series.
There is also the unmistakable atmospheric music of composer Mark
Snow.
</P>
<P>
   In front of the camera, the underappreciated O'Quinn is always
terrific, and Sweeney and Bairstow's gruff chemistry should pay off
in future episodes. The effects are decent, and until Hollywood
successfully beats the VR horse to death (probably sometime next
year), these stories should remain intriguing to a generation
currently under the spell of the Sega Dreamcast.
</P>
<P>
   But if it doesn't work, Carter is sure to have another project
up his sleeve. Perhaps something about a sinister consortium
working within network television, conspiring to sabotage the TV
shows of an idealistic writer who only wants to tell ... the truth.

`BOOGIE' WRITER BACK IN VALLEY  
 APPLAUSE FOR REVENGE
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By BERNARD WEINRAUB   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ It's a day and night of heavy rains in the San
Fernando Valley. Over the course of three hours, in the new film
``Magnolia,'' at least a dozen disparate people intersect in
sometimes odd ways. There's a television game-show host and his
angry, estranged daughter; there's a boy genius who appears on the
game show and his ambitious father; there's a dying old man, his
young sexy wife and his lost son; there's a policeman in love.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's funny,'' said the film's writer-director, Paul Thomas
Anderson, 29. ``I fell in love with movies as an adolescent growing
up in the Valley, and I thought I could never be a great filmmaker
because I had never lived on the mean streets of New York, or I had
never been in a war.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you get past that, and once you think where you're from
and what you've seen makes for good stories, too, you realize you
can do it too.''
</P>
<P>
   No one would dispute that.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson's acclaimed 1997 film, ``Boogie Nights,'' about the
world of pornography in the Valley in the late 1970s and early
'80s, placed him on the map as one of Hollywood's most innovative
and talented young filmmakers. His newest film, which opens in New
York and Los Angeles around Christmas (the exact date has not been
set by New Line Cinema, its distributor), has dazzled early
audiences. Executives at New Line predict that the alternately dark
and funny movie will emerge as one of the most discussed and
controversial films of the new year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Magnolia'' breaks the standard studio mold of the usual
prestige melodrama,'' said Mike DeLuca, New Line's president for
production. ``It doesn't pander, it doesn't manipulate, and it
defies convention with its structure and its imagery. It's a
cinematic wake-up call illustrating what ails us at the end of the
century.''
</P>
<P>
   The film is set on or near Magnolia Boulevard, a main
thoroughfare in the San Fernando Valley. Its common theme seems to
be the loneliness of so many of its characters and the family
relationships and bonds that break and mend over a day and night.
The actors, many of them from ``Boogie Nights,'' include Julianne
Moore, Philip Seymour Hoffman, William H. Macy, John C. Reilly,
Jeremy Blackman, Melinda Dillon and Philip Baker Hall.
</P>
<P>
   Also in the supporting cast are Jason Robards as the dying old
man and, of all people, Tom Cruise, as his son. In an unusual
secondary, but flashy, role for the movie star, Cruise plays a
charismatic sex guru who makes television infomercials for men's
empowerment. Cruise has never before played such an on-the-edge
role. (Associates of Cruise said he might avoid promoting the film
because he did not want to give the impression that ``Magnolia''
was a traditional Cruise movie.)
</P>
<P>
   Anderson said that Cruise had called him after seeing ``Boogie
Nights'' in London, while making Stanley Kubrick's ``Eyes Wide
Shut.'' Coincidentally Anderson was in London, and Cruise invited
him to the movie set to meet Kubrick. (``It was like meeting J.D.
Salinger,'' Anderson said. ``I was thrilled.'')
</P>
<P>
   Cruise also told Anderson to keep him in mind for his next film.
Anderson, who had already begun writing ``Magnolia,'' said he had
him in mind for a role and would call Cruise in six or seven
months.
</P>
<P>
   ``I finally sent him the script, and the next day Tom called me
and said, `Please come to my house to talk about it,''' recalled
Anderson. ``And away we went. What I said to him then was, `If you
hadn't called me, I never would have thought of you.' A movie star
like Tom Cruise was, I thought, out of my reach.''
</P>
<P>
   What may be out of reach for some viewers may be the film's
length: three hours. (``Boogie Nights'' ran 2 hours 35 minutes.)
``The challenge for us, quite simply, is not only having a
three-hour film but also having a film that's not easily described
in a single line,'' said Robert Friedman, co-chairman for marketing
at New Line. ``The challenge is to get people in to see the movie.
Once they do, it's a pretty darn amazing experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson said the people at New Line were ``cool'' to the length
and knew that the movie would be this long from the moment they
received his script. ``Making a movie at this length does set you
up for criticism, and in this day and age it's slightly dangerous
to do.'' He said, ``It's slightly arrogant and a little bold to
require three hours of someone's time to tell a story. It means you
really have to deliver.''
</P>
<P>
   He laughed. ``Like, if I hear a movie I'm going to see is three
hours, I get a little uneasy.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson, whose late father, Ernie Anderson, earned a living
making television voice-overs, is now writing a script for Jonathan
Demme. But he said he promised Demme not to discuss it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not set in the Valley,'' he said. ``I'm getting out of
the Valley.''
</P>

<P>
   Applause for Revenge
</P>
<P>
   To Sherry Lansing, the chairwoman of Paramount, the underlying
message of the unexpected success of ``Double Jeopardy'' is a
simple one: don't underestimate the power of the female audience.
Especially if a film involves revenge by a woman against her venal
husband.
</P>
<P>
   In the thriller, Ashley Judd plays a woman falsely imprisoned
for murdering her husband who has actually run off with her best
friend. They've also taken her young son. When Ms. Judd's character
is finally paroled from prison, well, watch out.
</P>
<P>
   The film received modest reviews. But in its first two weeks it
has unexpectedly soared at the box office and was No. 1, grossing
nearly $50 million so. Last week the film even beat out the highly
promoted ``Three Kings,'' the comedy-drama about three soldiers
seeking a fortune in the Persian Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lansing, as well as Leonard Goldberg, one of the film's
producers, said they realized that ``Double Jeopardy'' had struck a
nerve with female viewers when during test screenings women began
shouting, ``Go, girl, go!'' as Ms. Judd began hunting down the
villainous husband who framed her.
</P>
<P>
   ``It played like a rock concert,'' said Ms. Lansing. ``The
audience just loved it. It was delicious to watch.''
</P>
<P>
   Goldberg, whose television partnership with Aaron Spelling
produced series like ``Starsky and Hutch'' and ``Charlie's
Angels,'' said, ``I don't know what it is about us guys, but women
in the audience seem to love the fact that this is a woman who's
been wronged, becomes resolute, and nothing will stop her from
seeking revenge and getting her kid back.'' The movie, he said, was
especially popular among women in the Midwest and South.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unusually strong in the middle of the country,'' said
Goldberg. ``Actually the ultimate drive in the movie is not so much
revenge but getting her kid back.''
</P>
<P>
   The film, written by David Weisberg and Douglas S. Cook, also
stars Tommy Lee Jones as a burned-out parole officer seeking to
hunt down Ms. Judd's character. It was directed by Bruce Beresford,
who has directed films like ``Tender Mercies'' and ``Driving Miss
Daisy.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Judd said she took the role for two reasons: to work with
Beresford and to play a role that reached beyond the way women were
often depicted in film. ``It goes way beyond the traditional roles
and behavior of women in movies,'' she said. ``And there's a
wonderful adrenaline rush connected to the revenge drive.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Judd, a member of singing Judd family, said that on a
personal level female empowerment issues were not especially new
for her. ``I grew up with role models of women who did exactly what
they wanted to do and when they wanted to do it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lansing has made several successful ``women seeking
revenge'' films before, notably ``The First Wives Club,'' the
comedy in which three older women turn the tables on their husbands
and boyfriends who drop them for younger women.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're striking a chord here, some strong primal need where
women are no longer the victim,'' Ms. Lansing said. ``These movies
are really about female empowerment.''

BUSH STIRS THE WATERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARIANNE MEANS  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Texas Gov. George W. Bush's bold move to capture
the philosophical middle and distance himself from conservative
congressional Republicans not only strengthens his independent
image but exposes the party's far right wing as something of a
paper tiger.
</P>
<P>
   House Republicans screamed that Bush was undercutting their
crusade to retain control of that body next year, but there doesn't
seem to be much they can do about it. Bush is holding a powerful
political hand and he is not afraid to use it.
</P>
<P>
   He can get away with a lot in these days of heady polls,
fantastic fund-raising and weak opposition.
</P>
<P>
   You can't beat somebody with nobody. The religious right that
has dominated internal Republican politics for 20 years has no
single star to rally around this time. Too many insubstantial guys
are out there espousing an identical ideology and chasing the same
clump of voters. And the one major rival with real potential,
Arizona Sen. John McCain, has few friends on the far right.
</P>
<P>
   That's why 20 of the 54 GOP senators, 23 of 31 GOP governors and
148 of 222 GOP House members have already endorsed Bush. They may
be sorry now that Bush is proving to be his own man instead of
theirs, but it's too late. They made their choice prematurely and
they are stuck with it.
</P>
<P>
   Bush feels so confident of winning that he is already running a
general election campaign, risking the ire of right-wing primary
voters who are the party's traditional base. This is nervy, because
he is counting his chickens before the eggs have hatched. As one
disgruntled Republican observed ominously, ``He doesn't have the
nomination yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, he deliberately broke the spirit of an earlier promise
to GOP members of Congress that he would not campaign against them.
The happy scenario of a unified party riding to victory on his
coattails seems suddenly to be developing a tear here and there.
</P>
<P>
   Having criticized his party twice in a week, Bush then backed
off the confrontation by trying to mollify his angry targets. But
if he meant what he initially said, it is an important development
for his candidacy and the country. It was music to ears deadened by
years of partisan cacophony over the role of the federal
government.
</P>
<P>
   Bush complained that his party has spent too much time
``speaking a sterile language of rates and numbers. Too often my
party has confused the need for limited government with a disdain
for government itself,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hooray. This is the kind of common sense, centrist politics that
President Clinton has practiced brilliantly and that is important
to continue into the next century. When Clinton announced that the
era of big government was dead _ to be replaced by a smaller but
still activist government _ he moved public perceptions of the
Democratic party from the left fringes into the political
mainstream.
</P>
<P>
   If Republicans learned anything from the government shutdowns of
1995 and 1996, it should be that voters don't think government is
always the problem. They want basic services that only government
can provide but they want them delivered fairly and efficiently,
without ideological cant.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is trying to pull his party away from the right, as Clinton
pulled his from the left. Hopefully, this means the 2000
presidential campaign may focus on substantive issues of where the
country is going rather than the hateful wedge issues that
preoccupy the zealots.
</P>
<P>
   A classic example of this philosophical shift is Bush's blunt
rejection of the House GOP's desperate scheme to stay within budget
spending limits by delaying government payments to the working
poor. ``I don't think they ought to balance their budget on the
backs of the poor,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The transparent gimmick was already dying, but after Bush spoke,
the wretched thing was finished.
</P>
<P>
   Bush went further, denouncing a Republican tendency to take a
sour view of our national standards and our culture.``Too often on
social issues my party has painted an image of America slouching
toward Gomorrah,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He was repeating the title of a negative, carping book by Robert
Bork, a Supreme Court nominee defeated in the Senate because of his
nutty interpretation of constitutional rights. As much as anyone in
public life, Bork symbolizes radical right-wing fringe thinking.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush does not seem prepared to go much beyond what he said
recently. He is not challenging the gun lobby or the anti-abortion
crowd. He stands with his party in its basic objection to campaign
finance overhaul. He wants to shave off the unpopular edges but not
destabilize the Republican structure, which he must run on.
</P>
<P>
   This is good thinking, so long as he remains the unchallenged
frontrunner. If he falters, however, he may find that conservatives
have long memories and a few teeth after all.

 The Gainesville Sun    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   GAINESVILLE, Fla. _ Buildings have three dimensions. Pictures of
a building, however, have two.
</P>
<P>
   That posed a challenge for Duane Ellifritt, a University of
Florida civil engineering professor. More than a decade ago,
Ellifritt was searching for a way to help his students get a sense
of how things are built.
</P>
<P>
   His idea: to build a 14-foot high teaching sculpture that shows
how pieces of steel can be shaped and connected. In the 13 years
since it went up, almost 100 universities have copied Ellifritt's
idea. On Thursday, the University of Florida honored the original.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's such a simple idea,'' said Ellifritt, 64. ``I'm surprised
no one ever thought of it before I did.''
</P>
<P>
   A tall, red column stands at the center of the 10-ton red
sculpture. Smaller beams poke out from the column, illustrating the
different connections engineers use to bring steel pieces together.
With no two pieces exactly alike on the sculpture, it also shows
the variety of sizes and shapes steel can take.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are channels, angles, rods, pipes, I-beams,'' Ellifritt
said.
</P>
<P>
   The sculpture sat for years behind Weil Hall before the
university moved it this spring to a more visible location on the
building's west side. A formal dedication in the new location was
held Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The sculpture grew out of the difficulty students said they had
visualizing some objects in three dimensions, Ellifritt said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a textbook, it's always seen in two-dimensional view,'' he
said. ``So it was hard for them to visualize some of these
things.''
</P>
<P>
   Looking to remedy this, Ellifritt had several ideas. He likes to
take his classes on field trips, but Gainesville does not always
have a construction site that students can visit. He said he also
thought about building models and carrying them into class, ``but
the stuff is heavy.''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, he thought of building the teaching sculpture. After
the idea gained administrators' support, Steel Fabricators Inc. of
Fort Lauderdale built and donated it.
</P>
<P>
   Since the sculpture was first erected at the university in
October 1986, other schools have used the idea. Borrowing plans
from the original, universities in Canada, Mexico and across United
States have built sculptures.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got one here,'' said Chuck Moretti, civil engineering chair
at the University of North Dakota in Grand Forks. ``We like it.''
</P>
<P>
   A metal construction firm in Fargo, N.D., 80 miles to the south,
built and donated it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We poured a concrete slab and set it up ourselves,'' he said.
``We've got it sitting out by our building. It's kind of almost an
art sculpture.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   (italics)Here is a selective listing by critics of The Times of
new or noteworthy movies and film series playing this weekend in
New York City. (Star) denotes a highly recommended film or series.
Ratings and running times are in parentheses.(end italics) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Now Playing &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (Star) ``AMERICAN BEAUTY,'' starring Kevin Spacey, Annette
Bening, Chris Cooper, Wes Bentley and Thora Birch. Written by Alan
Ball. Directed by Sam Mendes (R, 116 minutes).
</P>
<P>
   With heavenly finesse, Spacey plays a buttoned-down 42-year-old
suburbanite who flips his lid for a teen-age cheerleader. And he
never gets it back on. The midlife crisis motif is familiar, but
the stage director Sam Mendes brings terrific visual flair and dry
humor to this barbecuing of the bourgeoisie. All the actors display
coolly expert timing, especially Ms. Bening as the antihero's
grasping wife.
</P>
<P>
   Although the story spreads itself thin among many characters,
the film coalesces for a devastating finale (Janet Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   ``DOUBLE JEOPARDY,'' starring Ashley Judd, Tommy Lee Jones and
Bruce Greenwood. Directed by Bruce Beresford (R, 106 minutes).
</P>
<P>
   In a touristy thriller that roams from the coastline of
Washington State to New Orleans' French Quarter, Ms. Judd plays a
woman who's free to kill her husband because she's already gone to
prison for the crime (see title).
</P>
<P>
   Not even she is beautiful enough to get away with rote acting
and a far-fetched plot, but she perks up as her character becomes
less of a victim. In this co-ed homage to ``The Fugitive,'' Jones
is on hand as another weathered sourpuss with a knack for barking
orders. Beresford directs so unremarkably that it takes a line like
``I feel like I've grown in the last six years'' to signal the
passage of time (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   (Star) ``EARTH,'' starring Aamir Khan, Nandita Das, Rahul Khanna
and Maia Sethna. Directed by Deepa Mehta (not rated, 99 minutes).
</P>
<P>
   It is 1947, and India is about to explode into ethnic violence
as British colonial rule ends and the country is partitioned into
two nations, mostly Hindu India and mostly Muslim Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   These momentous changes are observed by Lenny (Ms. Sethna), the
8-year-old daughter of a well-to-do Parsi family in Lahore. As
Hindus, Muslims and Sikhs slaughter one another in the streets, old
friends become deadly enemies. Caught in the middle is Shanta (Ms.
Das), Lenny's beautiful Hindu nanny, who has two Muslim suitors.
The movie's child's-eye view somewhat mutes its dramatic sweep
(Stephen Holden).
</P>
<P>
   ``FOR LOVE OF THE GAME,'' starring Kevin Costner and Kelly
Preston. Directed by Sam Raimi (PG-13, 140 minutes).
</P>
<P>
   This film, starring Costner as Billy Chapel, an aging Detroit
Tigers pitcher, is a baseball movie the way ``You've Got Mail'' was
a movie about the retail book business. Deep down the film is
really about the love of a difficult man for a good woman, played
by Ms. Preston. The baseball story, thanks to Costner's athletic
credibility (see ``Bull Durham'' and ``Field of Dreams'') and a
complement of real ballplayers, works better than the romance.
</P>
<P>
   Taken together, they add up to routine entertainment, because
the overloaded love story doesn't really tug the heartstrings.
Underlying the story of Chapel's crucial game is the story of his
five-year romance with Jane (Ms. Preston), seen in flashbacks, as
he tries to coax one more win out of a worn-out arm. Is it time for
Chapel to quit?
</P>
<P>
   Filmmaking, like baseball, is a team game, and sometimes even a
talented lineup produces unexceptional results (Lawrence Van
Gelder).
</P>
<P>
   ``GUINEVERE,'' starring Sarah Polley and Stephen Rea. Written
and directed by Audrey Wells (R, 104 minutes).
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Polley shines as a shy, rebellious 21-year-old involved in
an affair with an older man. Escaping her chilly family, she moves
into the well-populated space beneath the wing of a bohemian
photographer, played with great charm by Rea. This coming-of-age
film takes a knowing, intimate view of the dynamics of such a
relationship and watches its heroine blossom. So does Ms. Polley,
as a luminous, mysterious young actress capable of exceptionally
subtle shadings (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   ``HAPPY, TEXAS,'' starring Jeremy Northam, Steve Zahn and
William H. Macy. Directed by Mark Illsley (R, 96 minutes).
</P>
<P>
   The zany comedy follows two escaped convicts (Northam and Zahn)
who pose as a pair of gay pageant producers in a small Texas town
that is grooming its little girls for the Little Miss Squeezed
Pageant. Macy is poignant as the discreetly gay, doe-eyed sheriff
who shyly pursues Northam (who's only posing as gay). Zahn has his
amusing moments as an oaf improvising ludicrous dance routines. But
the movie is so desperate to be liked that its satire is risk-free
and toothless, and its laughs widely scattered (Holden). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``JAKOB THE LIAR,'' starring Robin Williams, Alan Arkin, Liev
Schreiber and Armin Mueller-Stahl. Directed by Peter Kassovitz
(PG-13, 114 minutes).
</P>
<P>
   In a Holocaust story to make Roberto Benigni look like Primo
Levi, Williams plays a man who brightens life in a Polish ghetto
with imaginary good news about the imminent end of the war.
Surrounded by a strong supporting cast (with Arkin giving the
film's only genuinely funny performance), he again indulges that
unfortunate yen to play the clown who cried.
</P>
<P>
   The direction is sincere but sloppy. Watch the microphone make
repeated, unwelcome entrances from the top of the frame (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   (Star) ``LUCIE AUBRAC,'' starring Carole Bouquet and Daniel
Auteuil. Produced, written and directed by Claude Berri (R, 116
minutes).
</P>
<P>
   What lifts this taut World War II thriller based on a true story
above the ordinary are the impassioned performances of Ms. Bouquet
and Auteuil as Lucie and Raymond, a married couple who are fighters
in the French Resistance. When Raymond is arrested by the Nazis and
convicted of war crimes, Lucie conceives an outrageously audacious
plan for his escape.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Bouquet and Auteuil are as romantically intense as Bogey and
Bergman in ``Casablanca,'' but here the woman is the one who ends
up doing the thinking for both of them (Holden).
</P>
<P>
   (Star) ``MUMFORD,'' starring Loren Dean, Hope Davis, Jason Lee,
Alfre Woodard and Mary McDonnell. Written and directed by Lawrence
Kasdan (R, 115 minutes).
</P>
<P>
   An immensely likable semiscrewball comedy from the director of
``The Big Chill,'' ``Mumford'' follows the adventures of an
engaging charlatan psychotherapist (Dean) fleeing a sleazy former
life, who names himself after the town (Mumford) in which he
settles and helps a lot of troubled people, even though he is
without credentials.
</P>
<P>
   His most endearing client ( Lee) is a warm, fuzzy billionaire
computer nerd who loves to skateboard but finds it's lonely at the
top. Mumford's moral ambiguity (he's both a hero and a fraud) keeps
this delightful Frank Capraesque fable of self-invention from
becoming too sappy (Holden).
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``MYSTERY, ALASKA,'' starring Russell Crowe, Hank Azaria, Ryan
Northcott, Mary McCormack and Burt Reynolds. Directed by Jay Roach
(R, 119 minutes).
</P>
<P>
   The king of television drama David E. Kelley co-produced and
helped write the satirically edged meat-and-potatoes story of a
legendary ice hockey team in the small town of Mystery, Alaska,
that is persuaded to play the New York Rangers in a televised
exhibition match.
</P>
<P>
   With its skillfully interwoven personal dramas of assorted
townspeople, the movie is a convincingly likable portrait of a
modern pioneer community under siege from the media. But it begins
to lose its punch when the story settles into the all-too-familiar
``Rocky'' formula. It includes strong performances by Crowe (as the
town sheriff) and Reynolds (as an imperious local judge) (Holden). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``PLUNKETT AND MACLEANE,'' starring Jonny Lee Miller and Robert
Carlyle. Directed by Jake Scott (R, 102 minutes).
</P>
<P>
   Miller and Carlyle, who were co-stars in ``Trainspotting,'' are
a pair of dashing 18th-century highwaymen who scandalize (and
titillate) the aristocracy with their daring robberies of rich
people in carriages. Although the overdirected movie has many weak
moments (an impenetrable opening sequence and far too many
close-ups), its portrayal of the English aristocracy as a bunch of
voracious, corrupt gargoyles living out an 18th-century version of
a Studio 54 life style carries a nasty satirical bite (Holden). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``ROMANCE,'' starring Caroline Ducey, Sagamore Stevenin,
Francois Berleand and Rocco Siffredi. Written and directed by
Catherine Breillat (not rated, 93 minutes).
</P>
<P>
   A solemn, sexually graphic exploration of the nature of a
woman's need for male attention and erotic love, even if its
insights are already familiar to readers of Cosmopolitan and the
Marquis de Sade. And it's doubtful that the film's intellectual
aspects would command the same attention if its camera did not make
the actors' genitals as familiar as their faces.
</P>
<P>
   The carnal and cerebral erotica here have already achieved the
considerable feat of shocking France, but the film is often stilted
and methodical to the point of tediousness. It hovers between
passion and philosophical argument without often achieving Ms.
Breillat's ambition to fuse the two (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   ``THE SIXTH SENSE,'' starring Bruce Willis and Haley Joel
Osment. Written and directed by M. Night Shyamalan (PG-13, 107
minutes).
</P>
<P>
   What starts out as a horror movie about a troubled 8-year-old
boy ( Osment) who claims to see dead people, and the child
psychologist ( Willis) determined to cure him, eventually turns
into New Age mush (think ``What Dreams May Come'' and ``Simon
Birch'').
</P>
<P>
   When you trace the plot backward after its big secret is
revealed, the story doesn't begin to add up. Willis gives his usual
smirking one-note performance. What empathy the movie generates
comes from Osment's intense portrayal of the tormented child
(Holden).
</P>
<P>
   ``STIGMATA,'' starring Patricia Arquette, Gabriel Byrne and
Jonathan Pryce. Directed by Rupert Wainwright (R, 102 minutes).
</P>
<P>
   When Frankie Paige (Ms. Arquette), a vapid Pittsburgh
hairdresser, receives the present of a rosary lifted from the dead
body of a Brazilian priest, her life becomes a supernatural horror
show. Byrne is the Vatican cleric who investigates the case and
Pryce the evil cardinal who wants to cover up evidence that could
damage the church.
</P>
<P>
   The seizures in this poorly acted melange of shock effects and
religious imagery are bargain-basement ``Exorcist.'' Instead of pea
soup and spinning heads, we get breaking glass, dripping blood and
flurries of feathers from agitated doves (Holden).
</P>
<P>
   ``STIR OF ECHOES,'' starring Kevin Bacon and Kathryn Erbe.
Directed by David Koepp (R, 99 minutes).
</P>
<P>
   Another little boy talks to a ghost at the start of this
thriller, but it isn't an instant ``Sixth Sense'' sequel. Instead
it shows what happens when the boy's closed-minded father lets
himself be hypnotized and awakens to find himself receiving
otherworldly stimuli. Bacon gives a grippingly intense performance
as a man terrified by his new extrasensory powers. And Koepp
conveys a potent sense of what it means to unravel.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its strong, spooky start and early momentum, the film
winds up with too earthbound an explanation for the havoc it
unleashes (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   ``THREE KINGS,'' starring George Clooney, Mark Wahlberg and Ice
Cube. Written and directed by David O. Russell (R, 105 minutes).
</P>
<P>
   The prodigiously talented writer-director of ``Spanking the
Monkey'' and ``Flirting With Disaster'' has made a much more
ambitious film, with mixed results. His gimlet-eyed Persian Gulf
War film has a ``Catch-22'' absurdist edge, but it also has an
oversupply of visual affectations.
</P>
<P>
   Vertiginous music-video camera tricks jazz up the otherwise
straightforward story of American soldiers who have larcenous
designs on Saddam Hussein's captured gold and then develop
conscience pangs about their own roles in Iraq. There are many
clever peripheral touches, but there's something tamely
conventional at the film's core (Maslin).

 &HT;    NAZI CAMP WORKERS REJECT NEW GERMAN SETTLEMENT OFFER
 &HT;    By LARRY LIPMAN
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ German negotiators Thursday offered $3.3 billion to
Nazi-era victims of slave labor, but lawyers for the aging
survivors rejected the offer.
</P>
<P>
   The latest offer _ 6 billion Deutsche marks _ is three times
higher than the amount offered earlier this year to settle more
than 40 cases in U.S. federal courts.
</P>
<P>
   How many victims might be eligible is still undetermined. German
negotiators put the figure at roughly 1 million, while survivor
advocates put it at about 2.3 million.
</P>
<P>
   Mel Weiss, lead attorney representing the victims, said he was
``appalled'' by the latest German offer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Despicable is too weak a word to describe it,'' Weiss said
after two days of talks here at the U.S. State Department.
Negotiations are scheduled to resume next month in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   The amount that German companies have offered to pay survivors
of slave labor is about five times less than comparable settlements
reached in Germany, Weiss said.
</P>
<P>
   The German offer, two-thirds of which would be paid by 35 major
corporations and the remaining third by the German government,
translates to about $5,263 per slave laborer _ those who worked in
concentration camps or similar facilities.
</P>
<P>
   Forced laborers, who worked under slightly less onerous
conditions, would receive about $1,548, while those who suffered
other injuries, such as being used for medical experiments, would
receive about $1,400.
</P>
<P>
   German government envoy Otto Lambsdorff called the $3.3 billion
offer ``a considerable amount given the budget constraints in
Germany.'' Lambsdorff said it was not easy to convince the German
people to make such reparations at a time when services to German
citizens were being reduced.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Secretary of State Stuart Eizenstat said the German offer
``represents a basis for serious discussion,'' but he warned that
``in order for this to succeed, both sides are going to have to be
flexible.''

 (Editors: The following text accompanies the weather map for
Friday, Oct. 8, sent to computer graphics clients of The New York
Times News Service. For information call 212-556-4204.) 
(th) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The day will begin bright and cold across the Northeast on
Friday. Amid plentiful sunshine, breezes from the south will bring
noticeably milder air to the region by the afternoon. Farther west,
a strong difference between high pressure near the New England
coast and low pressure over Ontario will cause brisk, warm winds
from the southwest to buffet the Great Lakes. Indeed, gusts will
exceed 30 mph near Lake Erie.
</P>
<P>
   Moist air will surge north through the Mississippi Valley,
setting the stage for heavy showers and thunderstorms from
Louisiana to Arkansas. Though the region has been dry recently,
local flooding is possible. Additional rain will occur Friday
evening.
</P>
<P>
   Farther west, a broken line of potent thunderstorms will affect
eastern New Mexico and western Texas on Friday as a potent jet
stream disturbance intercepts a flow of humid air from the Gulf of
Mexico. Meanwhile, winds shifting direction with increasing
altitude will induce a few of the storms to rotate. These rotating
thunderstorms, called supercells, are capable of producing
tornadoes.
</P>
<P>
   Subsiding currents of air associated with high pressure over the
Great Basin will bring abundant sun to much of the West on Friday.
Offshore breezes in California will promote unseasonable warmth at
the coast. Further north, moist winds from the Pacific Ocean will
cause scattered showers across northern Washington. As the moist
winds ascend the higher terrain to the east, showers will dampen
the Bitterroots.
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: TIME-RELEASED FLOODS
</P>
<P>
   Serious river flooding is like time-released weather _ brimming
waters recede back between their banks slowly. Thursday, several
rivers in North Carolina remained above flood stage in the
aftermath of heavy rains from Hurricane Floyd more than two weeks
ago. It takes time for water in streams and tributaries to drain
into the main river system and then more time for the river to
crest and recede. During the Great Midwest Flood of 1993, the
Mississippi River stayed above flood stage for 80 consecutive days
at St. Louis and above record stage for more than three weeks.

`HARSH REALM': WHEN LIFE BECOMES A NIGHTMARISH VIDEO-GAME WAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Production notes are at end of review)  
 (af)  
 By RON WERTHEIMER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Warning: Chris Carter wants to hijack your brain. Again. And
after shuddering through Friday night's premiere of ``Harsh Realm''
on Fox, you may be ready to surrender.
</P>
<P>
   Carter, the creator of ``The X-Files'' and ``Millennium,'' has
concocted another nightmare world. This time he plunks you down
inside a virtual-reality simulation that's virtually impossible to
understand. No matter. You're not supposed to understand it. You're
only supposed to watch it, and to empathize with the series'
boyishly appealing hero, Lt. Thomas Hobbes, played by Scott
Bairstow.
</P>
<P>
   As things begin, Hobbes is about to complete his Army service in
New Jersey, marry his beloved Sophie (Samantha Mathis) and start a
new life in California with her and his little dog, Dexter. But the
Army has one last order: He must try his hand at a top-secret
virtual-reality training game, Harsh Realm, attempting to beat the
reigning high scorer, a guy named Santiago.
</P>
<P>
   In the blink of a horrified eye Hobbes finds himself submerged
in a bleak, war-torn landscape ruled by an evil dictator named
Santiago (Terry O'Quinn). Being high scorer obviously has its
perks.
</P>
<P>
   There are some familiar faces in this place, but only Dexter has
retained his original identity. (See, Hobbes and his little dog
aren't in New Jersey anymore.) Sophie is here, but she doesn't know
Hobbes. In this place she is married to Hobbes' pal, Lt. Mel Waters
(Maximilian Martini), who is the commander of Santiago's forces.
</P>
<P>
   But Waters does know his friend, and he delivers some unsettling
news: ``The game _ get in, get out, get Santiago _ it's all a lie,
Hobbes. There is no game. No gettin' out. No goin' home.''
</P>
<P>
   Waters says that he, too, was sent to beat Santiago, but had no
choice but to join him. Hobbes isn't in a joining mood. Instead, he
falls in with some shadowy rebels, including a resourceful fellow
named Pinocchio (D.B. Sweeney). They are convinced that Hobbes is
the savior they have been hoping for.
</P>
<P>
   You begin to see that this spiraling story is built with
familiar elements whose sources range from cinema to Scripture.
Still, you quickly join Hobbes in accepting an environment you can
neither believe nor understand.
</P>
<P>
   Carter has provided another tale of a good person in a bad
world. But by giving Hobbes a more personal quest _ to complete his
assignment and get home; to preserve his dream, not save the world
_ he is giving his latest dark fable a heart full of hope as well
as a head full of fear.
</P>
<P>
   Each twist in the story asks more disturbing questions. Is
Hobbes in a game? Can he trust anyone he meets? Can he trust his
own senses? Can he ever get home? Does home still exist? How many
conspiracy theories can dance on the head of a pin?
</P>
<P>
   Based on Carter's track record, the answers will not be easy to
come by. But that shouldn't prevent you from following Hobbes
willingly along his twisted road, even if it isn't paved with
yellow bricks. &QL;

   LOVE AND MONEY &QL;
</P>
<P>
   CBS, Friday night at 8:30 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (Channel 2 in New York) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In her new television role the dependable Swoosie Kurtz plays
Effie Conklin, an alcoholic matron trapped in a gilt-edged world
with her cold, bombastic husband and their three foolish,
overeducated children. The look of bone-deep misery on her face
could break your heart. At least until the laugh track starts
howling. David Ogden Stiers, as her husband, Nicholas, howls, too,
through one more stuffed-shirt role. The other actors mostly
whimper.
</P>
<P>
   The Conklins are the money of the title. The love is the romance
between their daughter Allison (Paget Brewster) and Eamon McBride
(Brian Van Holt).
</P>
<P>
   Allison has degrees from Yale and Harvard and teaches
kindergarten in the Bronx. Eamon is the handsome superintendent who
lives with his dad the doorman (Brian Doyle-Murray) in the basement
of the swanky Manhattan building where the Conklins have a duplex
penthouse.
</P>
<P>
   Allison's brother, Nicky (John Livingston), who describes
himself as the ``jobless son,'' and her sister, Puff (Judy Greer),
who describes herself as the ``blond nympho,'' complete the
upstairs family.
</P>
<P>
   In Friday night's first episode, a household emergency rekindles
the long-ago fire between Eamon and Allison, scuttling her wedding
to a rich twit. Next week's installment finds everyone trying
unsuccessfully to cope. The script is no help.
</P>
<P>
   Allison: ``So, you're my boyfriend now?''
</P>
<P>
   Eamon: ``Yeah. Of course I am. I mean, uh, we just did it in the
elevator.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kurtz gives her scenes some class. But the tragic look in
her eye says it all: This is hopeless. &QL;

   CONGRESS-HEALTH (Washington) _ Developments. The House approves
bipartisan legislation granting new rights to patients, including a
broad ability to sue their health insurance companies for denying
care. By Robert Pear.
</P>
<P>
   With photo.
</P>
<P>
   BUSH-CAMPAIGN (Washington) _ Gov. George W. Bush's public
statements suggest a willingness to use his commanding position in
the Republican presidential race to challenge some of the party's
assumptions about what it stands for. But as he starts to set out
specific positions, particularly on high visibility issues like
taxes and economic policy, Bush is by no means abandoning the basic
conservative principles that have defined the party at least since
the Reagan administration. By Richard W. Stevenson and Frank Bruni.
</P>
<P>
   INDIA-POLITICS (New Delhi, India) _ The verdict of some 360
million Indian voters is announced: The Hindu nationalist Bharatiya
Janata Party, once seen as the ugly, anti-Muslim face of Hindu
revivalism, wins a clear victory as the leader of a centrist
coalition of 24 parties that appears likely to offer India its most
durable government in several years. By Celia W. Dugger. 1,700
words.
</P>
<P>
   FENPHEN-SUIT (Undated) _ American Home Products will pay $3.75
billion to settle claims over fen-phen, its diet drug combination.
As part of the settlement, American Home will pay for medical
monitoring and make cash injury awards of up to $1.5 million. By
David J. Morrow.
</P>
<P>
   SWEDEN-ECON (Stockholm, Sweden) _ At a time when world leaders
are fixated on the United States' economic success and its credo of
less government and unfettered competition, Sweden suddenly appears
to be defying gravity. In a turnaround that has surprised Swedes as
much as anybody else, this largely unreconstructed welfare state is
suddenly one of Europe's most vibrant economies. And after nearly
three decades of sluggishness in which the output per person
slumped from third highest in the world to 18th, just behind Italy,
the Swedish economy is in the midst of a powerful transformation.
By Edmund L. Andrews. 2,000 words.
</P>
<P>
   TEST-BAN-REACT (Vienna, Austria) _ Speakers at a conference
convene to press for ratification of the nuclear test-ban treaty,
including Russia and China, make clear that the most critical
factor for the treaty's fate was the debates underway in the U.S.
Senate. By Donald G. McNeil Jr. 1,100 words.
</P>
<P>
   COLLEGES-ECONOMY (Cambridge, Mass.) _ The much-trumpeted
``knowledge'' (or information or innovation) economy consists of
much more than Silicon Valley. Across America, researchers say,
high-tech is creating localized boomlets like the one here in
Kendall Square, which houses not only biotech but software and
other companies. And if there is one never-fail factor at work on
these silicon corners, it is the nearness of a research university
shifting from ivory tower to revving economic engine. By Carey
Goldberg. 2,300 words.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Drivers suffering through highway construction
projects may console themselves with the thought that when the work
is done the traffic will flow faster and their trips will be
shorter. But that is not always so, according to the Surface
Transportation Policy Project, a group that favors other methods to
cut traffic, like mass transit and land-use planning.
</P>
<P>
   The nonprofit group, which is based in Washington, issued a
report in September that analyzed several large highway projects
and calculated how many years a commuter driving through the
construction zone every day would have to keep driving after the
work was finished to break even on the time lost to work delays.
</P>
<P>
   For a $85 million project in Trenton, N.J., to turn a two-lane
stretch of Route 29 into a four-lane road with full shoulders, the
job will delay the average commuter about 10 minutes a trip, or
more than 80 hours a year. Work began a year ago and is expected to
last for two more years, The finished road will save drivers 25
hours a year, the report said, basing its estimates on figures from
the New Jersey Department of Transportation.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, the break-even point _ the date at which the Trenton
commuter recoups the time lost because of the construction _ will
come in 2012.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem in New Jersey and elsewhere is what the
study calls induced travel, which, it said, ``occurs when road
capacity is expanded and drivers flock to the new facility hoping
to save time.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Also, the new roadways tend to draw people who would otherwise
avoid congested conditions or take alternative modes to their
destinations,'' the study said. ``In the long run, this encourages
additional development nearby, and that leads to even more
traffic.''
</P>
<P>
   If that is bad for New Jersey, it is even worse for Virginia,
where a project to rebuild the intersection of the Washington
Beltway and Interstates 95 and 395 began this year. By late fall,
the construction work will cause delays of 30 to 60 minutes, unless
some commuters take other routes or switch to trains, state
officials say. As a result, drivers in Virginia who wait that long
in traffic every day will never win back the lost time, the report
said. That is another way of saying that the traffic will get worse
even faster than the roads will get better.
</P>
<P>
   The road-building lobby, of course, had a different take. The
American Highway Users Alliance said it was wrong to suggest that
the new roads had no benefit, because they served a population that
the study itself acknowledged was ``choosing to drive more cars
more miles than population growth would indicate.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you build a new transit system and it eventually fills up,
everyone considers it a success,'' said William Fay, president of
the alliance. ``Why isn't the same standard used for new
highways?''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Drivers More Sober; Older, Too
</P>
<P>
   The rate of drunken driving arrests is falling sharply, perhaps
for the same reason that crime is down over all: The population is
getting older and thus more law-abiding, according to the Justice
Department.
</P>
<P>
   A study released in June found that from 1986 to 1997, the
number of people arrested for driving under the influence of
alcohol or drugs (the majority of whom had been drinking) fell to
1.5 million from 1.8 million, while the number of licensed drivers
increased 15 percent. The rate of arrests per 100,000 drivers fell
to 809 from 1,124.
</P>
<P>
   But the number in jail, in prison or on probation soared, to
513,200, nearly double the 270,100 in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   In both years, older drivers were arrested less often than
younger ones. In 1997, 54 percent of licensed drivers were 40 or
older, up from 46 percent in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   The study can be viewed on the Web site of the department's
Bureau of Justice Statistics: http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs.
</P>
<P>
   The findings paint a bleak picture of those who are in jail or
on probation. Of those on probation, 37 percent showed signs of
alcohol dependency, the study said; for those in jail, the figure
was 47 percent. Among probationers, 46 percent said they had
received treatment from a professional for alcohol abuse since they
were sentenced. Such treatment is often a condition of probation.
</P>
<P>
   But only 4 percent of those in jail said they were currently in
treatment, the Justice Department study found.

A BRAND NEW CLUB AND ROSEMARY CLOONEY, AN AGELESS STAR  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ With the grand opening on Tuesday evening of a
150-seat supper club at the Regency Hotel bearing the name of the
singer and pianist Michael Feinstein (who is booking the club in
partnership with the Tisch family), Feinstein's at the Regency has
become the first high-end supper club to cast its hat in the
cabaret ring since the demise of Rainbow and Stars.
</P>
<P>
   The club, equipped with a new sound and lighting system,
occupies the hotel's ``power breakfast'' restaurant and has a cozy,
librarylike atmosphere. But will it fly? Feinstein's at the Regency
is expensive. If it books more performers of the stature of
Rosemary Clooney, who opened a two-week engagement there on
Tuesday, it stands a fighting chance of survival. But following
Feinstein, who comes in on Oct. 19, who might those performers be?
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Clooney, who is 71 and in very good voice despite being
slightly short of breath, is an icon of naturalness in a realm
where affectation often tries to pass for depth. Blunt, jolly and
loquacious, she projects the warmth of a den mother opening her
arms to her flock. When she sings, with perfect enunciation, a
casually swinging authority and a sound that still conveys a flavor
of spring flowers, you're less aware of technique and
interpretation than of a life poured directly into song.
</P>
<P>
   Even at the beginning of her career, Ms. Clooney conveyed a
no-nonsense directness that ruled out attitudinizing and hysteria.
Today that quality is even more pronounced. The bulk of her new
show is divided into blocks of songs by individual composers: three
by Dave Frishberg, three Duke Ellington standards and three with
lyrics by Johnny Mercer.
</P>
<P>
   Supported by a superb pop-jazz sextet under the direction of
John Oddo, Ms. Clooney repeatedly demonstrated her gift for
transforming the simple into the profound. The evening's
show-stopper was a pensive version of ``When October Goes,'' Barry
Manilow's posthumous setting of an almost doggerel-like Mercer
lyric about memory, regret and the passage of time that conveyed a
bittersweet message: our deepest emotional wounds never completely
heal.  &QL;

JEFF GORDON PROVED A POINT WITH MARTINSVILLE WIN 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By PATRICK ZIER   
 Lakeland (Fla.) Ledger   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was not Jeff Gordon's biggest win. It may have been his most
important.
</P>
<P>
   Last Sunday at Martinsville, Va., running for the first time
without crew chief Ray Evernham calling the shots, Gordon gambled
with 15 laps to go and won for the his sixth time this season.
</P>
<P>
   Only days earlier, Evernham had ended months of speculation
about his future by announcing he was leaving Hendrick Motorsports,
which owns Gordon's car, to form his own team.
</P>
<P>
   Since they came up together at the end of the 1992 season,
Gordon and Evernham have developed into the most powerful
combination in Winston Cup racing. Gordon's rapid rise was
attributed to Evernham's brilliance.
</P>
<P>
   But Sunday in the NAPA AutoCare 500, with new crew chief Brian
Whitesell making an Evernham-like call at the end of the race,
Gordon proved he can win without the master, something Evernham has
been saying for a long time.
</P>
<P>
   With 15 laps to go, while all the other fast cars pitted, Gordon
stayed out and finished first.
</P>
<P>
   ``That answers a lot of questions, doesn't it?'' Gordon asked
after the race.
</P>
<P>
   Whitesell was the team's engineer before being picked by
Evernham as his replacement. Although Evernham was still there
looking over his shoulder, Whitesell's ability to make decisions
under pressure has given Gordon a boost.
</P>
<P>
   It says something about the level of excellence Gordon has
achieved that, despite winning six races this season, Gordon is
considered to be having an off year.
</P>
<P>
   That's because he hasn't been as consistently superior as he has
in the past, seeming to run either really well or very poorly.
</P>
<P>
   ``The effort has been there, the performance has been there, but
the finishes haven't been there,'' Gordon said.
</P>
<P>
   In some respects, his situation this year is similar to 1995,
when he struggled early, made a strong midseason run and then held
off Dale Earnhardt at the end to win his first Winston Cup title.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1995, Gordon led at least one lap in 29 of the 31 races,
and he has not been able to do that this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if it's really the same,'' Gordon said. ``In
1995, we had the new Monte Carlo. It was a very dominant race car
and our team took that dominance a step further.
</P>
<P>
   ``The dominance of the Monte Carlo at so many different tracks
made up for the bad finishes,'' Gordon said.
</P>
<P>
   If Evernham had to go, this is probably as good a time as any,
from the team's standpoint.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, a new Monte Carlo is being built, set to debut at
Daytona in 2000 with Hendrick Motorsports on the cutting edge.
</P>
<P>
   New body styles mean new chassis setups, and while it wouldn't
have been pushed back to square one, Gordon's team will have to go
through a learning curve, and that would have been true even if
Evernham had stayed.
</P>
<P>
   ``There isn't a guy on our team who doesn't believe in what
we're doing,'' Gordon said. ``We don't second guess ourselves or
point fingers, and team attitude goes a long way.''

WINE-GRAPE HARVESTERS RUSH TO MEET THE CRUSH  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By RANDI ROSSMANN   
 The Press Democrat, Santa Rosa, Calif.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA ROSA, Calif. _ This year's grape harvest was late to start
but may be quick to finish as wineries hustle to bring in the $600
million wine grape crop.
</P>
<P>
   ``The harvest is going very rapidly, they're taking out the
grapes en masse,'' said Nick Frey, executive director of the Sonoma
County Grape Growers Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a quick, short harvest. We're rocking and rolling and
could be done next week,'' said Jim Caudill, spokesman for
Kendall-Jackson Winery.
</P>
<P>
   Slight precipitation Tuesday evening caused the crush to slow
somewhat in wetter areas, but the weather has cleared and
forecasters are calling for sunny, warm days through the end of the
week.
</P>
<P>
   The crush appears to be at least halfway over for most of
northern California, said Pierre Gadd, Sonoma County's chief deputy
agriculture commissioner.
</P>
<P>
   The county's grape harvest started out two to three weeks later
than normal because of the cool summer. Then two weeks ago, rain
caused some concern among growers as only 10 percent of the
county's 153,000-ton wine grape crop had been harvested.
</P>
<P>
   But last week's warmer weather brought up the sugar level in the
grapes. ``Since then they've been going pretty much full bore,''
Gadd said.
</P>
<P>
   The wineries are bursting at the seams with ripened grapes and
many growers are gathering their crop round the clock, Caudill
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hot weather caused everything to ripen pretty quickly,
rather unexpectedly,'' he said. ``We were sort of prepared for
everything because the weather has been so screwy this year.''
</P>
<P>
   The return to cooler weather early this week helped stabilize
the sugar levels, said Caudill, who didn't see the trace of rain
Tuesday as a problem at this point. ``As long as it's a little bit
it really doesn't do much but shuffle the dust around,'' he said.

TROPICALE CREW TO BE EVALUATED ON ENGLISH FLUENCY DURING FIRE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: The Philippines, Fla.)  By DOUGLAS FRANTZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Coast Guard is investigating whether crew
members aboard the Tropicale cruise ship spoke enough English to
assist passengers when a fire broke out on the ship in the Gulf of
Mexico last month.
</P>
<P>
   Rear Adm. Robert C. North, assistant Coast Guard commandant for
marine safety, told a congressional hearing Thursday that the
agency will ask 300 passengers aboard the Tropicale, owned by
Carnival Cruise Lines, to evaluate the performance of the crew.
</P>
<P>
   The ship, with 1,700 passengers and crew members, was adrift in
the gulf for almost two days after fire disabled the engines on
Sept. 19.
</P>
<P>
   Passengers, who had spent 11 hours at emergency stations,
complained afterward that some crew members did not speak English
well enough to provide safety instructions.
</P>
<P>
   James E. Hall, chairman of the National Transportation Safety
Board, testified that questions about the performance of crew
members have also been raised during an investigation of a fire
aboard another Carnival ship, the Ecstasy, in July 1998 off Miami
Beach.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's congressional hearing was called in response to
concerns about industry regulation after reports about illegal
dumping by cruise ships, sexual assaults on board ships and the two
fires.
</P>
<P>
   North and Hall gave the cruise industry generally high marks for
safety during testimony Thursday before the House Transportation
and Infrastructure Subcommittee on the Coast Guard and Maritime
Transportation.
</P>
<P>
   But worries over the potential losses in a fire at sea have
grown as the size of cruise ships has mushroomed to 3,000
passengers and 1,500 or more crew members. Hall said the Tropicale
and Ecstasy fires should be wake up calls that the industry must do
more in terms of training and fire prevention.
</P>
<P>
   The industry has adopted many fire-safety measures, including
sprinkler systems, smoke detectors, remote operation of fire doors
and improved detection systems. But the safety board said the smoke
detectors on cruise ships are not as effective because they sound
an alarm at a central location, rather than in passenger and crew
accommodations where the smoke is detected.
</P>
<P>
   ``Immediate warning of the presence of smoke is absolutely
essential to escape a fire,'' Hall testified.
</P>
<P>
   Cynthia A. Colenda, president of the International Council of
Cruise Lines, an industry trade group, said crew members were
quickly sent to check on alarms that register at the central
location. She said alarms do not sound in cabins because they are
too often set off by accident, through cigarette smoking or even
hair spray.
</P>
<P>
   But Rep. Peter A. DeFazio, D-Ore., said he did not understand
why ships could not use the same alarms that are in hotel rooms.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can't tell me that smoke detectors wouldn't work in
cabins, too,'' DeFazio said.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government cannot order installation of the smoke
detectors because the cruise ships serving U.S. ports fly foreign
flags and are regulated by the countries where they are flagged and
the International Maritime Organization. The maritime organization
was expected to debate the necessity of local-sounding alarms at
some point, but the resistance of the cruise companies would make
it difficult to mandate them.
</P>
<P>
   The Coast Guard regularly inspects foreign-flagged ships that
sail in and out of U.S. ports, including monitoring fire drills.
But the government's jurisdiction over the industry is limited. For
instance, the safety board cannot investigate accidents that occur
outside U.S. territorial waters and crew qualifications are often
determined by unmonitored schools in foreign countries.
</P>
<P>
   DeFazio said he had seen evidence that training schools in
countries like the Philippines are shams that sell the
certifications necessary for getting a job on a cruise ship.
</P>
<P>
   ``That gives me zero confidence,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Colenda countered that the cruise lines inspect the
schools and that the Coast Guard observes crew performance during
on-board inspections. She said the trade association also operates
two schools in Florida to train crewmembers in firefighting.

`WHITEBOYS:' RAPPING IN THE HEARTLAND, EAGER TO SHED HIS SKIN 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Production notes appear at end of review.) (DW) 
 By ANITA GATES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Flip Dogg is phat. He's a hip-hop kind of guy. ``I got so much
juice/I'm getting loose,'' he raps in the privacy of his bedroom _
until his mother calls him for dinner. Did we mention that although
Flip deals cocaine from the men's room at a local club, it's really
baking soda? Did we mention that Flip lives in rural Iowa,
surrounded by cornfields, barns, pickup trucks and birdsong? Did we
mention that Flip is white?
</P>
<P>
   The idea of white-bread teen-age boys in the heartland affecting
a black ghetto sensibility is innately comical, but is it also sad,
deadly dangerous, an inspiring harbinger of racial harmony or some
combination of the three?
</P>
<P>
   The strength of Danny Hoch's deceptively silly, ultimately
intelligent film ``Whiteboys'' is that it keeps moviegoers thinking
and rethinking those questions, even after they've left the
theater.
</P>
<P>
   Hoch, the performance artist who sold out Performance Space 122
in the East Village for 14 weeks last year, plays Flip. In fact,
Flip _ who says, ``Even though I live in Iowa, I've still got the
ghetto in my heart'' and likes to practice his future talk-show
patter, explaining to an imagined Jay Leno that he has ``this rare
skin disorder'' that makes him look white although he's black
inside _ began as a character in that show.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Whiteboys,'' Flip has two close white friends, James (Dash
Mihok) and Trevor (Mark Webber), who are equally enamored of the
hip-hop fantasy and walk around their small town dressed and
talking like the urban rappers they see on MTV. He has a white
girlfriend, Sara (Piper Perabo), who is headed for college and
works in the meantime as a telemarketer for a long-distance
service. Flip has her name sort of branded on his arm, probably
because there are no tattoo parlors nearby. He even has a black
friend, Khalid (Eugene Byrd), whose look, attitude and home life
are more like ``The Cosby Show Meets Martha Stewart'' than the
ghetto. Most of all, Flip has fantasies.
</P>
<P>
   A particularly colorful one is a big rap number with Flip and
his friends in monochromatic clothes, accompanied by booze, guns
and babes in bikinis in convertibles, all in front of a cornfield
that eventually catches fire. A black-and-white fantasy set in a
prison that serves champagne and huge platters of shrimp features
Snoop Doggy Dogg in a musical cameo.
</P>
<P>
   In real life, Flip desperately wants to get to Chicago, where he
dreams of living in Cabrini Green, the notoriously dangerous
housing project, and being a drug dealer. Eventually he and his
friends pile into the car, drive to the big city and get an
unfortunate taste of reality.
</P>
<P>
   Hoch wrote the film with Marc Levin (who also directed), Garth
Belcon and Richard Stratton. The literalness of film drains some of
the power from Hoch's message, but the brashness and the occasional
``Kids''-like intensity of ``Whiteboys'' may also attract a lot of
young moviegoers who would never have turned up at avant-garde
theater in the East Village.

`SUPERSTAR:' THE THINGS SHE'LL DO FOR FAME AND A DATE

   It's easier to understand Mary Katherine Gallagher when you know
about her family. Her parents were killed in a tragic Irish
step-dancing accident at a talent show. She lives in the quiet town
of Besamee Heights with her grandmother (Glynis Johns), who once
danced on Broadway in ``Gypsy'' but is now in a wheelchair and
absolutely forbids her granddaughter to go into show business. No
wonder dear Mary Katherine walks around St. Monica's Catholic High
School in a plaid uniform skirt that barely covers her white
underpants. No wonder she practices her kissing skills and
sweet-nothings patter on trees. No wonder she dreams of being a
star.
</P>
<P>
   By now, just about everybody knows how hard it is to make a good
movie out of a ``Saturday Night Live'' sketch character (Wayne and
Garth and the Blues Brothers notwithstanding), but they keep
trying. Mary Katherine (played by Molly Shannon, who created the
character), television's most endearing insecure extrovert, is the
focus of ``Superstar,'' a comedy with several good laughs but no
convincing cohesion.
</P>
<P>
   The plot is twofold: Mary Katherine sets out to win a venereal
disease benefit talent contest sponsored by Catholic Teen magazine,
so she can go to Hollywood and begin achieving the international
fame she knows she deserves. And she sets out to be kissed by her
school's biggest dreamboat, Sky Corrigan (Will Ferrell). Having
Ferrell play Sky with the same goofy, misguided confidence that he
gives to many of his ``Saturday Night Live'' characters is a joke
that works. Having him double as Jesus _ or at least Mary
Katherine's psychological manifestation of Him (she has a lot of
fantasy sequences) _ is funny in the first scene but wears a little
thin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Superstar'' gives us characters like Evian (Elaine Hendrix),
Sky's blond cheerleader girlfriend, her pals Autum and Summer
(Natalie Radford and Karen Dwyer), and Slater (Harland Williams),
the guy in special ed who never talks. It gives us a few terrific
scenes, like the huge robot-dance number in the cafeteria (almost
as good as those Gap television ads) and an appropriately inane
``Armageddon'' fantasy involving the song ``Leaving on a Jet
Plane.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Shannon herself is in fine form as the heroine, telling it
like it is (``Your intense energy is making me feel a little
bombarded'') and responding to simple questions by acting out
scenes from various television movies, even in the confessional.
Many of her finest moments take place in Mary Katherine's bedroom,
even if some seem stolen from Gilda Radner. But the majority of the
jokes fall flat, and in the end Mary Katherine has proved (and she
would have trouble accepting this) that she's a joy only for five
minutes or so at a time.

TORY CONVENTION ENDS WITH CALL TO RESIST FURTHER EUROPEAN
INTEGRATION 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By WARREN HOGE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BLACKPOOL, England _ William Hague, the Conservative Party
leader, brought his party's annual convention to a close Thursday
with a call for tougher resistance to further integration with
Europe and an attack on Prime Minister Tony Blair as a liar and
hypocrite.
</P>
<P>
   ``The man is a fraud,'' Hague said, taking issue with Blair's
speech last week in which he told the Labor Party conference that
the country's ills were the fault of ``the forces of conservatism''
and invited disaffected Tories to abandon ``today's extreme
Conservative Party.''
</P>
<P>
   Hague said it was not extreme to want to protect your own
national characteristics, keep your own currency and do away with
``regional bureaucracies and European political superstructures.''
</P>
<P>
   Seeking to end a long-running and damaging internal quarrel, he
placed the Conservatives squarely on the side of those wary of
closer ties to Europe and declared the distinction the one that now
most defined the rival parties.
</P>
<P>
   He stopped short of any pledge to withdraw from the European
Union, as hard-liners in the party have been seeking. But he said
Britain should cooperate in no more European intergovernmental
conferences without the prior guarantee of a ``flexibility clause''
that would allow it to opt out of any arrangements it did not like.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we must join battle to defeat new, pervasive, foolish
ideas which threaten our country,'' he said to cheers and applause.
</P>
<P>
   The address by Hague signaled that the Conservatives, badly
defeated in the 1997 national election and still lagging far behind
Labor in popularity polls, would center their appeal to voters on
the Europe argument. He counseled delegates to resist expected
characterizations of the stance as ``small, narrow and petty,''
saying instead that it was ``great, large and generous.''
</P>
<P>
   The party appeared confident and united Thursday listening to
Hague, but it soon became clear that the bickering in the ranks
over Europe has not ended. A significant warning shot came from
Kenneth Clarke, the former Treasury head and a popular figure among
Conservatives across the country. ``I feel I am watching the party
marching off to an extreme Euroskeptic view which will damage our
chances to win elections,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While Hague is an effective speaker to his party and a combative
debater in the House of Commons, he has yet to rouse great support
from the public. More than two years into his post, he has presided
over constantly diminishing Conservative appeal, with polls showing
that if an election were held now, the party would attract only 25
percent of the vote, down from 31 percent in May 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The Conservatives lost because vast numbers of middle-class
voters deserted them for the reformed Labor Party of Blair. It is
Hague's mission to attract them back, and he has decided that
Europe is the issue on which to base that campaign.  &QL;

SOLOMON DISMISSES QUESTIONS OF IMPROPER LOBBYING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK HELM  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Former Rep. Gerald Solomon, R-N.Y., joined by his
successor Rep. John Sweeney, vehemently denied claims Thursday that
the ex-lawmaker may have violated a federal law barring former
members of Congress from lobbying current members.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is all so ridiculous,'' said Bill Teator, a public
relations specialist at Solomon Group LLC, Solomon's lobbying firm
in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The issue arose from an article by the Capitol Hill newspaper
Roll Call that said Solomon, ex-chairman of the powerful House
Rules Committee, may have violated the lobbying law when he
discussed dairy issues with Sweeney and Rep. Thomas Reynolds, both
of whom are also New York Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Solomon's lobbying firm works for the National Milk Producers
Federation and the States Ratification Committee, both of which are
pushing for the continuation of dairy price supports being debated
in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The law on the conduct of former members, enacted as part of the
Ethics Reform Act of 1989, prevents them from lobbying current
members of Congress for one year after retiring. For Solomon the
bar against lobbying expires in January.
</P>
<P>
   In the Roll Call article, Sweeney and Reynolds are quoted as
saying that Solomon talked with them about dairy issues and
agricultural legislation. The story also quotes Solomon as denying
that he spoke with either of them about the current dairy fight.
</P>
<P>
   Sweeney and Reynolds, who both strongly favor the milk price
supports, said they did talk with Solomon about dairy issues but
that they spoke about ``past dairy legislation'' and how Solomon
had worked with other members of Congress to push through that
legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never, not once, talked about the current dairy
legislation, and he has never tried to lobby me on this issue or
any other,'' Sweeney said. ``Besides, why in the world would Gerry
waste his time lobbying me, one of the leaders of the side that he
is on? It's absurd.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike Brady, spokesman for Reynolds, said: ``It's crazy, and I
have to wonder if the (Roll Call) reporter wasn't just looking for
a story.''
</P>
<P>
   Teator said Solomon never denied talking with Sweeney or
Reynolds about past dairy legislation. ``It's perfectly acceptable
for Sweeney or Reynolds to discuss with Gerry dairy bills that have
gone through in the past,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Teator also noted that Solomon talked with Sweeney and Reynolds
about the dairy issues only after the two congressmen called him
and asked for his advice.
</P>
<P>
   Trevor Potter, a Washington lawyer who is an expert on lobbying
law, said it was not improper for Solomon to discuss his experience
in Congress or the history of dairy issues with Sweeney or
Reynolds.

CIVILIANS SUFFER HIGH RATE OF CASUALTIES IN CHECHNYA 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By CARLOTTA GALL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   GROZNY, Russia _ Two Chechen sisters lay side by side in the
Ninth City Hospital, barely able to talk. Their bodies were riddled
with shrapnel wounds and stained green with disinfectant. One
woman, Zina Kardayeva, 42, could just lift her head to recount what
happened. The other, Aisha Nur Magomeda, 27, who was wounded in the
head, could barely whisper.
</P>
<P>
   The sisters were among the busload of people killed and wounded
on Tuesday when an artillery shell, apparently Russian, caught them
with a direct hit. In one of the worst incidents since Russia began
its invasion of Chechnya several weeks ago, 40 people were killed,
mostly women and children; 18 wounded were brought to Grozny, the
capital of the secessionist republic.
</P>
<P>
   Along dim corridors, thick with the smell of sickness and blood,
the hospital staff is struggling under an increasingly heavy load
of civilian casualties. Some patients have no sheets; one lay on
the bare springs of the bed.
</P>
<P>
   Few stay long. Relatives, anxious that Grozny might be bombed
again, are taking their wounded home again or to neighboring
republics. But those in the wards tell a tale of indiscriminate
bombing that is taking a far greater toll among the civilian
population than among any fighters.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were all civilians,'' Ms. Kardayeva said. ``We hung out a
white flag. We knew the Russians were there, but people said they
were not shooting. Two or three buses had come up that road already
that morning.''
</P>
<P>
   The bus was full; many passengers were women and children trying
to return to Chervlyonnaya, just north of Grozny, she said. They
had fled their homes when Russian forces first advanced into
Chechnya two weeks ago, but had heard that it was now safe to
return home.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was 2 p.m. and we went over the Terek River and turned
toward Chervlyonnaya when they started to shell,'' Ms. Kardayeva
said. ``The bus turned back, and suddenly we were hit from behind.
</P>
<P>
   ``When people started to arrive to help, they bombed more. In
the end a red Lada car came and took us away. There was blood
everywhere. And we lost all our documents.''
</P>
<P>
   By some fluke, Ms. Magomeda's two children escaped unscathed.
</P>
<P>
   A commission at Chechnya's Parliament now says 500 people have
died since Russian forces began their air and artillery bombardment
in early September. The figures are difficult to verify. There is
no city morgue or coroner who registers the dead in Grozny, and
Chechens tend to bury their dead immediately. But the number of
casualties arriving at Grozny's hospitals suggest the death toll is
in the hundreds.
</P>
<P>
   The Ninth City Hospital, Chechnya's main hospital, has treated
677 wounded to date, the chief surgeon, Aslanbek Atsalayev, said.
Thirty-five died, he added. Across town at the children's hospital,
doctors say they have treated 30 children since the bombardments
began.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have all been trauma cases from bomb blasts,'' said
Ruslan Aslanbekov, the chief trauma surgeon. ``All of them have had
shrapnel wounds.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he had yet to see any bullet wounds among the children.
``We had mixed cases in the previous war,'' he added, ``but this
time it is all coming from above.''
</P>
<P>
   In his wards lay four children wounded in a missile attack on
Mesketi on Sept. 23. Elita, aged 11, lay pale and thin, her legs
peppered with dark wounds. Her cousin, Ramzan, 10, cried and shook
with pain as he clutched his broken leg with both hands.
</P>
<P>
   Their uncle, Umar Haji Visambayev, 38, a bearded farmer, was
sitting with them. ``Out of the blue they started shelling at one
in the afternoon,'' he said. ``We got scared so I loaded everyone
up in into my truck, and then suddenly three mortars landed just 20
yards away.'' .
</P>
<P>
   His wife, a niece and a neighbor, still standing on the ground,
were killed instantly, he said. Eleven of the people in the cab of
the truck and piled into the open back were wounded, he said; nine
were children.
</P>
<P>
   Visambayev said he knew the high level of crime and banditry in
Chechnya had turned the world against the Chechens, but he also
appealed for understanding. ``We know we are not worthy of help
because of all the kidnapping,'' he said. ``But even so, to kill
civilians in such a way is a breach of human rights. We also have a
right to live.''
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to the civilian casualties, the number of fighters
killed or wounded remains low. Atsalayev said he had seen only 15
wounded fighters, and those reported killed number a few dozen at
the most.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Russians keep saying how many fighters they have killed,''
he continued, ``but the fighters know how to fight and avoid the
shells. The civilians don't.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Even as he spoke, news came of 30 civilians killed in Elistanzhi
in heavy bombing during the night. The evening news showed pictures
of the dead, wrapped in white shrouds for burial. There faces were
bare, showing that some victims were young children, and one was a
baby.
</P>
<P>
   What most concerns doctors is their lack of facilities. ``I
don't have the equipment or the drugs I need for them,'' Atsalayev
said. During the last war , ``the Red Cross saved 90 percent of our
patients,'' he added. ``All the humanitarian organizations gave us
a colossal amount of assistance.''
</P>
<P>
   But virtually all the aid agencies have left Chechnya in the
last three years, forced out by the wave of kidnappings and
killings, many of which were directed at foreigners. Six workers
with the International Committee of the Red Cross were killed.
</P>
<P>
   The Chechens are now dependent on the small amounts of aid that
the Russian authorities let through. ``Very little gets through,''
Atsalayev said. ``It's going to be very difficult.''

 &HT;    COLUMN: Famed coach Lombardi's family life wasn't in the same
league as Packers and the game
 &HT;    By Michael Skube
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   No one in American life is more overvalued than football
coaches, and no football coach has been revered like Vince
Lombardi. It was Lombardi who said winning wasn't everything; it
was the only thing. Yet the reverence for the man hints at values
not recorded on the scoreboard _ values gone by the wayside in a
less valorous time.
</P>
<P>
   ``His bronze bust at the Pro Football Hall of Fame in Canton,
Ohio,'' David Maraniss writes in ``When Pride Still Mattered: A
Life of Vince Lombardi,'' ``has the shiniest nose, touched more
than any other by the faithful, the sporting world equivalent to
rubbing St. Peter's foot in Rome.''
</P>
<P>
   Dead nearly three decades, Lombardi lives on as a
near-mythological figure in a trench coat, roaring and thundering
from the sidelines, driving us onward, onward like Gen. Patton
racing his boys across frozen France to smite the Germans at
Bastogne.
</P>
<P>
   The Green Bay Packers of the mid-'60s became pro football's
dominant team at precisely the moment the sport was achieving
parity with baseball in popularity, and no single player was as
visible as the team's coach. The San Francisco 49ers have been Joe
Montana and the New York Jets Joe Namath. The Packers were
Lombardi, a onetime high school coach and physics teacher in
Elizabeth, N.J., who became all but synonymous with the National
Football League, the Super Bowl and the American ethos of winning.
</P>
<P>
   It's what's lost in the winning that is usually out of public
view. Just as Lombardi seemed larger than the game itself,
Maraniss' sympathetic yet unsparing portrayal of a sports legend
and his family _ religious, committed to hard work, undergirded by
all the right values _ transcends the narrow world of yard markers
and end zones. In Maraniss' deft hands, it is an American tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   God, family and the Green Bay Packers _ these were the
cornerstones of Vince Lombardi's life, and Americans hungered to
see a hero so genuine in the old-fashioned ways. But family
relationships are rarely what they seem from the outside, and the
Lombardis were no different. They were, for all their apparent
solidity, a family of strangers: wife Marie, whose only life was
her husband and his football team; daughter Susan, fun-loving in a
funless home, overweight and ignored; son Vincent Jr., unable to
live up to his father's expectations, trying all his life to reach
the man Americans admired more than they did their president.
</P>
<P>
   Maraniss, who won a Pulitzer Prize as a reporter for The
Washington Post and went on to write a biography of President
Clinton, sees in Lombardi much that was worthy of admiration. But
he sees his blind spots as well. What was to be admired was
apparent enough; it was his faults that were less visible, and not
because they were small. Maraniss paints a scene of family
togetherness you'd never see on ``The NFL Today.'' It was 1960, a
year after the new coach had rejuvenated the Packers, and the
Lombardis had moved into a new home:
</P>
<P>
   ``It was not just the unused fireplaces that made the new
Lombardi house feel cold. Inside, it seemed uncomfortably silent
and somber much of the week. The halls were dark and uninviting. A
friend of Susan's said that her lasting image of the home was `one
of the sadness ... It was a sad house as soon as you walked in,
empty, you could feel the family void.' The defining scene was at
the dinner table: Vincent on one side, tense and quiet; Susan on
the other, chatting away, oblivious until she realized no one was
responding to her; Marie perched at the end nearest the kitchen,
impeccably dressed, bony and uneasy, offering little visible
motherly comfort to her children, barely showing interest in the
events of their days, instead focusing her gaze on her husband
across the way, looking at him with awe and adoration as he sat
there, eyes on his plate, chewing his meat, thinking about ... who
knows what? (Bart) Starr's sore ribs? The Bears linebackers? The
Rams passing game? A new wrinkle in the belly series? When he
cleared his throat, the others stiffened with anticipation: maybe,
at last, the father would speak, his voice deep and resounding.
Pass the salt, Marie.''
</P>
<P>
   From the above, it would be easy to conclude that the Super
Bowl-winning coach was a despot at the dinner table, benevolent in
his beliefs, obtuse in his emotions. It would also be misleading.
He enforced early curfews on his children, but a friend of Susan
Lombardi's, Mary Jo Antil, remembers when their dads took them to
the father-daughter dance. ``The girls asked if they could go out
on the town afterward,'' Maraniss writes, and their fathers agreed.
``I can still see him doing the locomotion and the watusi,'' Mary
Jo Antil told Maraniss. ``He was totally out of his realm, and he
enjoyed it immensely.''
</P>
<P>
   In recounting such fleeting episodes from a life consumed by
winning football games, Maraniss displays a psychological acuity.
Lombardi was neither a hero nor a tyrant, though he had qualities
of each. As a boy, the son of an immigrant Italian butcher, he
studied under the Jesuits and his virtues were the noble ones:
loyalty, self-sacrifice, obedience to authority.
</P>
<P>
   They were qualities an older generation, wistful for better
times, saw to the exclusion of all else. After Lombardi's death in
1970, a post-Vietnam generation would see other qualities: an
excessive zeal to win, an unhealthy single-mindedness of purpose.
</P>
<P>
   Maraniss was a student at the University of Wisconsin at
Madison, one of the rowdier campuses of the '60s, and recalls that
even there Lombardi was something of a folk hero. Part of it was
geography, Wisconsin standing atop the world of pro football. But
part, too, was the sense that Lombardi lived life passionately and
was wholly without pretense or affectation. What you saw was what
you got, and the kids could respect that.
</P>
<P>
   But what we saw Sunday afternoons on television wasn't entirely
what we imagined, and the pity of it was that Lombardi, a decent
man, knew no other way. It was he, after all, who said winning was
the only thing. The tragedy of his life was that he was unable to
reckon the cost.

 &HT;    `Really real' Catholic girl a bit of Shannon
 &HT;    By Bob Longino
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Molly Shannon is still reeling from her 35th birthday party.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was, like, so much fun,'' she coos in chatter only slightly
less frenetic than if she were talking as Mary Katherine Gallagher,
her manic Catholic schoolgirl sketch character that's been a
consistent spark for ``Saturday Night Live.''
</P>
<P>
   So there Shannon was just three weeks ago, downing margaritas
with a big group of friends at Los Angeles' Orso restaurant, the
trendy, be-seen hangout of the stars.
</P>
<P>
   It was as boisterous a group as when she would pal around with a
pack of girlfriends and play the Tree Game.
</P>
<P>
   ``My friends and I would say, `Pretend like you're on a date and
say goodbye to that palm tree,''' she says with definitive glee.
``You had to do it really real.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``Superstar,'' Shannon's new comedy movie opening today, Mary
Katherine plays several love scenes with a tall, tall tree as her
beau. And Shannon makes it look almost too real.
</P>
<P>
   She caresses the tree. Woos it. Smooches it. Some early
screening audiences have laughed themselves silly over it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Superstar'' has the intensely focused Mary Katherine,
Catholicism's abundantly unrestrained schoolgirl in horn-rimmed
glasses and short-short plaid skirt, wanting desperately to be
kissed. She has her eyes focused on Sky Corrigan (Will Ferrell),
St. Monica High School's most popular guy.
</P>
<P>
   To accomplish her goal, she enters her school's talent contest
for a chance at a trip to Hollywood and a possible role as an extra
in a new movie ``with positive moral values.'' In other words,
she'd become a kissable ``superstar.''
</P>
<P>
   Shannon talked by telephone recently during a break while taping
an upcoming guest appearance on MTV in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Q:Molly, it's you and the tree. What's your motivation? In your
head, who does that tree look like?
</P>
<P>
   A:I don't necessarily have a specific guy in mind for that
scene. He could look any way, I guess. What I keep thinking is that
I really like this person and I'd like to see him again.
</P>
<P>
   Q:Mary Katherine also talks _ and gets quite chummy _ with a
stop sign. Are you thinking of the same guy?
</P>
<P>
   A:That would be a different person. You know Mary Katherine.
She's a cheater. Yeah.
</P>
<P>
   Q:In ``Superstar'' some of the dialogue is intentionally lifted
from old TV movies.
</P>
<P>
   A:I am really into those. The monologues are all from movies
I've seen. You know, loser girl wants to get into a sorority.
Portrait of a teenage alcoholic. Anorexia. Bulimia. The more
dramatic and troubled the young women are, the better.
</P>
<P>
   Q:Who was your favorite nun at your old Catholic school?
</P>
<P>
   A:Sister Rosemary. She was very young and pretty, but I thought
it was so sad that she had to wear that habit. It hides her hair.
The convent was so plain. There's this simple room and this plain
bed. What kind of life was this for a lady?
</P>
<P>
   Q:Tell me about your first kiss.
</P>
<P>
   A:It was with Tom Sullivan from my hometown of Shaker Heights
(Ohio). Right after my mom died. We used to go to this place. Into
the bushes, you know, and kiss. We were, like, 6.
</P>
<P>
   Q:And where's Tom now?
</P>
<P>
   A:He's in Cleveland. He's the nicest guy. We're friends and
stuff. He got married really young.
</P>
<P>
   Q:What's Mary Katherine's intensity all about?
</P>
<P>
   A:When she wants something she can't stop until she gets it, no
matter what gets in her way. I'm sort of like that, too. We were
doing a cover shot for this movie thing once, and all these girls
were smiling and showing off. So I pushed my way up there. I'm a
pushy girl. I wanted to be in the front.
</P>
<P>
   Q:Why is it that every time Mary Katherine leaps forward with
her arms spread, you nearly tip and fall over?
</P>
<P>
   A:I'm basically a spaz.

 &HT;    Mini reviews of current movies
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel Gillespie, Steve Murray, Bob Longino and Jill
Vejnoska
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Grades range from A to F.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Adventures of Elmo in Grouchland'' G
</P>
<P>
   Starring Elmo
</P>
<P>
   (voice by Kevin Clash), Mandy Patinkin and Vanessa Williams.
</P>
<P>
   A kind of extended episode of ``Sesame Street,'' this movie is
recommended to the very, very, very young. Essentially, little Elmo
(voice by Kevin Clash) must go to Grouchland to rescue his blanket
from a meanie named Huxley (a hammy Mandy Patinkin.) Vanessa
Williams appears as the Queen of Trash. Fill in your own joke.
(ERG)1 hour,10 minutes. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``Africa's Elephant Kingdom'' Not rated
</P>
<P>
   A documentary
</P>
<P>
   It has some eye-poppingly large pachyderms, but it isn't as
visually astounding as ``Everest.'' Still, this Imax film has its
share of lovely images, including time-lapse shots of the sun
setting on the dusty horizon and a massive storm whirling across
the plain. (SM) 40 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Alaska:
</P>
<P>
   Spirit of the Wild'' Unrated
</P>
<P>
   Narrated by Charlton Heston.
</P>
<P>
   It's big, it's bold, it's big ... The sheer size of the latest
Imax offering sometimes makes it an eye-opening experience.
Otherwise, this visit to the far, brrr-cold reaches of our biggest
state is just another Discovery Channel-style nature flick. The
film spans millenniums _ and throws in bits and pieces about the
ice age, the Klondike Gold Rush, caribou hunting and bears. (Bob
Longino)40 minutes. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``American Beauty'' R (strong sexuality, nudity, profanity,
</P>
<P>
   violence and drug content)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Kevin Spacey
</P>
<P>
   and Annette Bening.
</P>
<P>
   A beaut. The ever-more-remarkable Kevin Spacey leads a stellar
ensemble cast (Annette Bening, Thora Birch, Chris Cooper) in this
scarily disturbing, daringly hilarious comedy-drama in this fin de
siecle tragifarce centering on Spacey as a man caught in a midlife
limbo. The movie is a hauntingly optimistic elegy for America the
Beautifully Screwed Up. (ERG)1 hour, 58 minutes. A
</P>
<P>
   ``Autumn Tale'' Not rated, but the theme may be
</P>
<P>
   too mature for children.
</P>
<P>
   Starring Marie Riviere
</P>
<P>
   and Beatrice Romand.
</P>
<P>
   Magali (Beatrice Romand), a widowed Frenchwoman in her mid-40s,
becomes the object of matchmaking by her best friend and by the
young woman who's dating Magali's son. By being sympathetic to and
ironic about the simple fact that seeking out romance reduces us
all to cringing adolescents, director Eric Rohmer, almost 80,
imparts wisdom that's aged to perfection. Subtitles. (ERG) 1 hour,
52 minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``Blue Streak'' PG-13 (profanity, violence
</P>
<P>
   and crude humor)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Martin Lawrence.
</P>
<P>
   A decent, disposable Martin Lawrence vehicle. He's a crook
posing as a cop to recover a $17 million diamond he stashed years
ago. Basically a series of quick skits, there's enough action
scenes to mollify audiences who can't get enough of gunfire and
breaking glass. While it doesn't exactly streak along, at 93
minutes ``Blue Streak'' gets the job done. (SM) 1 hour, 33 minutes.
C+
</P>
<P>
   ``Bowfinger'' PG-13 (sex-related material
</P>
<P>
   and profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Steve Martin,
</P>
<P>
   Eddie Murphy and Heather Graham.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Martin has come up with a beautiful premise for a movie.
Martin plays a hapless Hollywood producer with a stinky script and
a gem of a way to get it filmed with impossible-to-get megastar Kit
Ramsey (Eddie Murphy). ``Bowfinger's'' got a few good laughs but
not much more. Sadly, it never takes on Hollywood with the zing of
``Wag the Dog'' or ``The Player.''(Bob Longino)1 hour, 37 minutes.
B-
</P>
<P>
   ``The Dinner Game'' PG-13 (profanity and sexual innuendo)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Thierry Lhermitte and Jacques Villeret
</P>
<P>
   A feast of foolishness. Snotty Paris yuppies hold a weekly
dinner to see who can bring the biggest idiot as a guest. Publisher
Thierry Lhermitte thinks he's got a sure thing when he meets
Jacques Villeret, who builds scale-model monuments out of
matchsticks. Fate intervenes when Lhermitte throws out his back and
is forced to spend the evening with Villeret who, with all good
intentions, systematically wrecks his life. (ERG) B+
</P>
<P>
   ``Double Jeopardy'' R (profanity, sexuality, violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Ashley Judd
</P>
<P>
   and Tommy Lee Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Ashley Judd plays a woman out to wreak justice on the husband
who framed her for murder, and Tommy Lee Jones is the parole
officer on her trail in this action flick with a gender twist. For
better and for worse, the movie is as professional, efficient and
aloof as Judd's performance. (SM) 1 hour, 45 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Everest'' Not rated
</P>
<P>
   A documentary by David Breashears.
</P>
<P>
   Breathtaking. Even filmgoers accustomed to the five-story Imax
format may gasp at the unearthly scale of ``Everest.'' David
Breashears'
</P>
<P>
   documentary was filmed at the same time as the 1996 storm that
killed eight mountain climbers, memorialized by Jon Krakauer's
best-selling book ``Into Thin Air.'' (SM) 44 minutes. A
</P>
<P>
   ``For Love of the Game'' PG-13 (sexual situations, profanity
</P>
<P>
   and drinking)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Kevin Costner
</P>
<P>
   and Kelly Preston.
</P>
<P>
   No matter how hard it tries to hit, Kevin Costner's baseball
flick whiffs a lot. Costner plays Billy Chapel, a Detroit Tigers
pitching god in his waning years who first learns his team is being
sold and he'll be traded and then that his girlfriend is dumping
him. As he pitches what could be a perfect game, he flashes back
over his life. (Bob Longino) 2 hours, 18 minutes. C-
</P>
<P>
   ``Guinevere'' R (profanity and sexuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Stephen Rea,
</P>
<P>
   Sarah Polley and Jean Smart.
</P>
<P>
   A college grad (Sarah Polley) moves in with a 50-ish bohemian
photographer (Stephen Rea) who's made a career out of introducing
much younger women to the joys of sex, Sartre, jazz, art, etc. But
what sounds like grist for a feminist diatribe against our
culture's wink-wink approval of such liaisons is actually a sweet,
rueful love letter. The writing and direction is sharp as a tack
and the acting is gorgeous. (ERG) 1 hour, 47 minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``The Haunting'' PG-13 (intense horror sequences)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Liam Neeson, Catherine Zeta-Jones and Lili Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   Scary in all the worst ways. ``The Haunting'' is a Hollywood
debacle, an overpriced mess with only one scare in it. That scare
is of the old-fashioned ``boo'' variety. It has nothing to do with
the over-the-top computer effects that make this less a remake of
the 1963 classic than a theme park in search of a script. (SM)1
hour, 53 minutes. D
</P>
<P>
   ``In Too Deep'' R (profanity, sensuality, some violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Omar Epps and LL Cool J.
</P>
<P>
   A decent undercover-cop thriller highlighted by some smart
performances. Omar Epps is quite good as the detective, but LL Cool
J is a revelation as the ruthless drug kingpin, a monster made all
the scarier by his seeming benevolent charm. (SM)1 hour, 50
minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Inspector Gadget'' PG (wacky violence, profanity
</P>
<P>
   and innuendo)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Matthew Broderick
</P>
<P>
   and Rupert Everett.
</P>
<P>
   The best gag is the first one in Disney's big-screen version of
TV's popular animated part-human, part-machine, mucho-gizmo lawman.
Matthew Broderick is perfectly cast as Gadget. Rupert Everett goes
over the top as bad man Sanford Solex. Kids will enjoy watching
them both. (Bob Longino) 1 hour, 20 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``The Iron Giant'' PG (fantasy action and mild profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring the voices of
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Aniston and Harry Connick Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Nice story for kids, nifty look for adults. In 1957, a giant
metal-eating robot crash-lands on Earth and is befriended by
9-year-old Hogarth. But the robot's trail of munched-on trucks and
grain silos attracts a super-paranoid government agent. The
interesting mix of voice talent in this animated film includes
Jennifer Aniston as Hogarth's mom and Harry Connick Jr. as a
beatnik with seductive Elvis eyes. (ERG) At metro theaters. 1 hour,
24 minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``Jakob the Liar'' PG-13 (violence and disturbing images)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Robin Williams, Alan Arkin
</P>
<P>
   and Armin Mueller-Stahl.
</P>
<P>
   Robin Williams plays a Polish Jew who inspires his neighbors in
a Nazi-controlled ghetto by pretending to own a radio that's
broadcasting news of German defeat. While you'll be grateful that
Williams avoids his mawkish, laughter-through-tears routine, you
keep wanting him to do something memorable. Ultimately, it's what a
film like this should never be: dull. (SM)
</P>
<P>
   At metro theaters. 1 hour, 54 minutes. C
</P>
<P>
   ``Mickey Blue Eyes'' PG-13 (profanity, some violence
</P>
<P>
   and sensuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Hugh Grant, James Caan
</P>
<P>
   and Jeanne Tripplehorn.
</P>
<P>
   An effete British auctioneer (Hugh Grant) experiences culture
clash when he finds himself married to the mob, literally. Call it
a sleeping-with-the-fish-out-of-water comedy. Grant's one-trick
performance as an elegant bumbler is treadworn. He's terrific at
it, yes. But it's time to show more range. (SM) 1 hour, 45 minutes.
C+
</P>
<P>
   ``Mumford'' R (profanity, sex-related images,
</P>
<P>
   drug content)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Loren Dean, Hope Davis,
</P>
<P>
   Jason Lee and Alfre Woodard.
</P>
<P>
   Writer-director Lawrence Kasdan delivers a sunny, low-key
crowd-pleaser about a therapist named Mumford (Loren Dean) whose
effect on his clients changes the mood of their whole town (also
called Mumford). With a crack supporting cast, it's a gentle
vacation from the high-concept bangs and lowbrow laughs found
elsewhere in the multiplex. (SM)1 hour, 51 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Mystery, Alaska'' R (profanity and sexuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Russell Crowe,
</P>
<P>
   Hank Azaria and Burt Reynolds.
</P>
<P>
   A by-the-numbers but fairly pleasant David-vs.-Goliath comedy,
on ice. Russell Crowe, Hank Azaria and Burt Reynolds star in TV wiz
David E. Kelley's tale of small-town hockey lovers taking on the
New York Rangers. The movie piles on raunchy jokes and is a soggy
series of bite-sized vignettes and spoon-fed emotions. For all
that, it's still pretty watchable. (SM) 1 hour, 58 minutes.C+
</P>
<P>
   ``Plunkett &AMP; Macleane'' R (violence, profanity, sexuality,
nudity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Robert Carlyle,
</P>
<P>
   Jonny Lee Miller and Liv Tyler.
</P>
<P>
   A highwayman movie that stands well enough but doesn't always
deliver. In 18th-century London, a common thief (Robert Carlyle)
and a fallen gentleman (Jonny Lee Miller) team up to rob the rich
and give to themselves. Liv Tyler is lovely but listless as the
love interest. The movie is visually stylish but lacks the kind of
panache that made ``The Mask of Zorro'' so much fun. (ERG)1 hour,
40 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Random Hearts'' R (violence, sexuality and profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Harrison Ford
</P>
<P>
   and Kristin Scott Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   A meandering mystery/drama/romance that never hits the right
groove. Harrison Ford is a cop and Kristin Scott Thomas a
congresswoman who discover their spouses, both killed in a plane
crash, were having an affair. The stars' ensuing romance never taps
beneath the surface. (SM) 2 hours, 11 minutes. C-
</P>
<P>
   ``Runaway Bride'' PG (profanity and sexual innuendo)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Julia Roberts
</P>
<P>
   and Richard Gere.
</P>
<P>
   Lightning, alas, doesn't strike twice in this reunion of
``Pretty Woman'' stars Julia Roberts and Richard Gere. However, the
film isn't a fiasco and it does well by its intended audience,
i.e., anyone who wants to see Roberts galloping on horseback in
full wedding regalia. She's a bride who's already choked at the
altar three times and is about to try again. He's a cynical
journalist who's betting she'll run. (ERG) 1 hour, 56 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``The Sixth Sense'' PG-13 (intense thematic material
</P>
<P>
   and violent images)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Bruce Willis, Haley Joel Osment and Toni Collette.
</P>
<P>
   A surprising, spine-tingling gem. Eight-year-old Cole (Haley
Joel Osment) can see ghosts, not the Casper variety but restless
phantoms with their skulls blown open. It's a fascinating, odd film
that speculates on what the relationship between the restless dead
and a liaison to the living world might be. Plus, this film has the
best, and loveliest, last-act twist of the year. (SM)1 hour, 47
minutes. B+

   ``Stigmata'' R (profanity, sexuality, intense violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Patricia Arquette
</P>
<P>
   and Gabriel Byrne.
</P>
<P>
   Let it bleed without you. This mishmash of ``The Exorcist,''
``The Omen,'' etc. stars Gabriel Byrne as a Vatican investigator
sent to examine a young woman (Patricia Arquette) who's showing
signs of the stigmata, the wounds suffered by Christ on the cross.
Unfortunately, the movie prefers sensationalism to making sense.
It's enough to make you long for the good ol' days of pea soup and
spinning heads. (ERG) 1 hour, 42 minutes. C-
</P>
<P>
   ``Stir of Echoes'' R (profanity, sexual content
</P>
<P>
   and violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Kevin Bacon and Kathryn Erbe.
</P>
<P>
   A ghost story with too many echoes of other flicks. It might
have seemed intriguing had it landed in theaters before ``The Blair
Witch Project'' and ``The Sixth Sense'' gave us new twists on the
spooky movie genre. A little boy sees ghosts and his hypnotized dad
(Kevin Bacon) goes wiggy while hunting what happened to a teen girl
haunting their home. (SM)1 hour, 50 minutes. C
</P>
<P>
   ``Sugar Town'' R (profanity, drug content, sexuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Ally Sheedy,
</P>
<P>
   Rosanna Arquette and John Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   Co-writer/director Allison Anders and Kurt Voss' pointed but
affectionate satire of the world of rock 'n' roll showbiz. They
introduce us to a loosely connected group of has-beens, wannabes
and hangers-on in the recording studios of Hollywood's peaks and
valleys. ``Sugar Town'' doesn't waste time or linger too long. It
leaves you wanting more, and that's rare. (SM)1 hour, 32 minutes.

   Starring Molly Shannon,

   Will Ferrell and Elaine Hendrix.
</P>
<P>
   Whaddya know _ an ``SNL'' big-screen transfer that doesn't bite.
As the ebullient Catholic schoolgirl Mary Katherine Gallagher,
Molly Shannon delivers a memorable mix of adolescent brazenness and
self-mortification. It's clear the actress loves this character,
but she's never afraid to push the envelope of outrageousness,
whether talking baby talk to her own breasts, or fantasizing that a
tree is her lover. (SM) 1 hour, 22 minutes. B+

<P>
   ``The 13th Warrior'' R (violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Antonio Banderas.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, cheesy movies can be great fun. That's true of this
rip-roaring yarn about a medieval Arab poet (Antonio Banderas)
who's drafted by a roving gang of rowdy Vikings to help rescue a
Norse village from a mysterious enemy that comes from the mist,
kills everything in sight and leaves a trail of headless corpses.
This flick hits the ground running and never stops. (ERG)1 hour, 43
minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``The Thomas Crown Affair'' R (profanity and sexuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Pierce Brosnan and Rene Russo.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Windmills of Your Mind'' is still on the soundtrack, but
lots of other gimmicks from the 1968 original have been excised.
That's good. This remake is a guilt-free summer diversion. Pierce
Brosnan is an appealing billionaire gentleman rogue, stealing
priceless paintings. But it's really Rene Russo's film. As the solo
investigator hot on his trail, she prowls the screen savoring a
smart, sexed-up character. (SM) 1 hour, 45 minutes. B

<P>
   ``Three Kings'' R (graphic war violence, profanity,

<P>
   George Clooney, Mark Wahlberg and Ice Cube play three U.S.
soldiers in the Gulf War who go after Saddam Hussein's stolen
Kuwaiti gold. Their consciences are tested when they see
anti-Saddam civilians rounded up by Iraqi soldiers. While the
film's script cynically bashes George Bush's political stance, its
visuals pop with energy. (Bob Longino) 1 hour, 51 minutes. B

</P>
<P>
   In this sturdy and well-acted gay romantic comedy, two guys
spend a night looking to make love in all the wrong places. Gabriel
(Christian Campbell) and Mark (John Paul Pitoc) pick each other up,
both clearly intending a mutually gratifying one-night stand. But
as the evening wears on, they're still on the street. The obstacles
become more contrived as the movie goes on. But, overall, ``trick''
is a minor treat. (ERG)1 hour, 30 minutes. B

   ``Twin Falls Idaho'' R (kinkiness and adult themes)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Mark
</P>
<P>
   and Michael Polish.
</P>
<P>
   Eerie. Intriguing. Identical twins, Mark and Michael Polish,
play conjoined (the popular term is Siamese) twins. Moving at its
own slow, surreal pace, the picture shows what happens when a young
hooker (Michele Hicks) falls for one of the twins, thus creating a
strange pas de trois. Exploring themes of love and loneliness, the
movie suggests that sometimes, wholeness can only be found by
letting go. (ERG)1 hour, 45 minutes. A-

   ``Universal Soldier: The Return'' R (violence, profanity,
nudity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Jean-Claude Van Damme, Michael Jai White and Bill
Goldberg.
</P>
<P>
   It's loud, it's brutal and, unfortunately, not packed with
enough fun. This is a return to Jean-Claude Van Damme's 1992
``Universal Soldier,'' in which dead military guys are turned into
chiseled, nearly unstoppable, cyborglike warriors. This time he's
got to battle wrestling's Bill Goldberg and a monstrously buffed
Michael Jai White. (Bob Longino) 1 hour, 22 minutes. C

<P>
   Not as visually stunning as some Imax films, this is a highly
instructive look at the once nearly vanquished gray wolf's gradual
reintroduction to Yellowstone National Park and other parts of the
American West. Covers a bit too much ground, historically and
geographically; the best parts show wolves ranging from adult pack
leaders to newborn cubs exploring and adjusting to the wild again.

 &HT;    Nerdy `SNL' character makes successful leap to big screen
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Remember that old ``Superman'' slogan _ You will believe a man
can fly? Well, in ``Superstar,'' Molly Shannon does something else:
She makes you believe a tree can talk dirty.
</P>
<P>
   Bringing her Mary Katherine Gallagher character to the big
screen, the ``Saturday Night Live'' ensemble member pulls off what
many of her late-night alums couldn't (R.I.P., ``A Night at the
Roxbury,'' ``It's Pat,'' etc.). As the ebullient Catholic
schoolgirl _ whose plaid skirt seems a few inches too short and her
goal of superstardom a few miles too high _ Shannon delivers a
memorable mix of adolescent brazenness and self-mortification. It's
clear that the actress loves this character, but she's never afraid
to push the envelope of outrageousness, whether talking baby talk
to her own breasts or fantasizing that that tree (or a handy stop
sign) is her fantasy lover.
</P>
<P>
   Orphaned young when her parents die in a freak show biz accident
(not worth spoiling), Mary Katherine grows up with her
wheelchair-bound granny (Glynis Johns). But even as a tyke, she
prays, ``Please, God, send me somebody to make out with.''
</P>
<P>
   As a teenager, her ideal is Sky Corrigan (SNL colleague Will
Ferrell), the ``best guy dancer in school.'' The problem is, he's
dating blond cheerleader Evian (Elaine Hendrix, last seen in a
similar villainess role in the ``Parent Trap'' remake). So MKG
comes up with a plan: She'll enter and try to win her school's
Let's Fight Venereal Disease Talent Contest. The top prize is a
chance to appear in a Hollywood movie, and who could resist kissing
a movie star?
</P>
<P>
   Written by Steve Koren and directed by Kids in the Hall comic
Bruce McCulloch, ``Superstar'' has the good sense not to overdo the
tics that have become Mary Katherine's trademarks (the
finger-sniffing, the dance steps that escalate into chair-crashing
cataclysm). The script is an amiable version of ``Rocky'' in a
school uniform, with dance steps instead of uppercuts. The plot
gets spiced up with the occasional inspired riff, such as a fantasy
robot-dance sequence for Shannon or Ferrell pulling double duty as
``Mary Katherine Gallagher's subconscious idea of God,'' a
laid-back Christ figure who materializes now and then to cheer the
schoolgirl on.
</P>
<P>
   The movie pads itself by surrounding Shannon with classmates in
special ed (though why she's in that class never makes much sense).
We get a stoner, a goth girl, an obsessive-compulsive and a
braces-wearing jock. The best you can say is that they don't get in
the way of Shannon as she delivers impassioned monologues from
``Sybil'' and ``Portrait of a Teenage Centerfold'' to express her
true feelings.
</P>
<P>
   In this silly but compellingly sweet movie, when Mary Katherine
Gallagher finds unexpected romance with rebel student Slater
(Harland Williams), it's enough to make you feel bad for that poor
tree.
</P>
<P>
   ``Superstar''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   Starring Molly Shannon, Will Ferrell and Elaine Hendrix. Rated
PG-13 for sex-
</P>
<P>
   related humor and profanity. 1 hour, 22 minutes
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: Whaddaya know _ an ``SNL'' big-screen transfer that
doesn't bite.

 &HT;    Designer feels that Celine's collection is what women really
want to wear
 &HT;    By A. Scott Walton
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Paris _ Some like it hot. And some, like accessories designer
Marcia Kleinberg Sherrill like it hotter. ''The hotter the
better,'' she said Thursday after viewing New York-based Michael
Kors' spring/summer collection for Celine.
</P>
<P>
   ''Of all the collections I've seen so far in Paris, (Celine's)
had the most viability,'' said Sherrill, who came to the Celine
show dressed in a silk top hat, a feather trimmed suit, knee-high
boots and a red feather coat.
</P>
<P>
   ''The other shows have been exciting and the clothes have been
fabulous, but the bottom line is they're just about fantasy. This
show was about clothes you could really wear.''
</P>
<P>
   What women want for the warm weather months, Sherrill said, is
''color.''
</P>
<P>
   And the Celine show certainly offered that in a controlled
palette. Kors successfully set out to prove that: a) there's
nothing outdated about basic black and white; b) sea-faring shades
of blue and tropical shades of green have a sunny side to them; and
c) those blues and greens also go brilliantly with grey and silver.
</P>
<P>
   Relying heavily on the ''ombre'' technique of blending darker
hues with lighter ones, this collection conjured visions of the sea
meeting the shore, the beach meeting the breakers and the
grasslands meeting the jungle. Kors also concentrated on carefree
bleached and tie-dyed effects.
</P>
<P>
   Tailoring took a back seat to relaxed _ make that very relaxed _
silhouettes. Tops were stretchy and sheer. Dresses and skirts were
slit high, skin tight, one shouldered or a size or two too small.
The jeans _ often in stretch denim or perforated leather _ were
skin tight; the cropped jackets looked sexy and sophisticated.
Kors' stated inspiration was ``Jennifer Lopez meets Jackie O.''
</P>
<P>
   If anything could detract from the collection, it would be Kors'
insistence on showing ribbed wool sweaters that looked too bulky to
serve as swimsuit cover-ups, and his unabashed use of the
opportunity to showcase Celine accessories, including lucite diving
bags, leather duffels or denim satchels. Some outfits were
complemented with all three at once.
</P>
<P>
   Purple reign
</P>
<P>
   When Nino Cerruti stuck his thumb into Donna Karan's design
staff and discovered Peter Speliopolous, he truly plucked a plum.
Three years into his stewardship over the Cerruti label,
Speliopolous has settled in as a talent capable of refinement,
romanticism and restraint. Resisting the temptation to
over-embellish and outlandishly color his clothes the way so many
European designers have, Speliopolous restricted the Cerruti
collection to sedate shades of purple, grey and green. His reliance
on embroidery was economic. His forays into the floral motif were
well cultivated.
</P>
<P>
   The new looks from Cerruti are a study in contrasts. Most of the
pieces had a boxy cut to them. But the pants were just tight
enough, the blouses and jackets cropped just short enough, and the
dresses made of chiffons just sheer enough to make them all appear
sexy. Ruffles _ a cornerstone in most designers' collections were
few. His preference was for straight-edge collars, lapels and hems.
Polka dots and perforated leathers were the only prints shown.
</P>
<P>
   On other runways
</P>
<P>
   Rock queen Patti Smith, guiding inspiration for Antwerp designer
Anne Demeulemeester, wrote the poetry that accompanied the
soundtrack that she also partly produced for the designer's show, a
rambling dirge that perfectly set the mood for this spare,
essential show. Demeulemeester has already established some
classics looks _ like double-mesh tank tops, edgy leather
redingotes or her low-slung pants with broad waistbands, cut with
added ease at the back to hide a multitude of sins. This season,
Demeulemeester added text to the pants, shirts and dresses with
words like ``Worldwide,'' or phrases like ``Serious Wishes
Feathered in the Air'' embroidered on. Anne's big idea this season
was adding aprons to a dozen passages. The show had a nonchalant
air that sometimes masked its slick professionalism. At the very
moment Patty Smith intoned: ``Bits of human spirit that got up in
an apron,'' Amber Valletta hit the catwalk attired in a white
T-shirt and trousers but wrapped in a butcher's sized black and
white apron bearing the image of a proud hawk. Demeulemeester has
finally opened her own store. And in her familiar iconoclastic
manner she's opened up in her home town of Antwerp rather than
setting up shop in New York or London. The new 6,000 square-foot
flagship is very much in the same spirit as her fashion - clean and
modern, yet also warm and human.

 &HT;    Elderly often pass on yearly flu shot
 &HT;    By Lillian Lee Kim
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Many elderly people who don't get an annual flu shot
say they didn't know they needed one, or thought the vaccine could
give them the flu.
</P>
<P>
   Influenza kills 20,000 Americans every year _ and 90 percent of
those deaths occur among people 65 years and older. The vaccine can
prevent many of those deaths, and it can't cause the flu.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, as Health and Human Services Secretary Donna
Shalala made an announcement urging older Americans to get flu
shots, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released
findings from the first national study to look at why many Medicare
beneficiaries aren't vaccinated for flu and pneumonia.
</P>
<P>
   The flu vaccine, which must be received annually, and the
one-time pneumococcal vaccine are free to those enrolled in
Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, 65 percent of adults 65 or older said they had received
a flu shot within the past year, and 45 percent said they'd been
vaccinated for pneumonia. Vaccination rates were much lower among
African-Americans than whites.
</P>
<P>
   Not knowing they needed the vaccines was the most common reason
that study participants gave for not getting the shots. Many also
worried they could get the flu from the vaccine.
</P>
<P>
   It's a common misconception. The flu shot can't cause flu,
because the vaccine is made from killed virus. It is possible,
although very rare, to get briefly sick after a shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``You might get fever, aches for 48 hours, but no more than
that,'' said Atlanta pulmonologist Eric Honig.
</P>
<P>
   Also, people may think they have the flu when they actually have
another respiratory infection with similar symptoms, said Dr.
Carolyn Buxton Bridges of the CDC.
</P>
<P>
   The flu shot must be received every year because it is
reformulated to match the viral strains expected to circulate
during the coming flu season, which will begin in November and can
peak anywhere from December through March.
</P>
<P>
   Also, antibody protection wanes over time.
</P>
<P>
   This year's vaccine contains the Beijing, Sydney and Yamanashi
strains.
</P>
<P>
   Several flu outbreaks occurred this past summer, but the viral
strains involved were not new, and are included in this year's
vaccine.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors say people should receive a flu shot before mid-November
if possible, because it can take two to six weeks for the body to
build up sufficient antibody protection against the virus.

 &HT;    Syphilis down nationwide
 &HT;    By M.A.J. McKenna
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Syphilis has sunk to record lows in the United States
and could soon be eliminated from the country, the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   But the disease continues to have hot spots, and Atlanta's
Fulton County is one of them _ the eighth-worst county in the
United States, according to CDC statistics.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia will get $1.2 million in CDC funding as part of an $8.6
million nationwide push to eliminate the disease, CDC director
Jeffrey Koplan announced Thursday evening in Nashville. The funding
will be stretched over three years, and Fulton County will receive
80 percent of it.
</P>
<P>
   In a new report released Thursday, CDC said there were only
6,993 cases of syphilis in the United States in 1998, or 2.6 cases
for every 100,000 people. It is the lowest rate seen since the CDC
began tracking the disease in the 1950s. In 2,430 of the country's
3,115 counties, no syphilis was diagnosed last year at all.
</P>
<P>
   But in 28 counties _ 19 of them in the South _ the disease
remains a significant problem. In Fulton last year, there were 151
cases of syphilis, the CDC said. (In the hardest-hit county,
Baltimore County, Md., there were 456.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Half of all new cases of syphilis now come from just 28
counties,'' said Dr. Judith Wasserheit, director of CDC's division
of sexually transmitted disease prevention. ``These are the same
communities in which we see high rates of infant mortality, lower
than average life expectancy, and high rates of diseases such as
HIV.''
</P>
<P>
   Those numbers conceal other problems. Like other sexually
transmitted diseases, syphilis is a sign that safe-sex practices
aren't being followed. In addition, syphilis makes the body two to
five times more vulnerable to HIV infection. In women, untreated
syphilis can cause severe birth defects, or kill a developing
fetus.
</P>
<P>
   And syphilis is not evenly distributed through the population.
The rate of infection in African-Americans is 34 times that of
whites, CDC said.
</P>
<P>
   Public-health experts fear the remaining pockets of syphilis
could stymie the effort to eliminate it in the United States. The
incidence of the disease increases and decreases in 10-year waves.
The last peak was in 1990, when health authorities recorded the
highest rates of syphilis in 40 years. Each time the diseases
cycles back, rates of illness and death rise.
</P>
<P>
   ``The window of opportunity is very narrow and closing fast,''
Wasserheit said.
</P>
<P>
   To foil the disease's return, CDC Director Jeffrey Koplan
announced a five-point national program of syphilis elimination
Thursday. Speaking at a Nashville, Tenn., demonstration project
funded by CDC, Koplan said the agency hopes to reduce cases in the
U.S. to fewer than 1,000 by 2005.
</P>
<P>
   ``Historic moments are fleeting,'' Koplan said. ``If we do not
act now, this opportunity will be lost, certainly for many years,
perhaps forever.''
</P>

 &HT;    Syphilis down nationwide
 &HT;    By M.A.J. McKenna
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Syphilis has sunk to record lows in the United States
and could soon be eliminated from the country, the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   But the disease continues to have hot spots, and Atlanta's
Fulton County is one of them _ the eighth-worst county in the
United States, according to CDC statistics.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia will get $1.2 million in CDC funding as part of an $8.6
million nationwide push to eliminate the disease, CDC director
Jeffrey Koplan announced Thursday evening in Nashville. The funding
will be stretched over three years, and Fulton County will receive
80 percent of it.
</P>
<P>
   In a new report released Thursday, CDC said there were only
6,993 cases of syphilis in the United States in 1998, or 2.6 cases
for every 100,000 people. It is the lowest rate seen since the CDC
began tracking the disease in the 1950s. In 2,430 of the country's
3,115 counties, no syphilis was diagnosed last year at all.
</P>
<P>
   But in 28 counties _ 19 of them in the South _ the disease
remains a significant problem. In Fulton last year, there were 151
cases of syphilis, the CDC said. (In the hardest-hit county,
Baltimore County, Md., there were 456.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Half of all new cases of syphilis now come from just 28
counties,'' said Dr. Judith Wasserheit, director of CDC's division
of sexually transmitted disease prevention. ``These are the same
communities in which we see high rates of infant mortality, lower
than average life expectancy, and high rates of diseases such as
HIV.''
</P>
<P>
   Those numbers conceal other problems. Like other sexually
transmitted diseases, syphilis is a sign that safe-sex practices
aren't being followed. In addition, syphilis makes the body two to
five times more vulnerable to HIV infection. In women, untreated
syphilis can cause severe birth defects, or kill a developing
fetus.
</P>
<P>
   And syphilis is not evenly distributed through the population.
The rate of infection in African-Americans is 34 times that of
whites, CDC said.
</P>
<P>
   Public-health experts fear the remaining pockets of syphilis
could stymie the effort to eliminate it in the United States. The
incidence of the disease increases and decreases in 10-year waves.
The last peak was in 1990, when health authorities recorded the
highest rates of syphilis in 40 years. Each time the diseases
cycles back, rates of illness and death rise.
</P>
<P>
   ``The window of opportunity is very narrow and closing fast,''
Wasserheit said.
</P>
<P>
   To foil the disease's return, CDC Director Jeffrey Koplan
announced a five-point national program of syphilis elimination
Thursday. Speaking at a Nashville, Tenn., demonstration project
funded by CDC, Koplan said the agency hopes to reduce cases in the
U.S. to fewer than 1,000 by 2005.
</P>
<P>
   ``Historic moments are fleeting,'' Koplan said. ``If we do not
act now, this opportunity will be lost, certainly for many years,
perhaps forever.''
</P>
<P>
   No vaccine protects against syphilis, so elimination depends on
treating those who are infected. But unlike gonorrhea, the disease
has not developed antibiotic resistance _ so it can be easily
treated, often with one dose of antibiotics.
</P>
<P>
   To ensure that awareness and treatment spread widely, the CDC
program will emphasize community mobilization, involving schools,
churches and the courts.

21-YEAR-OLD CHOSEN TO BE MODEL FOR SYMBOL OF FRENCH REPUBLIC 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By SUZANNE DALEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ France's mayors announced their choice Thursday: Come
the millennium, Laetitia Casta, a 21-year-old model and actress
will be the model for Marianne, the symbol of the French Republic.
</P>
<P>
   For years, Marianne was an anonymous image of beauty and virtue
that symbolized the principles of the French Constitution. In
Delacroix's ``Liberty Leading the People'' she leads the rabble
over the barricades holding a flag in one hand and a riffle in the
other. More recently, Brigitte Bardot and Catherine Deneuve _ minus
weapons _ have been among those to pose for statues of her.
</P>
<P>
   But last month, the Association of French Mayors announced they
were looking for a new pretty face to grace the city halls and
other public buildings around the country.
</P>
<P>
   It offered its 36,000 members a choice of five celebrities _ two
supermodels, a game-show hostess, a singer and a TV news anchor _
to choose from, touching off an avalanche of objections.
</P>
<P>
   Critics said the process smacked of sexism and would produce a
Marianne who had none of the values of today's women. One mayor
took the association to task for turning the choice into a beauty
contest.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must move away from the conventional course of a Marianne
who is uniquely a symbol of feminine beauty,'' said Francoise
Cartron, the mayor of Artigues-pres-Bordeaux. ``These days women no
longer settle for the limitations that were too often forced on
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Others joined in. Michele Fitousi, chief editor of Elle
magazine, the nation's leading fashion monthly, wrote, ``If
Marianne must borrow the features of a famous woman, there are
women in literature, philosophy, politics, science, economics,
theater and film who could better represent the republic.''
</P>
<P>
   The mayor's association _ a group composed of only 5 percent
women _didn't budge. The head of the association, Jean Paul
Delevoye, insisted the association's choices did represent today's
woman.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Casta, who is best known for starring in lingerie ads and a
recent film version of Asterix the Gaul, got 36 percent of the
15,000 votes cast. Model Estelle Hallyday, got 29 percent. Nathalie
Simon, a former game-show hostess and windsurfing champion, got 16
percent. Patricia Kass, a waiflike singer, got 14 percent. Daniela
Lumbroso, a television journalist and the only one of the
candidates who could reasonably claim to be competing less on the
ground of glamor than as a representative of modern working women,
got the fewest votes, 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   A statue of Ms. Casta is to be unveiled in November. Interviewed
on television during a break in the filming of her latest movie,
she groped for words Thursday. Finally she said that being chosen
to be Marianne at the age of 21, was ``chouette, quoi.'' an
expression that meaning roughly, ``like, neat.''

 &HT;    Frito-Lay set to close Georgia plant
 &HT;    By Susan Harte
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ By this afternoon, the last white truck will have left
the Frito-Lay plant on Peachtree Industrial Boulevard in Chamblee,
Ga. It will haul its cases of Fritos, Lay's chips, Funyuns, Doritos
and Ruffles to stores where snack foods are sold.
</P>
<P>
   Then, the doors will be locked for good on this Atlanta landmark
that people now in their 60s remember gaping at as schoolchildren.
At its 1956 opening, Herman W. Lay's potato-chip plant was the very
essence of mass-production modernity.
</P>
<P>
   Now, CB Commercial will sell the plant and its 14 acres.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would imagine it will be demolished and replaced with front
parcels for commercial and retail spaces, and back parcels as
residential,'' said broker Patrick Laughlin.
</P>
<P>
   Since Frito-Lay announced the Chamblee closing in January, 440
salaried and hourly workers have retired, found other jobs, or
taken advantage of outplacement services.
</P>
<P>
   Fewer than 90 employees are left to finish shutting down the
plant, said Lynn Markley, a spokeswoman for Frito-Lay, the Plano,
Tex.-based snack-food arm of PepsiCo.
</P>
<P>
   She declined to say how many people have found other jobs.
Frito-Lay drivers and loading personnel weren't affected by the
layoffs, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The plant's closing was part of a plan to modernize and
consolidate U.S. manufacturing and distribution operations, Markley
said.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Chamblee, facilities were closed in Massachusetts,
Mississippi and North Carolina. About 400 to 450 jobs were cut, or
about 1 percent of PepsiCo's 40,000 workforce in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The snack-making operations are being transferred to new
factories in Lynchburg, Va., Jonesboro, Ark., and Fayetteville,
Tenn., and to two other locations. One is in Perry, Ga., and the
other is in Killingly, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   The Chamblee plant closing ``has to do with efficiency,'' said
analyst Marc I. Cohen of Goldman Sachs. The reconfiguration will
help PepsiCo, he said.
</P>
<P>
   PepsiCo's earnings per share dragged in the early 1990s, but
have shown steady increases since 1996, when Roger Enrico became
chairman and chief executive. In 1997, it sold off a fast-food unit
and bought Borden's Cracker Jack brand.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the company bought Tropicana juices from Seagram's
and brought out its own lemon-lime drink. Earlier this year,
PepsiCo took public a 65 percent interest in its bottling
operations.
</P>
<P>
   PepsiCo's first chairman, Herman Lay, a North Carolinian, came
to Atlanta as a young man.
</P>
<P>
   In 1938, he founded the H.W. Lay Co. in downtown Atlanta. In
1961, he merged the company with The Frito Co. of San Antonio, and
formed Frito-Lay. Four years later, Lay and Donald M. Kendall,
president of Pepsi-Cola, merged his company with Frito-Lay to form
PepsiCo.
</P>
<P>
   Herman Lay died in Dallas in 1982 at age 73.
</P>
<P>
   Frito-Lay currently contributes more than one-third of PepsiCo's
$16 billion in annual revenues. PepsiCo closed Thursday at $33.12
1/2, down 6 1/4 cents.

 &HT;    Online grocer ready to deliver
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The online grocer WebVan may be the first to bring
online grocery shopping to metro Atlanta residents.
</P>
<P>
   According to the company's S-1 registration statement with the
SEC, WebVan should begin delivering groceries to area residents in
the second quarter of next year. Last spring, Intelligent Systems
for Retailing announced the lease of a 350,000-square-foot building
in Suwanee, Ga., to WebVan which could be used as a distribution
facility.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, WebVan (www.Webvan.com) said it would delay its IPO
after the Securities and Exchange Commission said WebVan executives
were spending too much time talking to the media during the
company's ``quiet period'' prior to its IPO.
</P>
<P>
   In grocery terms, you could say that online grocer WebVan was
selling produce before it was ripe.
</P>
<P>
   The SEC was particularly concerned about articles on the
California-based company in Forbes and BusinessWeek, the Wall
Street Journal reported, citing unnamed sources.
</P>
<P>
   Of particular concern was a recent BusinessWeek cover story on
the top 25 Internet personalities, which featured WebVan CEO Louis
Borders on the cover.
</P>
<P>
   WebVan also was just a little too chatty with many institutional
investors. The company reportedly was more than willing to give out
information to potential investors that was not included in its
prospectus.
</P>
<P>
   Although Atlanta residents can buy dry goods from several
competing Web sites including Peapod (www.peapod.com), NetGrocer
(www.netgrocer.com) and Whole Foods (www.wholefoods.com), which
opened its first market in Atlanta in May, WebVan would be the
first to deliver perishable goods.
</P>
<P>
   About 200,000 shoppers buy groceries online nationwide,
according to industry reports. This is a relatively small number,
but true online grocery shopping is only available in a handful of
major cities.
</P>
<P>
   ``A market like Atlanta is something we would certainly look at.
It fits a demographic,'' said Amy Larson, a Peapod spokeswoman.
``Peapod is exploring expansion into various metropolitan markets,
and when we do, we look at a wide variety of criteria. A number of
things have to fall into place,'' she said. ``Like any expanding
business, you have to have distribution facilities, some type of
partner to provide you with inventory. And, you have to have
employees.''

<P>
   MARTIN-GUERRE-MUSICAL (Minneapolis) _ ``Martin Guerre,'' the
British musical that has returned more often than, well, Martin
Guerre, finally had its American premiere here on Sept. 29. It was
the fourth opening for the show, counting its first one in London's
West End in 1996, and a climactic night for Alain Boublil and
Claude-Michel Schonberg, who first brought the idea to the producer
Cameron Mackintosh a full seven years ago. The tale is based on the
often-told true story of the 16th-century Frenchman who, left for
dead on the battlefield, returns home to find his identity _ his
standing in the village and his place in the marriage bed _ assumed
by his friend and fellow soldier. By Bruce Weber. &UR;  &LR; (Moved).

   &UR; FILM AND VIDEO &LR;
</P>
<P>
   TAIWAN-FILM-DIRECTOR (Undated) _ Could it be that one of today's
most important film artists _ the critic J. Hoberman calls him
``the world's greatest active narrative filmmaker'' _ is a
Taiwanese director virtually unknown here? American audiences,
accustomed to gauging a movie's importance by its advertising
budget and buzz, may understandably scoff at such a claim.
Regardless, the director in question, Hou Hsiao-hsien, is a star of
the international circuit. Six of his last seven pictures have been
shown at this year's New York Film Festival, which ends Sunday, yet
none were released in the United States theatrically. By Phillip
Lopate. (Moved).

   &UR; THEATER &LR;
</P>
<P>
   LIFE-DREAM-THEATER (London) _ Imagine a play that suggests
Shakespeare _ ``Hamlet'' or ``The Tempest,'' particularly _
filtered through a Pirandellian prism, with an enormous gilt-edged
mirror suspended forbiddingly above the action and a gravel-strewn
set providing its own aural soundscape. That is one way of
describing the production of ``Life Is a Dream'' by the Royal
Lyceum Theater Company of Scotland that arrives in New York on
Tuesday at the Brooklyn Academy of Music. The Spanish director
Calixto Bieito's fevered staging of the defining 17th-century play
by Pedro Calderon de la Barca will have six performances at the
Harvey Theater as part of 1999 Next Wave Festival. By Matt Wolf.

<P>
   &UR; CLASSICAL MUSIC &LR;
</P>
<P>
   GIGLIO-OPERA-COMPANY (Lucca, Italy) _ Small opera companies like
the Teatro del Giglio here worry that their centuries-old trueness
to themselves marks them as provincials unable to cope with any art
but their own. American opera companies, long dependent on private
philanthropy and fund-raising prowess, look across the Atlantic,
envying countries like France and Germany, where federal money for
the arts has flowed almost endlessly. With financial faucets
closing, Europeans now wish they had developed the money-generating
skills that Americans have refined into an art. These matters are
particularly acute in a small Tuscan city like Lucca and a country
like Italy, where opera is not a plaything for the well heeled but
government business. By Bernard Holland. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   PITTMAN-JENNINGS-MUSIC (Undated) _ Piecing together the clues,
the astrologically challenged reporter gathers that Sagittarians
are orderly, methodical, not to be hustled. At 48, the
Oklahoma-born, Paris-based baritone David Pittman-Jennings
exemplifies the sign. Since choosing voice over the oboe as his
vehicle for artistic expression at the end of the Vietnam War, he
has gone on to master repertoire ranging from Bach to the most
mandarin of the moderns. On Saturday he celebrates what seems to be
a tardy New York debut in the title role of Luigi Dallapiccola's
``Il Prigioniero'' (``The Prisoner''), in concert with the Montreal
Symphony Orchestra under Charles Dutoit. By Matthew Gurewitsch.
(Moved).

American Celebration,'' is the latest of its CD compilations of
archival recordings. By Allan Kozinn. (Moved).

   &UR; ART &LR;
</P>
<P>
   CORTAZAR-ART (Mexico City) _ The painter, Roberto Cortazar,
regards this city, where he was born 37 years ago, as ``a kind of
body.'' Cortazar's preoccupation with the human figure and his
meticulous rendering of it helped draw attention to his work soon
after he graduated from the National School of the Arts here in
1983. For his drawings, he won a prize that year named after the
important Mexican modern artist Jose Luis Cuevas. An exhibition of
Cortazar's new paintings opens on Thursday at Praxis International
Art on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. By Edward M. Gomez.

</P>
<P>
   MASKS-ART (St. Louis) _ For 30,000 years, all sorts of people
have felt the need to create masks. From cavemen to astronauts,
they have worn them for protection, as a disguise or as a way of
transforming themselves spiritually. Masks reflect a range of human
expression: funny, sinister, ascetic, wild or haunting. ``Masks:
Faces of Culture,'' an exhibition at the St. Louis Art Museum that
is the first to survey ancient through modern masks. The show,
which opens this weekend and remains through Jan. 2. By Rita Reif.
(Moved).
</P>
<P>
   CHARDIN-ART (Paris) _ Twenty years after the last major
exhibition of his work in Paris, Chardin, the 18th-century French
still-life and genre painter, is the subject of yet another big
retrospective at the Grand Palais through Nov. 22. Why so soon for
someone who is not exactly a household name? Well, no one, it
seems, can resist round numbers: 1979 was the 200th anniversary of
Jean-Baptiste-Simeon Chardin's death; 1999 is the 300th anniversary
of his birth. By Alan Riding. (Moved).

topic of the 1970s comes up, as it seems to so often these days,
thoughts may drift to those obvious icons of the Me Decade. That's
one reason that Mark Brazill, 37, a former stand-up comedian turned
sitcom writer, is an executive producer and co-creator of the hit
Fox series ``That 70's Show.'' By Andy Meisler. (Moved).

BACK-TO-SCHOOL SALES GIVE RETAILERS A LIFT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS REIDY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Despite Hurricane Floyd and the ups and downs of the stock
market, many US retailers reported brisk sales for September, a big
back-to-school month.
</P>
<P>
   After several unseasonably warm autumns, a cool September saw
strong demand for apparel, and with consumers still spending
freely, the early signs are that most chains can expect to enjoy a
solid holiday season.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, some Wall Street analysts looked at September sales
and lowered holiday forecasts, figuring US consumers were starting
to cut back on previously exuberant spending.
</P>
<P>
   But there was little in Thursday's numbers to suggest consumers
are about to stop their shopping spree any time soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's no longer shop-till-you-drop,'' said Kurt Barnard,
president of Barnard's Retail Trend Report. ``It's shop _ and then
shop some more.''
</P>
<P>
   Looking at sales at stores open at least a year _ a measurement
known as same-store sales _ Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi Ltd.
calculated that overall retail sales rose 6.7 percent when compared
with September sales a year ago; that was a bit better than
expectations, Bloomberg News reported.
</P>
<P>
   Economists keep ``theorizing'' that consumers can't keep up this
spending pace forever, said John Hancock Funds analyst Steve
Paspal. ``But I don't see any signs of weakness.''
</P>
<P>
   Unemployment and inflation rates are low. And though the Federal
Reserve twice hiked interest rates over the summer in a bid to keep
the economy from overheating, no one has been able to detect any
real evidence of a slowdown in consumer spending.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer spending makes up about two-thirds of the total economy
and has been responsible for much of the recent boom.
</P>
<P>
   Based on September results, Barnard said he expected retailers
to post average same-store gains of 5 percent for the holiday
season, and Paspal estimated ``mid single-digit growth.''
</P>
<P>
   East Coast retailers in the path of Hurricane Floyd saw some
mixed September sales as a result of the storm. Some lost business
because they had to temporarily close stores, but others got a
boost from consumers loading up on flashlights, food, and
generators.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, discount chains generally fared better than
department stores. Consumers may be spending freely, but many of
them were still hunting for values.
</P>
<P>
   Wal-Mart Stores Inc., the world's largest retailer, said
same-store sales were up 7.2 percent in September.
</P>
<P>
   Bradlees Inc., the Braintree, Mass. discount chain, said
same-store sales rose 10.2 percent for the month.
</P>
<P>
   ``September sales continue our strong sales momentum,'' said
Peter Thorner, Bradlees chairman and chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   Bradlees, which has performed well since emerging from
bankruptcy protection early this year, also said it was opening two
stores, one in Philadelphia, the other in New Jersey. These are the
first store openings for the chain in four years.
</P>
<P>
   TJX Cos. of Framingham, Mass. continued its winning ways. Led by
its T.J. Maxx and Marshalls chains, the company said same-store
results for September rose 7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sales trends this fall continue to be robust,'' said TJX
chairman and chief executive Bernard Cammarata.
</P>
<P>
   BJ's Wholesale Club Inc. of Natick, Mass. said its monthly
same-store sales were up 6.9 percent. ``September sales reflect
strong demand for apparel, jewelry, and computer software,'' said
BJ's president and chief executive Jack Nugent.
</P>
<P>
   Luxury retailer Neiman Marcus has seen the pace of business pick
up in recent months. Though the Chestnut Hill, Mass. retailer had
easy comparisons with last September's soft sales, this year's gain
of 13.5 percent is partly because customers are willing to pay full
price for the chain's high-end apparel lines and women's
accessories, said chain spokesman Peter Farwell.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a lot of momentum,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A willingness to pay full price also helped Talbots Inc. of
Hingham, Mass. post big numbers. Earlier in the week, the company
said its September same-store sales rose a whopping 16.6 percent.
In recent years, Talbots had seemed to lose touch with its
customers _ middle-age women who favor classic fashions.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, Talbots hired chief merchandising officer H. James
Metscher to help engineer a comeback. His first product line has
just reached stores, and customers were snapping it up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Customer response to our fall merchandise in both stores and
catalog was exceptional during the month'' of September, said
Arnold B. Zetcher, Talbot's president and chief executive.

NEW HAMPSHIRE STANDS PAT ON FEB. 1, 2000 PRIMARY DATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JILL ZUCKMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   New Hampshire officials ran out of options Thursday to change
the date of their 2000 primary, leaving presidential candidates
scrambling to revamp their strategies to match an unprecedented
prospect: the crucial Iowa caucuses and New Hampshire primary, set
to fall just one day apart.
</P>
<P>
   The New Hampshire primary will be held on Feb. 1 of 2000,
exactly as Secretary of State William Gardner had scheduled it.
Despite a steady drumbeat among Statehouse leaders to reverse
Gardner's decision and reset the date for Feb. 8, lawmakers in
Concord admitted that they do not have the votes to call the
Legislature back into session and pass the necessary legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Iowa officials are holding fast to plans to hold
caucuses on January 31. Traditionally, a good showing in Iowa has
given candidates a bounce of favorable publicity in New Hampshire.
But without some breathing room between the caucuses and the
primary _ in past years, at least eight days has been the norm _
political calculations of the Iowa impact are out the window.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Schnur, communications director for Republican John McCain,
believes that if the calendar holds, New Hampshire will become more
important than Iowa. That would be happy news for McCain, if true,
as Iowa is a state McCain has declined to compete in.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's only going to be a three-hour window between the end
of the caucuses in Iowa and the beginning of the voting in Dixville
Notch,'' said Schnur. ``It's going to be awfully tough to take
advantage of any bounce you get coming out of the caucuses in that
short a time.''
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Campion, a political consultant at the Dewey Square Group
who has worked for the presidential campaigns of both Walter
Mondale and Michael S. Dukakis, said there's no way of knowing how
the contests will play out.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a dynamic neither party has dealt with before,'' said
Campion.
</P>
<P>
   In Concord, the governor and other elected officials expressed
regret that they did not have the ability to rescind Gardner's
decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having consulted our various caucuses, the legislative
leadership of the House and the Senate in New Hampshire are clear
that the primary date is the first and there is insufficient
enthusiasm for changing that date,'' said Peter Burling of Cornish,
the House Democratic leader.
</P>
<P>
   Iowa and New Hampshire have been in an angry stand-off recently
over the dates of their respective primary events for next year.
According to Iowa state law, there supposed to be at least eight
between the caucuses and the New Hampshire primary. This time,
however, Iowa set its date for Jan. 31, while Gardner set New
Hampshire's date for Feb. 1 in order to comply with the Granite
State's law.
</P>
<P>
   New Hampshire Governor Jeanne Shaheen and others have been
worried that the antagonism between the two states would harm New
Hampshire's special first-in-the-nation primary status in future
elections.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement Thursday, Shaheen said she wants to maintain the
eight-day window with Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should be working together with Iowa, as we have in the
past, to protect the status and relevance of the
first-in-the-nation caucus and the first-in-the-nation primary,''
Shaheen said. ``Secretary Gardner's decision will stand, and we
must now focus our efforts on protecting our primary.''
</P>
<P>
   New Hampshire law requires Gardner to set the date of the
primary so that it is seven days ahead of any similar event.
Delaware Republicans decided to hold their primary on Feb. 8,
forcing Gardner to set the New Hampshire date for Feb. 1.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, Iowa has waited until New Hampshire set its date
before locking in the caucuses.
</P>
<P>
   But Iowa officials this year settled on January 31 before
Gardner made his ruling, and have vociferously protested making a
change now, particularly as hotel rooms across the state are booked
for a pork convention and other meetings. A delegation from Iowa
even flew to New Hampshire to try to persuade Gardner to change the
date, but he refused.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Shannahan, the spokesman for Iowa Governor Tom Vilsack, said
the caucuses will be held Jan. 31st, regardless of New Hampshire's
date. ``It's very unfortunate,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, Gardner continued to enjoy support from Hugh Gregg,
the former Republican governor who has been active in preserving
the state's first-primary status.
</P>
<P>
   ``Iowa messed up. They never took the trouble to find out when
we were going to hold the primary,'' he said. ``They're going to
have to move back. It's their problem, not ours. They are totally
unreasonable.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Gardner said he is relieved that the tussling over
the date has ended.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good,'' he said, when told his decision would stand.

MIXED TOPICS FOR CARROLL AT PRESS CONFERENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ The vastly different worlds of baseball and
football injuries converged Thursday at Pete Carroll's daily press
conference.
</P>
<P>
   Carroll announced that middle linebacker Ted Johnson's timetable
to return to practice from his torn left biceps tendon has been
accelerated to ``early November.'' He also predicted running back
Robert Edwards (knee) will make it back to football. And he spoke
passionately about the injury suffered Wednesday by Red Sox ace
Pedro Martinez in Game 1 of the AL Division Series.
</P>
<P>
   Carroll was asked whether he thought Martinez should have stayed
in the game, and whether a football player would have come out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ask Pedro. Do you think he'd take himself out of the game if
he couldn't play?'' Carroll said. ``This guy is a great competitor,
so there's no way. The guy couldn't perform. To think anything else
. . . What are you thinking? How can you even start to think that?
He couldn't play. I'm dead serious about it. That guy would have
been in there. You don't think he wanted to win that game? Look
what he's done. Anyone who would question that ethic is a thousand
miles off track.
</P>
<P>
   ``This guy is throwing the ball 100 miles per hour. With the
body he has, he has to be perfectly finely tuned. He wasn't gonna
be able to help his team. He didn't think he could because he was
hurt. He was right. Think about how hard it was for him to have to
do that. It's killing him.''
</P>
<P>
   Carroll turned less serious when he was asked if the Patriots
staff would have rushed Martinez back. ``That's right. We'd be
rubbing him down and (having) the laying of the hands, throwing
chicken legs at him,'' quipped Carroll.
</P>
<P>
   Carroll has apparently been throwing those same chicken legs at
Johnson, who this week has engaged in pre-practice drills for the
first time since his training camp injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ted is encouraged and the doctors are encouraged so that makes
me feel encouarged,'' Carroll said. ``He's at practice now for the
first week doing the footwork drills, and starting to get into the
movement things we do with linebackers, working in the weight room
on a strict program. We're looking toward the day when he has full
flexibility and when he can really scale up his lifting. What this
leads to is an opitmistic date of him being able to practice in
early November.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what Ted and I are looking at, and the doctors are
talking somewhat later than that. We're trying to beat it by two or
three weeks. He's doing quite well. He's at all the meetings; he's
involved with everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson realizes he'd be ``beating the odds'' if he returns to
game action by his target date of Thanksgiving, but he's going for
it. Johnson has some experience with this rehab. He suffered the
same injury to his right biceps tendon last December while trying
to tackle Steelers running back Jerome Bettis.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tendon is still very sensitive,'' Johnson said. ``You can
bang it against a table and feel the pain through your arm. We have
to get full flexibility first. I still can't straighten my arm out.
We're trying to be optimistic and hope to salvage the season, but
sometimes it feels like maybe we're trying to speed something up
that won't let it be sped up.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson is at the eight-week point after the surgery. Thinking
back to the eight-week period following the other biceps injury,
Johnson said, ``I was sitting at home on my couch not doing
anything. I was told to rest it. At the time, it was the offseason
and there was no reason to rush it, because if you just let it heal
on its own for five months it'll heal on its own. But you won't
have the muscle definition nor mass you need to play football.''
</P>
<P>
   That's why Johnson has begun the other aspects of training. He's
been working on his legs, abdominals, back, and even his ``good
arm.'' Johnson said that when the time comes, he hopes to be able
to step right back on the field.
</P>
<P>
   It's an optimism Carroll has inspired in Johnson. It is an
optimism Carroll still feels for Edwards, who has made great
progress after suffering a severe left knee dislocation during a
rookie event during Pro Bowl weekend in February. Edwards is still
working out at the University of Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Robert Edwards is gonna make it back,'' said Carroll.
``Robert Edwards thinks he's gonna make it back. Not many people on
the other side think that. How else can you have a miraculous
recovery? How else can you have a rehab that's off the charts if
you don't think that way? If you get back when they tell you to get
back, you have a normal rehab. Well, we ain't going for that.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll see how fortunate Ted's recovery is without setbacks. If
it goes on track, maybe he will be back by then. I don't care what
they (doctors) think right now. I consciously want to be very
optimistic. I'm just telling you what we're shooting for. If it
stays on course, then we'll just back it up and continue to try and
accelerate that date.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked to explain his stance, Carroll said, ``I'm a coach and
they're the doctors. They want him to heal and I want him to play.
I don't like the time frames on any of these injuries. I'm not
satisfied with `it's a two-week injury, get back when you can get
back.' Get back on the field as soon as possible. That's how we
approach injuries. Sometimes we come back too early, sometimes we
come back too late. I'm at odds with the doctors all the time over
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said he's lifting light weight, ``about the amount of a
can of coffee. . . . I'm doing everything I can do in the meantime,
so there won't be much else to catch up on.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Johnson the tutor
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Johnson has continued in his role as mentor to Andy Katzenmoyer.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday Carroll pulled him into the office to go over the
defensive game plan for Kansas City. The coach got Johnson's input
on what he feels Katzenmoyer would be comfortable with.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just knew when I was younger the game plans were sometimes
too much for me to comprehend,'' said Johnson. ``I just think if
you simplify things for a young guy they're much better off.''
</P>

<P>
   Sky's the limit for Cloud
</P>
<P>

 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City coach Gunther Cunningham didn't know whether former
Boston College running back Mike Cloud would be active after
dressing for the first time last week. ``His character and work
ethic are nothing but tremendous for him,'' he said. ``With Kimble
Anders out, he started dressing this week. He played a lot on our
special teams. I hope he'll play this week. I think he will.''
</P>
<P>
   The Chiefs will enter Sunday's game a bit banged up. The biggest
concern is left tackle, where veteran Glenn Parker (elbow) will not
play. There is a possibility the Chiefs may activate John Tait,
their first-round pick from Brigham Young, for the first time. Tait
held out and was a late arrival at camp. Also questionable are
running back Bam Morris (hamstring) and defensive tackle Ty Parten
(shoulder).

FIDELITY GETTING INTO LATE-TRADING GAME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNNLEY BROWNING  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Betting that stock market-crazed Americans want to buy
and sell shares well into the night, Fidelity Investments will let
ordinary investors trade securities outside traditional market
hours beginning next month.
</P>
<P>
   Boston-based Fidelity, the nation's biggest mutual fund firm,
said Thursday it would extend its trading hours for on-line
investors to include a 4:30 p.m.-to-8 p.m. slot.
</P>
<P>
   The steps by Fidelity, which is also the nation's second largest
discount brokerage, follow similar moves by competitors in recent
months. Charles Schwab &AMP; Co., the San Francisco-based fund purveyor
and the leading discount brokerage, announced after-hours trading
plans earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
   The race is to capture the allegiance and wallets of wealthy,
do-it-yourself investors, who account for the lion's share of
revenues at on-line brokerages. The bet is that investors can't get
enough of Wall Street's record-breaking bull market and will want
to monitor their portfolios, research companies, and trade stocks
well into the evening. The hope is that extended hours will appeal
to West Coast investors, who are three hours behind the New
York-based markets and practically unable to trade after lunch.
</P>
<P>
   Web brokerages also want to offer clients who work during
regular market hours the opportunity to trade once they get home.
</P>
<P>
   ``After-hours trading is a service that is of great interest to
our involved, active traders,'' said Tracey Curvey, executive vice
president of Fidelity's on-line brokerage, in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's main exchanges _ the New York Stock Exchange and
the Nasdaq over-the-counter market _ open at 9 a.m. The NYSE sounds
its closing bell at 4 p.m.; its cousin, under a new schedule, two
and a half hours later.
</P>
<P>
   Institutional, or professional, investors have long been able to
trade stocks through the night, using alternative, round-the-clock
exchanges known as electronic communications networks. Most ECNs
shut down sometime during the 30 minutes following the NYSE's close
to regroup for extended trading.
</P>
<P>
   But do ordinary investors really want to skip dinner to buy
Microsoft?
</P>
<P>
   Dan Burke, an on-line brokerage analyst at Gomez Advisers, said
the after-hours market was quite small and would take a while to
grow. ``The volumes are just not there yet,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   After-hours trading is likely to appeal less to day traders _
investors who frantically buy and sell stocks dozens of times a day
_ and more to active but serious investors who trade dozens of
times a year.
</P>
<P>
   The boom in on-line brokerages has attracted millions of such
investors in recent years. ``Serious investors now dominate the
Internet investing landscape,'' Burke said, adding that people
trading from 80 to 100 times a year _ so-called hyperactive traders
_ now account for only 10 percent of the on-line investing market,
compared with 50 percent two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Under its after-hours trading program, to start in early
November, Fidelity will allow clients to place limit orders _
commands to buy securities at or below a set price _ for Nasdaq
stocks and a limited number of NYSE stocks. Investors must buy
round lots of at least 100 shares.
</P>
<P>
   When asked if Fidelity would offer 24-hour trading, spokesman
James Griffin said, ``This is a start; we'll look at things as we
move forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Datek Online Holdings, a Web-only brokerage, began the
after-hours craze for ordinary investors in August. Soon, ETrade
Group, a competitor, teamed up with Reuters' Instinet, one of the
biggest ECNs, to do the same. Traditional Wall Street brokerages,
including Citigroup's Salomon Smith Barney and Morgan Stanley Dean
Witter, followed suit. Even the NYSE is considering extended hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's potentially a growth market,'' said Amar Mehta, an
industry analyst at CIBC World Markets. ``But after a while, people
are going to want to do something other than trade stocks.''
</P>
<P>
   The proliferation of ECNs and various extended-hours trading
programs has industry regulators worried that the after-hours
market is fragmented, chaotic, and potentially unable to provide
investors with the best prices.
</P>
<P>
   Fidelity will process after-hours trades through REDIBook, an

MELVIN O. DACUS: CO-FOUNDER OF CASA MANANA MUSICALS IN FORT WORTH
</HEADLINE>
 (EDS: If available typographically, the first ``n'' in Manana takes
a tilde), (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PERRY STEWART 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Melvin O. Dacus _ a singer, actor and
producer who co-founded Casa Manana Musicals and symbolized musical
theater in North Texas for four decades _ died Wednesday of
congestive heart failure at his Fort Worth home. He was 76.
</P>
<P>
   Family members, including Katy Dacus, his wife of 50 years and
frequent co-star on stage, were with him when he died.
</P>
<P>
   Entombment will be private. Visitation will be until noon Monday
at Greenwood Funeral Home in Fort Worth. A memorial service will be
at 3 p.m. Monday at University Christian Church in Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   During the Dacus era as vice president or producer/general
manager of the theater-in-the-round, the Casa stage was a summer
proving ground for many performers who would become famous, among
them Betty Buckley, Beverly Sills, Morgan Fairchild, Cindy Pickett
and Brent Spiner.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Dacus' tenure at Casa also saw the introduction to Fort
Worth audiences of Ruta Lee, arguably the most popular performer in
that theater's history.
</P>
<P>
   To one generation of theatergoers, Mr. Dacus was known as
producer/general manager of Casa. To those of a later era, he was
the white-bearded character actor known for a range of portrayals
including Tevye in ``Fiddler on the Roof,'' crotchety Sheridan
Whiteside in ``The Man Who Came to Dinner,'' the grandfather in the
religious pageant ``The Promise'' and an elderly ex-rodeo rider in
``The Golden Shadows Old West Museum.''
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Dacus' many appearances as Santa Claus in TV commercials and
live productions established him in the minds of many as the next
best thing to the Jolly Old Elf himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I wrote my novel, The Autobiography of Santa Claus, the
voice I kept hearing in my head was Mel's,'' said Star-Telegram
books editor Jeff Guinn. ``It was a thrill for me when Mel provided
Santa's voice on the audiobook version.''
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Dacus was born March 15, 1923, in Fort Worth. His father,
James Alexander Dacus, was head of the Texas Christian University
business school when it moved to Fort Worth. The elder Dacus helped
select the site of the current campus.
</P>
<P>
   Melvin Dacus graduated from TCU in 1944 and had a longtime
association with the university. Friends and family have
established a performance award in his memory at TCU.
</P>
<P>
   His last major stage appearance was in 1995 as the philosophical
furniture dealer in ``The Price'' at Theatre Three in Dallas. In a
Star-Telegram interview a few weeks before his death, Mr. Dacus
said it was one of his favorite roles.
</P>
<P>
   Although Mr. Dacus was weak and confined to bed, he raised up to
greet the reporter in his familiar robust baritone. His eldest
daughter, a nurse, cautioned him: ``You're not on stage, Daddy.
Don't try to project. It'll tire you out.''
</P>
<P>
   In that final interview, Mr. Dacus reflected on many aspects of
his life, including the World War II combat experience that few of
his show business friends knew about. He was a young lieutenant
among the second wave of Marines to land on Iwo Jima. Although he
rarely talked about the war in later years, the experience had a
profound influence on him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was there when they raised the flag the second time on
Iwo,'' he recalled. ``I couldn't really see it because I was
hunkered down in a foxhole. But I heard the other men up closer
cheering _ kind of a guttural cheer, almost a growl. I'll never
forget the sound.''
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Dacus and Fort Worth oilman James H. Snowden formed the
nonprofit corporation that built Casa Manana in 1958 on the Fort
Worth site of the Casa Manana amphitheater, which showman Billy
Rose created for the 1936 Texas Centennial. For several years Mr.
Dacus served as vice president of Casa Manana Musicals. He became
producer/general manager in 1966, holding that post until 1975.
</P>
<P>
   The family suggests that expressions of sympathy be in the form
of contributions to the Melvin O. Dacus Performance Award in care
of Adam Baggs, University Advancement Office, TCU P.O. Box 297044,
Fort Worth, TX 76129.
</P>
<P>
   Survivors include his wife, Katy Dacus, who appeared in many
productions with her husband; daughter Kim Dacus Reynolds and son,
Brent Dacus, all of Fort Worth; daughter Mindy Dacus Fabiano of Los
Angeles; a brother, James Alexander Dacus Jr. of Fort Worth; and a
sister, Maude Englantine Bennett of Dallas.

 &HT;    CLINTON TRIES TO WOO LABOR FOR GORE
 &HT;    Eds: Retopping a story that originally moved for Sept. 24.
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (p) politics categories.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton on Thursday became the first
chief executive since Franklin D. Roosevelt to address members of
the Teamsters' union.
</P>
<P>
   The timing was no accident.
</P>
<P>
   With Vice President Al Gore locked in a battle with former U.S.
Sen. Bill Bradley over the Democratic presidential nomination,
organized labor has become a key battleground.
</P>
<P>
   Emerging from a meeting in New York with James Hoffa, president
of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, Clinton wouldn't say
whether he came out and asked the labor leader to endorse Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, we didn't talk much about that,'' Clinton told
reporters, adding that much of the conversation centered on Hoffa's
concern over international trading agreements and the growing
imbalance between the United States and its global trading
partners.
</P>
<P>
   `` We had a good talk about golf,'' said Clinton. ``We didn't
talk too much about other politics.''
</P>
<P>
   In a speech later to 1,000 labor officials and analysts at a
dinner honoring Hoffa, Clinton ticked off the litany of initiatives
he's pressed on behalf of American workers: raising the minimum
wage, fighting for improved health care coverage and shoring up
Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   It was his standard rhetorical message, but this time with a
special appeal: anyone happy with Clinton's agenda should vote to
replace him with the next best thing - Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has been seeking labor's endorsement since February but has
been countered so far by Bradley, who has trudged through union
halls across the country seeking the support of leaders and rank
and file workers.
</P>
<P>
   With the nation's labor organizations _ a traditional Democratic
stronghold _ yet to endorse Gore, Clinton has raised his profile
among worker unions over the past week.
</P>
<P>
   He delivered a eulogy for the late AFL-CIO icon Lane Kirkland
last week in Washington. And on Thursday he journeyed to New York
to address the dinner honoring Hoffa.
</P>
<P>
   Kirkland's funeral, naturally, was unforseen, but there was
nothing accidental in the timing of Thursday's address.
</P>
<P>
   The AFL-CIO, a federation of labor unions, including the
powerful Teamsters, holds its annual convention next week in Los
Angeles. Clinton is pressing the group, the largest labor
organization in the country, to step forward and cast its lot with
Gore.
</P>
<P>
   It's not an easy sell. Organized labor is still smarting from
Clinton's work five years ago to pass the North American Free Trade
Agreement, or NAFTA. The controversial treaty essentially wedded
the U.S., Canadian and Mexican economies, putting millions of
American workers in direct competition with their low-wage rivals
south of the border.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffa took Clinton to task over the issue again on Thursday, and
no card-carrying union member has forgotten that it was Gore who
defended the treaty in a widely viewed televised debate against
NAFTA opponent Ross Perot.
</P>
<P>
   As in his appeal to organized labor, Clinton faces complications
in his efforts to help Gore more broadly.
</P>
<P>
   His own presidency is indelibly stained by scandal. There are
signs that the public is weary of Clinton and his political and
personal entourage. And when he plays to his rhetorical strengths,
it often highlights Gore's own limitations in connecting with
crowds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Clinton can help him only in a very careful sort of
way,'' said Darrell West, a Brown University political science
professor. ``He can't be heavy-handed about helping him.''
</P>
<P>
   Presidents have a natural tendency to be cautious in promoting
their number-twos, whether because of petty jealousy, professional
egotism or reservations borne of working closely with them for four
or more years.
</P>
<P>
   Few vice presidents have won election to replace their bosses.
In 1988, George Bush became the first sitting vice president to be
elected to the top job since Martin Van Buren's win 152 years
earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The White House insists that Clinton very much wants Gore to be
the next president.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can tell you with 100 percent certainty that he's not
ambivalent,'' said Clinton's spokesman, Joe Lockhart.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, said Lockhart, Clinton views Gore's campaign as
something of a mission, one key to the Clinton legacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``He honestly believes that we've changed the way we do business
in this town,'' said Lockhart. ``It's very important to him that we
build on this success, rather than undo many of the steps we've
taken to move forward, and he thinks that the vice president's the
best person to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore can take credit, too, for many successes _ including an
economy that has grown by nearly 40 percent on Clinton's watch _
stemming from Clinton, who still enjoys a 59 percent job approval
rating, according to a two-week-old Gallup poll.
</P>
<P>
   Finding the best way to translate that into gains for Gore,
though, is dicey.
</P>
<P>
   One of the first things any vice president seeking the
presidency must do is convince the public that, after years of
playing a supporting role, he's suddenly ready to lead.
</P>
<P>
   For Clinton to take an aggressive approach in the selling of Al
Gore might only underscore Clinton's leadership abilities, not
Gore's.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem for a vice president always is to establish
themselves as their own person without repudiating their boss,''
said Jonathan Siegel, director of the Harris Interactive Election
2000, a project of the Rochester, N.Y.,-based Harris polling
agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's up to Al Gore to both have the message and the ability to
communicate it,'' said Siegel. ``Bill Clinton can't do it for him,
his handlers can't do it and his advisers can't do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore appears to suffer, moreover, in areas where Clinton is
strong.
</P>
<P>
   A poll taken Sept. 10-14 among 1,698 Americans by the Gallup
Organization shows Gore trailing George W. Bush by 19 points in
people's perceptions of Gore's effectiveness as a manager; by 16
points in his ability to affect change; and by 20 points in his
ability to inspire others.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those are the same things that Clinton has done well on
historically,'' said Frank Newport, editor in chief of the Gallup
Polls.
</P>
<P>
   ``How Bill Clinton transfers those kinds of characteristics onto
Gore is a real challenge,'' said Newport. ``I don't think that you
can do that by osmosis.''
</P>
<P>
   The Gore-Clinton equation is further complicated by Clinton's
impeachment-marred conduct in office. Enough Americans from both
parties still regard Clinton's behavior as sufficiently
reprehensible, and his impact on the office as sufficiently
corrosive, that Gore stands to suffer, in some quarters at least,
by association.
</P>
<P>
   At best, Clinton polarized much of the nation, splitting the
electorate into Clinton supporters and Clinton despisers. That's
left precious little of the ideological middle ground over which
presidential campaigns are fought.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I were Al Gore, would I really want Bill Clinton going
around and campaigning for me,'' wondered Roger Hartley, who
teaches government at Roanoke College in Salem, Va. ``The president
is kind of a lightning rod.''
</P>
<P>
   Apart from those who feel strongly one way or the other about
Clinton, there appears to be a substantial portion of the American
public that has simply overdosed on the rich media diet of Clinton
fare.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is this phenomenon out there, Clinton fatigue, that
makes it hard for Clinton to go out there and help Gore,'' said Dan
Thomas, professor of political science at Warburg College in
Waverly, Iowa. ``It could amount to the kiss of death.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL ADD FOLLOWS
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One group that is anything but fatigued, however, consists of
the long-term Democratic Party stalwarts who recall with a shudder
the party's pre-Clinton malaise. They credit the president, despite
his faults, for having reinvented and reinvigorated the entire
party.
</P>
<P>
   These backers turn out en masse at fund-raisers and rallies,
where Clinton invariably receives a rock star's reception. He
remains able to electrify a crowd like no other politician of his
generation. To the extent that's useful to Gore, Clinton is
prepared to do it.
</P>
<P>
   ``If going out and raising money is helpful he's going to do
that. If going and making appearances is helpful he's going to do
that,'' said Lockhart. ``If staying here and concentrating on
getting things done is helpful he's going to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   As a backdrop for appearing presidential, it's hard to beat the
White House.
</P>
<P>
   West said he would expect to see Clinton do everything possible
in the months ahead to portray Gore as a co-partner in the
administration's achievements.
</P>
<P>
   ``You do it by sharing credit, making sure the vice president
gets a lot of press, giving him positive announcements to make and
sending him to foreign funerals, where he can look presidential and
meet with foreign leaders,'' said West.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, Clinton and Gore will both face the limits on what
one man can do for another. Public perceptions aren't always easily
swayed and no amount of praise from a figure of boundless charisma
can create the same persona in another.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's hurting Gore currently,'' said Newport, ``is Gore.''

   EL AGUACATE, Honduras _ A few cattle munched idly on scraggly
clumps of grass poking through the hard packed dirt and gravel of
what was once Honduras' longest and busiest military airstrip.
</P>
<P>
   Now, only mosquitoes and butterflies hover over the runway, but
in the 1980s cargo planes constantly swooped into this valley with
supplies for the U.S.-backed Contra rebels fighting Nicaragua's
government just over the mountains to the south. The airstrip was
also used by the Honduran army, which itself had waged a quiet and
deadly war against political enemies.
</P>
<P>
   Remnants of that era lie hidden in a thicket of thorny bushes
several hundred feet along a winding path off the runway: a cramped
and roofless red brick building and two soggy plots where the earth
has sunk three feet. About half a mile away, a hillside field was
deserted except for a concrete cross stuck into the dirt. All were
encircled with yellow crime scene tape.
</P>
<P>
   The debate over El Aguacate's Cold War history has been revived
in recent weeks as Honduran officials started investigating
assertions that those sites are home to torture chambers and
clandestine graves. Their questions about the base's past are
entangled in a conflict over its future: The assertions were made
in August by farmers who have taken the military to court to regain
land they said was taken from them for a pittance to build the
3,000-acre base.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Former Contras have said that the cells were used to punish
their own and that the graves hold only the bodies of comrades who
died in battle or at the base hospital. A few bones and traces of
human blood have been discovered, although the special prosecutor
for human rights said he wanted to interview more of the area's
residents and people who worked at the base before starting any
large-scale exhumations.
</P>
<P>
   Further delaying that prospect is a judge's request that the
area be swept for mines, a process that has yet to begin.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Human rights advocates still hope the investigation will unearth
clues to the fate of 184 Honduran political prisoners who
disappeared during the 1980s. Among the missing are the Rev. James
F. Carney, a priest from St. Louis who was chaplain to a small
Honduran revolutionary group routed by Honduran Special Forces in
1983, and David Arturo Baez Cruz, a former Green Beret who was the
group's military adviser. Their remains have never been found.
</P>
<P>
   The sites are unguarded, and that increases the worries of human
rights advocates that evidence _ and the culprits _ could vanish.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a dirty history of a dirty war, and some people do not
want it to get out,'' said Leo Valladares, the National
Commissioner for Human Rights. ``But the issue of human rights
violations will only end by discovering the truth. With the truth
you can have justice and with justice, reconciliation. But how can
you forgive if you don't know what you are forgiving or whom you
are forgiving?''
</P>
<P>
   Valladares is affable and energetic, traits that have been put
to the test in his efforts to uncover that history. The U.S.
government has given him reams of declassified documents about
intelligence activity in Honduras in the 1980s. Among them are
reports that the CIA failed to inform Congress about human rights
abuses, including the execution of members of the revolutionary
group to which Carney and Baez belonged.
</P>
<P>
   Conflicting reports about the priest's death were noted in the
documents: one said he died of starvation in the jungle, while
another said he had been executed. Valladares' quest for answers is
hampered by the fact that large parts of the documents have been
blacked out, including the names of those who executed other
members of Carney's group.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for the U.S. Embassy in Tegucigalpa said
Valladares had received all the documents pertaining to his
inquiries.
</P>
<P>
   Valladares has contacted U.S. authorities in an effort to learn
the identity of the people whose names were blacked out. He is
being helped by the National Security Archive, a Washington
organization that specializes in the collection and analysis of
declassified government documents.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the case of Honduras, it's more or less 4,000 pages,'' said
Susan Peacock, a research fellow at the archive. ``In comparison,
we have 30 boxes about Guatemala. We have less information for
Honduras, but the presence of North American military advisers and
the CIA was equal or more here.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   These days, El Aguacate feels more like a ghost town than it
does a spook headquarters. However, conflict is still being played
out in hearing rooms and cornfields.
</P>
<P>
   For years, the farmers who worked its soil watched helplessly as
their land was overrun with military advisers and Contra soldiers.
They were warned not to enter, and they were ultimately compensated
with about $600,000. But they soon found out that that was not
nearly enough to buy new land, and many wound up having to rent
homes and fields, or immigrate illegally to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``The armed forces are supposed to protect the people, but not
here,'' said Carlos Antonio Rodriguez, the vice president of the
local farmers' association. ``They protected the foreigners and
dislodged the natives, which we saw as absurd.''
</P>
<P>
   As he tells it, the absurdities were just beginning. After the
Contra force left the area in 1989, the Honduran military tried its
hand at farming, part of an effort to train soldiers in
agriculture. When the effort failed, Rodriguez said, the military
began to rent the fields to civilian growers.
</P>
<P>
   That's when he and the other displaced farmers filed a complaint
with the National Agricultural Institute, which has ruled in their
favor three times. The Honduran military has appealed the case to
the Supreme Court, which is expected to rule soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not fair,'' said Col. Romeo Vasquez Velasquez, a
military spokesman. ``If you sell something, how can you take it
back?'' He said he had no knowledge of the military's renting out
the fields, adding that keeping the site as a military base would
better serve the national interest.

BRADLEY OFFERS SOMETHING FOR THE BABY BOOMER VOTE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PETERBOROUGH, N.H. _ Bill Bradley proposed a mix of major and
modest programs Thursday aimed at work-stressed baby boomer
parents, promising billions of federal dollars for everything from
child care to community colleges.
</P>
<P>
   But the Democratic presidential candidate, who has castigated
his opponent Al Gore for making only incremental proposals, matched
one of the vice president's initiatives, a plan to expand the
Family and Medical Leave Act for non-emergency purposes such as
parent-teacher meetings. Gore spoke about that idea as recently as
this week.
</P>
<P>
   Building upon last week's launch of a $65 billion-a-year health
care plan, Bradley Thursday expanded his promise of federal help to
families. The former New Jersey senator proposed a $2 billion
annual child-care subsidy to the states, a $1.2 billion stipend for
senior citizen volunteers, and a $400 million annual investment in
community colleges. Bradley said the money for the plans would come
from the budget surplus.
</P>
<P>
   ``The virtuous circle for national prosperity can be a vicious
circle for parents,'' Bradley said in an address to a packed
gymnasium at Contoocook Valley High School, nestled amid a mountain
setting made famous in the Thornton Wilder play, ``Our Town.''
</P>
<P>
   While Bradley's aides provided many details about what they
considered to be the impact of Bradley's programs, the overarching
message was that Bradley was trying to form a bond with harried
parents, an update of President Clinton's comment ``I feel your
pain.'' Bradley said he empathized with families that not only are
trying to make ends meet, but also trying to make enough time in
the day for a fulfilling life.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are economically healthy, but are we socially healthy?''
Bradley asked. ``Are we spiritually healthy?''
</P>
<P>
   Recalling how he used to have dinner with his parents at a set
time when he was growing up in Crystal City, Mo., Bradley bemoaned
that ``the new global economy doesn't care about the 6:30 dinner
hour.''
</P>
<P>
   The design of the Bradley's programs said as much about the
candidate as the dollar amounts attached to them. For example,
instead of proposing an increase in the popular child-care tax
credit, Bradley suggested that $2 billion a year should be given to
states, which would work with local businesses to decide how to use
the money. The states would have to meet certain standards to
improve the quality of child care.
</P>
<P>
   A Bradley aide estimated that the federal government already
provides nearly $10 billion per year for the Head Start preschool
program, low-income subsidies, and the tax credit. But Bradley said
that is not enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``The plain truth is that child care isn't very good in
America,'' Bradley said. ``It's child care, yeah, but do they care
for your child? We're not always so sure.'' He said the current
``hodge podge'' of child care should be converted to a
federal-state partnership that would monitor quality standards.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley has blasted Gore for proposing only incremental
improvements, but Bradley's other programs seemed more modest.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Bradley proposed an expansion of the Family and
Medical Leave Act. Bradley said the law, which gives parents unpaid
medical leave, should be expanded to cover more than 10 million
employees of companies with 25 or more employees, up from the
current coverage of companies with 50 or more workers. Bradley also
suggested that parents be allowed to take 24 hours of leave for
non-emergency purposes, such as a teacher-parent meeting, similar
to an idea proposed by the Clinton-Gore administration.
</P>
<P>
   Gore spokesman Chris Lehane said, ``Bill Bradley says his
campaign is about big ideas, but what he's failed to tell people is
that his big ideas are Al Gore's ideas.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's proposal for a ``Senior Corps'' of volunteers sounded
similar to the Clinton administration's AmeriCorps and the
longstanding VISTA program. Bradley said senior citizens would be
given a tax-free stipend of up to $200 per month to enable them
teach young people are in afternoon care centers. Bradley said the
program initially would cost $200 million a year and eventually
cost $1.2 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Another program, grandly called ``Lifelong Learning
Communities,'' would provide $400 million a year to community
colleges in partnership with local businesses, which would agree to
provide jobs to qualified graduates.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. T. Berry Brazelton, one of the nation's best-known advocates
for better child care, was among those listed by the Bradley
campaign as supporting the programs announced Thursday. Reached by
telephone, the Harvard Medical School professor emeritus said he
``loved'' what Bradley was proposing for children's health, but
that he wasn't endorsing any candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to play both sides,'' Brazelton said, adding that he
visited Tennessee with Al and Tipper Gore. He said he was waiting
to learn more details about the Gore plan before comparing the two
candidates on child health.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley travels to Iowa Friday, and is to unveil a $1.32 billion
farm package that would provide cash payments to farmers when
commodities prices drop, the Associated Press reported. The package
also calls for sharply increasing the number of environmentally
fragile acres taken out of production, increases in farm research
programs, and a ``rigorous review'' of concentration of ownership
in the meat industry.

 EL AGUACATE, Honduras: national interest.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Yet, eager to take advantage of the planting season and
emboldened by their previous victories, the farmers' group started
to fence in and cultivate the land on the base last May. A few
weeks later, they encountered troops conducting military exercises
on their fields.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were great explosions, machine guns, big guns,''
Rodriguez said. ``Some commandos came to us with rifles in hand and
stopped our machines. They took down all the fence posts.''
</P>
<P>
   Within weeks, the farmers were taking reporters to the base to
show them how the military was responding. By August, the farmers
began talking about the graves and cells that were on the base,
prompting an investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people are fed with basic grains, not guns and
munitions,'' Rodriguez said. ``We can no longer justify any more
aggression and marginalization by the army.''
</P>
<P>
   The conflict has resulted in claims of death threats, as well as
accusations that one Honduran officer shot 87 cattle dead. It has
worried human rights advocates, who say the region is saturated
with AK-47 assault rifles left behind by the Contra army. They hope
the court ruling, as well as the investigations into just what lies
dormant in El Aguacate's earth, will end a sad and violent part of
their recent history.
</P>
<P>
   The farmers hope so, too, saying they want El Aguacate to become
a place that sustains life once again.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want our land back,'' Rodriguez said. ``Then we can become
productive again. Then the soldiers of Aguacate can leave this land
and go to the border where the country needs their force. Or back
to their barracks.''  &QL;

 &HT;    Atlanta among top Net-connected cities
 &HT;    By Ernest Holsendolph
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Atlanta ranks fifth among the nation's most
Internet-accessible cities, which makes it well-positioned to grow
economically in the coming years, according to a study by geography
specialists at Ohio State University.
</P>
<P>
   The other top five cities, in order, are Washington, D.C.,
Chicago, Dallas and New York. The rest of the top 10 are San Jose,
Calif., Los Angeles, Houston, San Francisco and Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers measured ``accessibility'' by the number of Internet
connections to and from each city through 31 major commercial Net
backbones.
</P>
<P>
   Morton O'Kelly, co-author and professor of geography at OSU,
said the premise of the study was that high-ranking cities in the
survey have some advantages in the global marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   ``In general, cities with more linkages to the Internet backbone
will have faster access and more reliable connections to global
information,'' O'Kelly said. ``This enhanced access results in a
comparative advantage that will grow in importance with the
continuing global computerization of information.''
</P>
<P>
   The important Internet backbones mostly include giants like
AT&AMP;T, Sprint and others, as well as Internet service providers such
as MindSpring. These are all considered ``on-ramps'' to the big
Internet highways, O'Kelly said. Cities with the most connections
were rated as the most accessible.
</P>
<P>
   The combined domestic network contains 31 backbones encompassing
141 cities and 848 linkages, according to the study.
</P>
<P>
   The cities with the major advantages in terms of Internet
accessibility include the four major national access points, he
said, namely San Francisco, Chicago, New York and Washington. Think
of these as the main entrances and exits to the Internet in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is interesting about Atlanta is that it ranks high even
though it is not an NAP,'' O'Kelly said. ``We found that what makes
Atlanta rank high is the volume of activity you see there as a kind
of communications crossroad, much like the highway and air traffic
grid for which the city is known.''
</P>
<P>
   The Internet access picture changes constantly, O'Kelly said,
but to some extent strength begets strength.
</P>
<P>
   ``You find a peer influence where big communications companies
attract others,'' he said. ``And the presence of multiple sources
creates redundancy and reliability that is valued by customers, and
that value creates growth.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Kelly emphasized that the study essentially is a snapshot of
1997 information, so the conclusions are subject to aging and
change.
</P>
<P>
   ``Engineers are constantly looking at this kind of information,
spotting holes and areas of weakness, and then setting about to
construct more capacity,'' O'Kelly said.
</P>
<P>
   He said that because policy-makers are gradually beginning to
appreciate the economic advantages of quality Internet access, they
are working to stimulate growth in the infrastructure across the
country and around the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``In our future work, we are taking a look at cities around the
world to assess Internet accessibility and measure their economic
responses to the advantages that many American cities enjoy,'' said
O'Kelly.
</P>
<P>
   In the Ohio State study, published in the current issue of the
journal Professional Geographer, the analysts found that cities in
the West were more Internet-accessible than cities in other
regions.
</P>
<P>
   Particularly strong, of course, were Silicon Valley and Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``The results are not unexpected, given the growth of computer
technology and investment in the Internet in California over the
past decade,'' O'Kelly said.
</P>
<P>
   Many major centers adjoined other strong centers, he said, such
as Washington, which was bolstered by Virginia and Maryland suburbs
with strong Internet accessibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``Atlanta was unique as a city somewhat isolated in the region
but still a focus of Internet activity,'' he said.

<P>
   STOCKHOLM, Sweden _ At a time when world leaders are fascinated
by the United States' economic success and its credo of less
government and low taxes, Sweden seems to be defying gravity.
</P>
<P>
   This is still, after all, a country where government consumes
nearly 60 percent of the national economy, far above the 32 percent
share in the United States. Taxes and wages are among the highest
in the world. Dismissing a sluggish worker is, in nearly all cases,
legally impossible.
</P>
<P>
   And Swedes are proud of it. When Prime Minister Goran Persson
introduced his budget plans nearly a month ago, he promised that
``Sweden will consolidate its position as a leading welfare
nation.'' He even pledged to create another entitlement: The right
of every person who turns 65 to retain a personal assistant.
</P>
<P>
   Yet this largely unreconstructed welfare state is one of
Europe's most vibrant economies. And after nearly three decades of
sluggishness in which the output per person slumped from the
third-highest in the world to 18th, just behind Italy, the Swedish
economy is in the midst of a powerful transformation.
</P>
<P>
   Sweden's recent boom is in part due to a cyclical recovery from
back-to-back recessions. But it also reflects a wider pattern in
Europe and a particularly nuanced reaction to the robust U.S.
economy of the 1990s. For even as Sweden, like many countries in
Western Europe, is continuing to preserve traditional European
social programs, the nation also has been embracing
entrepreneurship and unrestricted competition.
</P>
<P>
   While the Swedish government continues to finance health care,
education and scores of social services, it has deregulated
industries from telecommunications and energy to airlines and
banking.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, new companies and high technology have flourished.
Indeed, much of the growth here is coming from companies that did
not exist 10 years ago. Information technology and service
companies have eclipsed traditional manufacturers as the main
source of new jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is mostly a cyclical upswing, but it is more than that,''
said Anne Wibble, chief economist at the Swedish Federation of
Industry. ``It is also a breakthrough of the private service sector
_ the new networked economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Annual growth here is running at 3.6 percent, far faster than
Europe as a whole and close to the recent growth rate in the United
States. Foreign corporations from Ford to Microsoft are pumping
billions of dollars into the country. The government, which was
drowning in debt five years ago, now has a huge budget surplus.
</P>
<P>
   Unemployment has declined to 6.1 percent from 8.2 percent in
1993. Indeed, the Stockholm area now has shortages of computer
specialists, sales representatives, schoolteachers, even caterers.
</P>
<P>
   Sweden is not the only country to challenge some central tenets
of the current American-British model. France, where the Socialist
Cabinet has mandated that the official workweek will fall to 35
hours, is growing by nearly 3 percent and its double-digit jobless
rate is coming down. Finland has high personal taxes and rigid job
rules, yet it has become a world leader in the mobile phone
industry. The Netherlands still has generous welfare programs, but
offers the industrialist or entrepreneur low corporate taxes and
flexible labor rules.
</P>
<P>
   For all the talk of ``Euro-sclerosis,'' Europe is a continent
today of budget cutting, negligible inflation and, most important,
increasingly brutal market competition.
</P>
<P>
   Sweden's boom is arguably the most unusual. Besides clinging to
a cradle-to-grave system of security, Sweden was one of just a few
countries refusing to join with 11 European nations in adopting the
euro as a common currency.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Sweden is growing faster than most of its euro zone
neighbors. Germany, which accounts for one-third of the euro zone's
total economy, is expected to grow less than 2 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, no one here is talking yet about a new ``Swedish
model'' for growth. But a few years ago, it was a textbook
illustration of how good intentions could lead to disastrous
results.
</P>
<P>
   In 1970, Sweden's economic output per person was the third
highest in the world, behind only Switzerland and the United
States. With its wealth and a culture of high-minded homogeneity,
Sweden built up one of the world's legendary welfare states. But as
the public sector ballooned, swelling from one-third to more than
half the economy, business and productivity lagged behind the world
as a whole. Unsurprisingly, job creation stagnated. And today,
despite the recent upswing, Sweden still employs slightly fewer
people than it did in 1970.
</P>
<P>
   So what lies behind the current rebound? One major change is
that Swedish political leaders have finally put the government's
budget in order. After running up staggering budget deficits in the
mid-1990s, the Social Democratic government, while rejecting most
demands to trim the welfare state, raised personal taxes and
imposed tough spending limits.
</P>
<P>
   The measures were painful, but they steadily reduced the deficit
and gave corporations some room to breathe.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But that was only part of the story. Like Finland and Britain,
Sweden moved much faster than most other European countries to
deregulate its markets and foster a more entrepreneurial culture.
It opened its telephone and electricity markets to competition in
the mid-1990s. It also jumped into the vanguard of mobile
telephones, as LM Ericsson emerged as one the world's biggest
producers of wireless phones and networking equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning in 1993, the country also loosened up its job rules.
Though full-time employees are still protected from layoffs, the
government allowed companies to hire temporary workers who could be
let go at will.
</P>
<P>
   The result has been a torrid expansion of temporary-service
companies. Manpower Inc., one of the world's biggest temporary
companies, now employs 6,000 workers in Sweden. Poolia A.B., a
temporary agency in Stockholm, has more than 1,700 workers and has
nearly doubled its force of ``consultants'' in the last year alone.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps the biggest change has been the rise of new
companies, many sprouting from Ericsson's roots in the
telecommunications industry and many others emerging from
Scandinavia's infatuation with the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   According to a recent study by the Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development, Sweden invested a higher proportion of
its gross domestic product in ``knowledge'' _ research,
development, training and education _ than any other country in the
world.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the expansion of Kiska Science Park, an industrial park
started by Ericsson and IBM in the early 1970s. Located on a former
waste site, Kiska is now a sprawling complex with 600 technology
companies and 27,000 workers. It has also attracted two of Sweden's
important scientific institutes: the Royal Institute of Technology
and the Swedish Institute of Computer Science.
</P>
<P>
   Stockholm itself has become a breeding ground for Internet
companies. Johan Ihrfelt and a group of friends launched Spray.se
as an Internet consulting firm back in 1995. After raising about $3
million from private investors, including the huge Swedish holding
company Investor A.B., they launched an Internet portal and access
service.
</P>
<P>
   Based in a renovated brick warehouse here, Spray now employs
about 250 people across Europe and has 450,000 customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe Sweden is one of the most exciting markets after the
U.S., if you are looking for entrepreneurial growth,'' said
Ihrfelt, 32. ``Ten years ago, it was almost nonexistent here.''
</P>
<P>
   Spray is hardly alone. Boxman, based in Stockholm but now
operating largely from Britain, has become one of Europe's biggest
providers of music over the Internet. Boo.com, a Stockholm start-up
whose investors include Goldman Sachs, is gearing up to sell sports
clothing on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   There are a number of signs that this new generation of
companies _ and a new generation of entrepreneurs _ has changed
Sweden's basic chemistry. The most dramatic indication is that
Sweden kept growing this year even when its basic industries began
to sputter.
</P>
<P>
   Much like Germany, Sweden has traditionally relied on
manufactured exports for most of its growth. And much like Germany,
those exports were hurt badly after the Russian and Asian markets
plunged last year. Yet while the German economy came to a
standstill, Sweden's actually accelerated.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we were doing our projections exactly one year ago, we
were worried the country might even slip into a recession,''
recalled Bjorn Oras, chief executive of the Poolia temporary
agency. ``Instead, things kept right on surging.''
</P>
<P>
   Government forecasters were equally surprised. Worried that a
downturn would generate new budget problems, Persson rejected the
idea of tax cuts as recently as March. But now, with government
coffers overflowing, Persson is pushing modest tax cuts as well as
spending increases for health care, pensions, job training and
universities.
</P>
<P>
   ``In March and April, we didn't think unemployment would
decrease so much,'' said Bosse Ringholm, Sweden's minister of
finance. ``We have a new situation now.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Wibble, at the Swedish Federation of Industry, said the
explanation lay in the expansion of new service companies.
``Formerly, we saw a close correspondence between economic growth
and what was happening in the manufacturing industries,'' she said.
``Now what we see is that when industry slows down _ as it did
earlier this year _ the private service sector is still surging
ahead. That is something new.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of Sweden's biggest employers are still struggling.
Ericsson has lost a big chunk of the cell phone market to Nokia of
Finland, which is now the world's biggest maker of mobile phones.
SAS, the Scandinavian airline, is losing millions of dollars,
partly because of cut-rate competition from Finnair.
</P>
<P>
   At 6.1 percent, Sweden's jobless rate is about one-third the
average of the European Union. The numbers overstate the success
somewhat, because government job-creation and training programs
account for another 3.5 percent of the work force.
</P>
<P>
   Yet economists say virtually all of the increase in new jobs in
the last two years has come from business rather than government.
</P>
<P>
   That is apparent at Stockholm County's employment office. The
office's most recent analysis shows shortages in several dozen job
categories and acute shortages in many others, including car
mechanics, taxi drivers and nurses.
</P>
<P>
   ``The information technology branch is pulling all kinds of
other professions along with it _ economists, accountants and even
artists,'' said Per Lindberg, director of the office. ``It's
changing the whole structure of the labor market.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, many Swedes remain cautious about the future. Partly
because of its heavy social program, Sweden's economy often swings
from feast to famine.
</P>
<P>
   When the economy is strong, government revenue rises much faster
than expenses. But when conditions turn bad, the country is hit by
a double punch of added social costs and shrinking capital
investment.
</P>
<P>
   Arvid Bohn, an economist at the Swedish Federation of Industry,
has been through those big swings before. ``The thing you have to
remember about Sweden,'' he said, ``is that there is no such thing
as a soft landing here.''

BUSH CAMPAIGN TRYING TO DEFINE `COMPASSIONATE CONSERVATIVE' 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON with FRANK BRUNI    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For as long as Gov. George W. Bush of Texas has
been describing himself as a ``compassionate conservative,''
Republicans and Democrats alike have wondered whether the phrase
was a call for a flexible new ideology or an attempt to put a
friendlier face on an essentially unchanged philosophy.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's public statements, including his denunciation this week
of his party's focus on wealth, suggest a willingness to use his
commanding position in the Republican presidential race to
challenge some of the party's assumptions about what it stands for.
</P>
<P>
   But as he starts to set out specific positions, particularly on
high visibility issues like taxes and economic policy, Bush is by
no means abandoning the conservative principles that have defined
the party at least since the Reagan administration.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is clearly attempting a delicate balancing act, seeking to
retain the faith of the party's conservative base even as he courts
the moderate swing voters he would need to win the general
election.
</P>
<P>
   And beyond political positioning, Bush's fuzziness may also
reflect the early stage of the campaign, when candidates are still
formulating policy positions, as well as some debate within his
campaign about how far he should tilt in either direction.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's still a work in progress,'' said William A. Niskanen, an
economic adviser in the Reagan administration who is now chairman
of the Cato Institute, a conservative research organization in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   On the campaign trail and in meetings with his policy advisers,
Bush emphasizes a traditional conservative belief in the power of
free markets and is as enthusiastic as any Reagan-era supply-sider
in calling for tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   His economic advisers, many of whom served in the Reagan and
Bush administrations, are drawn from centers of orthodox
conservative thought like the Hoover Institution at Stanford
University and the American Enterprise Institute, a research
organization in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The basic thrust of his advisers remains reducing marginal tax
rates, a step that cuts tax bills proportionally more for the
wealthy, who pay the most taxes, than for middle- and lower-income
people. And they back specific tax cuts that Democrats have long
said are skewed to the rich, including the elimination of the
inheritance tax on large estates.
</P>
<P>
   Where Bush and his team seem to be taking a fresh approach is in
applying conservative orthodoxy in new ways.
</P>
<P>
   They point out, for example, that high marginal tax rates can be
more of a problem for a single mother working her way out of
poverty than for an investment banker.
</P>
<P>
   As workers move from income levels associated with the working
poor _ below $20,000 a year _ into middle-class income levels, they
often lose all or part of tax credits and breaks like the
earned-income tax credit, and enter higher-income tax brackets,
meaning that a big chunk of their additional earnings goes to
taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's advisers say the main policy idea behind ``compassionate
conservatism'' at this point is to help people in that kind of
situation, probably through an expansion of the earned-income tax
credit or through other changes to the tax code that would allow
low- to middle-income workers to take home more of what they earn.
</P>
<P>
   ``Governor Bush understands and very much believes that high
marginal tax rates create enormous disincentives,'' said Lawrence
B. Lindsey, a former Federal Reserve governor who heads the
candidate's economic policy team. ``What may be new here is the
realization, which he's talked about on the stump, that high
marginal rates affect not only high-income people but a lot of
low-income people as well.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Lindsey, Bush's economic team includes Michael
Boskin, who was chief economist in the Bush White House; John F.
Cogan, a former budget aide to President Reagan; Martin Feldstein,
a former Reagan administration chief economist; John B. Taylor, an
expert on monetary policy who worked on Bob Dole's 1996
presidential campaign, and R. Glenn Hubbard, who was a Treasury
Department official under President Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the team say they consider themselves technicians,
simply taking the goals laid out by Bush and finding ways of
translating them into workable policies. Yet there is concern among
other Republicans working with Bush that the campaign will be too
tentative in trying to redefine the party, and will in effect miss
an opportunity to broaden the party's appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Especially after the failure of the big Republican tax cut to
generate much public enthusiasm before it was vetoed by President
Clinton, they would like to see Bush support a tax plan that
clearly repositions the party toward the political center by
adopting some of the approaches supported by the Democrats,
including more tax breaks targeted to the middle class.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason why it is so important for Governor Bush's plan to
lean in the direction of those left behind,'' said one adviser to
Bush, speaking on the condition of anonymity, ``is because it's the
right policy and the right politics if we want to recapture the
idea of being the party of the middle class.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Outside of his economic team, Bush's most influential advisers
include a number of advocates of fresh approaches to domestic
policy, including Mayor Steve Goldsmith of Indianapolis; Mike
Gerson, the governor's speechwriter, and Marvin Olasky, a
conservative theoretician who advocates harnessing faith-based
programs and charities to address social ills.
</P>
<P>
   Last week Bush effectively shot down a proposal by Republicans
in the House to delay payments to the working poor under the
earned-income tax credit program, saying Congress should not
balance the budget ``on the backs of the poor.''
</P>
<P>
   And this week he said that Republicans had too often ``focused
on the national economy, to the exclusion of ll else,'' and that
the strongest argument for conservative ideals should be ``that
they lead to greater justice, less suffering, more opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush has angered some Republican members of Congress with his
criticism of how the party has conducted itself, and he has been
attacked by several of his rivals for the party's nomination,
including Steve Forbes and Gary Bauer, for being insufficiently
conservative on both economic and social policy.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there has not been any widespread uprising against him by
conservatives, in part because of his big lead in the polls. And
his advisers suggest that unlike his father, Bush seems to have a
Reaganesque ability to communicate a conservative agenda in a
nonthreatening way that defuses Democratic attempts to portray the
Republican party as mean-spirited.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has publicly said he is a supply-sider, and when he says
that he says it with a passion that gives conservatives in the
Republican party more comfort than they get from candidates who are
viewed as more conservative,'' said Rep. Rob Portman, a Republican
from Ohio who is working with the Bush campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the same time he's comfortable focusing on issues like
charitable giving,'' Portman said. ``Perhaps what he is showing us
is that because of the power of his personality or the strength of
his passion, he can break through and persuade people that these
are not inconsistent.''

COALITION LED HINDU NATIONALIST PARTY WINS INDIAN ELECTION 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By CELIA W. DUGGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW DELHI, India _ The verdict of some 360 million Indian voters
was announced Thursday: The Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata
Party, once seen as the ugly, anti-Muslim face of Hindu revivalism,
won a clear victory as the leader of a centrist coalition of 24
parties that appears likely to offer India its most durable
government in several years.
</P>
<P>
   And the Congress Party, the once dominant, now faded political
force that had desperately hoped to make a comeback under Sonia
Gandhi, torchbearer of the Nehru-Gandhi dynasty, was handed the
most humiliating defeat it has ever suffered since India gained its
independence from Britain in 1947.
</P>
<P>
   The BJP did not actually increase the number of seats it holds
in Parliament, but it made several smart new alliances with rising
state-level parties that produced the coalition's larger majority.
By late Thursday night, the BJP and its allies had won 294 seats,
well past the bare majority needed among the Parliament's 543
elected seats. And they were expected to pick up a couple more
seats by the time counting is completed on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   In exchange for its allies' support, the BJP has promised that
it will not pursue the agenda that has raised the hackles of
Muslims and secularists alike, which includes building a Hindu
temple on the site of a 16th century mosque in Ayodhya that Hindu
militants tore down with sledgehammers and crowbars in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   The previous incarnation of the Hindu nationalist-led coalition
had tottered along for 13 months until April, when a temperamental
former movie star, Jayalalitha Jayaram, yanked the 18 votes of her
regional party out from under it and caused the government to fall.
</P>
<P>
   This time, the alliance, which is expected to form a new
government next week, will have enough votes to survive even if a
couple of its more quixotic partners pull out.
</P>
<P>
   This extra measure of breathing room _ while not large _ may
give Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee, a grandfatherly looking
moderate in the Hindu nationalist party, the strength to tackle
some of the stickiest issues that face this nation of 1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Vajpayee, 72, has said he will try to bring India and Pakistan,
neighboring nuclear powers now almost completely estranged, back to
the bargaining table, as well as to improve the performance of the
economy in India, where 300 million people live in abject poverty.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Vajpayee himself is a complex, ambiguous figure. He has
professed great admiration for India's first prime minister, the
Congress Party leader and confirmed secularist, Jawaharlal Nehru.
And he has described the destruction of the mosque in Ayodhya _ an
act that many blamed on other leaders of his party _ as a blunder.
</P>
<P>
   But for more than three decades Vajpayee has also been a
stalwart of the Hindu nationalist party, and his kindly face and
mild temperament have made acceptable the rise of a party that, in
religously diverse India, has pursued the idea that Hinduism should
define the national ethos.
</P>
<P>
   It was also Vajpayee who decided last year that India should
break an almost 25-year-old moratorium and conduct underground
nuclear tests, a move that inspired Pakistan to respond in kind.
Earlier this year he went on a peacemaking trip to Pakistan, then
acted forcefully to battle Pakistan-supported forces that occupied
Indian territory in the disputed state of Jammu and Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
   Vajpayee himself made no public remarks Thursday. And the
Congress Party president's, Mrs. Gandhi, never stepped outside her
fortresslike compound. Instead, the spin cycle of Indian politics
played out in marathon sessions on state television and the private
Star TV network, as officials from the alphabet soup of political
parties gabbed endlessly.
</P>
<P>
   Congress Party leaders, some of whom had been claiming even
Wednesday that theirs would be the single largest party in
Parliament, worked hard to put the best face on their loss. They
pointed out that the party had won at least eight seats in India's
largest state, Uttar Pradesh, where they had been completely wiped
out in the last election, and had won decisively in the states of
Karnataka and Punjab.
</P>
<P>
   But nothing could disguise the dismal national tally. The
Congress Party, which had been disappointed last year when it won
only 140 seats in Parliament, had claimed only 109 by late Thursday
night, with the expectation that it would pick up a few more once
counting was done.
</P>
<P>
   The Congress Party headquarters here wore a deserted look
Thursday. And party officials privately admitted that they had
taken a terrible drubbing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've come back with our tail between our legs,'' said one
official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. ``It's a shameful
defeat, the worst performance in Congress' history.''
</P>
<P>
   The Italian-born, politically inexperienced Mrs. Gandhi, whose
mother-in-law and husband both served as prime minister and were
both assassinated, had traveled the nation, but the party's
decrepit to nonexistent grass-roots organization in key north
Indian states was unable to translate popular enthusiasm into
victories.
</P>
<P>
   In her speeches, Mrs. Gandhi warned that the Bharatiya Janata
Party was a threat to secular harmony, but Vajpayee's genial style
and his party's promise to renounce religiously divisive issues
took the zing out of her words.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Mrs. Gandhi's intense shyness and the security
cordon that surrounded her _ she usually swooped down in a
helicopter to give her speech, and swooped away just as quickly _
kept her from developing the kind of organic rapport with people
that her mother-in-law, Indira, was famous for.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday was typical. Rather than come out and face the public,
Mrs. Gandhi issued a stilted statement that acknowledged the
disappointing outcome. ``The result calls for introspection, frank
assessment and determined action,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Arun Jaitley, a spokesman for the Bharatiya Janata Party, said
the Congress Party's defeat proved what the Hindu nationalist
leaders had been saying about Mrs. Gandhi all through the campaign:
``The people don't want a foreigner as prime minister.''
</P>
<P>
   But Mrs. Gandhi's foreign origins _ she became an Indian citizen
in 1983 _ were not a decisive factor in either of the
constituencies where she sought, and won, election to Parliament.
(She will have to give up one of the seats.)
</P>
<P>
   ``That issue did not cut much ice,'' said Ambika Soni, a
Congress Party official who is close to Mrs. Gandhi.
</P>
<P>
   It was not Mrs. Gandhi's foreign birth, but the Congress Party's
inability to make strong alliances with regional political leaders,
combined with its own poor performance, that led to defeat. Mrs.
Gandhi's argument that only Congress could provide the stability
India needed simply no longer washed.
</P>
<P>
   The Bharatiya Janata Party trumpeted its success in ridding
Indian territory of Pakistan-backed forces, and that military
victory does seem to have lifted Vajpayee's popularity ratings. But
most voters were motivated by issues closer to home, often at the
state level.
</P>
<P>
   The alliances the Congress made with regional parties were
particularly ill-fated. It hooked up with two of India's most
entertaining, headstrong _ and many say corrupt _ politicians. Both
of them did badly. The party headed by Ms. Jayaram, the diva from
the southern state of Tamil Nadu, won a little more than half as
many seats as it had last time.
</P>
<P>
   And Laloo Prasad Yadav, the rustic politician from the cowherds
caste who made a career of poking his finger in the eye of the
upper castes, lost his own seat in Parliament and saw his party's
tally shrink by more than half.
</P>
<P>
   The Congress Party also paid dearly for the decision of Sharad
Pawar, a powerful leader in the large state of Maharashtra, to
leave the party over the issue of Mrs. Gandhi's foreign origins and
to start his own party. The Congress Party's tally in the state
declined sharply this time.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, the Bharatiya Janata Party made several successful
new alliances this year, most spectacularly with Chandrababu Naidu,
chief minister of the southern state of Andhra Pradesh and leader
of the regional Telugu Desam Party.
</P>
<P>
   Naidu, an aggressive economic reformer, won a big victory. He
and the BJP together dramatically increased their state tally. The
BJP also allied with the rivals of Ms. Jayaram in Tamil Nadu and of
Yadav in Bihar, and picked up a lot of seats in those states, as
well.
</P>
<P>
   Undoubtedly, the Hindu nationalists will have to share a
substantial amount of patronage and power with their regional
allies, and they will have to heed the sometimes unruly, insistent
demands of their partners for a say in how the country is governed.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it seems likely that this stronger alliance will manage
to survive, if not for its full five-year term, at least for a
longer spell than last time.
</P>
<P>
   In Chandni Chowk, the teeming bazaar in Delhi that dates to
Mughal times, people said they hoped for a period of stable
government, but were skeptical after three elections in the last
three years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Will the coalition be united or will the partners pull the
legs off the chair?'' asked Rakesh Gupta, a cloth merchant who wore
a cell phone dangling from his belt.
</P>
<P>
   Parmanand Arora, a rickshaw driver, said he was looking to the
stars to give India political continuity. ``Even yesterday,'' he
said, ``I read in the newspaper that the astrologers said this
government will continue for five years.''

 &HT;    Trump considers run for presidency with Reform Party backing
 &HT;    By Chris Burritt
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ New York tycoon Donald Trump announced Thursday that
he has formed an exploratory committee to help him decide whether
to seek the Reform Party presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   If he decides to go for it, he knows who he wants as a running
mate: Oprah Winfrey.
</P>
<P>
   The move by the brash real estate developer is the boldest yet
by an improbable cast _ including former professional wrestler and
Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura, conservative Republican Pat Buchanan,
actor Warren Beatty and actress Cybill Shepherd _ who are said to
be considering making a bid for the Reform Party nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is like going to the circus,'' University of Virginia
political scientist Larry Sabato said.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Tolchin, a public policy professor at George Mason
University, said she sees political value in what promises to be a
dogfight for the 2000 Reform Party presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ''I do not think any of them can win (the presidency), but they
can be an awful nuisance and raise issues that might not otherwise
be talked about,'' said Tolchin, author of ``The Angry American:
How Voter Rage is Changing the Nation.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I think people are taking them seriously,'' she said. ''They
are entertainers, a very important part of society today.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet while potential celebrity candidates promise to pump
excitement into the presidential race, it also threatens greater
instability for the Reform Party.
</P>
<P>
   Since Reform Party founder and Texas billionaire Ross Perot won
19 percent of the 1992 presidential vote, the party's sharp focus
on tax reform, balancing the federal budget and other economic
issues has wavered.
</P>
<P>
   The potential candidates for the Reform Party's 2000 nomination
are talking about potentially divisive social issues, including
health care reform and abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   Trump, a registered Republican who describes himself as socially
liberal, supports abortion rights. Buchanan, expected later this
month to jump from the Republican Party to seek the Reform Party
nomination, opposes abortion.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not a bad thing to shake up a campaign, but it is
probably not a good idea to throw a stick of dynamite,'' Sabato
said. ''Trump will shake it up; Buchanan is the stick of
dynamite.''
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Reform Party Chairman Anne Merkl said some in the party
worry how Buchanan's conservative social views may disrupt the
party's ''socially moderate'' posture.
</P>
<P>
   ''We need to reach common ground'' among conflicting views, said
Merkl, who serves on the Reform Party's national executive
committee.
</P>
<P>
   Trump was scheduled to meet Thursday night with Ventura, the
Reform Party's leading elected official who recently came under
fire for remarks about religion and other controversial topics in a
Playboy interview.
</P>
<P>
   Ventura is trying to find a candidate he can back for the Reform
Party's nomination _ though some think he could run himself.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan has the backing of another wing of the party, a loose
alliance with ties to Perot. A Republican presidential candidate in
1996, Buchanan met this week with Russell Verney, Perot's top
adviser and the Reform Party's chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Former Connecticut Gov. Lowell Weicker has indicated he is
interested in seeking the nomination of a splinter group, the
American Reform Party.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am sure we are going to be called the circus party,'' Merkl
said. ''But I think what people are going to have to do is sit back
and see what the candidates' views are.''
</P>
<P>
   Trump said he plans to decide by January or February whether to
seek the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   During an interview Thursday taped for broadcast on CNN's
``Larry King Live,'' Trump said Winfrey, the talk-show host, would
be his first choice for running mate. The two have not spoken about
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``If she'd do it, she'd be fantastic,'' Trump said. ``I mean,
she's popular, she's brilliant, she's a wonderful woman.''
</P>
<P>
   In the fashion of a high-profile risk taker whose business and
martial successes and failures have grabbed national attention,
Trump is cocky in assessing his political chances.
</P>
<P>
   ''The only thing that could interest me is if I could win,'' he
said. ``I'm not talking about the nomination, I'm talking about the
whole megillah.''

 By RICHARD SALTUS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ You wondered, ``What was he thinking?'' when Mathew
Huggins, 16, tapped on his wheelchair-mounted computer and his
voice synthesizer spoke: ``Can I have your autograph?''
</P>
<P>
   For the celebrity he addressed was physicist Stephen Hawking,
who lies twisted and nearly immobile in his electric wheelchair
while his towering intellect probes the universe. With his barely
controllable hands, writing is not even an issue.
</P>
<P>
   But little fazes the unstoppable Hawking, 57, who visited
Children's Hospital for a couple of hours Thursday to learn about
the latest in communications aids, and to do a little role-modeling
as well. Within minutes after Mathew's request, one of Hawking's
several assistants was handing out ``autographs'' _ cards bearing
photos of Hawking and his thumbprint _ to Mathew and other kids.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are impressed and moved and encouraged by (Hawking's)
achievements,'' said Mathew's mother, Katherine. So were the
parents of a half-dozen other children with impaired communications
who met with Hawking, in their wheelchairs and using a variety of
devices, both high-tech and low, to converse.
</P>
<P>
   Hawking, a professor of physics and mathematics at Cambridge
University in England, has gained immense celebrity, written a
best-selling book, fathered three children, and done a huge amount
for the public image of disability.
</P>
<P>
   While at Children's Thursday, he toured the hospital's
Communication Enhancement Center. He was shown around by Howard
Shane, the director of the center, which evaluates assistive
technologies and helps children and adults find the most useful
devices to compensate for limited speech or writing because of
autism, cerebral palsy, language disorders, spinal cord injuries or
neuromuscular diseases.
</P>
<P>
   Computer technology has made it possible for even severely
disabled people to use some small movement _ a finger, a head
movement, even an eyeblink _ to select words or letters on a screen
to activate a speech synthesizer or log onto the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can find some movement a person can control to use the
computer, then we're on our way,'' said Shane.
</P>
<P>
   Shane also said that in recent years, people who are diagnosed
with a degenerative disease that will ultimately silence them have
been recording their normal speech and putting the recordings into
a ``voice bank.'' This sampling of their healthy voice will make it
easier to synthesize natural-sounding speech.
</P>
<P>
   At one point during the tour, Hawking asked for coffee. ``He's
feeling a little sluggish,'' said his wife, Elaine. Various
hospital staffers and members of his entourage scurried around to
procure it (black), get it to the right temperature and help him
drink it.
</P>
<P>
   About that time, Shane pointed to a framed motto he thought
particularly relevant to Hawking. ``You don't need dexterity to
manipulate concepts,'' it read: the physicist typed for a few
moments and his synthesizer quipped, with perfect timing, ``Just
coffee.''
</P>
<P>
   Hawking developed Lou Gehrig's disease, or amyotrophic lateral
sclerosis (ALS), in his college years. He's been unable to speak
since undergoing a tracheostomy in 1985, but he has far outlived
the normal life expectancy of the disease, and he spends several
months of each year traveling and giving lectures and keeping up
with his work _ he publishes about 20 papers a year _ with the aid
of his speech synthesizer and a number of assistants.
</P>
<P>
   About 200 doctors, nurses, Children's employees and passersby
gathered around Hawking as he answered questions and gave a
kid-oriented mini-lecture on his specialties _ cosmology, the
theory of black holes, and the fate of the universe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gravity keeps the earth in its orbit,'' said Hawking through
his speech synthesizer. ``Otherwise it would wander off into
interstellar space, and things would get really, really cold.'' The
talk was pre-written and stored in Hawking's voice computer.
Answering a spontaneous question, however, meant a four- or
five-minute pause while the physicist scrolled through lists of
letters, words and phrases on a screen in front of him, selecting
them with a click of a switch held in his right hand, and
assembling them into a reply.
</P>
<P>
   Hawking was to speak Thursday night at the Wang Center, and has
been in Boston for several weeks exchanging ideas with faculty and
students in Harvard's physics department.
</P>
<P>
   Before leaving Children's, Hawking switched from lecturer to
student. He received a personal briefing from Dr. Evan Snyder, a
researcher at Children's who believes that primordial ``stem
cells'' in the brain and nervous system can potentially be coaxed
into becoming nerve cells that could help people with diseases like
Hawking's to regain function.
</P>
<P>
   These primordial stem cells, said Snyder, choosing an analogy
that would appeal to Hawking, ``are the cells in which the Big Bang
in the brain took place.''

CLINTON SAYS SENATE HAS `MORAL RESPONSIBILITY' TO RATIFY NUCLEAR
TEST BAN TREATY  

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By GREG McDONALD 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton said Thursday that the Senate has
``a moral responsibility'' to ratify the nuclear test ban treaty as
he broadened his appeal to lawmakers to take more time to study the
issue before putting it to a scheduled vote Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Several Republican senators also deserted their leadership to
join with Clinton in urging that the Senate postpone consideration
of the controversial treaty even as lawmakers prepared to begin
debate on it Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, fearing certain defeat if the vote takes place next
week, called on the Senate to hold hearings to allow testimony from
religious leaders and nuclear experts who support the treaty.
</P>
<P>
   ``We ought to have a regular, orderly, substantive process that
gives all the people the necessary time to consider this on the
merit,'' Clinton said before leaving Washington on a three-day
Democratic Party fund-raising trip.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton called the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty a vital tool
``to strengthen our security'' and suggested that lawmakers have
``a moral responsibility'' to support its ratification. Passage of
the treaty requires two-thirds support of the Senate, or 67 votes.
But enough Republicans are standing together against it for now to
ensure its defeat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Future generations won't forgive us if we fail that
responsibility,'' the president said in his appeal to lawmakers to
give the treaty a full airing before holding a vote on it.
</P>
<P>
   A handful of Republicans, led by Sens. James Jeffords of Vermont
and Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania, joined in Clinton's appeal,
urging their colleagues to stand with the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the Senate is not ready to vote,'' Specter said on the
Senate floor. He called the treaty ``a very complex issue'' that
most members on both sides of the aisle have not yet taken the time
to analyze, and he warned that its defeat would be both an
embarrassment and a danger for the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we were to reject it out of hand on what appears to be a
very partisan vote, it could be disastrous for our country,''
Specter said.
</P>
<P>
   Rejection of the treaty would mark the first time ever that
Congress chose to kill an arms control accord that was negotiated
to help curb the proliferation of nuclear weapons. Such a
precedent, Jeffords said, could wipe out all the work by present
and past administrations, and lead to a new arms race.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ratification of this treaty will improve our chances of
stopping the spread of nuclear weapons ... We owe it to our
children and grandchildren to add this important brick to the
foundation of international peace,'' said Jeffords.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffords brought together a group of religious leaders and
nuclear experts with Clinton at the White House to emphasize the
importance of the treaty.
</P>
<P>
   The test ban treaty, which would extend the present ban on
atmospheric testing of nuclear weapons to underground testing as
well, was negotiated and signed by 154 nations under U.S.
leadership some three years ago. Since then only 44 of the
participating countries have ratified it. But Jeffords said many of
the others are waiting on the U.S. Senate to ratify the accord
before giving final approval to it themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will take leadership to lock up the commitment. The world
is looking to the United States and ... to the United States Senate
to show that leadership,'' Jeffords said.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffords and Specter are among only a handful of Republicans
prepared to cross the aisle and vote with most Democrats in support
of treaty. Sen. Joseph Biden, D-Del., the ranking Democrat on the
Foreign Relations Committee, said he doubted that even with
Republican support Democrats will be able to muster the 67 votes
needed for passage.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they want to kill it, I guess they can do it,'' Biden said.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., surprised the
Democrats last week when he scheduled the treaty for a vote after
rejecting the administration's pleas for nearly two years to force
Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Jesse Helms, R-N.C., into
holding hearings on it.
</P>
<P>
   Helms opposes the treaty, as does many other Republicans,
including Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the leading GOP presidential
candidate, because of concerns that the ban on testing cannot be
enforced and wouldn't stop so-called rogue nations such as North
Korea and Iran from developing nuclear arsenals. They also worry
that it would interfere in U.S. efforts to maintain its own nuclear
edge in the world today.
</P>
<P>
   In testimony Thursday before the Senate Armed Service Committee,
Energy Secretary Bill Richardson rebuffed those claims, saying that
the treaty would not interfere with U.S. efforts to maintain and
improve the reliability of the nation's weapons system.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton told reporters Thursday that even though there is no
sure way to prevent some nations from cheating, the inspections
would be allowed to help verify that testing is not taking place.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Helms and other Republican opponents seem
determined to prevent any effort by the administration to postpone
a vote. Helms had asked Clinton to make his postponement request in
writing and to agree not to revive the issue until after the next
presidential race in return for a delay. But Clinton rejected that
idea.
</P>
<P>
   In his statement Thursday, Clinton cautioned Helms and other
lawmakers that it would be ``terrible mistake'' to play politics
with the test ban treaty.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is huge. This is bigger than party politics. This is
bigger than personal politics,'' Clinton said.

AG SAYS MOTORISTS FACE 0.7% INSURANCE HIKE IN 2000 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRUCE MOHL  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Attorney General Thomas F. Reilly announced Thursday
that the state's auto insurers have privately agreed to a 0.7
percent increase in rates for next year, catching the other parties
involved in the rate negotiations off-guard.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement, which would end up boosting the average annual
premium for Massachusetts's 3.6 million drivers by $6, to $886, was
called ``premature'' by an insurance industry spokesman, while one
company official said it was a blatant publicity grab. The
agreement also was attacked by consumer advocates, who were hoping
for a rate cut of several percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for state Insurance Commissioner Linda Ruthardt, who
officially sets the rates, said she would have no comment. ``She
doesn't have a reaction because there's nothing in-house to look
at,'' he said. ``Nothing's official until the commissioner signs
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Timothy Shea, chief of Reilly's public protection bureau, said
word of the settlement agreement was leaking out and he wanted to
make sure consumers had all the facts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think this is a good deal for consumers,'' he said. ``It's
the same increase as last year.''
</P>
<P>
   But consumer advocates, backed up by the State Rating Bureau's
recommendation last week that rates be cut 6.1 percent, urged
Insurance Commissioner Linda Ruthardt to reject the settlement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Auto rates usually come out around Christmas time, but if the
commissioner accepts this agreement it will be an early $20 million
Christmas present for the insurers,'' said Stephen D'Amato, a
Cambridge attorney and consumer advocate. His comments were echoed
by officials of the Massachusetts Public Interest Research Group.
</P>
<P>
   Insurance company officials declined comment Thursday, although
sources said the industry was divided on whether a settlement was
in its best interests. Industry officials have said the last
several years that rates have been inadequate. Sources said Arbella
Mutual Insurance Co. of Quincy and Liberty Mutual Insurance of
Boston, two of the state's largest insurers, argued against a
settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts is the lone state in the nation where all aspects
of auto insurance rates are set by the state insurance
commissioner. In setting the rates, the commissioner acts much like
a judge, overseeing a case pitting the Automobile Insurers Bureau
of Massachusetts against the attorney general and the State Rating
Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   As with any court case, a settlement becomes attractive when the
outcome is uncertain. That seemed to be the case this year.
</P>
<P>
   Shea said the attorney general decided to settle because a minor
increase in rates was appropriate. But he also said this year's
case was uncertain because a Ruthardt ruling on industry profits in
this year's workers' compensation rate decision seemed to undermine
a pro-consumer ruling she made last year on auto insurance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We weren't sure what we would get in the end with the
commissioner,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Insurance industry officials privately said the rate-setting
process is so politicized that a settlement, even if it's not the
optimum solution, is the safe approach.
</P>
<P>
   One official, speaking on condition that his name not be used,
said Ruthardt's contradictory rulings on industry profits were a
case in point. Last year, the official said, the commissioner took
the position that auto insurers are entitled to a lower profit
because investors view insurance stocks as safer investments than
US Treasury bills. In this year's workers' compensation case, which
has a far less public profile, she took the opposite approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're fighting against a system that has a political agenda,''
the official said.
</P>
<P>
   The negotiated 0.7 percent increase falls roughly midway between
the rate requests of the industry and the State Rating Bureau, an
agency within the state's Insurance Division that advocates for
consumers.
</P>
<P>
   The industry earlier this year called for a 7.8 percent increase
in rates, while the State Rating Bureau called for a 6.1 percent
rate cut. Sources said the State Rating Bureau expressed a
willingness to accept a 0.9 percent increase earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
   Insurance industry officials said it was too early to say
whether they will continue their practice of offering discounts off
of the state-set rates to good drivers and members of certain
groups.
</P>
<P>
   Shea said the average good-driver discount declined from 9.2
percent last year to 6 percent this year. He said the attorney
general's office would be monitoring the discounts this year to
make sure good drivers are rewarded, but he acknowledged his office
has no control over the discounting process.

GE TO SPEND $750M TO CLEAN UP PCBS IN HOUSATONIC 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOTT ALLEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   General Electric Co. will invest up to $750 million to clean up
PCB contamination caused by its old transformer plant in
Pittsfield, Mass. under a consent decree filed Thursday in US
District Court that ends years of wrangling over the company's duty
to restore the Housatonic River and other polluted areas.
</P>
<P>
   Under the 404-page agreement, signed by federal, state and local
officials as well as GE, the company will begin cleaning up the
half mile of the river immediately downstream from the long-closed
plant next week, with promises to clean up the rest of the river in
the years to come.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the Connecticut-based company will complete the
cleanup of the 250-acre plant site, then turn it over to the city
of Pittsfield for redevelopment.
</P>
<P>
   ``This settlement ensures that the environment and public health
of the residents in the Pittsfield area will be protected,'' said
Carol Browner, administrator of the US Environmental Protection
Agency, which agreed not to declare the plant a federal hazardous
waste site in exchange for a negotiated cleanup settlement.
</P>
<P>
   General Electric officials praised the agreement as well,
although they predicted the total cost would be far less than $750
million.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like all settlements, this one required compromises from all
sides. But it shows that creative and constructive solutions can
emerge when government and business sit down to negotiate in good
faith,'' said Stephen D. Ramsay, GE's vice president for corporate
environmental programs.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, GE also agreed Thursday to spend $1 million on
environmental projects to settle allegations investigated by
Attorney General Thomas Reilly that the company failed to properly
report the PCB contamination in residential areas.
</P>
<P>
   The consent decree, which still must be approved by a federal
judge after a 60-day public comment period, lays out a detailed
blueprint to undo the damage from GE's longtime use of
polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCBs, as a transformer fluid before
the toxic chemicals were banned in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   Although they are not acutely toxic, longterm exposure to PCBs
has been linked to cancer in part because they tend to accumulate
and remain in human and animal tissues.
</P>
<P>
   Many projects described in the decree, such as the cleanup of
Allendale School, which neighbors the plant, are already under way,
and the company had already agreed in principle to carry out the
rest of the project. GE has spent an estimated $100 million on PCB
cleanup not included in the decree.
</P>
<P>
   However, top GE executives said they would not begin work on the
Housatonic River itself _ perhaps the most costly portion of the
job _ until the formal consent decree was filed, spelling out the
company's right to appeal cleanup requirements.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have not been willing to go forward with the work in the
river until this was signed,'' said EPA regional administrator John
DeVillars. ``Now, we will have crews deployed in the river next
week.''
</P>
<P>
   Government sources say the final pricetag of the cleanup is
likely to range between $250 million and $750 million, depending
mainly on how much cleanup is needed in the stretch of the
Housatonic River more than two miles downstream from the plant.
</P>
<P>
   Although the downstream section of the river is further from the
plant, federal officials have found PCB levels in ducks more than
200 times the safe level for human consumption. Government sources
said the total cost of removing PCBs more than 2 miles downstream
is likely to range from $100 million to $500 million.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in Pittsfield may have been the happiest of all, since
they will get a long-awaited cleanup as well as 700,000 to one
million square feet of building space for future development from
the former GE complex.
</P>
<P>
   Pittsfield city council president Thomas E. Hickey, Jr., said
the city will develop ``one of the largest city center business
complexes in the commonwealth,'' finally turning years of disaster
to economic advantage.

 &HT;    Affordable child care aim of Bradley proposal
 &HT;    By Ken Foskett
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Calling stay-at-home parents ``a luxury that most
families can't afford,'' Democratic presidential challenger Bill
Bradley on Thursday proposed new government investments in child
care.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley called for spending $2 billion a year in public-private
partnerships that would make child care more affordable to working
parents and improve child care facilities. He also wants to offer
$200 monthly stipends to senior citizens who work with children and
expand the Family and Medical Leave Act to cover 10 million more
employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``A prosperity that fails to bolster families is a hollow and
unsustainable one,'' Bradley said in a speech in Peterborough, N.H.
``This proposal is not about big government, but it's about big
ideas and the courage to commit ourselves to finding a common sense
balance between family and work.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's child care speech was scheduled to come on the eve of
a crucial meeting in Los Angeles next week when AFL-CIO leaders are
likely to endorse a Democratic presidential candidate. Bradley
openly appealed to ``working families'' during his remarks.
</P>
<P>
   But his campaign officials on Thursday all but conceded that the
AFL-CIO, which Bradley had been aggressively courting, won't
endorse the former New Jersey senator. ``We think it's going to go
to Gore,'' said Bradley's spokesman, Eric Hauser.
</P>
<P>
   In a series of speeches to different unions and in closed-door
meetings with labor leaders, Bradley had sought to convince the
AFL-CIO leadership to at least withhold any endorsement until after
the Democratic primary.
</P>
<P>
   But AFL-CIO President John Sweeney publicly pushed for Gore's
endorsement, even though some of the larger unions, such as the
Teamsters, wanted to wait.
</P>
<P>
   Having apparently lost the fight, Bradley's camp downplayed the
significance of labor's endorsement.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to wonder at this point whether it's just a paper
endorsement with as much internal division as there was,'' Hauser
said.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, however, picked up some good news in New Hampshire on
Thursday. A new statewide poll conducted by WNDS-TV and Franklin
Pierce College found Democrats favoring Bradley over Gore 42
percent to 35 percent, with a margin of error of 6 percentage
points.
</P>
<P>
   More troubling for the vice president, perhaps, was the poll's
finding that all voters would choose Bradley over Texas Gov. George
W. Bush, the GOP front-runner, 51 percent to 35 percent. Gore and
Bush were in a statistical dead heat, according to the survey.
</P>
<P>
   Another survey for the Boston Herald and WCVB-TV showed Bradley
and Gore in a virtual tie. Four months ago, Gore led Bradley by a
dozen points.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's speech to students and teachers at Contoocoock Valley
High School in New Hampshire, site of the nation's first primary,
was intended to bolster Bradley's standing among rank and file
union members and other suburban voters.
</P>
<P>
   Under Bradley's child care initiative, local counties would
create public-private partnerships composed of state child care
agencies, day care centers, churches and educators. Forty percent
of the federal grants would go to improving existing child care
programs such as Head Start. The rest could be used for teacher
training, building new facilities or subsidizing the cost of child
care to help working parents.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley modeled his program on North Carolina's ``Smart Start''
program. It targets state resources to improving care for children
from birth to age 5, working through locally created public-private
partnerships.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a respectable start,'' said Helen Blank, child care
director at the Children's Defense Fund.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign was less impressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it comes to the most important issues facing America's
working families, like after-school care, the marriage penalty,
quality child care and real help with college, he falls short, and
even flat,'' said Kiki Moore, Gore's campaign spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   Expanding the Family and Medical Leave Act to cover businesses
with 25 or more employees (current law covers businesses with 50 or
more workers) was first proposed by President Clinton in his
January State of the Union speech. Gore also backs the expansion,
and has pledged to offer tax credits to businesses that offer
on-site day care and personal income tax credits for low-income
families.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley also proposed spending $400 million a year on community
colleges, targeting the funds toward programs that retrain adults
to fill better paying jobs. Bradley said his $1.2 billion a year
initiative to give stipends to senior citizens who work as tutors
or care givers could attract more than 500,000 ``volunteers'' to
help in their communities when the program was fully funded in five
years.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley said he would fund the 10-year cost of his $2.6 billion
initiatives through non-Social Security surpluses.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech, Bradley said he sought to develop his proposals
recognizing that the ``6:30 dinner hour,'' which he fondly recalled
from his own childhood, doesn't exist in the new, global economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``While government shouldn't be meddling with your family's
dinner hour, it can and should be a catalyst for change,'' Bradley
said in his prepared remarks. ``Americans don't want new government
bureaucracies, but I think they do want government to understand
the enormous pressures and difficulties they face every day trying
to provide care for their families.''

 &HT;    Witness: Koch may have cheated on measurements
 &HT;    By Fred Cohen
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TULSA, Okla. _ A witness for Palm Beacher William Koch's side in
his case against his brothers' huge oil company testified Thursday
that Koch Industries employees may have cheated when measuring
producers' tanks as well as the oil in them.
</P>
<P>
   Several witnesses testified this week that they ``adjusted'' the
measurements taken to determine how much oil the company bought
from producers. The result, they said, was that the Wichita,
Kan.-based company usually got more oil than it paid for.
</P>
<P>
   Falsifying the measurement of a tank _ saying it is smaller than
it really is _ would have ensured overages for the company for
years, former employee Wayne Ramberg said.
</P>
<P>
   Suing on behalf of the United States of America and Indian
tribes, William Koch has alleged the company led by his brother
Charles systematically defrauded oil producers working leases on
federal and Indian land in the 1980s, costing the government and
Indians millions of dollars in royalties. William Koch stands to
collect as much as a third of any judgment against the company.
</P>
<P>
   The suit is the latest in a series he has brought against family
members and the company founded by his father. William Koch's twin
brother, David, has a home in Palm Beach and is the executive vice
president of Koch Industries. The $35 billion business is the
second-largest privately held company in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The company says its error rate in measuring oil was well within
industry standards and that the ``gaugers'' who collected oil for
the company legitimately made adjustments to account for conditions
such as oil clinging to tank walls, excessive sediment on tank
bottoms and ``encrustation'' of tank walls. In cross examination,
the witnesses have agreed that some of the adjustments they made
were necessary for the company to avoid paying for oil it would not
have received.
</P>
<P>
   The company also points to the lack of participation in the case
by the Indians it supposedly cheated, and fact that independent
producers have not complained about its measurement practices.
</P>
<P>
   Ramberg of Billings, Mont., like some others who have testified
during the trial in U.S. District Court here, was fired. He had
worked for the company for 28 years and received a demotion and pay
cut before Koch Industries let him go in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Ramberg said that, as an operations foreman from 1979 to 1988,
he measured the circumference of about half a dozen oil tanks,
using a tape measure divided into hundredths of a foot. He said he
was instructed to ``shrink'' each tank by one to two hundredths of
a foot.
</P>
<P>
   Later he testified that this would result in the purchaser
getting ``more volume.''
</P>
<P>
   Than it pays for? plaintiff's lawyer Jim Stubblefield asked.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Ramberg said.
</P>
<P>
   Every time that tank is bought?
</P>
<P>
   Yes.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs introduced as evidence a chart showing the
results of the remeasuring of several customers' tanks by a Koch
Industries employee. In all cases, the remeasurement found the tank
to be either the same size or larger than the first measurement.
</P>
<P>
   Ramberg said Koch Industries often would measure a customer's
tank only once, when it started buying oil from them.
</P>
<P>
   In cross-examination, Koch Industries chief attorney Clyde
Muchmore asked Ramberg if he knew how old the tanks were when they
were remeasured. He did not.
</P>
<P>
   Muchmore also asked Ramberg if he knew what happens to the
circumference of a tank over a period of years if it is repeatedly
emptied or filled. He did not.
</P>
<P>
   Ramberg also testified that, at the September 1988 meeting at
which the company issued the measurement policy and manuals, a Koch
Industries official suggested that he destroy records showing how
much more oil the company had received than it had paid for.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jerald (Burks, manager of Koch Industries' northern division)
said that if we had anything in the office that pertained to over
and short, it shouldn't be there,'' Ramberg said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew what we had to do,'' he said. ``We didn't need those
reports any more.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ramberg said under questioning that he did not know what
happened to the reports and had no knowledge that they were
destroyed. Koch Industries lawyers later showed him what he said
were copies of the reports.
</P>
<P>
   Ramberg, like the other former ``gaugers'' _ employees who
measured oil Koch Industries bought, said he learned from other
gaugers. He said a September 1988 meeting in Wichita was the first
time the company provided a manual and formal policy on oil
measurement.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs presented a chart, Ramberg said, the company's
overages started dropping precipitously about the time of the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   The policy introduced at the meeting, Ramberg said, was ``to be
as accurate as possible and avoid losses.''

LACK OF FUNDS SQUEEZING UN PEACEKEEPING EFFORTS 
</HEADLINE>

 By JOE LAURIA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Faced with a Congress reluctant to fund a spate
of new UN peacekeeping missions, the Clinton administration
Thursday asked the United Nations to reduce the size of its
proposed peacekeeping mission in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
   The price tag for the East Timor operation is expected to exceed
$1 billion at a time when the UN is struggling to fund its civil
administration in Kosovo following the NATO bombing campaign
earlier this year. The UN has so far raised only $35 million of the
proposed first year budget of $125 million. UN Secretary General
Koffi Annan has asked the General Assembly for $200 million for
Kosovo, though officials say the eventual cost could reach $500
million for the first year.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one would have thought that, in the past year alone, the
United Nations would undertake new operations in Kosovo and East
Timor and be on the verge of new missions in Sierra Leone and the
Democratic Republic of the Congo,'' Annan told the UN budget
committee this week. ``The UN must be prepared. Ad hoc solutions
will not do.''
</P>
<P>
   Such solutions have been made necessary largely because the
United Nation's richest member, the United States, has refused to
pay its peacekeeping and regular budget dues.
</P>
<P>
   The United States must pay the United Nations $550 million by
the end of the year to avoid losing its vote in the General
Assembly, warned Joseph Connor, UN undersecretary-general for
management, this week. So far, Congress has only authorized $200
million toward the $1.7 billion in back dues that Washington owes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are running a globally important organization without the
predictable, assured, financial support of its members,'' Connor
said.
</P>
<P>
   New peacekeeping missions in the next 12 months could cost as
much as $800 million, he added. UN members have been $2.15 billion
behind in peacekeeping dues since December 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Annan has not yet submitted a budget for East Timor, but the
mission will be more expensive than Kosovo because the United
Nations will be running both a civilian administration and a
peacekeeping mission. NATO countries currently pay for peacekeeping
in Kosovo. Officials here say estimates for East Timor range from
$1 billion to $1.7 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The United States is assessed by the United Nations for 31
percent of that cost, though Congress has passed legislation
cutting Washington's share of the UN peacekeeping budget to 25
percent from 31 percent..
</P>
<P>
   ``The United Nations needs to reduce its over-reliance on a
single member,'' US Ambassador Richard Holbrooke told the budget
committee. ``A scale of assessments that is fair is not something
the UN can just hope to do. It is what the UN must do.''
</P>
<P>
   To cut costs in East Timor, US representatives want the
operation proposed by Annan to be reduced from 8,950 troops to
8,000, which could save hundreds of millions of dollars over the
three years that the mission is expected to last.
</P>
<P>
   ``The UN told the Americans it is in the hands of the Security
Council and they should work it out there,'' said a UN source, who
spoke on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal to cut the size of the force angered Antonio
Monteiro, UN ambassador from Portugal, which was East Timor's
colonial ruler until it pulled out in 1975. ``I'm fed up with being
told we should do this or that,'' Monteiro said in an interview
with a Portuguese newspaper Thursday. ``The Secretary General says
this is what we need, so let's stick to that.''
</P>
<P>
   Monteiro added: ``We have to start out with what the Secretary
General considers the minimum necessary to rebuild the country,
that's what I told Ambassador Holbrooke. I know it may be
problematic with Congress, but we'll have no difficult finding the
money if commitments are kept.''
</P>
<P>
   Portugal has offered 1,000 troops for the operation, which it
says it will pay for out of its own funds, but the UN may be
reluctant to allow the former colonial rulers back in the
territory.
</P>
<P>
   The Security Council Thursday began discussing a draft
resolution that would establish the UN-run East Timor civil
administration and the longterm peacekeeping force that would
replace the Australian-led multinational force now restoring order
to the troubled territory.
</P>
<P>
   UN officials hope the Australians will leave some of their
equipment behind to help defray some of the cost.
</P>
<P>
   Peacekeeping officials here say the lack of money could delay
deployment of the force well beyond November, when the Indonesian
assembly is expected to ratify the East Timorese vote for
independence and formally hand over the territory to the United
Nations. A February date appears more likely, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Deployment of the force may also be held up by the contentious
issue of who should command the peacekeeping force and the civilian
administration to be installed in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
   Sources say some of Annan's aides are pressing him to appease
Indonesia, fearful that other parts of its far-flung archipelago
might break away, by appointing two Asians to the top positions,
possibly from Malaysia and Thailand.
</P>
<P>
   This has angered the Portuguese and the East Timorese
pro-independence leaders. ``We can't just take into account Asian
sensibilities,'' said Monteiro. ``I keep hearing from the UN and
from some member states that East Timor is going better now, so
let's help Indonesia. But East Timor still needs priority
attention.''
</P>
<P>
   East Timor independence leaders Xanana Gusmao and Nobel Peace
Prize-winner Jose Ramos-Horta said in London this week they want
Portugal to have a leading role in East Timor and even suggested
adopting the Portuguese currency.
</P>
<P>
   Monteiro said he has told Annan that the East Timorese leaders
does not want Asians in the top jobs, fearing they believe could be
controlled by Jakarta.

   NEW YORK _ With both his wife and his vice president facing
tough races in New York, President Clinton met here Thursday with
representives of a key state voter group: labor.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton spent 25 minutes chatting with influential union leader
James P. Hoffa, marking the first time since Franklin Roosevelt
that a US president has met with the head of the Teamsters Union.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the evening, Clinton was scheduled to speak before the
National Labor Research Association and to the Democratic
Senatorial Campaign Committee. The latter event featured Dennis
Rivera, the powerful head of the city's biggest health care union.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he and Hoffa ``didn't talk that much about other
politics,'' and mainly discussed trade issues, including ``safety
provisions'' of the North American Free Trade Agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Labor unions opposed NAFTA, a Clinton administration initiative,
arguing that US workers would lose their jobs to lower-paid labor
in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   The AFL-CIO, of which the Teamsters union is a member, is
tentatively scheduled to vote on a presidential candidate
endorsement next Wednesday, although there has been some discussion
about delaying the vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still up in the air,'' said AFL-CIO spokeswoman Deborah
Dion.
</P>
<P>
   But Hoffa later said the possible endorsement at the AFL-CIO's
Los Angeles meeting was not discussed. ``Believe it or not it
didn't come up,'' Hoffa said, adding that it was too early to lean
toward a candidate.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that Vice President Al Gore is meeting with labor union
people. ``I think it would be helpful for him to be more engaged
with the people who are running the large labor unions,'' Hoffa
said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton had been trying for several months to get a meeting with
Hoffa, who is the son of legendary and controversial Teamsters
leader James R. Hoffa. The elder Hoffa vanished in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   It was only ``scheduling'' that held up a Clinton-Hoffa get
together, White House spokesman Joe Lockhart told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Former Senator Bill Bradley has been edging Gore in many
statewide polls, leading Gore to shake up his campaign and take the
surprising step of challenging Bradley to a series of debates.
</P>
<P>
   Losing a major labor endorsement would be a devastating
development for Gore, who normally would enjoy an institutional
advantage as a sitting vice president in a Democratic White House.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Bradley downplayed the endorsement vote and
virtually conceded the win to Gore based on his status as vice
president. The two men _ both of whom supported NAFTA _ do not have
substantially different records on labor issues, said Bradley
spokesman Tony Wyche.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley is meeting with labor leaders and Thursday in New
Hampshire unveiled a program for ``working families'' that included
such labor-friendly ideas as an expansion of the Family and Medical
Leave Act, and the creation of a new child care program.
</P>
<P>
   But more important than a major labor endorsement is the
grass-roots support of working people, Wyche said. ``We've been
actively competing for the support of working men and women,''
Wyche said.
</P>
<P>
   Aggressive labor support is also important to the campaiagn of
Hillary Rodham Clinton, who is exploring a possible Senate bid.
</P>
<P>
   The active backing of Rivera _ who is both a prominent Latino
leader as well as a major union president _ could be especially
important to Mrs Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton angered many Puerto Rican leaders when she said the
clemency offer to members of the National Front for Liberation, a
Puerto Rican nationalist group, should be withdrawn.
</P>
<P>
   The labor vote is particularly important in New York State,
where Gore and Bradley are neck-and-neck in the polls.
</P>
<P>
   A recent poll by the independent Marist Institute for Public
Opinion in Poughkeepsie shows that Bradley and Gore each has about
41 percent of voter support. However, Bradley fares much better
than Gore in a hypothetical matchup against the Republican
front-runner, Texas Governor George W. Bush, said Lee Miringoff,
director of the Marist Institute.
</P>
<P>
   Pitted against Bush, Bradley would win New York State 48 percent
to 38 percent, while Gore would garner only 44 percent of the vote
against Bush's 44 percent, Miringoff said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a Democratic primary, it's very hard'' to win without labor
backing, Miringoff said. ``The votes are important, and the
endorsements are very important.''

RAYTHEON SEES SHORTFALL IN PENTAGON MUNITIONS ORDER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROSS KERBER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Raytheon Co. said it now expects the Pentagon to order 20
percent fewer bombs and missiles than previously forecast to
replace munitions used in last spring's Yugoslavia air war.
</P>
<P>
   In the latest of a string of financial warnings by the
Lexington, Mass. defense contractor, Raytheon spokesman Dave Shea
said Thursday the company believes replenishment orders for
Tomahawk and Maverick missiles and other armaments will total about
$800 million, down from an earlier estimate of $1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Shea said the change resulted from a slower pace of orders from
the Pentagon. A Pentagon spokesman declined to discuss specific
weapons systems purchases.
</P>
<P>
   Raytheon's update came as the company prepares to detail its
financial outlook at investment conferences scheduled next week in
New York and Lexington.
</P>
<P>
   Concerns about Raytheon's revenue and earnings have grown since
September, when the company said it planned to take a charge of up
to $450 million for its third quarter, ending Sept. 30, primarily
beause of disappointing overseas orders. The company warned the
setbacks will lead to further job cuts in Massachusetts and
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   News of the charge and cooling expectations about the air war's
benefits to Raytheon have helped drive the company's shares down
nearly 40 percent since July, when they reached a 12-month high of
76 9/16. Raytheon's widely traded Class B shares fell 1 to close at
46 1/16 in New York Stock Exchange trading Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Many analysts still keep ``buy'' ratings on the company.
Although Raytheon's fortunes are closely tied to overall defense
spending, analysts said the slipping replenishment schedule wan't a
matter of grave concern.
</P>
<P>
   But several said they are also waiting for the company to
solidify its financial picture. ``The recent weakness reflects
uncertainly about the earnings and cash-flow outlook,'' said Bear,
Stearns analyst Steven Binder, who has a ``neutral'' rating on the
stock.
</P>
<P>
   Raytheon's latest revision adjusts a June forecast by company
chief executive Daniel Burnham that Raytheon expected about $1
billion worth of extra work over the next year to replace stocks of
the Navy's Tomahawk cruise missile, Air Force glider bombs and
Maverick air-to-ground missiles, and other munitions fired during
NATO's three-month air campaign over Serbia and Kosovo that ended
in June.
</P>
<P>
   In all, US forces used more than 25,000 bombs, of which 8,500
were precision-guided munitions made by Raytheon and other military
contractors. The Pentagon isn't yet saying exactly how many copies
of each weapon type it launched during the campaign, but expects to
spend around $1.3 billion to rebuild US military stockpiles in
Europe to levels meant to last through a 30-day war, according to
Pentagon spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Vic Warzinski.
</P>
<P>
   Some new business for Raytheon is already on the way that should
mitigate some financial concerns. For example, Congress has
allocated $431 million to upgrade older Tomahawk missiles with
advances such as satellite-based targeting systems and lightweight
titanium casings.
</P>
<P>
   Raytheon also will receive about $40 million for production of a
decoy pod known as the ALE-50, which is towed behind fighter planes
and bombers and sends out electronic signals to jam enemy missile
navigation devices.
</P>
<P>
   But for other weapons systems, there are ``things that are not
necessarily falling into place,'' said Raytheon's Shea, a spokesman
for Raytheon Systems Co., a Virginia-based military-contracting
unit.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, Raytheon doesn't expect as many orders as it once
did for replacements for its Paveway laser-guided bombs or for
missiles such as the Maverick series. These missiles, along with
the Tomahawk, are built at Raytheon plants in Tucson, Ariz., using
some circuit cards and other components produced in Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   Raytheon still expects to receive a large chunk of $1.1 billion
that will be allocated among several defense contractors under a
federal arms replenishment bill, according to Shea.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the Tomahawk and ALE-50 work, ``We believe we are
well-positioned to receive several hundred million in additional
revenue,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Warzinski, the Pentagon spokesman, said he couldn't discuss
upcoming orders of individual weapons systems or Raytheon's
outlook.
</P>
<P>
   Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette analyst Joe Nadol said Raytheon
previously told him and other analysts it was backing away from the
$1 billion total for arms replenishment in connection with the NATO
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Nadol said he is more anxious to hear additional details about
the status of the company's overseas projects such as missile
defense work for Taiwan, and a European military radar project.
``That's the crux of the issue, in terms of their revenue
shortfall,'' Nadol said.
</P>
<P>
   Raytheon hasn't quantified the additional impact that the lower
estimate for replenishment orders might have on third-quarter
earnings, scheduled to be released Oct. 21.
</P>
<P>
   Nadol said he estimates Raytheon earned about 89 cents a share
in the third quarter, but added: ``I don't feel fully confident in
that (estimate), because they haven't given explicit guidance''
lately.

CHASE TO MOVE 3,500 JOBS OUT OF NEW YORK CITY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass., Texas, Fla.)  (th) 
 By LESLIE EATON    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Chase Manhattan Corp., the largest corporate employer
in New York City, is moving 10 percent of its jobs _ 3,500
positions _ to Florida, Texas and Massachusetts, the company told
its workers on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   City officials and corporate consultants said they could not
remember a bigger relocation by a single company. But in the late
1980s, many Wall Street firms began moving their ``back office''
record-keeping and data processing jobs to New Jersey and Florida,
a trend that Chase is now catching up with.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning next year, Chase will move two entire back-office
units, from entry-level positions to technology workers to senior
managers, said Ken Herz, a spokesman for the company. One of the
businesses transfers money for companies; the other involves
tracking and processing stock and bond trades.
</P>
<P>
   By relocating its workers, the bank will cut its costs
significantly, Herz said, though he would not say how much money it
expected to save. Salaries, real estate costs, taxes,
telecommunications charges and utilities costs are all lower in
Tampa, Fla., and Dallas, where most of the jobs are to be
relocated.
</P>
<P>
   But the savings are so big that Chase did not even approach the
city for financial or logistical help to try to keep the jobs in
New York, Herz said. ``There was no way the city could come up with
enough money,'' he added. ``These are very significant savings.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're always sorry to see any jobs go,'' said Deputy Mayor
Randy Levine. But, he said, Chase has promised to keep its
headquarters and core business in the city and will be expanding
its other operations. The company, which Levine said was looking
for one million square feet, has been searching unsuccessfully for
space in which to expand.
</P>
<P>
   Technological advances have prompted banks to slash the number
of employees in the city over the last decade, as have mergers;
Chase gobbled up Chemical Bank and Manufacturers Hanover, among
others. Employment at depository institutions has fallen from
almost 175,000 in 1988 to about 110,000 today, according to the
state's Department of Labor.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the jobs that have disappeared were held by middle-class
people earning middle-income salaries, leading some economists and
government officials to worry that New York is becoming
increasingly a city of the very rich and very poor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a constant worry, that all the middle-class finance jobs
are going, that the banks can't afford to keep them here,'' said
one former city official.
</P>
<P>
   The city government has offered financial incentives to large
companies that threatened to leave the city; Chase received $235
million in 1988, when it agreed to move many back-office employees
to Brooklyn, rather than New Jersey. It now has about 6,000
employees at Brooklyn's Metrotech Center office complex, which is
full.
</P>
<P>
   Some Metrotech jobs are among those that are being moved, Herz
said, adding that Chase planned to relocate other business units to
Metrotech to keep it full.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the employees whose jobs are being moved work at the tip
of Manhattan, at 4 New York Plaza and 55 Water St. While Chase said
it would offer to relocate many of those workers, several
interviewed Thursday said they were unlikely to go.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess if you're single or live with your parents, you could
pack up and move, but I can't,'' one middle-aged employee said.
``We constantly get letters from the chairman saying you're doing a
great job; now, we really feel betrayed.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The city's Metrotech deal with Chase particularly rankled,
another employee said. ``It's a sorry state,'' he complained.
``Here's a major corporation that receives tax abatements from the
city, and part of that deal is to bring jobs to the city. Slowly
but surely, they move operations.''
</P>
<P>
   One reason that employees may be reluctant to relocate is that
their chances of finding work in New York City are unusually good,
corporate consultants said. The unemployment rate in the city is
6.9 percent, down from roughly 10 percent in early 1997, and many
companies are adding new jobs at a record pace.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people will find jobs in a couple of months,
definitely,'' said Dennis J. Donovan, a partner in the
Wadley-Donovan Group, which advises companies on relocations.
</P>
<P>
   That was not the case in the late 1980s, when Merrill Lynch
moved 2,500 back-office jobs to Jersey City. Or, in the mid-1990s,
when several big financial firms threatened to move to Stamford,
Conn., and Swiss Bank actually did, taking 1,300 jobs with it.
Citigroup, which employs about 25,000 people in the city, has for
years had its stock custodial business in Tampa, a Citigroup
spokesman, Jack Morris, said.
</P>
<P>
   Companies have discovered that they can have administrative
tasks performed almost anywhere, even overseas, said Daniel
Malachuck, a partner at Arthur Andersen who specializes in business
location services.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, however, companies and their employees have
become far more optimistic about staying in New York City,
Malachuck said, and less inclined to move to another part of the
country.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know what the post-Rudy mind-set will be, but people
feel better about the city and their situation,'' he said. ``And
people have been to some of those other places.''

<P>
   BIRCHTOWN, Nova Scotia _ As a mechanic with the Canadian air
force, Everett S. Cromwell traveled the world. But as a black man
born in Nova Scotia, a wind-blown Atlantic province typically
associated with Gaelic cod fishermen, he recalled, ``I never had a
clue where we actually came from.''
</P>
<P>
   The mystery of his family's past lifted when investigators from
a new provincial black history project showed him the ``Book of
Negroes'' _ a list of African-Americans who had escaped slavery to
fight with the British during the American Revolution. Reviewing
this list, prepared because George Washington demanded British
compensation for lost slaves, he said, ``We discovered that
Cromwells, our ancestors, disembarked here.''
</P>
<P>
   This tiny village, where Cromwell now routinely strolls along a
quiet cove, was once the largest settlement of free blacks outside
of Africa. A boomtown in the late 18th century, it was named after
Samuel Birch, a British general. He issued ``Birch Certificates,''
the prized traveling papers that allowed black men and women to
escape, via New York, to freedom in Nova Scotia.
</P>
<P>
   After two centuries of neglect bordering on denial, Nova Scotia
now is unearthing its black American history. In Halifax, a
250-year-old city dotted with museums celebrating white colonial
history, Nova Scotia Museum researchers recently won a $114,000
federal grant to research black history. A black history slide show
has toured traditionally black communities. ``Loyalties,'' a new
movie on the 18th-century black migration, was on national
television in mid-September.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was collective amnesia, no memory, no stories,'' said
Carmelita Robertson, a museum researcher who brought the slide show
to Tracadie, the historically black community where she was born.
``There was only a very superficial knowledge that people were
slaves, and came up from the states on boats.''
</P>
<P>
   Here in Birchtown, archaeologists have dug into the cellar hole
of Stephen Blucke, a colonel in the ``Black Brigade,'' a British
unit that waged guerrilla war against rebels in New Jersey. Digging
200 yards from Cromwell's house last year, they found a rich trove
of 16,000 artifacts, including Revolutionary War era military
buttons, a shoe buckle and a bayonet.
</P>
<P>
   Nearby, at Shelburne, people of African descent telephone daily
from across Canada, and, increasingly, from the United States, to
register with Teena Paynter, secretary of the Black Loyalist
Heritage Society, a new genealogical project.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Robertson, who has traveled to South Carolina to meet lost
family members, said, ``To find these missing cousins can only
enrich families. For black Americans, they possibly do have
relatives who escaped north during slave times.''
</P>
<P>
   The Book of Negroes, which the Nova Scotia Museum hopes to post
on the Internet soon, is considered a rare and valuable document
for black history. It was produced 80 years before Emancipation in
the United States and contains 2,700 surnames of escaped slaves,
including names, ages, appearances, previous owners and places of
residence. Although the British compiled the lists and rebel
inspectors boarded each ship to verify passenger manifests, the
British never paid the compensation demanded by the man who would
become the first U.S. president.
</P>
<P>
   For people of African origin, about 5 percent of Canada's
population, uncovering the saga of the black loyalists has proved
to be both uplifting and dispiriting. Those who went over to
British lines in the late 1770s were not monarchists, but
freedom-seekers, their descendants say.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they fought the Americans for the British, as far as they
were concerned, they were fighting for their freedom,'' said
Cromwell, a 77-year-old veteran who fought alongside U.S. units in
Europe in World War II.
</P>
<P>
   During the American Revolution, in a strategy they repeated in
the war of 1812, British commanders offered freedom to slaves of
rebel masters who would come over to fight with the British army.
The offer was not valid for slaves of loyalist masters. As a
result, thousands of African-Americans fled slavery, and crossed
over to British lines, where they often worked digging trenches and
building gun emplacements.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In the chaos following the British military collapse, some
officers enriched themselves through betrayal. When
African-Americans got out to the high seas, they found that their
ships were heading south to sugar plantations in the Caribbean,
instead of north to freedom in Nova Scotia.
</P>
<P>
   But at Birch's insistence, about 3,500 free black veterans were
evacuated to Nova Scotia in 1783 and 1784. The policy resulted from
a mix of compassion and realpolitik. Determined to hold on to
Canada, the British populated Nova Scotia with people hostile to
the American Revolution _ decommissioned British soldiers, white
Tories and black loyalists.
</P>
<P>
   On arriving here, freed blacks encountered a wall of racism.
White authorities apparently wanted cheap labor. Within two years,
surveyors had allotted farming plots to virtually all white
arrivals but to fewer than 15 percent of the blacks. White plots
averaged twice the size of the black plots, which were often on
thin, rocky soil distant from town.
</P>
<P>
   Without the promised land, tools, or food rations, desperate
black workers became indentured servants or accepted reduced wage
rates. In 1784, the lowering of wage scales by black laborers
prompted North America's first modern race riot, in Shelburne.
Benjamin Marston, a surveyor, wrote: ``Great riot today. The
disbanded soldiers have risen against the free negroes to drive
them out of town.''
</P>
<P>
   Two winters later, famine hit black communities. In 1788, a
royal adviser visited Birchtown and reported of the black
loyalists: ``Their huts are miserable to guard against the Nova
Scotia winter. I think I never saw such wretchedness and poverty.''
</P>
<P>
   With black communities bitterly calling this cold, rocky
province ``Nova Scarcity,'' residents and church leaders responded
enthusiastically in 1791 to a plan by a London philanthropist to
create a free black colony on the west coast of Africa. In January
1792, 1,196 free blacks set sail from Halifax for Sierra Leone,
where they helped to establish the capital city, now Freetown.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Sierra Leone, they are still called the Nova Scotians,
although they really are African-Americans,'' Joe Opala, an
American anthropologist, said of Freetown's founding families.
Through research into 18th-century shipping records, scholars have
determined that about 50 of those who moved to Freetown were
actually West Africans who had been kidnapped from their villages
for the slave trade.
</P>
<P>
   ``One man had been stolen from the coastal area'' near where
Freetown is now, recalled Opala. ``A few days after he returned on
the British ship, his mother saw him walking down a trail. She
nearly collapsed.''
</P>
<P>
   In modern Nova Scotia, the rediscovery of history has enhanced
the self-esteem of the province's long-isolated black minority of
18,000 people. Still, recognition remains slow. Ms. Robertson says
that, 216 years after her ancestors settled here, white Nova
Scotians still assume she just arrived from the Caribbean, asking,
``what island I am from.''
</P>
<P>
   Here in Birchtown, Elizabeth Cromwell, Everett Cromwell's wife,
was locked in negotiations one recent afternoon with donors for a
proposed black history center.
</P>
<P>
   ``All our history was shut off, as if we never existed,''
Cromwell recalled of growing up black in Nova Scotia. ``We just
want to put ourselves on the map, to show that weren't born on a
rock.''

 &HT;    Dell CEO confident Taiwanese parts will be available
 &HT;    By Jerry Mahoney
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ While acknowledging there will be shortages of
some computers heading into the holiday season, Dell Computer Corp.
Chief Executive Michael Dell assured about 200 industry analysts
visiting Austin on Thursday that his company is in the front of the
line for components made in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   The earthquake that hit Taiwan on Sept. 21 killed nearly 2,300
people and injured 8,700. But, Dell said, the 7.6-magnitude quake
did not seriously damage manufacturing plants of Dell's suppliers.
</P>
<P>
   Dell buys notebook computers and parts such as liquid-crystal
displays and mother boards from Taiwanese companies.
</P>
<P>
   He said those suppliers assured him when he visited Taiwan last
week that the Round Rock, Texas, company's size guarantees it will
get components if there are shortages.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to squeeze out the little guys and I think we're
going to get the parts we need,'' Dell said at the annual fall
meeting with analysts who follow Dell for large investment
companies and PC industry research firms.
</P>
<P>
   Dell said his company deals directly with customers, and guides
customers to purchase components more readily available,
eliminating delays.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our flexibility here is much, much greater than others,'' he
said. ``I'd be very surprised if we didn't come out of this a whole
lot better than our competitors.''
</P>
<P>
   His comments were prompted by concerns voiced by analysts at a
dinner Wednesday night. Dell's confidence contrasts with an Oct. 1
warning from Hewlett-Packard Inc. Chief Executive Carly Fiorina
that a disruption in chip supplies would lower HP's fourth-quarter
results.
</P>
<P>
   Dell said he's much less optimistic about supplies of
liquid-crystal displays, the thin screens that go in notebook PCs
and with newer desktop models. But even that shortage, which
predates the earthquake and affects all PC makers, is not expected
to impact Dell's third quarter, which ends Oct. 31, Dell said.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Don Collis, Dell's senior vice president for
investor relations, acknowledged uncertainties about the quarter.
``We can't be that explicit about what Q3 looks like,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Dell stock closed up $1.06 1/4 at $44.37 1/2 on Nasdaq trading
Thursday.

GIULIANI TESTED BY FIRST AMENDMENT STANCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRED KAPLAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Say what you will about the mayor's taste in art, but
there's no doubting his relish for a good First Amendment fight.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, as the courtroom clash between Mayor Rudolph Giuliani
and the Brooklyn Museum of Art gets under way Friday, the mayor's
legal troops find themselves confronting an all too familiar
battlefield on which they have spilled much blood and lost nearly
every contest.
</P>
<P>
   Since taking office in 1994, Giuliani or his aides have been
sued in 21 cases involving claims of First Amendment rights by
adversaries that include taxi drivers, Latino police officers,
winter solstice worshipers, black protest marchers, Times Square
preachers, and magazine publishers.
</P>
<P>
   For all these fights, he has emerged victorious just once. He
lost or surrendered 15 times, with four cases still pending.
</P>
<P>
   Some see his persistence as political, others see it as a
character trait _ whether admirable or disturbing _ while others
are simply puzzled. Whatever the view, many agree the mayor has
long displayed a pattern when it comes to dealing with people whose
views he does not like.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the volume of the cases and the frequency of his defeats
_ both of which are unprecedented in New York _ have done little
apparent damage to his political standing, though it seems this
case might inflict a bit of harm.
</P>
<P>
   A poll, released Thursday by the Marist College Institute for
Public Opinion, shows a majority _ not just in liberal New York
City but across more conservative regions of the entire state _
disagrees with the mayor's stance on this controversy, and that
many have lowered their opinion of him because of it.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute, to be heard in federal court Friday, involves the
Brooklyn Museum of Art's ``Sensation'' exhibit, which opened to
record crowds last weekend and features several provocative works _
most notoriously, a painting of an African Virgin Mary decorated
with elephant dung.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, Giuliani, calling the painting ``disgusting'' and
``anti-Catholic,'' threatened to cut off city subsidies to the
museum if the exhibit were not cancelled. The museum's directors
refused to cave, and filed a federal lawsuit demanding a return of
the subsidy, citing the first amendment's protection of free
speech.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor's lawyers have argued that the first amendment does
not protect public subsidies of speech, and that, as the museum
resides in a city-owned building, the mayor was entitled to act as
he did.
</P>
<P>
   Several constitutional specialists, including Lawrence Tribe of
Harvard University Law School, contend every applicable US Supreme
Court ruling supports the museum's position.
</P>
<P>
   But some critics see this case as being less about art (which
Giuliani has never fussed over before) or the upcoming Senate race
(for which he needs to solidify the Republican Party's conservative
base), than about Giuliani's sheer discomfort with protest.
</P>
<P>
   Norman Siegel, the longtime director of the New York Civil
Liberties Union, filed his share of lawsuits against two previous
mayors _ Democrats David Dinkins and Edward Koch _ but he sees
Giuliani's regime as a departure.
</P>
<P>
   ``The number of cases against him and the percentage of cases
he's lost are substantially higher than anything before,'' Siegel
said.
</P>
<P>
   The 16 cases that the mayor has lost during his six years in
office involved efforts to block cab drivers from forming a
procession to protest new taxi regulations, to forbid city
officials from speaking publicly about non-confidential matters, to
prevent two ``Million Youth March'' rallies, to prevent Socialist
candidates from collecting petition-signatures in city parks, to
prevent Winter Solstice celebrants from gathering on a city beach,
and to forbid New York Magazine from placing ads satirizing the
mayor on city buses.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were a few cases in the Koch and Dinkins years,'' Siegel
went on, ``but the question was where will they march, for how long
will they speak _ the parameters of the protest. In the Giuliani
years, it's a question of whether there will be a protest. It's
radically different.''
</P>
<P>
   Frederick A. O. Schwarz, a prominent Manhattan attorney, served
as Corporation Counsel _ the city's principal lawyer _ during the
Koch years. A few years ago, he was an ally of Giuliani's in his
one first-amendment victory, involving an attempt by the owners of
``adult-entertainment'' shops to quash a zoning regulation that
evicted them from Times Square and other areas of the city. Schwarz
represented the Times Square Business Improvement District in that
case, and made most of the oral arguments in several courts.
</P>
<P>
   However, on the museum case and many others, Schwarz thinks
Giuliani has gone too far. ``His attitude,'' Schwarz said, ``seems
to be: Do something that's ruthless and possibly popular in the
short term, without any regard that it's inconsistent with his
obligation to uphold the Constitution.''
</P>
<P>
   O. Peter Sherwood, corporation counsel under Dinkins, said, ``I
can't remember any case in which matters that (Dinkins) found
personally offensive resulted in the use of the corporate counsel
to prosecute them.''
</P>
<P>
   Press aides for Giuliani and Michael Hess, the current
corporation counsel, did not return calls asking for comment.
</P>
<P>
   In the Marist poll, just 33 percent agreed with Giuliani's move
to cut off museum funds, while 59 percent opposed it. Even in
upstate New York, 54 percent disagreed with the move. Statewide, 30
percent said their opinion of the mayor declined because of his
position, while 21 percent said it rose. Those having an
``unfavorable'' view of Giuliani climbed to 39 percent _ from 30
percent three weeks ago _ matching the negative ratings of his
likely opponent in the Senate race, First Lady Hillary Rodham
Clinton.

Bilbao a masterwork. Filler, a major Gehry fan, writes that he &LR;  the

   BIRCHTOWN, Nova Scotia _ As a mechanic with the Canadian air
force, Everett S. Cromwell traveled the world. But as a black man
born in Nova Scotia, a wind-blown Atlantic province typically
associated with Gaelic cod fishermen, he recalled, ``I never had a
clue where we actually came from.''
</P>
<P>
   The mystery of his family's past lifted when investigators from
a new provincial black history project showed him the ``Book of
Negroes'' _ a list of African-Americans who had escaped slavery to
fight with the British during the American Revolution. Reviewing
this list, prepared because George Washington demanded British
compensation for lost slaves, he said, ``We discovered that
Cromwells, our ancestors, disembarked here.''
</P>
<P>
   This tiny village, where Cromwell now routinely strolls along a
quiet cove, was once the largest settlement of free blacks outside
of Africa. A boomtown in the late 18th century, it was named after
Samuel Birch, a British general. He issued ``Birch Certificates,''
the prized traveling papers that allowed black men and women to
escape, via New York, to freedom in Nova Scotia.
</P>
<P>
   After two centuries of neglect bordering on denial, Nova Scotia
now is unearthing its black American history. In Halifax, a
250-year-old city dotted with museums celebrating white colonial
history, Nova Scotia Museum researchers recently won a $114,000
federal grant to research black history. A black history slide show
has toured traditionally black communities. ``Loyalties,'' a new
movie on the 18th-century black migration, was on national
television in mid-September.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was collective amnesia, no memory, no stories,'' said
Carmelita Robertson, a museum researcher who brought the slide show
to Tracadie, the historically black community where she was born.
``There was only a very superficial knowledge that people were
slaves, and came up from the states on boats.''
</P>
<P>
   Here in Birchtown, archaeologists have dug into the cellar hole
of Stephen Blucke, a colonel in the ``Black Brigade,'' a British
unit that waged guerrilla war against rebels in New Jersey. Digging
200 yards from Cromwell's house last year, they found a rich trove
of 16,000 artifacts, including Revolutionary War era military
buttons, a shoe buckle and a bayonet.
</P>
<P>
   Nearby, at Shelburne, people of African descent telephone daily
from across Canada, and, increasingly, from the United States, to
register with Teena Paynter, secretary of the Black Loyalist
Heritage Society, a new genealogical project.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Robertson, who has traveled to South Carolina to meet lost
family members, said, ``To find these missing cousins can only
enrich families. For black Americans, they possibly do have
relatives who escaped north during slave times.''
</P>
<P>
   The Book of Negroes, which the Nova Scotia Museum hopes to post
on the Internet soon, is considered a rare and valuable document
for black history. It was produced 80 years before Emancipation in
the United States and contains 2,700 surnames of escaped slaves,
including names, ages, appearances, previous owners and places of
residence. Although the British compiled the lists and rebel
inspectors boarded each ship to verify passenger manifests, the
British never paid the compensation demanded by the man who would
become the first U.S. president.
</P>
<P>
   For people of African origin, about 5 percent of Canada's
population, uncovering the saga of the black loyalists has proved
to be both uplifting and dispiriting. Those who went over to
British lines in the late 1770s were not monarchists, but
freedom-seekers, their descendants say.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they fought the Americans for the British, as far as they
were concerned, they were fighting for their freedom,'' said
Cromwell, a 77-year-old veteran who fought alongside U.S. units in
Europe in World War II.
</P>
<P>
   During the American Revolution, in a strategy they repeated in
the war of 1812, British commanders offered freedom to slaves of
rebel masters who would come over to fight with the British army.
The offer was not valid for slaves of loyalist masters. As a
result, thousands of African-Americans fled slavery, and crossed
over to British lines, where they often worked digging trenches and
building gun emplacements.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In the chaos following the British military collapse, some
officers enriched themselves through betrayal. When
African-Americans got out to the high seas, they found that their
ships were heading south to sugar plantations in the Caribbean,
instead of north to freedom in Nova Scotia.
</P>
<P>
   But at Birch's insistence, about 3,500 free black veterans were
evacuated to Nova Scotia in 1783 and 1784. The policy resulted from
a mix of compassion and realpolitik. Determined to hold on to
Canada, the British populated Nova Scotia with people hostile to
the American Revolution _ decommissioned British soldiers, white
Tories and black loyalists.
</P>
<P>
   On arriving here, freed blacks encountered a wall of racism.
White authorities apparently wanted cheap labor. Within two years,
surveyors had allotted farming plots to virtually all white
arrivals but to fewer than 15 percent of the blacks. White plots
averaged twice the size of the black plots, which were often on
thin, rocky soil distant from town.
</P>
<P>
   Without the promised land, tools, or food rations, desperate
black workers became indentured servants or accepted reduced wage
rates. In 1784, the lowering of wage scales by black laborers
prompted North America's first modern race riot, in Shelburne.
Benjamin Marston, a surveyor, wrote: ``Great riot today. The
disbanded soldiers have risen against the free negroes to drive
them out of town.''
</P>
<P>
   Two winters later, famine hit black communities. In 1788, a
royal adviser visited Birchtown and reported of the black
loyalists: ``Their huts are miserable to guard against the Nova
Scotia winter. I think I never saw such wretchedness and poverty.''
</P>
<P>
   With black communities bitterly calling this cold, rocky
province ``Nova Scarcity,'' residents and church leaders responded
enthusiastically in 1791 to a plan by a London philanthropist to
create a free black colony on the west coast of Africa. In January
1792, 1,196 free blacks set sail from Halifax for Sierra Leone,
where they helped to establish the capital city, now Freetown.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Sierra Leone, they are still called the Nova Scotians,
although they really are African-Americans,'' Joe Opala, an
American anthropologist, said of Freetown's founding families.
Through research into 18th-century shipping records, scholars have
determined that about 50 of those who moved to Freetown were
actually West Africans who had been kidnapped from their villages
for the slave trade.
</P>
<P>
   ``One man had been stolen from the coastal area'' near where
Freetown is now, recalled Opala. ``A few days after he returned on
the British ship, his mother saw him walking down a trail. She
nearly collapsed.''
</P>
<P>
   In modern Nova Scotia, the rediscovery of history has enhanced
the self-esteem of the province's long-isolated black minority of
18,000 people. Still, recognition remains slow. Ms. Robertson says
that, 216 years after her ancestors settled here, white Nova
Scotians still assume she just arrived from the Caribbean, asking,
``what island I am from.''
</P>
<P>
   Here in Birchtown, Elizabeth Cromwell, Everett Cromwell's wife,
was locked in negotiations one recent afternoon with donors for a
proposed black history center.
</P>
<P>
   ``All our history was shut off, as if we never existed,''
Cromwell recalled of growing up black in Nova Scotia. ``We just
want to put ourselves on the map, to show that weren't born on a
rock.''

CHINESE (Washington) - Two officials of the Chinese embassy here
have warned congressional investigators that their probe of the
corporation that owns the Chinese Cultural Center in Phoenix could
damage economic and political ties between the two countries. The
warning was presented at a Capitol Hill meeting last month to
investigators at the House Committee on Government Reform. The
Chinese officials were Shi Jianxin, the embassy's top trade
official, and Ci Bin, the embassy's First Secretary.
</P>
<P>
   Committee Chairman Dan Burton, R-Indiana, on Thursday said the
warning heightened his interest in pursuing the investigation of

the Chinese government. By JERRY KAMMER. Story will move in the

NTSB (Phoenix) - An in-flight accident that injured four America
West flight attendants was caused by a faulty warning system that
had ongoing problems for months that had not been corrected,
according to the NTSB's lead investigator. The federal agency is
looking at why problems persisted with the ground proximity warning
system. The pilots, reacting to a false warning, pulled the nose of
the plane up suddenly and hit maximum thrust, resulting in serious
injuries to two flight attendants and minor injuries to two others.

FORTIER (Phoenix) - So how deeply involved was Kingman, Ariz.'s

   Michael Fortier in the planning for the Oklahoma City bombing?
The government always contended that he was heavily involved since
Timothy McVeigh had detailed his plans to him for the bombing and
Fortier was with McVeigh when he stopped off in Oklahoma City
months before the bombing to case out the Murrah Federal Building.
But there's a school of thought now that Fortier wasn't really
involved at all and that he should be freed from prison now after
serving four years. The thinking is that McVeigh gave weapons to
Fortier for sale not for his help in the bomb plot but to pay back
rent for all the time that McVeigh mooched off him. Fortier may be
released on Friday. By MARK SHAFFER. Story will move in the ``A''

NOWITZKI READY FOR ROUND 2
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DWAIN PRICE 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ If it had been up to Dirk Nowitzki, he would have eased
into his rookie season with the excitement of a snail crawling down
a sidewalk.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, fireworks exploded and trumpets blared because
Mavericks coach/general manager Don Nelson described Nowitzki as a
rookie-of-the-year candidate who could hit the NBA ground running.
</P>
<P>
   However, as many foreign players do during their NBA
indoctrination, Nowitzki looked lost and bewildered at times last
season. He might have been Nelson's hand-picked starter at small
forward for the Mavericks, but Nowitzki felt he was in no way ready
for prime time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, I was kind of thrown into the cold water, but coach
wanted to give me a chance, and I really respect that,'' Nowitzki
said yesterday. ``But maybe I wasn't really ready for that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't really play very good in the training camp. Maybe he
just gave it to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Nelson believes Nowitzki learned from a rookie campaign that saw
him average 8.2 points and 3.4 rebounds, and shoot 40.5 percent
from the field. Plus, the 7-footer from Germany played well during
the Mavericks' summer-league games.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's much more comfortable this year than he was last year,''
Nelson said. ``You can tell he's like a veteran, although he's
still awful young. He knows what he's doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Nelson plans to play Nowitzki at small forward and power
forward, maybe a little at center. He also defended selecting
Nowitzki in last year's draft over an established player such as
Paul Pierce, who wound up starring with the Boston Celtics.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did it because of size more than anything,'' Nelson said.
``We had 6-51/2, 6-6 guys, and we didn't have 7-footers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether you think it was a good move or bad move, you don't
find 7-footers with his skills anywhere. And he's still 21, and
he's loaded with skills.''
</P>
<P>
   Nowitzki is working to improve his defense and rebounding
skills, two of his primary weaknesses last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not saying that he's ever going to be a stopper, but
neither are a lot of other guys out there,'' Nelson said. ``As long
as he tries defensively, that's all we can ask.
</P>
<P>
   ``The team concept kind of carries over. And we'll protect him
as best we can.''
</P>
<P>
   One way to protect Nowitzki is to play him against second-line
players. Indeed, he said he doesn't mind playing second-fiddle to
Cedric Ceballos.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ced is playing very well right now, so if he starts I don't
have a problem with that,'' Nowitzki said. ``He's making his shots,
and he's a great player.''
</P>
<P>
   Nowitzki isnursing a swollen thumb and index finger on his right
shooting hand. But nothing was more bruising than the three games
he did not play last season because of a coach's decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was kind of frustrating, because in Germany there never
was a game where I didn't play at all,'' Nowitzki said. ``But at
those times last year, I didn't play very good in practice, and I
didn't play very good in the games that I got in, so I have to
respect that and just work hard in practice.''
</P>
<P>
   Looking back, the NBA was as foreign to Nowitzki as he was to
the NBA. He didn't know what to expect when he arrived in Dallas,
except that Nelson had already super-hyped him to the public.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know the game at all,'' Nowitzki said. ``I didn't
know a single thing, like illegal defense. I'd never heard of that.
We played zone defenses in Germany, like in college.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I had to learn that in one week, and I didn't really pick
everything up. But now I know everything, so I'll be all right.''
</P>
<P>
   Nelson and the Mavericks are counting on it. / nn

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Coast Guard is investigating whether crew
members aboard the Tropicale cruise ship spoke enough English to
assist passengers when a fire broke out on the ship in the Gulf of
Mexico last month.
</P>
<P>
   Rear Adm. Robert C. North, assistant Coast Guard commandant for
marine safety, told a congressional hearing Thursday that the
agency will ask 300 passengers aboard the Tropicale, owned by
Carnival Cruise Lines, to evaluate the performance of the crew.
</P>
<P>
   The ship, with 1,700 passengers and crew members, was adrift in
the gulf for almost two days after fire disabled the engines on
Sept. 19.
</P>
<P>
   Passengers, who had spent 11 hours at emergency stations,
complained afterward that some crew members did not speak English
well enough to provide safety instructions.
</P>
<P>
   James E. Hall, chairman of the National Transportation Safety
Board, testified that questions about the performance of crew
members have also been raised during an investigation of a fire
aboard another Carnival ship, the Ecstasy, in July 1998 off Miami
Beach.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's congressional hearing was called in response to
concerns about industry regulation after reports about illegal
dumping by cruise ships, sexual assaults on board ships and the two
fires.
</P>
<P>
   North and Hall gave the cruise industry generally high marks for
safety during testimony Thursday before the House Transportation
and Infrastructure Subcommittee on the Coast Guard and Maritime
Transportation.
</P>
<P>
   But worries over the potential losses in a fire at sea have
grown as the size of cruise ships has mushroomed to 3,000
passengers and 1,500 or more crew members. Hall said the Tropicale
and Ecstasy fires should be wake up calls that the industry must do
more in terms of training and fire prevention.
</P>
<P>
   The industry has adopted many fire-safety measures, including
sprinkler systems, smoke detectors, remote operation of fire doors
and improved detection systems. But the safety board said the smoke
detectors on cruise ships are not as effective because they sound
an alarm at a central location, rather than in passenger and crew
accommodations where the smoke is detected.
</P>
<P>
   ``Immediate warning of the presence of smoke is absolutely
essential to escape a fire,'' Hall testified.
</P>
<P>
   Cynthia A. Colenda, president of the International Council of
Cruise Lines, an industry trade group, said crew members were
quickly sent to check on alarms that register at the central
location. She said alarms do not sound in cabins because they are
too often set off by accident, through cigarette smoking or even
hair spray.
</P>
<P>
   But Rep. Peter DeFazio, D-Ore., said he did not understand why
ships could not use the same alarms that are in hotel rooms.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can't tell me that smoke detectors wouldn't work in
cabins, too,'' DeFazio said.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government cannot order installation of the smoke
detectors because the cruise ships serving U.S. ports fly foreign
flags and are regulated by the countries where they are flagged and
the International Maritime Organization. The maritime organization
was expected to debate the necessity of local-sounding alarms at
some point, but the resistance of the cruise companies would make
it difficult to mandate them.
</P>
<P>
   The Coast Guard regularly inspects foreign-flagged ships that
sail in and out of U.S. ports, including monitoring fire drills.
But the government's jurisdiction over the industry is limited. For
instance, the safety board cannot investigate accidents that occur
outside U.S. territorial waters and crew qualifications are often
determined by unmonitored schools in foreign countries.
</P>
<P>
   DeFazio said he had seen evidence that training schools in
countries like the Philippines are shams that sell the
certifications necessary for getting a job on a cruise ship.
</P>
<P>
   ``That gives me zero confidence,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Colenda countered that the cruise lines inspect the
schools and that the Coast Guard observes crew performance during
on-board inspections. She said the trade association also operates
two schools in Florida to train crewmembers in firefighting.

LONGHORNS FACE MUST-WIN GAME
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Facing the prospect of falling two games
behind Oklahoma in the Big 12 South Division standings makes
tomorrow's meeting ``even bigger than normal'' for Texas coaches
and players, said Longhorns defensive tackle Casey Hampton.
</P>
<P>
   Texas (4-2, 1-1) trails Oklahoma (3-1, 1-0) by one-half game in
the division standings after last week's 35-17 loss to Kansas
State. The 23rd-ranked Longhorns also are a half-game behind Texas
Tech (2-2, 1-0), the only other South Division team without a
conference loss.
</P>
<P>
   A loss to Oklahoma would severely damage Texas' chances for
advancing to the Big 12 title game. But a victory, coupled with an
Oklahoma State triumph against Texas Tech tomorrow night, would put
the Longhorns atop the South Division standings. That makes this
Red River Shootout more pivotal than just another battle for
bragging rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``Losing two games in the conference race is not very good for
any team,'' Hampton said. ``There are a lot of good teams in the
South, and we need this victory a lot. That makes this game even
bigger than normal.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas coach Mack Brown agreed that more is riding on this game
than in 1998, when the Longhorns pounded the Sooners, 34-3.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our expectations are higher than they were last year at this
time,'' Brown said. ``We wanted to be a Top 10 football team today,
and we're not. We want to win the Big 12 South. We need to beat the
other people in the South to make that happen.'' \Nsubheds:Self
corrections A focus during Texas' workouts this week is reducing
penalties. The Longhorns were flagged eight times for 48 yards
against Kansas State, with four of them in crucial situations. The
offense had three false starts on third down. An offside penalty
wiped out a blocked punt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stupid stuff like that, there's no excuse for that,'' wide
receiver Ryan Nunez said.
</P>
<P>
   Linebacker Anthony Hicks agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, there is a sense of urgency that we need to correct
our problems,'' Hicks said. ``We need to check that our i's are
dotted and that our t's are crossed in order to make sure it's a
good game.'' \Nsubheds:Secondary stress test Texas defensive backs,
who have shuffled three positions because of injuries since the
season opener, are wary of facing an Oklahoma team that averages
341.8 passing yards per game.
</P>
<P>
   The Longhorns lost their top two free safeties, Quentin Jammer
and Chris Butcher, to season-ending injuries Aug. 28 against North
Carolina State. Cornerback Joe Walker has been limited in recent
weeks with a sprained ankle and might not play against Oklahoma.
Yet Texas ranks sixth nationally in pass defense.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there are concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still don't know, with all the personnel changes, if we feel
we can trust each other back there,'' cornerback Ahmad Brooks said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be an eye opener for us,'' free safety Lee
Jackson said. \Nsubheds:Home at last After struggling with his
football identity for three years, Oklahoma senior Brandon Daniels
is smiling, for a change.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy. Everything's positive here,'' Daniels said. ``This
offense allows me to do a lot of different things.''
</P>
<P>
   Daniels has settled in as the Sooners' slotback in coordinator
Mike Leach's new offense after various roles the past three seasons
as a receiver, a defensive back and a quarterback in an option
scheme under former coach John Blake.
</P>
<P>
   He ranks fourth in the Big 12 in receptions (13), sixth in
receiving yards per game (62) and is second nationally with a
40.83-yard kickoff return average following last week's 229-yard
performance against Notre Dame. He scored on an 89-yard return and
set up touchdowns with returns of 68 and 43 yards. He also caught
two passes for 29 yards, including a 15-yard touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the best game I've had in four years,'' Daniels said.
``But I'd trade all of it if we had won.''

OU KEEPING QUIET ABOUT ITS DEFENSIVE PLANS
</HEADLINE>

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NORMAN, Okla. _ Considering the way Kansas State's aggressive
defensive attack hampered Texas quarterback Major Applewhite last
week, the popular assumption is that the word ``blitz'' dominated
Oklahoma's defensive meetings this week.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it did. Then again, maybe it didn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to bring 'em and we'll drop off,'' Sooners
weakside linebacker Rocky Calmus said of his team's approach for
Texas. ``We're going to act like we're going to bring 'em ... keep
them guessing on every single play. Not just do one thing and let
them know what we're doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Oklahoma defensive coordinator Mike Stoops, who coordinated
K-State's defense last season, is mindful of the role the Wildcats'
blitz package played against Texas in helping force five sacks,
three interceptions and three fumble recoveries in the 35-17
victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``K-State blitzed the hell out of them, that's pretty obvious,''
Stoops said. ``But I'm sure Texas will be well-prepared \Rfor the
blitz\S this week.''
</P>
<P>
   Stoops said not to expect the Sooners to blitz all afternoon in
an effort to harass Applewhite.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kansas State's style is a little more aggressive than how we
play,'' he said. ``We're a little more conservative, a little more
straight-forward. We play a little more zone \Rpass\S coverage.
What we've got to do is be able to stop the run.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sooners are a little sensitive about their effort in run
defense against Notre Dame last week. The Irish gained 284 yards
rushing. Tailback Tony Fisher ran for 140 yards and quarterback
Jarious Jackson added 107, most on scrambles.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll have a great chance to win if we stop the run against
Texas,'' Stoops said.
</P>
<P>
   The good news, Calmus said, is that Applewhite is no Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the fact that Major isn't really a running threat,''
Calmus said. ``He's a little smaller and a little slower \Rthan the
235-pound Jackson\S, so we can concentrate on our pass drops _ but
the first thing is to stop the run. \RTexas\S has been having a
little trouble with the run, and I know they're going to come out
and try to establish it early. We need to make them start
throwing.''
</P>
<P>
   Middle linebacker Torrance Marshall, a transfer who along with
Calmus and safety Rodney Rideau are the heart of OU's defense,
cautions that too much concentration on the Longhorns' running game
can be dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   ``They like play-action,'' he pointed out. ``So we need to
prepare for that.''
</P>
<P>
   Stoops said the bottom line is that the Sooners need to play
better tomorrow than they did last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll have a chance against Texas if we play better defense,''
Stoops said. ``The sad part of it is, we had a chance \Ragainst
Notre Dame\S and played terrible. Couldn't get off the field and
still had a chance to win.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We really only played about 35 minutes,'' Calmus said. ``We've
got to finish against Texas.''

HOUSE APPROVES PROTECTIONS FOR HMO CONSUMERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Breaking a decade-long stalemate, the House
approved Thursday the most sweeping plan to expand federal
protections for medical consumers since the advent of health
maintenance organizations a generation ago.
</P>
<P>
   In defying Republican leaders and passing the overhaul measure,
275-151, the House endorsed granting 161 million members of the
nation's health plans the right for the first time to sue their
providers for deaths and injuries resulting from poor care or
denied treatment.
</P>
<P>
   The measure, a major blow to the insurance industry, will become
the centerpiece of negotiations as House, Senate and White House
representatives craft a final package of patient protections. A
renegade bloc of 68 Republicans rebuffed their leaders and joined
the nearly united Democratic minority to pass the bill.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, traveling in New York, echoed groups
representing doctors and patients as he hailed the measure's
passage and urged GOP leaders in Congress not to derail the
proposed overhaul during the final negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It shows that America is no longer willing to allow unfeeling
practices of some health plans to add to the pain of injury or
disease,'' Clinton said. ``It proves that America is committed to
putting patients first.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the measure's future remains highly uncertain, as House
Republican leaders indicated they will continue to try to block the
provision they consider most onerous: the right to sue.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have created a system that is going to result in the
extortion of dollars from every employer in this country,'' said
Representative Tom A. Coburn, an Oklahoma Republican who sponsored
an alternative measure that GOP leaders hoped would prevail over
the more comprehensive overhaul. The alternative plan was rejected,
238-193.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate poses another obstacle to the House measure because
the Senate passed a weaker version of a patients' rights bill that
would cover only about 48 million consumers who are not enrolled in
HMOs.
</P>
<P>
   Yet key Senate backers of the House version, citing the 68
Republicans who supported the measure, predicted they would
overcome resistance and keep the legislation largely intact.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a well-deserved defeat for the Republican extremists
in the House and their attempt to protect the profits of HMOs at
the expense of the patients' health,'' said Senator Edward M.
Kennedy. ``I'm convinced we will get a strong bill out of the
conference. A weak bill won't pass the House, and the president
won't sign one.''
</P>
<P>
   The House measure, addressing some of the most common complaints
aired by consumers in managed care programs, would guarantee access
to reasonable emergency care, permit patients to see pediatricians
and obstetricians without prior approval from their primary
doctors, and require routine care associated with clinical trials.
</P>
<P>
   Patients who are denied care or receive poor care could sue in
state courts after exhausting appeals in an independent review
process. Despite vehement objections from business and insurance
interests, there would be no limit on the amount of damages an
individual could receive.
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker J. Dennis Hastert, taking up the business leaders'
cause, appealed for less stringent regulations. ``We do not force
people to sue their way to better health care,'' Hastert said on
the House floor. ``We do not provide windfalls for the trial
lawyers.''
</P>
<P>
   But each of three alternative measures that would have killed
the broader bill was defeated, as wary Republicans deserted Hastert
on an issue that could have potentially potent repercussions in
next year's elections.
</P>
<P>
   Horror stories abounded in the final hours of debate, as
supporters of the broadest overhaul measure recounted episodes in
which patients had died or suffered severe injuries because of
alleged abuses by health plans.
</P>
<P>
   In a striking scene, 7-year-old James Adams of Atlanta, who lost
his arms and legs to gangrene after his health plan required his
parents to drive him 70 miles to an emergency room with a high
fever, sat in the front row of the House chamber.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he had a finger and you pricked it, it would bleed,'' said
Representative Greg Ganske, a physician and Iowa Republican who
helped pressure GOP leaders to permit a vote on the overhaul bill.
``He's not an anecdote.''
</P>
<P>
   Every New England Democrat voted for the measure. The only
Republican from the region to support it was Representative
Christopher Shays of Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   The prime Republican sponsor of the measure, Representative
Charlie Norwood of Georgia, a physician and Vietnam veteran,
compared his long struggle against GOP leaders to pass the bill to
one of the toughest battles of the Vietnam War.
</P>
<P>
   Moments before the final vote, Norwood said on the House floor,
``It's all been said and it's all been done, and what we need to do
now is mount the top of Hamburger Hill.''
</P>
<P>
   Kicking off a news conference afterward, Norwood said, ``Ladies
and gentleman, we are now on top of Hamburger Hill.''
</P>
<P>
   But he predicted the Republican leaders would continue to try to
stymie him during the final negotiations. ``It may be a bloody war
in conference to try to get this thing right,'' he said.

 &HT;    Up-and-comer Kenseth turning heads
 &HT;    By Michael Carvell
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ When the subject of Matt Kenseth is brought up, NASCAR
veteran Mark Martin is unable to conceal a smile. Martin often gets
a little giddy when talking about his future teammate at Roush
Racing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Matt is going to be... the next Tony Stewart in Winston Cup
racing,'' says Martin, who is sparing with praise. ``Not everybody
has ability like (Kenseth). He is gonna be big.''
</P>
<P>
   Kenseth already is well known in Busch Grand National racing,
where he is in a close battle with Dale Earnhardt Jr. for the
series title for the second year in a row.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Kenseth also has begun establishing himself in
Winston Cup, while running a limited five-race schedule. The
27-year-old driver from Cambridge, Wis., has a pair of top-15
finishes in three races and will run in two more _ Sunday's UAW-GM
Quality 500 at Lowe's Motor Speedway and the Rockingham 400 on Oct.
24.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how I'm going to do (this weekend),'' said
Kenseth, who qualified 27th. ``I'm a little worried about
Charlotte, (N.C.) because I have never been there in a Winston Cup
car.''
</P>
<P>
   Lack of experience didn't keep Kenseth from turning heads at
Dover Downs two weeks ago. He finished fourth at The Monster Mile,
trailing Martin, rookie sensation Stewart and points leader Dale
Jarrett.
</P>
<P>
   In the garage area after the race, Jarrett was one of several
drivers who sought out Kenseth to offer congratulations. Martin
paid his respects to the youngster from the winner's circle.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, I'm just glad to get this win because I don't know
how many more of them I'm gonna be able to get with (Kenseth) out
there,'' Martin said. ``He's spectacular.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin has taken a keen interest in Kenseth, and was responsible
for landing the promising rookie for multicar owner Jack Roush.
Martin teams with Jeff Burton, while Kenseth will be paired with
Chad Little next season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Matt has got great instincts for being a race-car driver,''
Roush said. ``He attracted the attention of Mark Martin for having
the 'right stuff' and having a thought process that was good.''
</P>
<P>
   Kenseth peaked at Dover Downs but also had a strong 14th-place
showing at the second Michigan race. He was running among the
leaders at Darlington before being involved in a wreck and placing
37th.
</P>
<P>
   With so many race teams still looking for drivers for next year,
Kenseth knows he could have gotten a more lucrative deal if he
hadn't signed already with Roush. He doesn't care.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not driven by money,'' Kenseth said. ``I'm driven by
winning races. Mark Martin told me that winning races was what
Roush Racing was all about. I trust in Mark, and believe in
everything he has told me.''
</P>
<P>
   Kenseth met his mentor for the first time at a drivers meeting
at the second Talledega race of 1997. Martin walked right up to the
wide-eyed Kenseth and introduced himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``The following Monday he called and said he wanted to get me
signed up with Roush and wanted to try to do something for the
future to help my path to Winston Cup progress a little faster than
it would without (his) help,'' Kenseth recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Kenseth initially targeted the 1999 season as his transition to
Winston Cup. However, after talking it over with Martin, Roush and
others, Kenseth agreed to do another tour of duty in a Grand
National car.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my heart, I knew I needed another year (of Busch
experience), but you can never get somewhere too fast, I don't
think,'' Kenseth said. ``You do need experience, but in my mind I
always want to do it now. I'm not a very patient person.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the impatience, Kenseth has flourished with another full
year on the Busch circuit. In 27 races, Kenseth has four victories,
13 finishes in the top five, and 17 in the top 10. He is second in
the points standings, trailing best friend Earnhardt by 113 points
with five remaining races, including Saturday's All Pro Bumper to
Bumper 300 at Lowe's Motor Speedway.

COMMENTARY: RIDING TWO TRACKS
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By A.M. ROSENTHAL  
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In New York over the past few days, two major opponents in
Israeli political life separately raised somber and fundamentally
identical questions about the problems of achieving peace between
Israel and the Arabs.
</P>
<P>
   The two men, who spoke before different audiences at different
times, were David Levy, now foreign minister under Prime Minister
Ehud Barak, and Ariel Sharon, leader of the Likud opposition.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If Barak publicly gives those questions the same emphasis, the
possibility of a permanent peace would become somewhat more
realistic. If he does not, or if the United States does not agree
they are critically important, the best that can be hoped for in
the Israel-Palestine talks would be an interim before another war.
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Paraphrased, the questions Levy and Sharon raised separately
are:  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What do the Arabs mean by peace? Does it include continuing
pressure on Israel, continuing opposition to borders safe for
Israel, continuing to break promises for hate control _ in
propaganda and in schools?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When will the Palestinian Authority reduce its army, as
promised, give up specified weapons as promised? Can Israel afford
to sign a final settlement before the Palestinians carry out every
promise they have already broken? That would be no guarantee for
the future, but it would provide the hopeful some confidence. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   True, Israelis make promise-breaking easy. At the Wye conference
last year, the Netanyahu government and the Palestinians agreed to
reciprocity of concession. A step-by-step timetable was created _
terrorism control tied to land concessions, for instance. That
timetable seems to have disappeared; zip, like that.
</P>
<P>
   The questions are not new; most have existed unanswered for
almost a decade, all through Israeli-Palestinian negotiations. That
makes them more and more important, not less.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What is very new and very important is that Levy chose to talk
about them, in New York, at a time when the United Nations was
smacking Israel with its usual package of insult, including a
Palestinian delegate's reference to Barak as a provocateur making
``crazy'' decisions. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Levy is sure the prime minister believes in the importance of
the questions his foreign minister was asking. But Barak has not
given the questions the public attention they need in Israel and
abroad. There's still time.
</P>
<P>
   In the world press, Sharon comes out as a Jewish Patton lusting
for war. But the truth is he is devoted to protecting the Israeli
nest, not flooding it with blood by seeking war. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Levy, once a Likud leader himself, is portrayed as a heavy,
mumbly type _ maybe because he has neglected to learn English well
enough to put himself across to journalists who have neglected to
learn Hebrew.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This is the key to the foreign minister: He longs for peace but
will not accept the two-track system.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On track one, Israel makes serial concessions. Track two: Arabs
keep threatening boycott and violence if they are annoyed by
Israel.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Meantime, with the help of member nations, Arabs make the United
Nations their personal anti-Israeli propaganda machine _ a special
committee and a special U.N. bureaucratic department for the
Palestinian cause, and tons of resolutions passed to demean Israel.
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I believe the United States should remove the shame of being
behind in dues. Maybe U.N. members could save a few dollars by
eliminating that nasty Palestinian apparatus. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What the United Nations gives Israel is a ghetto. Dore Gold,
leaving soon after a tour as one of the best U.N. representatives
Israel ever had, points out that membership in regional groups is a
requirement for nomination to the Security Council.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Mideastern nations won't allow Israel into their group.
Normally countries outside regional groups because of politics or
geography are taken in by others. Australia and Canada are in the
European group, and served on the Security Council. But every year
the Europeans blackball Israel, leaving it alone in its ghetto. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Richard Holbrooke, the new U.S. delegate to the United Nations,
is trying his best to break down the European walls for Israel.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It will be difficult for the Arabs to break the Israeli passion
to achieve peace. But if they keep riding that track of insult and
threat at the United Nations, who knows, they may accomplish it.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Can you teach an old bull new tricks?
</P>
<P>
   Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co., the world's largest brokerage firm, is
about to find out, as it introduces a set of online services
intended to transform its buttoned-down brokerage business into a
force in electronic commerce. The digital version of Merrill Lynch
wants to sell not just stocks and bonds, but steaks and bonbons,
too.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, Merrill has added online shopping and auctions
to its portfolio of World Wide Web sites and the firm's executives
have started using cyberspeak to describe a grand plan that sounds
more like Amazon.com than Charles Schwab, the leading online
brokerage firm. Merrill Lynch wants to manage ``the total financial
relationship'' with its customers, not just their investments, said
John L. Steffens, a vice chairman who heads Merrill's brokerage
business.
</P>
<P>
   If Steffens has his way, Merrill's clients will band together
and use their enormous buying power to extract the best prices from
hundreds of merchants for everything from champagne to diamond
rings to office supplies. They will pay for all those purchases
with their Merrill Lynch Visa debit cards and receive rebates in
the form of points they can use toward other purchases, air travel
or for discounts on brokerage services.
</P>
<P>
   ``We began to think of our clients as a community and this is
their community membership card,'' Steffens said, slipping his own
Signature Visa card out of his wallet and flashing it across the
table in a San Francisco restaurant. Merrill account-holders will
purchase about $7 billion in goods and services with their Merrill
Visa cards this year, Steffens said, and, he told the firm's
brokers last week, he believes that total could rise to $100
billion annually within six years.
</P>
<P>
   All this e-commerce talk comes less than two months before
Merrill is scheduled to begin its long-anticipated leap into
low-cost online trading, a risky move down-market that has created
friction within the ranks of Merrill's 14,800 brokers and worries
among the firm's shareholders. Many of them fear that Merrill will
cannibalize its existing brokerage business by inviting customers
and noncustomers alike to make trades for just $29.95 each, the
same price that Schwab charges.
</P>
<P>
   In preparation for a Dec. 1 kickoff, Merrill has teams of
technology specialists at two sites in central New Jersey and
another in Cambridge, Mass., tuning up and testing the
online-trading service, which it is calling Merrill Lynch Direct.
The new service will allow Merrill customers and others to set up
online accounts, log in and trade stocks, bonds, mutual funds and,
eventually, more exotic securities like stock options. In the
current model, one screen contains a column of buttons that users
can click for up-to-date summaries of all of their accounts or to
search across them for holdings of a particular stock.
</P>
<P>
   Add up all these changes and you get a big, blurry picture of
what customers will get from Merrill in the future, observers say.
``Is Merrill trying to become an electronic-commerce company or are
they still a financial-services conglomerate with a hefty focus on
brokerage?'' asked Henry McVey, an analyst at Morgan Stanley Dean
Witter &AMP; Co. ``That's unclear. To date, what we've seen is more of
a shotgun approach to the Internet, including free research,
e-shopping and online trading.''
</P>
<P>
   Steffens replies that ``I didn't have a change of heart'' about
incorporating new technology into Merrill's brokerage operation.
But he clearly is reading from a different playbook this year than
last, when he made an embarrassing public remark about how online
trading could be ``hazardous'' to investors' financial health.
</P>
<P>
   That view was consistent with Merrill's frequent pronouncements
that individual investors should stick to a disciplined investment
strategy and not get caught up in the day-to-day market frenzy. But
it was received as evidence that traditional brokerage firms were
ignorant of the changing needs of investors, who clearly have
embraced online trading.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Merrill is engaged in a difficult balancing act: The firm
wants to be able to claim that it offers everything an active
trader needs while generally discouraging active trading.
</P>
<P>
   What Merrill wants from its customers is clear: more of their
assets. The firm is the repository of about $1.5 trillion of assets
belonging to about 5 million clients. The assets at Merrill have
grown more than 15 percent annually this decade, McVey said, but
that growth rate pales when compared with rival Schwab's pace of
almost 40 percent a year. Schwab, based in San Francisco, has been
taking in more than $25 billion of new money from customers every
three months and losing a lot less to traditional brokers than
Merrill had once predicted.
</P>
<P>
   ``There certainly has been some graduation process,'' said Guy
Moszkowski, an analyst at Citigroup's Salomon Smith Barney unit.
``But Schwab wants to hang onto those people. Now, Merrill's
saying, `We've got to have them in-house earlier.''' The typical
Merrill customer has been getting younger and wealthier, but not
fast enough for the firm's taste. Many baby boomers are comfortable
enough with technology and distrustful enough of stockbrokers'
motives to go it alone or with the occasional help from firms that
don't have armies of commission-hungry brokers.
</P>
<P>
   Merrill is rolling out a raft of new services to attract those
investors.

HALL OF FAME IS FIRST HEADLINER AT RETAMA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TIM PRICE 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Almost every successful horse track has an event of some renown.
Churchill Downs has the Kentucky Derby. Oaklawn Park takes a full
week to present its Racing Festival of the South.
</P>
<P>
   Even a place like Penn National gets into the action. The
quality of the horses doesn't add up to much there, so the track's
front office lets the spotlight shine on the player with the annual
World Series of Handicapping.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't take long for Lone Star Park at Grand Prairie to find
its headliner event. Not to take anything away from either the
Texas Mile/Lone Star Park Derby or Lone Star Millions Day, but the
All-Star Jockey Championship became the track's top event
immediately upon the track's grand opening three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Success hasn't come as quickly at Sam Houston Race Park, but
that track has done an excellent job in building Texas Champions
Day into a fun day of competitive, memorable racing.
</P>
<P>
   Now it looks as if Retama Park near San Antonio has come up with
something. The new Texas Horse Racing Hall of Fame is the event
where the track can hang its hat.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we don't want to play this thing as something for Retama
Park,'' said Retama chairman Joe Straus Jr. ``It so happens that
it's located at Retama Park, but we want everyone to have a say in
how this thing is going to be run.''
</P>
<P>
   Among anyone who sits in the front offices at any of the Texas
racetracks, no one is as mindful of Texas' spot in racing history
as Straus or his brother David. As he sits in his office, Joe
Straus Jr. can look at a picture of his grandfather D.J. Straus,
who was a director of the horse racing meet at the San Antonio
International Fair Association in 1908.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's in a picture of the winner's circle, in front of the
grandstand full of people,'' Straus said.
</P>
<P>
   Hopefully, the Hall of Fame will pack the stands. The first
induction class will be honored in a ceremony tonight at Retama.
</P>
<P>
   There possibly isn't a stronger inaugural class of inductees,
respectful of both the thoroughbred and quarter horse industries.
There's 1946 Triple Crown winner Assault, leading quarter-horse
sire Dash For Cash, legendary race mare Pan Zareta, the late Robert
Kleberg Jr. of the King Ranch, the late B.F. Phillips Jr., who
spearheaded the effort to bring racing back to Texas, and all-time
leading jockey Bill Shoemaker.
</P>
<P>
   In conjunction with the proceedings Saturday at Retama, there
will be three races, each with purses exceeding $100,000.
</P>
<P>
   So the foundation has been set. There are two ways to make this
thing grow.
</P>
<P>
   One could take a while _ have an actual Hall-of-Fame building
constructed on the grounds at Retama. Straus said there's $100,000
in the bank for that so far, but much more is needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea would be to have a museum of not only the recipients
\Rof the Hall of Fame induction\S, but also memorabilia and
pictures and something you could bring the kids to so you could get
them interested in horse racing,'' Straus said.
</P>
<P>
   But there's one step that could be taken immediately. A kiosk
could be assembled and moved between the tracks to showcase this
state's racing history. Ballots for racing fans to nominate the
next class of inductees could be a part of the exhibit.
</P>
<P>
   As Straus says, that would allow ``everyone to have a say.''
PAN ZARETA STATUE
</P>
<P>
   Pan Zareta, who raced 151 times from 1912 to 1917, is a member
of the National Horse Racing Hall of Fame and will be inducted into
the new Texas Horse Racing Hall of Fame tonight at Retama Park. But
there's a move to have her honored near her birthplace in
Sweetwater.
</P>
<P>
   Sweetwater native Mel Harp is hoping to raise enough funds to
have a statue erected in that town. He can be reached by calling
(806) 745-8005 or by e-mail at LubbBuff &LR; aol.com
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's one of the best racehorses ever _ and that's agreed
upon _ and there's nothing in Sweetwater to honor her,'' Harp said.
</P>
<P>
   Harp said Robert Taylor has agreed to build the statue. Taylor
also sculpted the statue of the bear and the bull that stands in
front of the Chicago Board of Trade and the eagle clutching the
globe at the EDS headquarters in Dallas. LUKAS BUYS QUARTER
</P>
<P>
   Just a day after he won a quarter-horse stakes race for the
first time in 20 years, D. Wayne Lukas spent $315,000 on a Raise A
Secret yearling that topped the Pacific Coast Quarter Horse Racing
Association sale Sunday in Orange County, Calif. The previous day,
Worth A Look (Lukas trains and owns the horse with wife Laura) won
the $301,000 PCQHRA Breeders' Futurity.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very special victory because of what it means to my
wife,'' Lukas said. ``She handles our entire quarter-horse
operation on an everyday basis. I get a lot of enjoyment from the
sport, but I'm just a prop.'' CUP PREP FRENZY
</P>
<P>
   The next two weekends mark the final chances for serious prep
races heading into Breeders' Cup championship day, Nov. 6 at
Gulfstream Park. Keeneland opens tomorrow, and Joe Who is expected
to race in the $400,000 Shadwell Keeneland Turf Mile. Joe Who,
winner of the Eddie Read Handicap on the turf at Del Mar this
summer, is owned by Jim Helzer of Mansfield.
</P>
<P>
   Other racing action this weekend centers on the Oak Leaf Stakes
at Santa Anita on Saturday (undefeated 2-year-old filly Chilukki
races), and Belmont Park's Jockey Club Gold Cup (Behrens, owned by
Waco resident Bill Clifton, is favored) and the Beldame Stakes
(Silverbulletday is favored) on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   HORSES MORE THAN A HOBBY FOR LATEST NFL TEAM OWNER
</P>
<P>
   Bob McNair bid $700 million to convince the NFL to put a team in
Houston. Although it's uncertain how much of that actually will
come from McNair since he's still attracting investment partners,
this much we do know:
</P>
<P>
   His star filly can walk out onto the racetrack any day and win
some of his money back. That filly is Chilukki, who likely will be
one of the favorites to win the $1 million Breeders' Cup Juvenile
Fillies on Nov. 6 at Gulfstream Park.
</P>
<P>
   She'll definitely be the favorite if she wins the Oak Leaf
Stakes tomorrow at Santa Anita.
</P>
<P>
   Those who know McNair, whose horses run under the ownership name
of Stonerside Stables, believe he will stay heavily involved in
horse racing even while serving as managing partner with the new
Houston football team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the more he's in horse racing, the more he likes it,''
said Kentucky-based breeder Arthur Hancock III, who sold a yearling
colt in partnership with McNair for $4 million last year.
</P>
<P>
   McNair, who also was a co-owner of 1997 Belmont champ Touch Gold
when he foiled Silver Charm's bid for the Triple Crown, funded much
of his bid for the NFL team by selling three power plants he held
an ownership in for $1 billion last year.
JOIN THE FRATERNITY
</P>
<P>
   Houston businessman Bob McNair won the bid for an NFL expansion
team Wednesday. He's not the only person to own a professional
sports team and prominent racehorses at the same time. Owner Pro

 NEW YORK: those investors. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Easily the most important of those changes _ despite all the
attention Merrill's decision to offer online trading has garnered _
is the current push to convert most customers to a fee-based
account Merrill calls Unlimited Advantage. For a prearranged cut of
their assets, Merrill will offer account holders access to all of
its online services, including research by its own analysts and
from Standard &AMP; Poor's Corp. And those customers will be able to
make as many trades as they want, either electronically or through
a broker.
</P>
<P>
   One person close to Merrill's top management said he thinks the
impending rollout of online trading ``is the biggest nonevent
around.'' Other aspects of its new strategy, including using
technology to expand the firm's base of institutional clients and
shifting away from a reliance on commissions, are more critical to
Merrill's ability to compete as an independent firm amid a
consolidating industry, he said.
</P>
<P>
   More than anything else Merrill is attempting, the switch to
fee-based accounts augurs a transformation in the relationship
between the firm's brokers and their clients. For years, Merrill
has been pushing its brokers to shift more customers away from
paying commissions for every transaction to paying an annual fee
based on a small percentage of total assets. But many brokers
balked because they felt they had more control of their own
earnings in a commission-based system. Only about five percent of
Merrill's clients assets are in fee-based accounts.
</P>
<P>
   What were once mere encouragements is now turning into
ultimatums. Steffens and other Merrill executives routinely refer
to the impending extinction of brokers who don't adopt the new
approach. They laud Unlimited Advantage for aligning the brokers'
interests with the clients' interest, taking away much of the
incentive to induce clients to make excessive and unwanted trades,
a practice known as churning.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of clients who will actually look at this
account as favorable because it minimizes the potential for
churning,'' said Moszkowski, the Salomon Smith Barney analyst. But
it also takes away some of the brokers' motivation to interact with
clients. Once a client's assets are in-house and producing a fee,
the broker's attention naturally will turn to gathering more from
somebody else.
</P>
<P>
   Moszkowski predicted that many Merrill customers, contrary to
brokers' fears, will end up paying more in fees than they
previously paid in commissions. Steffens said that is already
happening. He told brokers last week that 55 percent of the new
accounts are yielding more per dollar to the firm than it gets on
the typical transaction-based account.
</P>
<P>
   On average, Merrill keeps about 77 cents annually of every $100
invested at the firm. That cut has been sliding for decades,
Steffens said in an interview after giving a pep talk at a
technology conference last week in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   To illustrate Merrill's predicament, Steffens drew a large X on
a napkin. The downward sloping line represented the decline of
Merrill's cut of the assets from 1.5 percent in 1985; the other
line depicted the rapid growth in assets from $188 billion in 1985
to its current $1.5 trillion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been in a price decline for years,'' Steffens said.
Brokers concerned about the firm's latest price cut, he argued,
should focus instead on helping Merrill continue to make it up on
volume.
</P>
<P>
   One veteran Merrill broker said he is resigned to earning 30
percent less from clients with more than $1 million in their
accounts. To make up the difference, he said, he will have to spend
more time prospecting and less time cultivating existing clients.
</P>
<P>
   Some brokers are not so accepting, though. Merrill admits that
more brokers are defecting to rival firms this year, an increase it
pegs at about 10 percent over a normal year. Others are grousing
about what they think is a too-aggressive swing the firm has made
to compete with cut-rate competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Steffens shrugged off those reactions: ``As you make changes in
a business and a business model, lots of people would like to go
back to the way things were.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the ironies of Merrill's new approach is that it goes
much farther afield than Schwab has. Long seen as an innovator
among leading brokerage firms, Schwab has no plan to branch out
into electronic commerce beyond its core financial-services
businesses, said Daniel Leemon, a vice president who maps strategy
for Schwab.
</P>
<P>
   ``What customers on the Web don't need these days is to be
inundated with offers,'' Leemon said. ``We think that begins to
dilute what the brand means to people. I don't think anyone wants
to come to Schwab for an auction of their Beanie Babies.''
</P>
<P>
   But Merrill executives are resolute about the important role thecan play in helping customers, including about 450,000 small
businesses, manage their daily finances. Customers care as much
about saving money on their regular purchases as earning money on
their investments, said Randal Langdon, who oversees Merrill's
e-commerce operations.
</P>
<P>
   Langdon, once a top Merrill broker, beamed like a new father the
other day as he demonstrated how Merrill's new shopping website
could track down a copy of a children's book by Harry Potter for
just $2.99. ``That's $20 retail,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Merrill already is arranging discounts for business owners on
office supplies, and helping them auction off excess inventory over
the Internet. Steffens said Merrill will consider brokering group
purchases of other things business owners need, such as insurance.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're trying to do is basically build more complete
banking capabilities, so they keep bigger balances with us,''
Steffens said. ``This is not about selling books and airline
tickets; it's about building relationships.''

<P>
   TIANJIN, China _ The Chinese gymnasts competing in the 1999
World Gymnastics Championships are aware of what a home-field
advantage can mean.
</P>
<P>
   All they need as evidence is the women's team competition at the
1996 Olympic Games. In Atlanta, the U.S. women won the team gold
against a Russian squad they could not defeat at a neutral site.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese gymnasts and coaches have expressed confidence that
they'll dominate the medal standings at this year's World
Championships, which begin Saturday and run through Oct. 16 in
Tianjin.
</P>
<P>
   More than medals are at stake, however. This year's meet serves
as the team qualifier to the 2000 Olympic Games. The top 12 men's
and women's teams in Tianjin earn the right to compete in Sydney,
Australia, next September.
</P>
<P>
   The 1999 championship also presents the last chance before
Sydney for countries and gymnastics judges to see most, if not
quite all, of the top Olympic contenders at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's going to be a lot of drama. Everyone's going to try to
put their 2 cents in,'' U.S. men's gymnast Blaine Wilson said.
``Everyone wants to look good.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. teams obviously want to look better than they did at
the previous World Championships in 1997, when both the men and
women made poor showings. The women plummeted to sixth only a year
after winning the Olympic team gold, and the men barely qualified
for the six-country team finals before finishing fifth.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. men seem likely to repeat that performance in China, as
they will be without rising star Jason Gatson, who suffered torn
knee ligaments at the U.S. Championships in August. Wilson will be
joined on the team by 1996 Olympian John Roethlisberger, Dallas
native Sean Townsend, Yewki Tomita, Chris Young, Steve McCain and
alternate Jay Thornton.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. women's team appears stronger than the 1997 squad, and
is probably in the running for fourth place in China. This team
will include top gymnasts who couldn't compete in 1997 because of
the meet's age limit of 16, including Elise Ray, Jamie Dantzscher
and Vanessa Atler. Back from 1997 are current U.S. champion Kristen
Maloney, Wichita Falls native Jennie Thompson and Jeanette Antolin.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. women's team will have a difficult time defeating the
likes of Romania, Russia, China, despite the fact that Romania and
China have lost their top all-around performers to injury. But the
U.S. women should have no trouble making the team finals, and the
17-year-old Atler could win titles on floor and vault and has an
outside chance at an all-around medal. nn

 &HT;    Bomb incidents investigated in N.C.
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach and Michael Carvell
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CONCORD, N.C. _ The parents of a man killed in a crash at Lowe's
Motor Speedway in May have been interviewed by the FBI in
connection with bombings at Lowe's stores in North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   And speedway officials, after receiving a bomb threat at the
track, will increase security for Sunday's NASCAR race, which is
expected to draw approximately 150,000 fans.
</P>
<P>
   FBI and local law-enforcement officials are investigating
whether the bomb incidents at the stores are linked to a May 1
crash at the speedway that killed three spectators and injured
eight.
</P>
<P>
   The parents of Randy Pyatte, who was killed when a tire flew
into the stands during an Indy Racing League event, confirmed that
they were interviewed by FBI agents on Oct. 2. Roger Pyatte, the
victim's father, said two agents arrived unannounced at his home in
Connelly Springs, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   ``They asked us if we'd heard anything in the past that would
have related to any kind of threat to the track,'' Roger Pyatte
said. ``They asked me if I'd been treated fairly by the track. I
said it was hard to say.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Speedway officials) called us for the first three or four
weeks after the tragedy, but then they just stopped,'' he said.
``If people really cared, like they said they did, it seems like
they'd call you every once in a while to see how you're doing.''
</P>
<P>
   In February, Lowe's agreed to pay Speedway Motorsports Inc.
about $35 million for a 10-year lease on the track's naming rights.
SMI also owns Atlanta Motor Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   The Sept. 22 explosions at Lowe's stores in Asheboro and
Salisbury injured three people. Another bomb did not explode at a
Lowe's store in Concord, near Lowe's Motor Speedway. A bomb threat
to the speedway has been received by telephone, track spokesman
Jerry Gappens said.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Beauchamp, the lawyer representing the Pyattes and the
estates of the other two men killed _ Dexter Mobley of Statesville,
N.C., and Jeffrey Patton of Connelly Springs _ confirmed that the
FBI had interviewed the Pyattes, but had not contacted the families
of the other victims.
</P>
<P>
   FBI officials in Atlanta could not be reached for comment
Thursday, but an FBI spokesman told the Greensboro News &AMP; Record
last week that investigators are following hundreds of leads in the
case. The News &AMP; Record also reported through anonymous sources
that ``an aggrieved relative'' called Lowe's headquarters in
Wilkesboro before the bombings to complain that the organization
``had not done enough'' for the families of the victims. The
newspaper also reported that a letter received by the corporate
office shortly after the bombings stated that they would continue
until Lowe's ``did right'' by the families of the victims.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the FBI is doing its job of following any and all
leads,'' Beauchamp said. ``I don't begrudge them for doing their
jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   Track officials have hired extra guards and promised a more
extensive search of race fans for all events, including Sunday's
UAW-GM Quality 500 race. The FBI, local authorities and the federal
Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms will have more personnel to
monitor the area and will employ detection devices.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think this is going to be a long-lasting thing,'' said
H.A. ``Humpy'' Wheeler, president of Lowe's Motor Speedway.
``Hopefully, they will catch this guy. All the things that have
happened at NFL games in the past are happening at speedways now.
We have some great expertise already in place to look at those
things. We have had a number of bomb threats (in the past), all
totally nothing to them, but they are very disruptive.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to alarm anybody, but just let them know it is
still safe to come out here,'' Gappens said. ``With the increased
awareness from what has been going on over the last two weeks, this
is probably the safest week we've ever had (because) awareness is
up. People are on the lookout for anything they see that is
suspicious or out of the ordinary. I think we're in good shape, and
it is going to be a great weekend.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Childress Racing reopened its No. 31 shop for tourists
on Wednesday after being closed to the public for three work days.
Mike Skinner is the driver for the No. 31 Chevy, which has Lowe's
as a primary sponsor.
</P>
<P>
   ``We (drivers) got so much to do, we don't even think about
(bomb threats), and hopefully things are being taken care of,''
driver Wally Dallenbach said. ``You just think about why somebody
is doing it. That's what you shake your head about and say, like,
'Come on, man, get a life.' I think (security) will do a good job
this weekend.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It worries you that there are nuts out there that do stuff
like that,'' said Richard Petty, one of NASCAR's greatest drivers.
``You just hope that it doesn't happen here, and if it does, you
are on the other side of the race track. I don't think there's a
bigger percentage of crazy people these days, just more people.''
</P>
<P>
   The ATF is offering a $30,000 reward for information leading to
the arrest of the person or group responsible for the bombing
incidents. ATF officials have said that evidence indicates the same
person or group planted all three bombs at the Lowe's stores.
</P>
<P>
   The estates of all three victims have filed wrongful-death
lawsuits against SMI, the Indy Racing League and Wheeler. A court
date of Aug. 8 has been set tentatively for Mecklenburg County
Superior Court.

<P>
   NEW DELHI, India _ Laloo Prasad Yadav, the canny son of an
illiterate cowherd, who ruled impoverished Bihar state for almost a
decade in the name of the poor and low caste but who failed to
improve their standard of living, lost his Parliament seat on
Wednesday. His National People's Party's share of seats also fell
precipitously.
</P>
<P>
   In sharp contrast, another state leader, Chandrababu Naidu, the
chief minister of Andhra Pradesh, who is credited with harnessing
the state bureaucracy to provide people with government services,
won a big victory, and his his Telugu Desam Party scored major
gains in state and national elections.
</P>
<P>
   In both states it appeared that the desire for decent jobs,
schools and health care _ and the candidates' success or failure in
meeting those expectations _ drove the results.
</P>
<P>
   Another demand _ for human dignity _ has been behind the rise of
the Bahujan Samaj Party, which has its voter base among the
untouchable castes, or Dalits. By late Thursday night, it had
increased its seats in Parliament to 14, from five, after expanding
its appeal by putting up candidates who were Muslims or from upper
and middle castes.

COMMENTARY: LET GEORGES DO IT
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By GAIL COLLINS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   George W. Bush was in New York this week, and by the time he had
left, everybody here was speculating like mad about Gov. George
Pataki's chances of getting the Republican vice-presidential
nomination. This is no small matter for the state. Pataki is a
career politician with no place left to climb. If we don't find him
another job soon, he's going to turn into Mario Cuomo.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the signs are favorable. Pataki appeared to have his
hand surgically attached to Bush's arm during his three-day visit,
but nobody shooed him away. The Texas governor heaped praise on
Pataki's support for charter schools, a passion so intense that
after five years of his leadership New York already has three, each
nearly a month old.
</P>
<P>
   Now, I know what you non-New Yorkers are saying to yourselves:
``Hey, we have a governor in our state that we might like to get
rid of too. Why can't George W. Bush pick him/her for his running
mate?'' Obviously, everybody cannot foist his excess politicians on
Bush's ticket. Some are simply unsuitable. Your governor might be a
Democrat or a professional wrestler. Even among the remainder, none
have Pataki's range of advantages:
</P>
<P>
   _Synergy. Secret research by the Republican National Committee
reveals that the majority of independent voters, soccer moms and
first-time home buyers would support the GOP ticket in 2000 if it
was made up exclusively of men named George.
</P>
<P>
   _Mutual interests. Like Bush, Pataki does not have a clue about
foreign affairs, so they could cram together, perhaps quizzing each
other on heads of state and capital cities.
</P>
<P>
   _Shared history. Pataki went to Yale in the mid-'60s, a rite of
passage he once said mainly involved ``beer and rock 'n' roll.''
Bush was at Yale at almost exactly the same time, having almost
exactly the same experience. However, Pataki was also involved in
campus politics, and he might be able to fill in a few blanks for
Bush, who claims not to remember having heard about any antiwar
protests during his college days.
</P>
<P>
   _Diversity. Pataki is a lawyer, a profession that is shockingly
underrepresented in the current presidential field. Think about it
_ Bush, Bradley, Gore, McCain _ not an attorney in the bunch. What
would happen if somebody in the White House needed to know what a
tort was in the middle of the night? The only serious presidential
candidate this year with a law degree is Elizabeth Dole. Bush
could, of course, take the easy route and simply make Mrs. Dole his
running mate. But then good luck finding out what was going on in
New Haven between 1964 and '68.
</P>
<P>
   _Desire. No other governor can match Pataki in desire to become
vice president, possibly because no one else has to deal with the
New York State Legislature. The governor was so eager to make Bush
happy this week that he agreed to share the stage on several
occasions with his longtime nemesis, New York City Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani. (Giuliani was equally intent on proving he could be
collegial. During four minutes of remarks at a Queens job center,
he managed to cram in seven favorable references to Pataki,
exceeding his entire output for 1998.)
</P>
<P>
   When Bush praised the pair as ``pillars of the strength of the
Republican Party here in New York'' who were going to help him win
the state primary, Pataki and Giuliani practically quivered with
determination. That could be dangerous. When somebody tells the New
York Republican Party to deliver a primary, the rank and file
generally regard that as a summons to kidnap the other contenders
and stuff them in a car trunk.
</P>
<P>
   But back to the vice-presidential nomination. A ticket in which
everyone shares the same name, sex, age, schooling and current job
would have untold advantages, not the least of which would be money
saved by releasing the same biography for both candidates. The only
possible competition I can imagine for Pataki might be George Bush
the former president, who has not only his son's name, schooling
and multiple home states, but also his DNA.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki does have a few minor disadvantages. He is, for instance,
taller than Bush, and most presidential candidates prefer to be
able to look down on their running mates. But I suspect Pataki is
so eager to get out of Albany that he would readily agree to remain
slouched for the next eight years. (BOX)

CHASE TO MOVE 3,500 JOBS OUT OF NEW YORK CITY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (EDS: Subs to correct 7th graf to say Chase combined with Chemical,
sted gobbled up. Chemical initiated the merger and kept the Chase
name.)  (th) 
 By LESLIE EATON    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Chase Manhattan Corp., the largest corporate employer
in New York City, is moving 10 percent of its jobs _ 3,500
positions _ to Florida, Texas and Massachusetts, the company told
its workers on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   City officials and corporate consultants said they could not
remember a bigger relocation by a single company. But in the late
1980s, many Wall Street firms began moving their ``back office''
record-keeping and data processing jobs to New Jersey and Florida,
a trend that Chase is now catching up with.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning next year, Chase will move two entire back-office
units, from entry-level positions to technology workers to senior
managers, said Ken Herz, a spokesman for the company. One of the
businesses transfers money for companies; the other involves
tracking and processing stock and bond trades.
</P>
<P>
   By relocating its workers, the bank will cut its costs
significantly, Herz said, though he would not say how much money it
expected to save. Salaries, real estate costs, taxes,
telecommunications charges and utilities costs are all lower in
Tampa, Fla., and Dallas, where most of the jobs are to be
relocated.
</P>
<P>
   But the savings are so big that Chase did not even approach the
city for financial or logistical help to try to keep the jobs in
New York, Herz said. ``There was no way the city could come up with
enough money,'' he added. ``These are very significant savings.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're always sorry to see any jobs go,'' said Deputy Mayor
Randy Levine. But, he said, Chase has promised to keep its
headquarters and core business in the city and will be expanding
its other operations. The company, which Levine said was looking
for one million square feet, has been searching unsuccessfully for
space in which to expand.
</P>
<P>
   Technological advances have prompted banks to slash the number
of employees in the city over the last decade, as have mergers;
Chase combined with Chemical Bank and Manufacturers Hanover, among
others. Employment at depository institutions has fallen from
almost 175,000 in 1988 to about 110,000 today, according to the
state's Department of Labor.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the jobs that have disappeared were held by middle-class
people earning middle-income salaries, leading some economists and
government officials to worry that New York is becoming
increasingly a city of the very rich and very poor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a constant worry, that all the middle-class finance jobs
are going, that the banks can't afford to keep them here,'' said
one former city official.
</P>
<P>
   The city government has offered financial incentives to large
companies that threatened to leave the city; Chase received $235
million in 1988, when it agreed to move many back-office employees
to Brooklyn, rather than New Jersey. It now has about 6,000
employees at Brooklyn's Metrotech Center office complex, which is
full.
</P>
<P>
   Some Metrotech jobs are among those that are being moved, Herz
said, adding that Chase planned to relocate other business units to
Metrotech to keep it full.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the employees whose jobs are being moved work at the tip
of Manhattan, at 4 New York Plaza and 55 Water St. While Chase said
it would offer to relocate many of those workers, several
interviewed Thursday said they were unlikely to go.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess if you're single or live with your parents, you could
pack up and move, but I can't,'' one middle-aged employee said.
``We constantly get letters from the chairman saying you're doing a
great job; now, we really feel betrayed.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The city's Metrotech deal with Chase particularly rankled,
another employee said. ``It's a sorry state,'' he complained.
``Here's a major corporation that receives tax abatements from the
city, and part of that deal is to bring jobs to the city. Slowly
but surely, they move operations.''
</P>
<P>
   One reason that employees may be reluctant to relocate is that
their chances of finding work in New York City are unusually good,
corporate consultants said. The unemployment rate in the city is
6.9 percent, down from roughly 10 percent in early 1997, and many
companies are adding new jobs at a record pace.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people will find jobs in a couple of months,
definitely,'' said Dennis J. Donovan, a partner in the
Wadley-Donovan Group, which advises companies on relocations.
</P>
<P>
   That was not the case in the late 1980s, when Merrill Lynch
moved 2,500 back-office jobs to Jersey City. Or, in the mid-1990s,
when several big financial firms threatened to move to Stamford,
Conn., and Swiss Bank actually did, taking 1,300 jobs with it.
Citigroup, which employs about 25,000 people in the city, has for
years had its stock custodial business in Tampa, a Citigroup
spokesman, Jack Morris, said.
</P>
<P>
   Companies have discovered that they can have administrative
tasks performed almost anywhere, even overseas, said Daniel
Malachuck, a partner at Arthur Andersen who specializes in business
location services.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, however, companies and their employees have
become far more optimistic about staying in New York City,
Malachuck said, and less inclined to move to another part of the
country.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know what the post-Rudy mind-set will be, but people
feel better about the city and their situation,'' he said. ``And
people have been to some of those other places.''

 &HT;    FSU All-American Warrick charged with theft
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Heisman Trophy hopes _ and perhaps college career
_ of All-American Peter Warrick were placed in limbo Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Florida State coach Bobby Bowden indefinitely suspended Warrick,
a senior, after the receiver was arrested on a grand-theft charge
in Tallahassee, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Senior wide receiver Laveranues Coles was arrested on the same
charge in the same case and dismissed from the team.
</P>
<P>
   Warrick and Coles are free on bond. Their first court appearance
is Monday.
</P>
<P>
   No. 1 Florida State (5-0) plays No. 19 Miami on Saturday in
Tallahassee.
</P>
<P>
   Arrested with the players was a department store cashier. Police
said Rachel Myrtil, 19, allowed Warrick and Coles to buy clothing
worth $412.38 for $21.40 on Sept. 29 at Dillard's department store.
They said Myrtil voided the purchase price in the cash register,
did a cost override and charged the players the lower total. An
off-duty police officer caught the transaction on the store's
surveillance system.
</P>
<P>
   Warrick told police that Myrtil did the same thing for him on
previous trips to the store.
</P>
<P>
   Warrick cannot return to the team until his case is resolved in
court. He also will have to satisfy conditions of the university's
Athletics Code of Conduct, athletics director Dave Hart said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Warrick, who has 36 catches for 508 yards and four touchdowns,
was the leading candidate for the Heisman.
</P>
<P>
   Coles has been in trouble before. In 1998 he was charged with
simple battery when he was accused of hitting his stepmother
outside her home. He did 150 hours of community service and was
suspended for the 1998 opener with Texas A&AMP;M. He missed the 1999
opener with Louisiana Tech while school officials investigated a
trip he took to Texas allegedly paid for by an agent. Coles
reimbursed the ticket price and was reinstated.
</P>
<P>
   ``My thinking this week has been that if Laveranues was charged,
I would permanently dismiss him from the team, and I have,'' Bowden
said. ``Peter ... has been such a hard worker and a good leader. It
makes this all the more disappointing.''
</P>
<P>
   Warrick was charged with disorderly conduct and resisting arrest
after an altercation at a Tampa, Fla., fast-food restaurant in
1998. The charges were dropped.

U.S. ATTORNEY'S OFFICE INDICTS FUGITIVE FINANCIER HELD IN GERMANY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Conn., Ohio, Germany)  (th) 
 By LESLIE WAYNE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The fugitive financier Martin R. Frankel, who fled the United
States and is now in a German prison, was indicted by a federal
grand jury Thursday on 36 counts of fraud, money laundering and
racketeering in a scheme that siphoned more than $200 million from
a group of Southern insurance companies and was used for his own
benefit.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment, sought by the U.S. Attorney's Office for the
District of Connecticut, is the latest turn in a bizarre tale in
which Frankel, 44, is accused of masterminding a complicated
financial plan that, for more than eight years, drained millions of
dollars from insurance companies and their policyholders. That
scheme ended in May when Frankel's Greenwich, Conn., mansion caught
fire and Frankel fled the country.
</P>
<P>
   The subject of an international manhunt, Frankel was captured in
a Hamburg hotel room by local police officers and an FBI agent in
September and was imprisoned there on charges of carrying a false
passport. Meanwhile, German authorities have been waiting for
American law enforcement officials to prepare more serious charges
against him.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment lays the groundwork for a formal extradition
process to begin. It is not known whether Frankel will fight
extradition. His financial assets have been frozen and he is now
being represented by Thomas Dennis, a public defender, who would
not comment Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Hugh F. Keefe, Frankel's former lawyer, said Thursday that
Frankel was currently facing ``two lousy options,'' either
remaining in German prison or returning to America for trial. Keefe
said he was no longer Frankel's lawyer because of the freeze on
Frankel's assets. He added, however, that Frankel's condition
``varies from day to day.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly,'' he continued, ``this is not a terrific place to be
for anyone and he is in a tough German prison.''
</P>
<P>
   Keefe added that, until this indictment, one of the grounds for
Frankel to oppose extradition had been that he had not been
formally charged with a crime. But Thursday's indictment ``lightens
the government's load,'' Keefe said. ``He will eventually be
extradicted back to America unless he waives it.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers with the U.S. attorney's office declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment offers some new details concerning how Frankel
conducted his insurance scheme and where the money went. In
two-pages of single-spaced type, the indictment describes how
Frankel, using a Swiss bank account, converted the money from the
insurance company into his multimillion dollar Greenwich mansion,
and into diamonds, gold coins from the Vienna Philharmonic,
traveler's checks, numerous automobiles and ``at least'' one
aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankel converted, stole and embezzled the majority of funds
for personal use,'' the indictment said. ``In total, in excess of
$200 million was converted, stolen and embezzled by Frankel through
the scheme and artifice to defraud.''
</P>
<P>
   The indictment also outlined how Frankel did business: He
created a trust, the Thunor Trust, that he used to acquire stakes
in a number of insurance companies and then took the assets of
these insurance companies by saying that the money would be
invested in safe assets, primarily U.S. government securities.
Instead, he kept the money.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   He also provided the insurance companies with false profit and
loss statements and, in some cases, returned enough cash to the
companies to prevent detection of the scheme by state insurance
regulators.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment also accuses him of controlling the St. Francis
of Assisi Foundation, which was to be used to acquire insurance
companies and use any profits for charitable causes. As part of
this fraud, Frankel even persuaded a high-level retired priest at
the Vatican to unwittingly back this charity.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the indictment lists a number of Wall Street firms
where Frankel maintained accounts. They included Dreyfus Corp.,
Prudential Securities and Bear, Stearns &AMP; Co., along with Banque
SCS Alliance in Switzerland. None of the firms are named in the
indictment and were listed simply as places were Frankel did
business.
</P>
<P>
   A native of Toledo, Ohio, Frankel agreed to a lifetime ban from
the securities business in an out-of-court settlement in 1992 with
the Securities and Exchange Commission. This came after he ran
afoul of financial regulators when a small investment fund he ran
generated steep losses for retirees who had entrusted their savings
to Frankel.
</P>
<P>
   But even before that agreement was final, he began the scheme
that lead to Thursday's indictment. Along the way, however, he
lived a lavish life, operating from inside his four-acre Greenwich
mansion, complete with walls of computer and trading equipment _
which was rarely used _ and staffed by women he recruited through
the Internet and help-wanted ads to be his personal assistants.
</P>
<P>
   About the time Frankel fled the country, his house caught fire.
While there, Greenwich firefighters found smoldering documents and
a ``to-do'' list in which item No. 1 said ``Launder Money.''
</P>
<P>
   Frankel was in his Hamburg hotel room with a female companion,
diamonds and cash, when he was arrested Sept. 4. Up to that point,
he had traveled through Europe, often openly, with several female
friends, and he had lived in apartments and hotels arranged for him
by contacts in Rome.
</P>
<P>
   If Frankel returns to the United States, he would be brought
before Judge Holly B. Fitzsimmons in Bridgeport. Keefe, Frankel's
former lawyer, said Frankel has not been allowed by German
authorities to meet with his new American lawyer yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is important,'' Keefe said, ``to remember that this man is
presumed innocent and has not yet had a chance to give his side of
the story.''

 &HT;    Game 3 a must-see for Venezuelans
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The New York Mets and Arizona Diamondbacks play a
baseball game tonight. For the entire nation of Venezuela, the
stakes are higher.
</P>
<P>
   After splitting the first two in Phoenix, the NL Division Series
shifts to Shea Stadium, where talk is incessant over a Subway
Series and the revived corpse that is the Mets. For Venezuela, it
is more than that. The nation's best hitter _ the Mets' Edgardo
Alfonzo _ squares off against the country's best starting pitcher _
Arizona's Omar Daal _ on an historic night.
</P>
<P>
   Venezuela won't know which way to turn.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they are going to root for Venezuela, for both,'' Daal
said. ``If I get (Alfonzo) out, I know they are going to be happy.
(He) gets a base hit, I know they are going to be happy too.''
</P>
<P>
   The arrangement is appropriate, for in the Latin American boom
that has hit the majors in recent seasons, no nation has increased
in presence more than Venezuela. What started with Luis Aparicio in
the 1950s, what Tony Armas continued in the 1970s and Andres
Galarraga and Ozzie Guillen kept going in the 1980s is now a flood
of young talent spreading across both leagues.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia's Bob Abreu, Montreal's Ugueth Urbina, San Diego's
Carlos Hernandez, Tampa Bay's Wilson Alvarez, Florida's Alex
Gonzalez and the White Sox' Magglio Ordonez have fanned out into
the majors. Postseason rosters are dotted with Venezuelans Omar
Vizquel (Cleveland), Luis Sojo (Yankees), Atlanta's Guillen and
Eddie Perez and Alfonzo's teammate Roger Cedeno. Galarraga and
Houston's Richard Hidalgo would be there too, but for the disabled
list.
</P>
<P>
   But tonight's pair is the most sublime, particularly because of
Alfonzo's rise to the elite this season. In an MVP-type year, he
moved from third to his natural position at second base and posted
career-highs in runs (123), hits (191), doubles (41), home runs
(27), RBIs (106) and walks (85), batting .304 in the most
productive season ever by a Mets second baseman.
</P>
<P>
   His ninth-inning, two-out grand slam in Game 1 off Bobby
Chouinard immediately turned this series in New York's favor,
coming at a critical time when Mike Piazza's bat has fallen quiet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's gotten away from the thought that he's going to
be a guy who gets a single to right,'' Mets manager Bobby Valentine
said. ``He's a guy who can do a lot more than that. That's kind of
been drummed into his head.''
</P>
<P>
   Daal had it drummed into his head he was a left-handed match-up
reliever during stints in the Los Angeles, Montreal and Toronto
organizations, where he was permitted only nine career starts in
205 big-league appearances dating back to 1993. But the
Diamondbacks made him the second pick of the expansion draft and
made him a starter after Joel Adamson went down two months into the
season.
</P>
<P>
   Going 16-8 this year (and 2-1 against the Mets), Daal's 3.65 was
the third lowest ERA by an NL left-hander. After a 3-4 start, he
finished second only to Randy Johnson in team wins, going 8-3 in
the second half. Though it all, he has held Alfonzo to three hits
in 12 at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know,'' Daal said, ``in the game, we are enemy.''
</P>
<P>
   And in Venezuela, they are proud.

HOUSE ADOPTS PATIENTS' RIGHTS BILL OVER OPPOSITION OF GOP LEADERS

 By ROBERT PEAR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ By a surprisingly lopsided vote, the House of
Representatives passed a bill on Thursday to give patients a wide
range of new rights, including the right to sue health insurance
plans that cause injury by denying care or by providing substandard
treatment.
</P>
<P>
   The vote, 275-151, was a stunning rebuff to House Republican
leaders. Sixty-eight Republicans defied their leadership and voted
for the bill, despite pleas from Speaker Dennis Hastert, who said
he vehemently opposed the measure because it could lead to a flood
of lawsuits against health maintenance organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's vote was the most serious setback for Hastert since
he became speaker nine months ago.
</P>
<P>
   The House bill, strongly supported by President Clinton, would
set uniform national standards for health insurance, a field
regulated mainly by the states for 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   In July, the Senate passed a bill providing patients with a more
limited set of rights. It differs from the House measure in two big
ways. Many provisions of the Senate bill would apply to only 48
million people, whereas the House bill would cover 161 million
people. And the Senate measure would not create any new right to
sue. Complicating the House-Senate conference that is to reconcile
the two versions, the House measure includes a set of tax breaks,
passed on Wednesday, that are opposed by Democrats and the White
House.
</P>
<P>
   The House bill on managed care was drafted by two of the most
stubborn and tenacious members of Congress, Reps. Charlie Norwood,
R-Ga., and John Dingell, D-Mich.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, in New York City on Thursday for a fund-raiser,
congratulated the House. ``The passage of this bill represents a
major victory for every family in every health plan,'' he said.
But, he added, when House and Senate negotiators try to thrash out
their differences, ``Republican leaders must resist the urge to
weaken the patient protections guaranteed in the Norwood-Dingell
bill.''
</P>
<P>
   Rejoicing with supporters after the final vote, Dingell, who has
served in the House since 1955, said, ``This was as fine a piece of
work as I've ever seen in Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   But the House Democratic leader, Rep. Dick Gephardt of Missouri,
said the bill could get bogged down in negotiations with the
Senate. ``I'm worried that this bill will go into a conference
committee that never ends, and nothing happens,'' Gephardt said.
</P>
<P>
   The House bill would guarantee patients access to emergency care
and medical specialists; would let them appeal coverage decisions
to an independent board, and would prohibit HMOs from retaliating
against doctors who fight for the needs of their patients.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would also make it much easier for patients to sue
health plans in state courts for injuries caused by the denial of
care.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since 1974,'' Norwood said, ``managed-care insurance plans
have enjoyed a near-total immunity from any legal accountability
for injuring and killing the citizens of this country for monetary
gain. No thinking, feeling American can agree to let that stand.''
</P>
<P>
   Another Republican who voted for the Norwood-Dingell bill, Rep.
Merrill Cook of Utah, said: ``If Americans have the right to sue
for a damaged fence or an unsafe toy, they should have the right to
sue if their life or health has been endangered. Doctors already
face liability, but often their decisions are forced upon them by
an insurance plan. It's only fair that insurance plans be held to
the same accountability.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Hastert said, ``Under the Norwood-Dingell legislation,
trial lawyers will be given unprecedented new rights to sue at any
time for any reason.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep, Thomas J. Bliley Jr., R-Va., said, ``Patients need care,
not courts.'' The same lawyers who sued tobacco companies and gun
manufacturers are planning to file similar lawsuits against HMOs
and employers who provide health benefits to their employees,
Bliley said.
</P>
<P>
   The House bill defining patients' rights was bundled together
with a bill, passed by the House on Wednesday, to create tax breaks
to help individuals and small businesses buy health insurance.
Republicans strongly support the tax breaks, which could cost more
than $40 billion over 10 years, but Clinton and other Democrats
dislike many of the tax proposals.
</P>
<P>
   Conservative Democrats expressed concern about these costs on
Wednesday. But Clinton relieved some of the concern on Thursday
when he said, in a letter to House Democrats, that he would not
sign any legislation ``unless its costs are fully offset by the
conference committee.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's vote was a rare triumph of bipartisanship in a House
chamber that has been torn apart by bitter partisan strife for more
than four years. In that same period, Norwood, a dentist, fought
the leadership of his own party and a well-financed coalition of
insurance companies and businesses of all sizes, to get a
managed-care bill through the House.
</P>
<P>
   Voting for the bill were 206 Democrats and 1 independent. Two
Democrats, Collin Peterson of Minnesota and Virgil H. Goode Jr. of
Virginia, joined 149 Republicans in voting against the measure.
</P>
<P>
   HMOs have helped employers control the cost of care, but in the
process they have infuriated many patients and doctors.
</P>
<P>
   The Norwood-Dingell bill was supported by many consumer
advocates and labor unions. But doctors and nurses made the
difference. The American Medical Association lobbied hard for the
bill. And Dr. Greg Ganske, R-Iowa, a surgeon, was a tireless
champion of the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Standing just 20 feet from the Capitol on Thursday morning, Dr.
Thomas R. Reardon, president of the AMA, buttonholed lawmakers and
urged them to vote for the Norwood-Dingell bill.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the doctors' long romance with the Republican Party was
souring, Reardon said, ``There is a real disenchantment with the
Republican leadership on this issue.''
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday night, after the final vote, Reardon said, ``It is
hard to imagine a bigger, more colossal victory for patients than
the one achieved in the House today.''
</P>
<P>
   Doctors have rebelled against the constraints of managed care
because they feel that HMOs have compromised their decision-making
authority and their professional autonomy.
</P>
<P>
   By a vote of 238-193, the House on Thursday rejected a
substitute bill offered as an alternative by the House Republican
leaders. Twenty-nine Republicans joined almost all the Democrats in
opposing this bill, written by Reps. Tom Coburn of Oklahoma and
John Shadegg of Arizona, both Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   The Coburn-Shadegg bill would have provided patients with a
limited right to sue HMOs in federal court.
</P>
<P>
   The bill passed on Thursday would pierce the shield of immunity
provided to many HMOs by a federal law, the Employee Retirement
Income Security Act of 1974.
</P>
<P>
   Under this statute, courts have repeatedly rejected lawsuits
that relate directly to the administration of claims under an
employee-benefit plan. But in the last two years, judges have
become more receptive to lawsuits seeking damages from HMOs on the
theory that the quality of care was inadequate.
</P>
<P>
   Almost every provision of the House bill, including the right to
sue, has been enacted in some form by one or more states.

 McENROE HOPES TRIP TO ZIMBABWE WON'T SCARE OFF TOP U.S. PLAYERS 
 (rk) 
 By ROBIN FINN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   John McEnroe, the colorful new U.S. Davis Cup captain, heard the
word Zimbabwe on Thursday and immediately began checking his cell
phone to see if the prime name on his wish list of Davis Cup
volunteers, Andre Agassi, had called in to cancel his opening round
reservations. He had not.
</P>
<P>
   But McEnroe, 40, was properly queasy after learning that the
first assignment of his celebrated captaincy will take place in
foreign territory in early February against a team of underdogs led
by Byron and Wayne Black. Zimbabwe, which stunned powerful
Australia in the opening round two years ago, upset Chile in the
1999 relegation round for the right to test itself next year in the
World Group.
</P>
<P>
   The United States fell to Australia in the quarterfinals in
Chestnut Hill, Mass., in July, a round Agassi boycotted and Pete
Sampras decorated for doubles only. Now the American team has drawn
Zimbabwe as its opener, a difficult sell for a new captain trying
to recruit players willing to sandwich a visit to Africa between
the Australian Open and a regular tour event in San Jose, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   The response of McEnroe, who spent Thursday spreading the Davis
Cup gospel, was predictable. He bashed the Davis Cup schedule,
resolved to see the competition confined to a single month by 2002,
and then pronounced himself confident that he and his as-yet
unannounced troops would prevail in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a tough travel trip, but I like our chances; it's like
David versus Goliath,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The United States, with 31 Davis Cup championships and 188 World
Group victories, is an overwhelming favorite to advance to the
second round against Britain or the Czech Republic.
</P>
<P>
   Still, McEnroe paled when advised that he would need a couple of
dozen shots for immunization purposes before making the first trek
to Africa by an American Davis Cup team, and he worried aloud that
the unglamorous locale might scare Sampras away from joining the
team. He has not yet committed himself to McEnroe's debut squad.
McEnroe joked that he had even resorted to prayer, so far to no
avail.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's critical that all the top players do play,'' said
McEnroe. ``I think he realizes it's the right thing to do, but he
may have different feelings, particularly when he sees the draw.''
</P>
<P>
   But the captain, a veteran of five Davis Cup championship teams,
cheered up when he realized that if he could not do sufficient
arm-twisting, he might just find himself on his 13th career Davis
Cup roster _ as a player. McEnroe was offended that Tom Gullikson,
the previous captain, refused to select him for doubles, and while
he admitted it might feel odd ``picking myself,'' he did not rule
it out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure word is seeping out that our worst-case scenario has
just taken place,'' said McEnroe of the logistical nightmare
entailed by a opening round confrontation in Zimbabwe just a week
after the Australian Open.
</P>
<P>
   ``Andre's already committed; unless he's injured, he's stuck,''
said McEnroe, whose hiring last month was expedited when Agassi,
Sampras, Todd Martin and Jim Courier expressed interest in playing
for him. Now it's crunch time for McEnroe and his persuasive
powers: ``This will be a gut check for a couple of guys. We will
separate the men from the boys.''

HOW BAD IS PEDRO? MAYBE HE'LL PLAY CATCH SATURDAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND _ This is the best the Red Sox could promise about
Pedro Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in there when Pedro was examined by the doctor,''
pitching coach Joe Kerrigan said. ``He told him to let it calm down
a couple of days, then he'll probably try to play catch (Saturday).
That was his advice. Let's see if he can play catch (Saturday).''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe he can play catch. Hardly a reassuring scenario for a team
hoping to have its ace back one more time in its division series
against the Cleveland Indians.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. William Morgan, the team doctor traveling with the team,
reiterated Thursday that Martinez has a muscle strain in the
midback area. The pitcher came out of the team's 3-2 loss in Game 1
after four innings after apparently sustaining the injury while
throwing a 96-mile-per-hour fastball to Jim Thome, the first batter
in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is slight improvement today, but he does have persistent
pain,'' Morgan said in a statement released by the club Thursday
afternoon. ``He's undergoing treatment right now, which includes
ultrasound, anti-inflammatory medication and rest. His condition
status is day to day.
</P>
<P>
   ``The plan is to start stretching (Friday) and light exercise .
... We'll observe his progress and we will reevaluate him
(Friday).''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez did not poke his head out of the Sox clubhouse before
the game. He surfaced in the dugout in a stocking cap, where he did
some robotic twitching in apparent imitation of someone giving
signs in the Indians dugout.
</P>
<P>
   He, too, limited his pregame remarks to a written statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have some improvement from Thursday,'' Martinez said. ``I
feel better already. I really feel positive about it. Right now I
feel looser. In a few hours after treatment, I'm hoping to even
feel better. Right now I'm just busy working and I'm going to keep
working.''
</P>
<P>
   Lurking on the perimeter of the discussion of Martinez's health
were suspicions that it was Martinez's shoulder and not his back
that was ailing. Pitcher Rich Garces mentioned after the Game 1
loss Tuesday night that Martinez's shoulder had been bothering him,
and in the Cleveland dugout, similar talk had been heard from the
Red Sox side.
</P>
<P>
   Just as Martinez repeatedly denied Wednesday night that his
shoulder was involved, Red Sox general manager Dan Duquette took a
similar line on the club's $75 million investment.
</P>
<P>
   ``He hurt the back of his shoulder in July,'' Duquette said.
``This is in a lower area. It's not related at all.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sox had some fears that Martinez would be affected by the
cool weather. Game-time temperature Wednesday night was 49 degrees.
Kerrigan said that when he was with Montreal, manager Felipe Alou
once kept Martinez out of commission for 17 days because he didn't
want him pitching in the cold.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were concerned, going in,'' Duquette said. ``Pedro thrives
in warm weather and (cold weather) is always a concern when you get
into October.''
</P>
<P>
   Manager Jimy Williams hasn't abandoned the hope that Martinez
will pitch again this season. Asked if it might be better to shut
him down, Williams said: ``I don't think we have to make that
decision today. I don't think we have to make that decision
tomorrow. Let's see how he feels. Let's get there first.''

 &HT;    Hampton has Astros feeling confident
 &HT;    By Curtis Bunn
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ In Mike Hampton's arm the Astros trust. That he takes
the ball in this afternoon's Game 3 of the Division Series against
the Braves is the club's ultimate security. An effort typical of
his sparkling season would put Houston on the cusp of the NLCS. And
Hampton would have it no other way.
</P>
<P>
   In short, this is what the Astros and Hampton wanted _ a chance
to get one game from eliminating the vaunted Braves with the ace on
the hill. When asked if there was anyone over Hampton he'd like to
have pitching today, manager Larry Dierker responded, ``Maybe Bob
Gibson.''
</P>
<P>
   That's as good an indication of the feel-good vibes Hampton
creates as anything. He finished the season 22-4 with a 2.90 ERA
and in serious Cy Young Award contention. If that's not enough,
Dierker pointed out that the team lost only five games in which
he's pitched.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of those games we took him out for a pinch-hitter or
because he didn't pitch that well,'' Dierker explained, ``but we
still usually did enough to win (29 of 34 starts). I can't remember
anybody _ including Bob Gibson _ with that high a winning
percentage.''
</P>
<P>
   Hampton said he cannot remember being so excited about a
single-season performance like this season. Nor can he pinpoint
ever being so anxious to pitch as he is today. The magnitude of it
all does not frighten him; it thrills him, he insists, even though
failure could be damaging.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being in pressure situations, you want to thrive in,'' Hampton
said. ``It's easy to get up for those type of games. If you do
well, you look great. But if you don't, you look like a guy who's
choked. So, it's a double-edged sword.''
</P>
<P>
   Facing Hampton is a similar endeavor. He has different velocity
on his fastball and stunning movement. His pitch placement usually
keeps batters off balance. He's grown from a predominant
heat-thrower determined to blow away hitters to a cunning pitcher
who uses a diverse arsenal to baffle opponents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Earlier in my career,'' Hampton said, ``I was more of a
thrower. I threw a little harder. In jams I would turn it up. Now,
I can take a little off, get more movement on my pitches. That's
been the biggest key in not pressing. I try to pitch 90 to 95
percent rate where situations (come) and I need that little extra,
I still have it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It basically comes down to knowing abilities, just learning
throughout the years and pitching smart.''
</P>
<P>
   Hampton clearly has a grasp of his skill. The Cy Young balloting
should be between him, Arizona's Randy Johnson and the Braves'
Kevin Millwood. If someone other than Hampton wins it, he figures
he'll never earn the coveted pitching award.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've definitely had the best year I probably could possibly
have,'' he said. ``Everything has gone right. (So) I feel like I
have a chance, but I can't control those things.''

 &HT;    Braves ready to take out Hampton
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ This is what the Braves wanted _ a chance to make or
break the Division Series in Game 3 today against the Astros' best
pitcher, and arguably the best pitcher in the National League.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-two game-winner Mike Hampton, the toughest pitcher to
beat in baseball this year this side of Pedro Martinez, is what
stands between the Braves and control of this Division Series,
which is back up for grabs after the Braves won 5-1 Wednesday to
even the best-of-five series 1-1.
</P>
<P>
   It's not exactly a best-case scenario, but after where the
Braves were sitting on Tuesday night following their 6-1 loss in
Game 1, this is good enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've come here to take out their best,'' Brian Jordan said.
``He's a Cy Young candidate. I think he's a winner. ... If we beat
Hampton tomorrow, the momentum will definitely be our way.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year's NL Cy Young award winner will have something to say
about it. Tom Glavine may have the toughest stomach lining of any
member of the Braves staff, and he'll need it with the pivotal Game
3 pressure bearing down.
</P>
<P>
   With the way he's pitched lately, the Braves have to like their
chances, especially considering where he's pitching. Glavine, who
finished out his season with three consecutive wins, including two
in postseason-caliber games against the Mets, is 8-0 in his last 10
starts in the Astrodome, going back to June of 1991.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm looking forward to it,'' Glavine said. ``If for no other
reason than you don't want to be sitting on the bench with somebody
else pitching in a game like that. ... I feel good about the way
I've been throwing the ball the last three starts, probably as
confident taking the mound as I've been all year.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astros beat the Braves only once in seven regular-season
meetings this year. Hampton was the guy to do it. He's many of the
Braves' choice for Cy Young, including Glavine and the Braves' top
candidate Kevin Millwood. Hampton is yet another left-hander who's
been compared to Glavine throughout his career. There's a point to
that. Both are groundball pitchers stubborn because they're around
the plate, but would rather walk a hitter than give him a decent
pitch to hit.
</P>
<P>
   Hampton has pitched Glavine-like of late, too, winning two
starts the Astros desperately needed to clinch their third
consecutive NL Central title.

BAY STATE VOTERS LEANING TOWARD BRADLEY: POLL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK PHILLIPS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ With questions of electability already dogging Vice
President Al Gore, Clinton-friendly Massachusetts voters are
delivering him another blow: A new poll shows Democrat Bill Bradley
leading Republican George W. Bush here by 14 points, while Bush
leads Gore by 7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The statewide survey, taken by the University of Massachusets'
McCormack Institute, also shows Bradley running 8 points ahead of
Gore among Democratic primary voters, 43 to 35 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The new survey marks an 11-point shift in Bradley's favor since
a UMass poll in June showed Gore leading the former New Jersey
senator, 38 to 35 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, Bradley's once longshot presidential candidacy
has started to surge, particularly in the Northeast. Recent polls
in New Hampshire and Rhode Island showed the two Democrats running
in dead heats, an astonishing turn-around given that only a few
months ago the vice president was expected to win handily.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Gore candidacy is in collapse in the Northeast,'' said Lou
DiNatale, director of UMass' McCormack Institute. ``This poll
confirms that at the very least this is going to be a race to the
convention. If the trend continues, it could even be a March
knockout by Bradley.''
</P>
<P>
   The poll _ taken Sept. 29 to Oct. 4 _ has a margin of error of
plus or minus 5 points among all 400 registered voters, and 6
points among the smaller sample of likely Democratic primary
voters.
</P>
<P>
   The survey shows Bradley attracting independent voters, women,
and high school and college graduates. In a race against Bush,
Bradley leads 48 to 34 percent, while Bush beats Gore, 46 to 39
percent. The Bradley survey comes in a state where Bill Clinton,
with Gore on his ticket, has rolled up some of his largest
electoral margins.
</P>
<P>
   On the state political level, the poll shows recent scandals in
Governor Paul Cellucci's administration have eroded the governor's
standing among voters. Cellucci's favorability has dropped 10
points since late June.
</P>
<P>
   The results show 59 percent of those surveyed approve of
Cellucci's performance. Another 29 percent disapprove, compared to
31 percent in June.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci's director of the Massachusetts Port Authority, Peter
Blute, was forced to resign in August after partying on a
state-funded ``booze cruise'' with lobbyists and young women.
Cellucci has also been criticized for the quality of some of his
appointments, including his selection of lobbyist Stephen Tocco to
head the board of higher education.
</P>
<P>
   The survey's findings in the presidential race also boost
Bradley's image as the strongest Democrat when he is paired against
another GOP contender, John McCain. Bradley holds a 25 percentage
lead over the Arizona Democrat, while McCain beat Gore with a 5
percent margin.
</P>
<P>
   While Gore may not score well in head-to-head contests with Bush
and Bradley, the vice president remains a relatively popular figure
among the Bay State's Democratic voters. Some 68 percent give him a
favorbale rating, while 25 percent rated him unfavorably. Another 7
percent offered no answer.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley gets a 70 percent favorably rating among the same group,
with only 8 percent rating him unfavorably. Another 22 percent had
no opinion.
</P>
<P>
   US Senator Edward M. Kennedy, who plans to seek his seventh full
term next year, is in a strong position with voters. In a trial
heat with Michael Sullivan, the Plymouth County district attorney
and likely possible Republican opponent, Kennedy receives 60
percent of the vote. Sullivan gets 23 percent.

MARSHALL CHESS STARTS OVER WITH NEW RECORDING LABEL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED SHUSTER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Pick up any book about the Rolling Stones' '70s
heyday and you'll find the name Marshall Chess.
</P>
<P>
   Go back even further to investigate the early days of rock 'n'
roll and blues and you'll also see the Chess name. Chicago's Chess
Records, co-founded by Marshall's father Leonard and uncle Phil,
was home to such greats as Muddy Waters, Chuck Berry, Little Walter
and Howlin' Wolf.
</P>
<P>
   The Chess catalog was acquired by MCA/Universal in 1985, while
Marshall, who runs a music publishing company, recently launched
his own label.
</P>
<P>
   The first release from CZYZ _ the original Chess family name
when they immigrated to the U.S. from Poland _ is ``2120'' by
Murali Coryell, son of jazz-fusion guitarist Larry Coryell. The
album is named after the historic address of Chess Studios at 2120
S. Michigan Ave., Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see the label like a small movie company _ give me an album
and a sequel and let's come up with a concept and idea,'' Chess
said. ``I'll work a record two years to make it happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Chess was hired by the Stones organization in the early '70s to
straighten out their contracts at a time when the band wanted to
start its own Rolling Stones Records imprint.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was around for the albums and tours,'' Chess recalls. ``I
left for survival reasons. I got out before the whole scene did me
in.''
</P>
<P>
   Chess came up with CZYZ two years ago when promoting Chess' 50th
anniversary, which MCA/Universal commemorated with a string of
re-releases and anthologies.
</P>
<P>
   ``People kept asking why I wasn't still making records,'' he
said. ``Blues had become a huge worldwide market.''
</P>
<P>
   CZYZ aims to capture the roots of urban blues, Chess says,
adding that Coryell's disc was cut on two-track in order to focus
on performance rather than perfection.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why was there so much magic in those early Chess records?'' he
asks. ``It was the performance. Today's records are done on
multitrack where you can make records in bits and pieces. But the
original records had to go down on tape as one, locked together.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
An Allstars moment
</P>
<P>
   The Long Beach Dub Allstars _ the seven-piece band formed two
years ago by surviving Sublime members Bud Gaugh and Eric Wilson _
cut their new album before offering it to labels.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took more than a year,'' explains RAS-1, the band's oddly
named guitarist-singer. ``We did it ourselves with nobody telling
us what to do. After that, we took it around and DreamWorks was
best because they were the least corporate of the majors.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Sublime's output, the Allstars' just-issued ``Right Back''
touches on reggae, hip-hop and rock. The band appears on Halloween
at the Hollywood Palladium with G. Love &AMP; Special Sauce and rapper
Kool Keith. &QL;

   The Stock Market And Social Security &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Turning to Wall Street for help may not solve Social Security's
potential problems, a group of researchers has found.
</P>
<P>
   Investing some Social Security taxes in the stock market will
not eliminate the program's projected deficit, they said. And under
some circumstances, the analysis concluded, it may even accelerate
it.
</P>
<P>
   Economists from Goldman Sachs, Invesco, Morgan Stanley Dean
Witter and J.P. Morgan did the research for the Committee on
Investment of Employee Benefit Assets, an association of corporate
pension plans based in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The economists considered three environments in which 50 percent
to 75 percent of the current surplus in Social Security taxes would
be invested in stocks. They concluded that if the market performed
in historical patterns, the year in which Social Security, without
any other changes, would technically be out of money would be
delayed from 2034, the current official projection, to between 2038
and 2046.
</P>
<P>
   But if the stock market dropped 20 percent to 30 percent during
the next five years, Social Security could run into a deficit as
early as 2032, they said.

   Up the Philanthropy Food Chain &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Philanthropy is about to show up on some high-definition radar
screens.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton and his wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, have
invited 150 leading donors, as well as young people and leaders of
foundations and other nonprofit groups, to the East Room on Oct. 22
for what is believed to be the first White House conference on
philanthropy.
</P>
<P>
   The group will ``take a look at the tradition of philanthropy
and giving in this country and new ways of looking at it,'' said
Marsha Berry, Mrs. Clinton's director of communication.
</P>
<P>
   Also this month, America Online's AOL Foundation plans to
introduce a philanthropic Web portal, which will connect donors and
volunteers to nonprofit groups, and link those groups to resources
on topics like management and fund-raising.
</P>
<P>
   The AOL Foundation has given a grant to the Benton Foundation in
Washington to help develop the site, called helping.org, and is
forming partnerships with nonprofit organizations to provide
content.
</P>
<P>
   A second philanthropic Web portal is also in the works. The
Surdna Foundation in New York has awarded $150,000 to Compumentor,
a nonprofit group in San Francisco, to create a technology portal
that will include links to help nonprofit groups find technical
assistance, donated and discounted software and information about
hardware.

MAN AND WOMAN MEET, DATE AND MATE IN FAUX DOCUMENTARY 
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GLENN WHIPP 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; LOS ANGELES _ ``The Mating Habits of the Earthbound Human''
(try saying that when you buy your ticket _ then again, don't)
attempts to appeal to people who like to watch animals do the wild
thing on the Discovery Channel. But, at the very least, nature
documentaries have a sense of wonder and surprise, two qualities in
short supply in this drab comedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mating Habits'' purports to be a documentary filmed by
extraterrestrials interested in human behavior. Glibly narrated by
``Frasier's'' David Hyde Pierce, this innocuous movie follows the
relationship of The Male (Mackenzie Astin) and The Female (Carmen
Electra) from their introduction at a ``sacred meeting place''
(nightclub) through courtship and various attempts to perpetuate
the species.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the film's humor is based on the fact that the alien
narrator accepts everything he sees at face value. Thus, birth
control is seen as a natural barrier (there are several too many
shots of men _ dressed up as sperm _ running into a padded wall)
and the humans' moaning and groaning during sex is taken as pain
endured for the sake of reproduction.
</P>
<P>
   As written and directed by sitcom veteran Jeff Abugov (he has
worked as story editor on ``Cheers,'' ``My Two Dads'' and ``The
Golden Girls), ``Mating Habits'' is intermittently amusing, with
Hyde Pierce's droll narration scoring a few points before
eventually becoming tedious. The film doesn't take itself
seriously, but, because it lacks much in the way of fresh insight,
its situations too often play like a bad episode of ``Beverly Hills
90210.''
</P>
<P>
   The two leads are perfectly adequate, although they never rise
above the undemanding material. ``Mating Habits'' features them in
numerous, discretely shot sex scenes, the tameness of which will
likely disappoint nature-loving adolescent boys _ no matter what
galaxy they hail from. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR;  &QL; 
The film: &LR;  ``The Mating Habits of the Earthbound Human'' (R; strong
sexuality and language). &UR;  &QL; 
The stars: &LR;  Mackenzie Astin, Carmen Electra and David Hyde
Pierce. &UR;  &QL;

CABINET MEMBERS TO SELL VIRTUES OF FREE TRADE IN PRE-WTO VISITS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MICHAEL PAULSON  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Three members of President Clinton's cabinet will
visit Washington state this month as part of a national effort to
talk up the benefits of global trade.
</P>
<P>
   The visits, which begin with a trip Friday by Transportation
Secretary Rodney Slater, are part of a broader effort by the
Clinton administration to sell its trade policy to the American
public in anticipation of the meeting of the World Trade
Organization in Seattle starting Nov. 30.
</P>
<P>
   Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Carol Browner and
Labor Secretary Alexis Herman also have scheduled Seattle visits.
</P>
<P>
   The trips come in the wake of criticisms by Sen. Patty Murray,
D-Wash., and others of the administration's efforts to promote the
virtues of global trade.
</P>
<P>
   Officials with the U.S. Trade Representative's office said they
expect Cabinet members, as well as top officials from the trade
representative's office, to fan out across the country over the
next seven weeks, promoting ``the benefits of trade and new
opportunities for American farmers and workers and families.''
</P>
<P>
   And U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky said in a
letter last week that the White House is looking for an opportunity
for Clinton to make a major trade speech prior to the Seattle
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Some Cabinet members, including Commerce Secretary Bill Daley
and Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman, have been traveling on
trade issues for months, but the efforts are being stepped up in
light of the concerns expressed by some environmental and labor
groups about the benefits of the WTO.
</P>
<P>
   Murray said she was delighted by the plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sen. Murray has urged the administration to make a forceful
case for the importance of trade, and sending Cabinet members and
asking USTR officials to go out around the country to articulate
the importance of trade is the strongest response we could have
hoped for,'' said Murray's spokeswoman, Tovah Ravitz.
</P>
<P>
   In a further effort to step up its courtship of concerned
constituencies, the White House this month will meet with groups
representing consumers, agriculture, labor, business and the
environmental movement, the U.S. Trade Representative's office
said. The Trade Representative's office said it has already been
consulting with many of those organizations for months about the
U.S. agenda for the WTO meeting, but that the White House visits
will provide a higher-profile opportunity for the groups to voice
their concerns.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. trade officials said it is possible that other Cabinet
members, including Daley and Glickman, could visit the state before
the WTO meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Daley and Glickman last week reported to the Senate Finance
Committee that U.S. trade policy has been a surprisingly tough sell
to the public.
</P>
<P>
   Daley, who has made five stops on his ``Trade Globally, Prosper
Locally: The National Trade Education Tour,'' said ``to be frank
with you, this has not been an easy sell, as you know. Many people
see only layoffs, they don't see the payoff of this open trading
system.''
</P>
<P>
   Glickman, whose agency held 12 ``listening sessions'' around the
country in anticipation of the WTO meeting, agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``This education tour ... has been rather difficult and, at
times, very disappointing, to be frank with you,'' he said. ``The
lack of understanding, first of all, by people who should
understand the benefits of this trading system of ours and,
obviously, the difficulty of getting a positive story through.''

AN EPIPHANY ABOUT LAWYERS  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, OCT. 10) 
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
 Steven Keeva is the author of ``Transforming Practices: Finding Joy
and Satisfaction in the Legal Life'' (Contemporary Books, 1999).  
 By STEVEN KEEVA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The first time I saw a lawyer cry, something shifted inside me.
</P>
<P>
   John A. was a litigator, perhaps 55, with silvering hair and an
air of contained kindness. I met him last year at a meeting on the
unlikely topic of law as a healing profession. In introducing
himself, he said he had always enjoyed his work _ until recently.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past, I wouldn't have even considered coming to a
gathering like this,'' he said. ``But now I've come hoping to find
some tools that lawyers and judges can use to look into themselves
and once again find the grandeur of the law.''
</P>
<P>
   My reason for being there wasn't all that different, except for
one thing. It wasn't so much the grandeur of the law that
interested me as it was the inner life of the lawyer, and how it
related to the widespread malaise that gripped the profession.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, I had been a legal journalist for the better part
of a decade and, like John A., I had started to feel uneasy,
troubled by what I heard _ and didn't hear _ in daily conversations
with lawyers and by a growing sense that what I did for a living
didn't matter.
</P>
<P>
   I yearned for the kind of work that justified a capital W. What
I had was a job _ a good one, but not Work.
</P>
<P>
   John A. began describing his career. But he soon fell into a
story that seemed in particular need of telling.
</P>
<P>
   It concerned a child whom he had represented early in his
career. The boy had been institutionalized for behavioral problems,
and after many months was desperate to go home. His parents were
ready to have him back, so John A. was hired to handle the
legalities. He did so, he recalled, with great passion, commitment
and success.
</P>
<P>
   As he described the day when the child was reunited with his
family, John A. turned inward, his eyes relaxing their focus. ``He
was so excited, so emotional,'' he recalled, ``and he asked me, `Do
you mean I really get to go home?' I told him yes, that's right,
and he smiled and said, `You are the greatest lawyer in the whole
world.'''
</P>
<P>
   John A.'s voice broke. His jaw trembled. As the tears came, the
room snapped to a higher level of cohesion; suddenly, we were all
there with him _ and for him.
</P>
<P>
   Each of us was a witness to his glimpse through time at buried
meaning.
</P>
<P>
   Something fuzzy had become absolutely clear to me: those same
tears had been there, sub rosa, in dozens of the lawyers with whom
I had talked. They were there in the comments about how much faster
the money was coming in compared with the satisfaction; in stories
about how ``a friend'' fantasized about natural disasters that
would make it impossible for him to reach the office, and in
grotesque jokes about how sad it was that so many billable hours
were lost to family events.
</P>
<P>
   John A. helped me understand what those suppressed tears were
about. Like so many of his colleagues who could not hold fast to a
vision of what the profession could be, he was seeking a way to
reconnect with a sense of purpose.
</P>
<P>
   The subsequent years, with their technical, pecuniary and
adversarial overlays had blocked out the warmth of those early days
and left him in the cold; he'd become wealthy, but alienated from
his chosen profession, and from himself.
</P>
<P>
   I'm grateful to John A. His tears helped me acknowledge the
grief that came from having lost my way professionally so that I
could then find real Work.
</P>
<P>
   The psychologist Abraham Maslow said that when a hammer is the
only tool you have, you tend to find that every problem looks like
a nail. Lawyers have fashioned effective analytical methods for
flushing legal issues from thickets of facts.
</P>
<P>
   Work, for me, now involves exploring the many tools that can
complement and enhance these legal hammers _ tools like compassion,
mindfulness, deep and committed listening, intuition and
re-visioning the law as a healing profession.
</P>
<P>
   When such tools are available, clients are seen for what they
are: not just legal problems, but multifaceted, whole people. &QL;

ARRESTS IN YOGURT SLAYINGS REOPEN OLD WOUNDS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN W. GONZALEZ 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Parents of the four teen-age girls slain in a
yogurt shop robbery in 1991 said this week's arrests of four young
men on capital murder charges suddenly reopened painful wounds that
may never heal.
</P>
<P>
   So doubtful were they that the case would ever be solved, one of
the parents said Thursday she long ago threw away a pamphlet for
crime victims about how to brace for an upcoming trial.
</P>
<P>
   In an emotional news conference, the parents expressed relief
that the case was finally cracked by Austin police. But they
indicated that convictions and even the death penalty won't end
their grieving _ or lessen their resolve to improve workplace
safety for minors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we've got to face the fact that the actual people who did
this... that we have to look at someone who actually pulled the
trigger on our children. The anxiety level is very high,'' said
Barbara Ayres, mother of murder victims Jennifer Harbison, 17, and
Sarah Harbison, 15.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we are really doing here is trying to beg you _ the press
and the public _ to not treat this as something to exploit, but to
respect our children's lives. It has not come to closure, and we
have not gone to court yet,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   James Thomas, father of victim Eliza Hope Thomas, 17, said he's
gratified that arrests were made.
</P>
<P>
   ``Personally, adaptation to loss of a loved one to homicide is a
difficult, gut-wrenching task, and I feel that I may accomplish
that someday,'' he said, adding, ``I will continue to need your
support as the matter makes its way through the legal process.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is my hope that bringing these people to justice will help
us all bring this episode to a close so we can get on with the good
things that we all do with our lives,'' Thomas said.
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Harbison and Eliza Thomas worked at the shop in a
northwest Austin strip mall; Sarah Harbison and a friend, Amy
Ayers, 13, were visiting the other girls at the shop around closing
time on the night of Dec. 6, 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the suspects provided written statements admitting they
cased the store earlier that day, propped a back door open and
returned after closing. With one of the suspects posted as a
lookout, the others robbed the store, bound and gagged the girls,
and shot each of them fatally in the head before setting the
business on fire, the confessions stated.
</P>
<P>
   Charged with four capital murder counts each are Maurice Pierce,
24, of Lewisville; Forrest Wellborn, 23, of Lockhart; Robert Burns
Springsteen Jr., 26, of Charleston, W.Va.; and Michael James Scott,
26, of Buda. All were arrested Wednesday and remained jailed,
pending indictment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard for me to believe that anybody could do what someone
did to our girls, much less kids,'' Ayres said. ``It's just hard
for me to imagine that somebody is capable of doing that, and it's
hard for me to imagine that they have walked around this long ...''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, none of the parents expressed annoyance at Wednesday's
revelation that police had nabbed one of the suspects eight days
after the killings on a weapons charge and released him _ even
after he admitted the gun was used in the girls' slayings. At the
time, police said the then-juvenile's account was unbelievable.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Ayers, Amy's father, said early on in the investigation, FBI
criminal profilers suggested to him that the culprits may have been
young acquaintances of the victims.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, we were prepared for that,'' Ayers said.
</P>
<P>
   Although the victims and suspects were of similar age, it's not
clear whether any of them knew each other.
</P>
<P>
   Ayers and his wife, Pam, said the arrests, which had been
reported as imminent several days ago, forced them to relive the
horror of the killings.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the starting point every time,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That doorbell rings,'' his wife added.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dec. 6, 1991 _ that's where we start,'' said Ayres, who said
she felt no particular emotion when she saw the suspects faces for
the first time in newspapers and newscasts.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what we want to know _ what happened. How it happened.
And what are we going to do as responsible adults so it doesn't
happen again. We want to know where these young people came from.
We want to know their background,'' Ayres said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to know how their lives got into murder _ how their
lifestyle became a murderous one. It's important to us. It's
important to people in Arkansas and Colorado and everyplace else
where they've had losses of life without good reason,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ayres and the others used proceeds from a legal settlement with
the shop owners to start a foundation called ``We Will Not Forget
SAJE`` _ the initials of the girls' first names. The organization
has lobbied for improved workplace security, especially where
minors are alone on duty, as their daughters were.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until we know exactly what happened, we will not be able to
protect the children that we have working now. That's our mission _
to protect the rest of the children who have a right to work and
are working,'' Ayres said.

10TH MONTH, RED SOX COLLAPSES GO HAND IN HAND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN SHAUGHNESSY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND _ The shadows grew long, the game got out of hand, and
back in New England, Wednesday's disappointment yielded to
Thursday's despair.
</P>
<P>
   Just what is it about October, New England's best month, that
brings out the worst in the Red Sox? The list of Sure Things In
Life now includes death, taxes, bad movies by Kevin Costner, and
Red Sox collapses in the 10th month.
</P>
<P>
   The estimable Peter Pascarelli, a Boston native now a reporter
for ESPN, walked around the batting cage before Thursday's 11-1
Cleveland win over Boston and said, ``Pedro is now day-to-day, and
Red Sox fans are century-to-century.''
</P>
<P>
   Time to bring in George W. Bush with the Alamo Speech. Or maybe
have Ms. Jimy Williams make game shirts with silkscreens of past
Red Sox world championship teams.
</P>
<P>
   So sad. Your Red Sox, this overachieving, hardscrabble band of
ballplayers, has been reduced to late-night monologue fodder. They
are the Susan Lucci of sport. Erica on ``All My Children'' is 1 for
19 at the Emmys, and the Sox are now 1 for 19 in postseason play
since Bruce Hurst beat the Mets in Game 5 of the 1986 World Series.
Who knew the fallout from Bill Buckner's error would carry into the
new millennium?
</P>
<P>
   What to do?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know,'' said Williams. ``Maybe I'll just get a hold of
George Herman (Ruth). I don't know. What do you want me to do?''
</P>
<P>
   The manager is deep into Bambino references as the sand runs out
on the Sox season. He's been carrying a Baby Ruth candy bar around
for good luck and noted that he was in room 1916 (the year the Babe
beat the Dodgers in the World Series) at the Sox hotel in
Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   Like all those who came before them, the 1999 Boston ballplayers
insisted that they had nothing to do with their forefathers. All
the bad stuff happened before they became Red Sox. But like the
teams of '86, '88, '90, '95, and '98, the Red Sox of 1999 are
adding a chapter to the haunted playoff history of the franchise
(a.k.a. ``The Misses of October''), feeding the fickle fan base and
media monster that's devoured the Olde Towne Team since 1918.
</P>
<P>
   Too bad. The Sons of Jimy Williams deserve better. This was a
team from which nothing was expected. They were resilient and
noble, winning 94 games and throwing off every challenge they
faced. But it would appear that nothing _ no measure of health,
heart, or heroism _ is bigger than the beast that stalks this team
when the leaves fall from the trees.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Wakefield, a veteran of Sox postseason humblings at the
hands of the Indians in '95, '98, and '99, admitted, ``It's
frustrating, but you can't take away what we've accomplished all
year. It's unfair. This reminds me a lot of '95 when we played well
in the first game. I can't explain it. I don't know. We played 'em
well all year.'' Boston was 8-4 vs. Cleveland during the regular
season.
</P>
<P>
   Sox frustrations aside, Cleveland has played near flawless
baseball in the first two games of the series. The Tribe have held
the Sox to three runs in 18 innings and gloved everything that
moved. Remember that these Indians are the first major league team
to score 1,000 runs in a season since the 1950 Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   There still is a chance, of course. The Sox could come home,
revert to regular-season form, and spank the Tribe twice _ forcing
a winner-take-all Game 5 Monday at Jacobs Field. But is there
anyone in New England, anyone in the Boston clubhouse, who believes
that is going to happen? With ace Pedro Martinez on the shelf with
a bad back? With Bret Saberhagen done for the series after one of
his worst outings of the year? With a Limp Bizkit lineup and
potential starters named Ramon Martinez, Kent Mercker, and
Undecided?
</P>
<P>
   Thursday at the Jake the Sox were exposed in ugly fashion. Jose
Offerman failed to turn a double play in the third, which opened
the gates. Saberhagen, who walked only 11 batters in 119 innings,
walked three in the third and did not leave before giving up a
whopping six runs. The Sox issued nine walks on the day.
</P>
<P>
   Saberhagen was replaced by John ``Way Back'' Wasdin. True to
form, Way Back yielded a grand slam to Jim Thome in the fourth and
the rout was on.
</P>
<P>
   ``What can you say about it?'' asked a frustrated Nomar
Garciaparra. ``The score speaks for itself. They just beat us. They
took it to us.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the most lopsided loss in Boston's ghoulish postseason
history.
</P>
<P>
   ``A five-game series is almost unfair in a way,'' said center
fielder Darren Lewis. ``If you don't jump out right away, it's like
you're in a hole from the beginning.''
</P>
<P>
   And so they are. It is October and the Red Sox are where they
have been every October since World War I. They are one loss away
from elimination. The series resumes at 4 p.m. Saturday at Fenway.

<TEXT>
<P>
   MCCOOK, Ill. _ Mike Lynch would probably have stumped the panel
on the old ``What's My Line.'' His twinkly blue eyes, impishly
salty language and well-cut suits would point to hard-driving real
estate type, maybe, or brash young entrepreneur.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Michael W. Lynch has been both those things. But at
39, what he is _ incongruously to many, but logically in his mind _
is a metals man who loves playing David to corporate Goliaths.
</P>
<P>
   He burst into the public consciousness in August, when his real
estate investment company, Michigan Avenue Partners _ or, more
accurately, its McCook Metals subsidiary _ offered to top a bid by
Alcoa Inc. to buy Reynolds Metals. Neither Reynolds management nor
its shareholders paid him much mind, and Reynolds has accepted
Alcoa's offer. But anyone who thinks that is the end of McCook's
bid has not met Lynch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a street fighter, and if someone tells me I can't do
something, I get an endorphin rush,'' Lynch said in his rapid-fire
style. Neither Reynolds shareholders nor Justice Department
regulators, who recently asked Alcoa and Reynolds for more
information, have passed on the merger, so he has not abandoned
``the dragon slayer'' _ his nickname for his Reynolds project.
</P>
<P>
   His tenacity does not surprise friends and colleagues. ``Mike is
very competitive, and capitalism gives him the biggest
scoreboard,'' said Scott Miller, who was a Chi Psi fraternity
brother of his at the University of Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   Dominic Forte, one of Lynch's partners, agreed. ``He gets an
emotional charge from taking on the corporate giants,'' he said.
``He's flamboyant, and he's not intimidated by anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   The oldest of seven children, Lynch grew up with ``mixed
messages all over the place,'' as he tells it. Money was ample, but
his father kept the purse strings tight, and Lynch had to work odd
jobs in college.
</P>
<P>
   His parents split 11 years ago, and he has not spoken with his
father in eight years. The only blood relative to whom he is really
close is his maternal grandfather. ``He loved my grandmother to the
end _ he is the epitome of loyalty, he is my mentor,'' Lynch said.
His grandfather turns 90 in February, and Lynch is chartering a jet
to treat him to a weekend trip.
</P>
<P>
   But none of this answers the obvious question: What is Michael
Lynch, political science and economics major and real estate pro,
doing in the grubby world of metals?
</P>
<P>
   In one sense, it was a logical progression. He gravitated
naturally toward real estate, an area in which competitive
instincts and a gift of gab go far. After a stint as a broker for
CB Commercial, he and a partner formed Michigan Avenue Partners to
develop a property on that famous Chicago street.
</P>
<P>
   It was 1991, the depth of the real estate depression, and
Michigan Avenue picked up several plum properties at bargain
prices. ``I saw grown men cry in bankruptcy court, and I vowed I'd
never live off debt,'' Lynch said.
</P>
<P>
   He eventually bought out his partner, took on new ones and
continued trawling for depressed real estate. Then, last year, he
heard that Reynolds wanted to sell its McCook works, an old
aluminum plant that sprawled across 265 acres just west of Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Most prospective buyers viewed the plant in terms of its
products. But he saw a prime piece of real estate, ripe for an
industrial park.
</P>
<P>
   He bought it _ and realized almost immediately that McCook was
overpaying for everything, from materials to electricity to
insurance. ``They had people negotiating contracts who should have
been teaching school,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lynch convinced Reynolds' former suppliers to cut prices. He
modernized the plant. And he successfully fought Alcoa in court,
retaining the right to use technologies Alcoa had licensed to
Reynolds.
</P>
<P>
   The results may give Lynch the best of both worlds: he is moving
the aluminum operations onto half the site and may build an
industrial park on the rest.
</P>
<P>
   He has since bought Scottsboro Aluminum, Great Lakes Metals and
various other metals plants, bringing the book value of McCook's
metals asset base to nearly $1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mike Lynch is an old-time wheeler-dealer who knows how to buy
cheap, cut costs, and make a whole lot of money,'' said Lloyd T.
O'Carroll, a metals analyst at Scott &AMP; Stringfellow Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Lynch is also spreading that cash around. A lapsed Catholic but
a devout Christian _ ``I believe in the Bible, but the church is
run by dysfunctional men,'' he said _ he has designated $2 million
for a McCook charitable foundation.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a little boy he dreamed of owning businesses, making
millions, and using them to help others,'' said Kimberlee Lynch,
his wife of seven years, who is expecting their third child, a son,
later this month. ``People say he's pompous, but he's not. He's
incredibly focused, and he wants to do good in this world.''
</P>
<P>
   He puts in grueling hours and rarely sleeps more than five
hours. In August, after he became so distracted during a phone
conversation that he nearly lost control of his car, he finally
hired a driver. The driver picks him up at 5:30 a.m. and rarely
delivers him back home until 7:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Lynch finds time to read the Bible with his 7-year-old
twin daughters, to garden at his home in Lake Forest, the Chicago
suburb, and even to take some naps. That practically makes him the
household sluggard.
</P>
<P>
   His wife, who never naps, gleaned her own seven-figure income
last year as a part-time insurance agent and distributor for
Starlight International's health food supplements _ many of which
Lynch takes at her behest.
</P>
<P>
   ``He chills and winds down at home,'' she said. ``When he's
here, he's really all here.''

REVAMPING THE VARIABLE ANNUITY TO MAKE IT MORE COMPETITIVE  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, OCT. 10) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass.)   (af)  
 By JOSEPH B. TREASTER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The variable annuity, that odd combination of mutual fund and
insurance policy, has picked up a reputation for being too complex
for most people to understand, not to mention overly expensive when
compared with a pure mutual fund.
</P>
<P>
   But fairly straightforward variable annuities with low fees do
exist, and, lately, the costs for these basic models have fallen
even lower.
</P>
<P>
   Just a few weeks ago, TIAA-CREF, which has been providing
pension plans for educators for decades, introduced a new variable
annuity for the general public with a fee of a little more than
one-third of one percent, or about one-sixth as much as the average
variable annuity.
</P>
<P>
   About the same time, Fidelity Investments, the big mutual fund
company, stopped charging a fee that most companies apply to
variable annuity accounts that are closed earlier than expected.
And the Vanguard Group, known for its low-cost mutual funds, shaved
a basis point _ one hundredth of a percentage point _ off the cost
of its already inexpensive variable annuities.
</P>
<P>
   All of these investments are aimed at the relatively
self-sufficient investor, and the companies that offer them pride
themselves on the annuities' simplicity.
</P>
<P>
   They work like this: People put their money into accounts that
in most respects are similar to mutual funds, with returns that
rise or fall with the market; indeed, many are run by fund
managers. A portion of the annual fee for the variable annuity pays
for life insurance that protects the investor's estate against a
dip in the market: if the investor dies, the heirs are assured of
getting at least the amount invested; if the investor lives, he or
she has to absorb any loss in value.
</P>
<P>
   Variable annuities also have an advantage that they share with
401(k) plans and similar accounts: earnings are tax-deferred.
Income tax is paid only when the money is withdrawn, and then at
the taxpayer's rate at that time. Money can be withdrawn from a
variable annuity all at once, in a few lump-sum payments or as a
stream of regular payments until death.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the more expensive variable annuities go beyond
protecting just the invested principal, by guaranteeing minimum
annual growth of, say, 4 percent or 5 percent, regardless of what
the market does. Such annuities relieve worries about the market's
ups and downs, though given the long-term upward trend in the
market over recent decades, some investors may not see such
protection as necessary. The growth guarantee can be set up to
benefit the investor or the estate, with separate charges for each
option.
</P>
<P>
   So far, low-cost versions are just a tiny fraction of the
variable-annuity market. Industry analysts say TIAA-CREF and the
other low-cost operators are fighting for bigger shares of that
small pie, while holding out hope that the pie will grow.
</P>
<P>
   But analysts say the tide does not seem to be running that way.
``If you look across the financial services field, there is a
movement toward advice,'' said Eric Speer, a specialist on variable
annuities for Tillinghast-Towers Perrin, the consulting firm.
``With variable annuities and mutual funds, more and more of the
business is being sold through adviser channels,'' rather than
directly.
</P>
<P>
   By selling a variable annuity, advisers _ typically brokers and
financial planners _ can make a commission of up to 7 percent from
the insurance company that offers the investment. That compares
with a commission of up to 5.75 percent for a mutual fund.
</P>
<P>
   As with some mutual funds, customers pay the commission out of
pocket _ in part or in full, on a sliding scale _ only if they
redeem the annuity in less than five or seven years.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, mainly because of the insurance features,
variable-annuity investors pay average annual fees of a little more
than 2 percent of the value of their investment, compared with 1.55
percent for the average stock mutual fund.
</P>
<P>
   Like no-load mutual funds, though, low-cost variable annuities
pay no sales commissions, so advisers have no incentive to sell
them. Customers must do business directly with the annuity
companies, using the phone, the mails and computers. And while
cutting out the adviser keeps costs low _ the total cost of a
Vanguard annuity, for example, is just 0.57 percent a year _
legions of investors do not want to make the journey alone.
</P>
<P>
   The companies that pay commissions to advisers emphasize the
value of a broker's advice. Jim Folwell of Cerulli Associates, a
consulting firm in Boston, says that while it is difficult to put a
precise value on the advice, ``there is definitely some value added
when a good financial adviser can position you in the right
product.''
</P>
<P>
   But consumer advocates and the low-cost operators suggest that
the advice might not be all that valuable. It seems only natural,
they say, that brokers and financial planners would be inclined to
recommend annuities that offer them the most profit.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, the critics say, that means selling less than the
best variable annuity available or selling one to customers who
should be investing in something else.
</P>
<P>
   For example, consumer advocates say investors should put money
into variable annuities only after they have already made the
maximum contributions to 401(k) programs, which are generally less
expensive. People who might need to withdraw money in less than
five to seven years should steer clear of variable annuities, the
consumer advocates say, because many companies charge penalties for
earlier withdrawals.
</P>
<P>
   For those who are interested, the choice is not absolutely
between turning to a broker for guidance and doing it yourself,
said Dennis D. Foley, a vice president at TIAA-CREF who has
overseen variable annuities and mutual funds there for nearly 20
years. While he acknowledged that the low-cost investments may well
appeal to a more independent sort, his company and others that deal
directly with consumers will go over the details of their products
and help with a selection.
</P>
<P>
   ``All our people on the phones are well trained to help you make
your decision,'' he said. ``The same telephone centers handle
variable annuities and mutual funds. Our people are on salary, and
they are not motivated to steer clients into one product or the
other.''

FOR WW II B-17 VETS, THIS IS THEIR FINAL MISSION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ED OFFLEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Wilbur Richardson stooped under the plexiglas nose of
the B-17F parked at the Museum of Flight and stared at the gun
turret protruding from the belly of the restored World War II
bomber.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very cold in there,'' said the former staff sergeant
and gunner, now a 77-year-old retiree. ``On flights it usually was
minus-40 degrees and on one mission I saw it get down to 72 below
zero.''
</P>
<P>
   Three wizened comrades nodded, their eyes gleaming with
memories.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson hunched over to explain. ``We kept warm with
electrically heated suits, but in there your knees were in your
eyeballs.''
</P>
<P>
   They survived the hellish skies over Nazi-occupied Europe nearly
six decades ago, bombing German targets, suffering enormous losses
from anti-aircraft artillery and Luftwaffe fighters. They flew
missions lasting as long as 12 hours, often limping back to England
with engines shot away and blood on the decks. And as part of the
``Mighty Eighth'' Air Force, they formed bonds of friendship that
have endured to this day.
</P>
<P>
   But for the men of the 94th Bomb Group, U.S. Army Air Corps, the
end is in sight. Time has accomplished what the enemy could never
do, and by mutual agreement, the airmen are staging their their
last mission _ one final reunion _ in Seattle this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our average age is the mid-70s to early 80s,'' said reunion
coordinator Colin Storey, who as a 1st lieutenant survived 35
combat missions with the group. ``We've lost so many of our key
members.''
</P>
<P>
   Age and illness have shrunk the veterans group from 4,000 in
wartime to about 1,200 today. Only 320 veterans and about 400
family members made the trip to Seattle, Storey said.
</P>
<P>
   But long before the passage of time eroded their ranks, there
was the German army and air force to contend with.
</P>
<P>
   They were part of an aerial armada unprecedented in military
history and not duplicated since. Formed in 1942, the Eighth Air
Force by war's end in May 1945 had 350,000 airmen and support
personnel including 210,000 aircrew members. They suffered
horrendous losses, with 26,000 killed in action. According to
military historian Gerald Astor, the mortality rate of 12.38
percent was four times higher than the Marine Corps and six times
as severe as the Army.
</P>
<P>
   The 94th Bomb Group, with 186 Boeing-built B-17s, was one of 22
groups that flew the B-17. They lost more than 100 aircraft and
hundreds of personnel killed or taken prisoner in their three years
of combat, Storey said.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Young shrugged when asked to recount his experiences.
</P>
<P>
   ``The aircraft was easy to fly but it was rough on those
8-9-hour flights,'' the 83-year-old Texan said. ``You'd come back
with blisters on your hands after gripping the yoke so long.''
</P>
<P>
   Navigator Elmer Ruehlmann said his most vivid mission came in
early 1945 when he, Storey and eight crewmates lost two of four
engines to enemy flak over Geisen, Germany. Unable to maintain
altitude, they played hide-and-seek with German fighters for more
than three hours while flying ``from cloud to cloud'' before making
a safe landing in Belgium, said Ruehlmann, a Sequim resident.
</P>
<P>
   There were still a few hours left for reminiscing and laughter
before the final mission ends Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll have our final banquet and closing ceremony,'' Storey
said. ``And that will be that.''

<P>
   CLEVELAND _ Jim Thome has been a colossal failure in the
postseason.
</P>
<P>
   He's been to the playoffs for the past five seasons, and in that
time, the Indians first baseman and No. 5 hitter has managed a
pathetic .229 average, mustering a mere 36 hits in 157 at-bats.
True failure.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, 14 of those hits have been home runs, a total
surpassed by only three men, Hall of Famers all, in history: Mickey
Mantle (18), Reggie Jackson (18), and Babe Ruth (15). And four of
Thome's homers have come in consecutive games, dating back to last
year's American League Championship Series. And two of (italics)
those (end italics) have been grand slams, a feat matched by no one
in baseball history. Now that's colossal.
</P>
<P>
   This season's Division Series reunion with the Red Sox has been
typical Thome. He has two hits in the first two games -- a two-run
sixth-inning homer that tied the opener, paving the way for a 3-2
Cleveland comeback, and a fourth-inning grand slam Thursday that
put the final chokehold on an 11-1 manhandling of the Sox.
</P>
<P>
   Other than that, Thome hasn't done a thing.
</P>
<P>
   But as the Indians fly to Boston on a 2-0 cloud in this
best-of-five series, be assured that this will not be a topic of
conversation: Why does Thome go boom or bust in October, either
hanging his head as he returns to the dugout or accepting a chorus
of salutes as he dances across home plate?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's probably one of those things that is best left
unexplained,'' said manager Mike Hargrove. ``Just be thankful that
it happens.''
</P>
<P>
   Omar Vizquel, whose two-run triple off Bret Saberhagen in the
third inning Thursday erased a 1-0 deficit that the Indians soon
obliterated, believes Thome ``is probably a little more patient in
the postseason.''
</P>
<P>
   So patient that he'll only settle for homers?
</P>
<P>
   ``That's one of those things I can't explain,'' said Vizquel,
nodding in the direction of Thome's locker and speaking just loud
enough for his teammate to hear. ``Only Jim Thome can explain it.''
</P>
<P>
   No he can't. But that didn't prevent him from complementing his
eye black with a huge smile as he dressed a half-hour after the
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It kind of happened during the season when I struck out 171
times,'' said Thome, neglecting to mention that he also batted .277
with 33 homers and 108 RBIs, a typical year for him. ``Seriously,
it's tough to explain. I'm fortunate to have good batters around me
and getting good pitches to hit.''
</P>
<P>
   Thome was only one of several Indians who savored some
delectable pitches Thursday. Vizquel's triple was followed by
Roberto Alomar's run-scoring double and Harold Baines's three-run
homer in the six-run third off Bret Saberhagen. In the five-run
fourth, Thome launched a John Wasdin offering 384 feet into the
right-field bleachers for the slam that really was superfluous
except in a historical context.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hitting today was kind of contagious,'' said Thome.
``After Harold's three-run shot, everyone relaxed in the dugout.''
</P>
<P>
   But in the Thome household in heartland America, they're excited
about the company he's keeping.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until someone mentions (his place on the all-time postseason
homer list), I never think of it,'' he said. ``Being a kid from
Peoria, I never have thought about having my name mentioned in that
group. That's what my dad said -- it's kind of neat to have my name
mentioned with those guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Thome may not give himself many opportunities, but he certainly
doesn't waste the ones he does.

Stephenville fans shake their loaded cans 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STACY FEDUCIA 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   STEPHENVILLE, Texas _ The caravan of can fans left for Brownwood
this morning, around the time they should have been leaving for
work.
</P>
<P>
   Coffee cans, paint cans, a steel trash can, an oversized oil
drum on a hand-cranked spit and about 80 freon bottles filled with
scores of half-inch ball bearings rumbled down U.S. 377, intent on
transforming hallowed Gordon Wood Stadium into a venerable den of
din.
</P>
<P>
   ``Representatives of the Can Fan Club will be at the gates at
10:30 a.m., just to make sure we get a good place in line to get
the right seating location,'' explained Dennis Hakes, a dairy
farmer who is credited with starting the freon-bottle caucus of the
Original Can Fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``The philosophy on can shaking depends on who we're playing,''
Hakes continued. ``For a team like Brownwood, we'll do about 30
minutes of pregame shaking on the sidelines so the other team can
see that they're not only playing our team, they're also playing
the stands.''
</P>
<P>
   When state No. 1-ranked Stephenville (5-0, 2-0) travels to
Brownwood (4-1, 1-1) tonight for the 62nd meeting of one of the
state's oldest rivalries, they will be playing out a story that
should be written in CAPITAL LETTERS, a story set to a soundtrack
of Scud missiles, a story of a man and his can.
</P>
<P>
   It was 1989 _ four years before Stephenville won the first of
its three Class 4A state championships and one year after the
Yellow Jackets had broken a 23-game losing streak to Brownwood with
a 7-7 tie _ and Dr. Steve Steed was sitting at his kitchen table,
lamenting the fact that Yellow Jackets games ``sounded like a
graveyard.''
</P>
<P>
   Having finished a snack of peanuts, Steed's son, T.J., replaced
the lid on the can and ``started to act like a 12-year-old, jumping
up and down screaming.''
</P>
<P>
   More than earache was born.
</P>
<P>
   Steed carried a sackful of coffee cans filled with nuts, bolts
and nails to a pregame tailgate party and offered them with simple
instructions: ``Anybody who has a can has to bring it back and
bring two more.''
</P>
<P>
   His garage became an assembly line, manned by bankers, truck
drivers, accountants, doctors, workers from FMC Fluid Control. He'd
return from work to find a year's worth of coffee cans on his front
porch. The local newspaper began running a ``Can Fan of the Week''
feature.
</P>
<P>
   The effort culminated in a drive yielding more than 700 cans to
be assembled for the Yellow Jackets' 1989 first-round playoff game
against Belton, but the line shut down at 250 when they ran out of
nuts, bolts and nails.
</P>
<P>
   FMC Fluid Control came to the rescue, donating almost 1,000
pounds of ball bearings, a tradition that has continued to this
day. In fact, FMC Fluid Control also built The Big Can _ the
Stephenville equivalent of a touchdown bell that is shaken after
every score.
</P>
<P>
   ``Year after year, we bring it into the plant and retrofit it
and put new ball bearings and grease in it,'' explained plant
manager John Moore, who also donates a case of earplugs for every
game. ``We could have 7,000 people in the stands and about 75
percent of them will have cans. Everybody becomes a real can fan
over the course of their lifetime.''
</P>
<P>
   Some, more than others: This being Texas, it was only a small
time _ four years _ before someone like Hakes would stumble upon a
freon bottle at the dairy and fire up his welder and lose what
schoolteachers call ``the inside voice.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The little cans didn't make enough noise for us,'' said Hakes,
who does upper-body workouts with the Yellow Jackets football
players in order to rattle his bottle with maximum effect. ``We
started with singles, then we would weld 'em end-to-end and that's
a double-barrel, and we have some that are four across and those
are quadruple barrels. They only last about a season, because if
you're real vigorous, you know, the metal becomes kind of fatigued
and it doesn't ring as good.''
</P>
<P>
   Translation: It doesn't produce the audible quality of a column
of tanks rolling by, which is something opponents have to consider
when they schedule Stephenville.
</P>
<P>
   ``You take the loudest jam box you can find and get a sound
effects soundtrack and play it the entire practice. That's how we
did it,'' Richland coach Bob Briscoe said of the preparation for
his 1999 season opener. ``We didn't copy the sound of the freon
bottles, but we had bombs and stampedes and nuclear explosions. To
be quite honest, when we got out there at the game, we didn't
notice the noise, but we've never done that for anybody but them.''
</P>
<P>
   Some schools have managed to silence the cans, only because of
community noise-pollution policies. Even then, the Stephenville Can
Fans have made their presence known.
</P>
<P>
   ``Round Rock wouldn't let noisemakers inside their stadium last
year,'' said Steed, the chairman of the business systems department
at Tarleton State. ``So, in protest, we took canned goods and left
them at the gate for their school to donate to charity because
we're going to take our cans.''
</P>
<P>
   Last season, they took an estimated 10,000 cans to Texas Stadium
for the Class 4A state championship game against LaMarque.
Tonight's planned can cacophony against Brownwood could well
approach that, if not in number, then in decibel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Different games require different levels of can-fan support,''
Stephenville head coach Art Briles said. ``As the playoffs come up,
they gear up and turn loose a little more. I think it'll be a
playoff-type atmosphere tonight. To us, the cans are music to our
ears.''
</P>
<P>
   As long as they remember the earplugs.

BY BUILDING A COALITION, UTILITY RESOLVES PRICKLY ISSUES ON DAMS  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, OCT. 10)

<TEXT>
<P>
   For decades in the Pacific Northwest, hydroelectric dams have
generated as much conflict as electricity.
</P>
<P>
   Many environmentalists, sports fishermen and Indian groups have
opposed the relicensing of such dams and have succeeded in getting
a few small ones to be taken down.
</P>
<P>
   The utilities, of course, backed by many of the businesses and
farmers who depend on the cheap power, want the dams relicensed and
left alone. To avoid serious negotiations with their opponents,
they have often opted for one-year license extensions.
</P>
<P>
   Now, one utility, Avista Corp., formerly the Washington Water
Power Co., has found a middle ground. Over a four-year period, it
hammered out a compromise with a multitude of environmental
organizations, sports fishing groups, Indian tribes and federal and
state agencies. Now it has an agreement to relicense two of its
largest hydroelectric dams, avoiding the confrontation and lawsuits
that have held up the process for scores of other dams.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement, which would run for 45 years, calls for a
wide-ranging, $225 million restoration program for fish and
wildlife. Avista filed its application with the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission last February and expects approval by early
next year.
</P>
<P>
   The commission has encouraged such an approach, called
alternative licensing, in recent years in order to speed up the
relicensing process _ an important issue because 11,500 megawatts
of hydroelectric power are up for renewal before 2010.
</P>
<P>
   About 40 percent of the cases now before the federal agency have
used forms of alternative licensing, and the agency has issued
about five new licenses to utilities that have chosen the method.
</P>
<P>
   The collaborative effort by Avista is one of the largest and
most ambitious so far. ``They did a great job using this process,''
said Ann Miles, the chief of licensing for the commission's West
Branch.
</P>
<P>
   Larry La Bolle, the general manager of hydropower development at
Avista, who led the company's effort, said that until the recent
compromise, relicensing was far more confrontational. Groups that
opposed relicensing typically put their demands on the table, but
the utility, seeing the demands as unreasonable would do little
negotiating. Instead it kept getting one-year extensions from the
energy agency, which are allowed under its rules. There was ``very
little incentive to settle,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But he decided that over their longer term there were good
reasons to settle.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, having a clear license will let the utility
operate much more nimbly and keep its focus on the fast-changing
environment of deregulation, he said. For another, delaying tactics
like the one-year extensions often deepen the frustration of the
opposition, which digs in and often escalates its demands.
</P>
<P>
   The traditional battles have led to prolonged stalemates and
enormous costs. A study by the Idaho National Engineering
Laboratory in 1997, for example, found that regulatory actions on
hydropower nationwide had cost about $7 billion since 1980.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the longest cases, involving the Cushman project in
Washington state, the city of Tacoma has been seeking a new license
for more than 20 years. It is still locked in disputes with various
groups including the federal agency, which has said that in order
to get a new license the city must agree to add measures to protect
fish. The city regards the measures as too costly.
</P>
<P>
   To avoid such a deadlock on the Avista dams, La Bolle brought
all the parties together to see if their issues could be resolved.
Much was at stake for the utility: The two dams, the Cabinet Gorge,
with a capacity of 231 megawatts on the Clark Fork River in
northern Idaho, and Noxon Rapids, with 466 megawatts of capacity in
western Montana, make up 40 percent of the utility's generating
capacity.
</P>
<P>
   As an incentive and a measure of good will, the utility offered
to spend money to help fish and wildlife and to improve water
quality _ even before a new license was issued.
</P>
<P>
   It also adopted what it called a ``living license'' approach.
Instead of having everything locked in for 45 years, both sides can
seek to amend the deal, provided they can agree on the terms.
</P>
<P>
   There were also some perks. The utility paid expenses like
travel for most of the 100 people and 39 organizations that
eventually joined in. They included federal and state agencies from
Idaho and Montana, five Indian tribes, conservation organizations
and property owners.
</P>
<P>
   La Bolle said the most difficult task was to persuade two key
federal agencies, the Forest Service and the Fish and Wildlife
Service, to enter the agreement. Those agencies can order a utility
to mitigate its impact on wildlife and the environment, and were
reluctant to give up that power.
</P>
<P>
   ``Originally we viewed it skeptically,'' said Larry Lockard, a
biologist with the Fish and Wildlife Service. ``We have some
regulatory authority to get what we want.'' However, he added, that
power was largely useless in the absence of agreements, which
sometimes cannot be reached for decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``The company's agreement to early implementation of all the
mitigation programs was really a big carrot for us,'' he said.
About $1 million is already being spent on passages that will allow
fish to swim past the dams, and on improvements in water quality.
</P>
<P>
   Another group that played a large role was Trout Unlimited, a
conservation group based in Washington, D.C., that seeks to help
restore trout and salmon mostly in the Northwest, where most
hydroelectric dams are located.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took a lot of guts for them to do it,'' said Steven Moyer,
vice president for conservation at Trout Unlimited, referring to
Avista and La Bolle. ``They brought in groups that could very
confrontational.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They knew they couldn't avoid a fight,'' Moyer added. ``What
they decided is to have the fight in a small room with all the
stakeholders rather than in the press and in the courts, which is
the usual way.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of the agreement calls for a $94 million restoration
program for bull trout.
</P>
<P>
   He said other utilities, like the Portland General Electric Co.,
which wants to relicense a dam on the Deschutes River in Oregon,
were trying the concept but were not as far along as Avista was.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the right way to this,'' he added. ``It's a model
effort.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The scientists in charge of maintaining the safety
and reliability of the nation's nuclear arsenal said Thursday that
they might not be able to do their job without nuclear tests that
would be outlawed under a test ban treaty.
</P>
<P>
   The directors of the country's three nuclear weapons
laboratories testified that while the nation's nuclear stockpile is
safe and reliable now, the future is less sure because of budget
uncertainties, aging weapons, shortages of trained experts and a
science-based substitute for actual nuclear tests that will not be
fully ready for five to 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   The tempered testimony by the scientists on the consequences of
Senate ratification of an accord banning underground nuclear tests
contrasted with the upbeat defense of the pact by their boss,
Energy Secretary Bill Richardson, who declared that the treaty
would help halt the spread of nuclear weapons, improve national
security and make Americans ``more safe in an uncertain world.''
</P>
<P>
   The scientists took pains to qualify each of those assertions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether on balance the effect of a test ban to retard
proliferation and further development of nuclear weapons is worth a
similar penalty on the U.S. nuclear arsenal is the real crux of the
dilemma,'' C. Paul Robinson, director of Sandia National
Laboratories in New Mexico, told the Senate Armed Services
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Since the United States suspended underground nuclear testing in
1992, it has relied on sophisticated computer models and
non-nuclear explosive tests to certify annually that the stockpile
is safe and reliable. Under a safeguard attached to the treaty, the
directors' failure to certify the stockpile would be grounds for
the United States to withdraw from the pact.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are confident in the stockpile today,'' said John C.
Browne, director of the Los Alamos National Laboratory in New
Mexico. ``The issue is whether we will have the people, the
capabilities and the national commitment to maintain this
confidence in the future when we expect to see more significant
changes in the weapons.''
</P>
<P>
   The directors have reason for concern. The House this year cut
$600 million from the administration's $4.5 billion request for the
scientific testing regime, called the Stockpile Stewardship
Program. Senators prevailed to restore almost all the funding.
</P>
<P>
   Allegations of mismanagement and spying at the labs, new
mandatory lie-detector tests and restrictions on scientific
exchanges have hurt efforts to recruit new specialists.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before long our nuclear-test veterans will be gone,'' said C.
Bruce Tarter, director of the Lawrence Livermore National
Laboratory in California. ``Events over the past year are making it
more difficult to recruit and retain top-notch talent.''
</P>
<P>
   Tarter summed up the directors' overall assessment of the
stewardship program: ``It is an excellent bet, but it is not a sure
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   The scientists' reservations go to the heart of doubts harbored
by Senate Republicans, who oppose the treaty and fear that it would
permanently limit America's ability to test and modernize its
nuclear weapons, while states like North Korea and Iraq cheated and
conducted low-level tests to help build crude nuclear bombs.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the United States scrupulously restricts itself to
zero-yield while other nations may conduct experiments up to the
threshold of international detectability, we will be at an
intolerable disadvantage,'' Robinson said.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John Warner, R-Va., who heads the Armed Services Committee
and opposes the treaty, seized on the conflicting opinions,
reminding Richardson that the scientists' views ``are in many
respects contradictory of the remarks you had.''
</P>
<P>
   Supporters concede that they do not have the 67 votes needed to
ratify the treaty. After hounding Republicans for months to bring
the treaty to a vote, Democrats are now trying to negotiate a
graceful way out.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate inched closer to breaking an impasse on a deal to
postpone a vote scheduled for next Tuesday or Wednesday as
Republicans weighed new concessions from Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking to meet one Republican demand, the White House formally
requested that Senate Republicans withdraw the treaty. In a
telephone interview, Sandy Berger, Clinton's national security
adviser, said that ``the treaty is so important and time is so
short for consideration that we should postpone the vote in order
to have full and thorough deliberations.''
</P>
<P>
   To address Republican fears that Democrats would wield the
treaty as a campaign issue next year, Daschle proposed that any
formal consideration of the accord would require prior approval of
Daschle and Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott.
</P>
<P>
   But four conservatives _ Sens. Tim Hutchinson of Arkansas, James
Inhofe of Oklahoma, Robert Smith of New Hampshire and Jeff Sessions
of Alabama _ vowed to block any attempt to cancel next week's vote.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the concessions were unlikely to avert a floor debate,
which Lott said would begin on Friday with 10 to 20 senators
speaking on the treaty.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Behind the scenes, several Democratic and Republican senators
continued to negotiate a way to put off a near-certain defeat of
the treaty that supporters and critics said could deal the United
States a political and diplomatic embarrassment.
</P>
<P>
   Warner expressed confidence that political and procedural
hurdles could be surmounted. He joined a growing number of
Republicans seeking to postpone a vote, a group that includes Sens.
Pete Domenici of New Mexico, Ted Stevens of Alaska, Gordon Smith of
Oregon, Olympia Snowe of Maine, Fred Thompson of Tennessee and
Craig Thomas of Wyoming.

HOUSE APPROVES PATIENTS RIGHTS BILL 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BENNETT ROTH 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Overcoming stiff opposition from the insurance
industry and the Republican leadership, the House approved sweeping
managed care legislation Thursday that gives consumers broad rights
to sue their health insurance companies for malpractice.
</P>
<P>
   The 275-151 vote was a victory for President Clinton and
congressional Democrats who have lobbied for several years for
patients rights legislation. The measure must now be melded with a
much narrower HMO bill approved by the Senate, which covers far
fewer people and does not include the right to sue.
</P>
<P>
   The House bill, which would apply to all health plans, would
make it easier for consumers to have access to specialists, and to
receive emergency care without getting permission from their health
plans.
</P>
<P>
   It would require health plans to set up an internal or external
appeals process so patients could challenge decisions made by their
HMOs.
</P>
<P>
   The most controversial provision would amend the 1974 federal
Employment Retirement Income Security Act, or ERISA, which covers
multistate employer sponsored health plans, to allow patients the
right to sue for malpractice.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, who was in New York City, hailed the passage
of the measure, saying, ``It shows that America is no longer
willing to allow unfeeling practices of some health plans to add to
pain, injury and disease.''.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, however, warned congressional leaders not to sabotage
the measure during House-Senate negotiations by loading it up with
provisions he opposes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me be clear, we still have a lot of work to do before this
bill becomes the law of the land,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the House and Senate negotiators meet they must be sure
the bill is paid for and when they meet in conference, the
Republican leaders must resist the urge to weaken the patient
protections,'' he said. ``They must not undo behind closed doors
what has been done in the public.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Democrats feel the Republicans will kill the legislation by
burying it in conference committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm worried this bill will go into file 13,'' said Rep.
Richard Gephardt, D-Missouri, the House minority leader.
</P>
<P>
   While it is uncertain whether the two chambers can reach
consensus, it is clear that Democrats believe they have an issue
that will resonate with voters in next year's elections.
</P>
<P>
   The potency of the managed care issue was evident as 68
Republicans broke ranks to support the series of reforms opposed by
their leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the debate, proponents of HMO reform recounted horror
stories of patients who had been denied care. One of those victims,
7-year-old James Adams of Atlanta, was invited into the House
chamber by Rep. Greg Ganske, R-Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   Ganske, a doctor, recalled that when James was a baby and had a
fever of 104 degrees his parents were forced by their HMO to drive
70 miles to an emergency room even though there were several closer
hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   James had a heart attack and ended up with gangrene that forced
doctors to sever his hands and feet.
</P>
<P>
   Before the legislation was passed, 29 GOP members joined
Democrats in defeating a compromise measure endorsed by House
Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill, which gave consumers only limited
ability to sue their plans for malpractice.
</P>
<P>
   The House also defeated a measure pushed by conservatives that
contained no right to sue.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents said the bill addressed the growing concern by
doctors and patients that they have lost their ability to make
medical decisions to large impersonal managed care corporations,
who are more interested in profits.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Charles Norwood, a Republican dentist from Georgia who
co-sponsored the bill with Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., sounded a
common theme of the day when he said, ``It is time to tell patients
that they will actually have decisions made by their doctors not by
that clerk who may be living in Missouri.''
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of the measure, however, warned that the regulations
would drive up insurance costs and force companies to drop
employees from health plans. They added that giving people the
right to sue their health care plans would only be a boom for trial
lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe this bill is poison for our health care system,''
said Rep. John Boehner, R-Ohio, who sponsored the measure backed by
business groups that did not contain the right to sue.
</P>
<P>
   And the managed care industry, which had mounted a
multimillion-dollar campaign to defeat the measure, vowed to
continue fighting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of enacting reforms that could have allowed patients
to settle disputes quickly and independently the House has moved
instead to open the litigation floodgates and empower trial
attorneys,'' said Karen Ignagni, president of the American
Association of Health Plans, the chief lobbying arm for managed
care plans.
</P>
<P>
   However, the American Medical Association, the nation's largest
organization of doctors that lobbied hard for the bill, praised the
House action. AMA president Dr. Thomas Reardon, who appeared with
victorious lawmakers after the vote, said ``this is a real win for
American patients.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Republicans, led by Rep. Tom Coburn, a doctor from
Oklahoma, sought a middle ground in the debate by proposing
legislation that would allow lawsuits to be filed in federal but
not state courts. The Coburn measure would also have limited the
amount of money patients could be awarded.
</P>
<P>
   However, Norwood and others said the Coburn plan would make it
too hard for most people to take action against their HMOs.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents of HMO reform repeatedly cited the example of Texas,
where lawmakers in 1997 approved managed care regulations that gave
patients the right to sue.
</P>
<P>
   They noted that the liability changes have not caused a rush to
the courthouse or driven up health care costs dramatically in the
state.
</P>
<P>
   Gephardt noted that what the House had passed was ``a lot like
the law in Texas, and that is a conservative state.''

OATES TRIES TO BEEF UP RANGERS' LINEUP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHNNY PAUL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Manager Johnny Oates' desperate search for offense
resulted in a massive overhaul of the Texas Rangers' lineup for
Game 2 of this Division Series.
</P>
<P>
   Shortstop Royce Clayton, who hit leadoff only twice this season,
occupied the top spot in the order Thursday night, and left fielder
Rusty Greer _ the Rangers' primary No. 3 hitter _ moved up a spot
with catcher Ivan Rodriguez batting third.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a great lineup,'' Oates said. ``I spent a lot of
time (Wednesday) night thinking about it. Rusty has been drawing a
lot of walks, and Clayton has had a pretty good second half against
left-handers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, those two guys at the top can get on for our Nos. 3
and 4 hitters. I think it'll give us a chance to get out on top.''
</P>
<P>
   Oates also benched center fielder Tom Goodwin, a left-handed
hitter, and started reserve outfielder Roberto Kelly against
Yankees left-hander Andy Pettitte. Kelly, a right-handed batter,
entered Thursday night's game hitting .105 (2-for-19) for his
career against Pettitte.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing about it is his career numbers against left-handers
are better than anybody I've got,'' Oates said. ``I think Kelly
gives us a chance to put a charge in one.''
</P>
<P>
   Kelly hit .358 this season against left-handers and owns a .314
average against lefties for his career, but the move did not come
without a sacrifice defensively.
</P>
<P>
   ``You give up some range, but I need offense,'' Oates said.
``I'm looking for a run right now. There's no such thing as a 0-0
tie in this game.''
</P>
<P>
   Second baseman Mark McLemore remained in the lineup and batted
ninth despite hitting .163 this season against left-handers. Oates
went with McLemore instead of reserve infielder Luis Alicea because
Oates preferred a ``healthy second baseman hitting ninth at 100
percent as opposed to Alicea, who is 90 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   Alicea hit .290 this season against left-handers, but his right
calf remains tender from a muscle pull suffered Sept. 13 at Kansas
City's Kauffman Stadium. nn

SPECIAL FUNDS FOR SPECIAL CUSTOMERS  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, OCT. 10) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass.)  (Eds: The (star) word in online company should be replaced with the
symbol) 
(af) 
 By DANIEL AKST   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Who says gambling doesn't pay?
</P>
<P>
   The casino metaphor for investing is pretty tired, but in mutual
funds, there is yet another way in which the Street is emulating
the Strip: by granting exclusive access to specialized products as
a way to attract new business.
</P>
<P>
   In Las Vegas and other gambling centers, high rollers enjoy free
food, drink and accommodations, and even people like me find rooms
and restaurants surprisingly affordable. Of course, gaming losses
subsidize all this, but because I don't bet, I don't care.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street seems to be going the same way.
</P>
<P>
   Sign up for an online stock trading account with E(star)Trade,
for example, and you get access to what it calls the lowest-cost
technology-oriented index fund available. Intended to track the
Goldman Sachs Technology Index, this no-load fund has a relatively
modest expense ratio (for a technology fund, at least) of 0.85
percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did this because it's the kind of fund our customers
want,'' said Joe Van Remortel, vice president of E(star)Trade Asset
Management, which develops mutual funds for its parent.
E(star)Trade is not ready to disclose figures, but Van Remortel
said the response had exceeded expectations. ``The customers love
it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   E(star)Trade customers can expect further such offerings. Van
Remortel said the company had two new index funds in registration
with the Securities and Exchange Commission; like the technology
fund, both will be open only to E(star)Trade customers. One is an
electronic commerce fund, and the other is a broad-based
international fund. ``We'll probably do some more down the road,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere on the Web, Stockjungle.com, an investment-oriented
Web site, plans to offer its customers an apparently unique index
fund linked to the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500. The fund will charge
investors nothing _ no loads, management fees or expenses of any
kind, although it does have a 2 percent redemption fee for shares
held less than 120 days.
</P>
<P>
   Like the E(star)Trade technology fund, Stockjungle.com's S&AMP;P 500
index fund will provide reports, statements and so forth only
electronically, saving the expenses of printing and mailing.
</P>
<P>
   And Waterhouse Securities, another discount broker, offers its
customers, on an exclusive basis, the no-load Waterhouse Dow 30
fund. It aims to match the total return of the Dow Jones industrial
average _ and is one of only two such funds tracked by Morningstar
Inc., the Chicago financial publisher.
</P>
<P>
   The Waterhouse Dow 30, of course, joins more than 8,500 mutual
funds of every stripe that Waterhouse offers from fund families
like Fidelity Investments, the Vanguard Group and Janus.
</P>
<P>
   When I first heard about these developments, I dismissed them as
curiosities. But the more I thought about them, the more they
seemed harbingers of something much bigger _ a trend toward the
commodification of mutual funds. Leaving aside the unusual nature
of these funds, their companies are granting access to a fund just
to sell you something else. It is similar to a supermarket selling
milk as a loss leader.
</P>
<P>
   If the idea catches on in mutual funds, it could change
radically how Americans think about investing _ not to mention how
the fund industry is structured.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Guillette, a consultant with Cerulli Associates, a
financial services consulting firm in Boston, considers the
funds-as-premiums idea as more an unusual marketing ploy than a
trend. Instead he points to a very different development: the
efforts of some mutual fund families to go upmarket.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Putnam Investments, for instance, has formed a partnership with
the Thomas H. Lee Co., a private equity investment firm, to offer a
range of financial products to affluent investors, perhaps
including a venture capital fund. Such vehicles are a far cry from
index investing.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Guillette acknowledges that it is becoming harder
for many funds to differentiate themselves. As a result, somebody
decides to use them as marketing giveaways. ``In a world that's
increasingly commodified,'' he said, ``that's how you draw
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the world of mutual funds wants to be perceived in
much the same way as Garrison Keillor's Lake Wobegon, where ``all
the children are above average.'' Judging from long-term
performance data, however, the opposite must be true. Over the long
haul, most fund managers cannot beat the market averages, and those
that do so for a while tend to drop back into the pack eventually.
</P>
<P>
   There is evidence that past performance is of little use in
predicting the future, suggesting that, unless you're clairvoyant,
it doesn't much matter which funds you select.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, your decisions about asset allocation are almost
always going to be more important to your performance than which
aggressive growth mid-cap mutual fund you choose.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, there is good reason to treat mutual funds as
commodities: Once you decide how much to invest in the various
asset classes, you can buy the cheapest versions and hang on. This
isn't new.
</P>
<P>
   People like John C. Bogle, the former chief of Vanguard, have
suggested it for years, and there are signs that this Gospel of the
Sensible Investor is gaining adherents, judging from the growth of
index funds _ the ultimate in commodified funds _ in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   And is the idea of fund premiums really so different from that
of the American AAdvantage Mileage funds, which reward investors
with frequent-flier miles as well as investment returns? The funds'
flavors include stocks, bonds and money markets.
</P>
<P>
   Or how about the Aid Association for Lutherans? It offers a
family of mutual funds available exclusively to members of the
organization, although investors get the benefit of knowing that
their money is being plowed into companies meeting certain
social-responsibility standards.
</P>
<P>
   If the premiums idea catches on, the current flow of fund
advertisements, promoting investment performance and the
personalities running the money, could dry up, and the many
publications devoted to mutual fund rankings could disappear.
</P>
<P>
   The industry might instead emphasize partnerships with firms
that have access to large, loyal groups of members or customers.
Who will get the chance to sell mutual funds to the customers of
the Wal-Mart? To volunteer firefighters? To former Girl Scouts?
</P>
<P>
   AARP, the pick of the litter when it comes to affinity marketing
by virtue of its size and the wealth of its membership, offers
mutual funds managed by Scudder Kemper Investments. And the United
Services Automobile Association, widely known as USAA, seems to
have the inside track in providing mutual funds, as well as a host
of other financial services, to former members of the armed forces
and their families. But the company's funds are also open to
investors who haven't had anything to do with the military.
</P>
<P>
   It is easy to see all this going further.
</P>
<P>
   Will your credit union offer access to certain mutual funds when
you open an account? Will buying a Ford or Toyota open the door to
an index fund that charges no expenses whatsoever? Or, conversely,
will you get a Ford or Toyota by investing enough money in a given
fund? How about funds open only to the fraternal members of the
Knights of Pythias? Or current and former inmates of the federal
penitentiary system? The possibilities are mind-boggling.

ARE FUND MANAGERS IRRELEVANT? AN 18TH-CENTURY THEORY SUGGESTS NOT  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, OCT. 10) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Pa., Mass.)   (af)  
 By MARK HULBERT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The debate over index funds has been exceedingly lopsided.
Reason and common sense have been almost completely on the side of
those who advocate investing all of a portfolio in index funds.
</P>
<P>
   The statistics are familiar: Only a very small percentage of
actively managed stock funds perform as well as the Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500-stock index _ just 6 percent, for example, over the last
five years (although they've had more success in the last two
quarters).
</P>
<P>
   And many people try to explain away those few funds that have
beaten the market by saying they have done so by chance alone.
After all, if several thousand monkeys threw darts at the stock
pages of the newspaper, some of them would beat the market, too.
</P>
<P>
   The debate is about to become a lot less lopsided. A new paper,
as yet unpublished, reveals that the case for indexing an entire
portfolio _ tying all of it to funds that track major market
indexes _ is a lot weaker than many people have thought.
</P>
<P>
   The study, titled ``Should Investors Avoid All Actively Managed
Mutual Funds? A Study in Bayesian Performance Evaluation,'' was
written by Klaas Baks, Andrew Metrick and Jessica Wachter. Metrick
is an assistant professor of finance at the Wharton School at the
University of Pennsylvania, and Baks and Ms. Wachter are graduate
students in economics at Brown University and Harvard,
respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Because it is waist-high in statistics, the paper probably won't
prompt a stampede into actively managed mutual funds. But it should
turn upside down a lot of people's thinking about indexing.
</P>
<P>
   The first point that these academics make, if not particularly
original, is nevertheless one that is not often appreciated: Just
because most portfolio managers fail to beat the market
consistently doesn't mean that none do so.
</P>
<P>
   ``Big deal,'' an indexing absolutist might say. ``Even if the
rare money manager has the stock-picking prowess necessary to beat
the index, it doesn't alter the fact that he is in the extreme
minority, and that rational investors therefore ought to put their
whole portfolio into index funds.''
</P>
<P>
   That, according to the new paper, is precisely where the
absolutists are wrong.
</P>
<P>
   The study's key assertion is that once it is conceded that even
a very small percentage of managers have the ability to beat the
market, it becomes irrational not to invest a significant portion
of an equity portfolio in their funds that have done so, on a
risk-adjusted basis, by the greatest amounts over the long term.
</P>
<P>
   The study relies on a type of statistical analysis pioneered by
the Rev. Thomas Bayes, an 18th century mathematician, whose theory
explains how probabilities should be updated in light of new
information.
</P>
<P>
   A nonfinancial example illustrates how a Bayesian analysis
works. Imagine that 10 percent of a coin dealer's inventory of
identical-looking coins are special _ they are weighted so that
when you toss them, they come up heads three-quarters of the time,
instead of just half. Suppose, too, that before buying a coin, you
are allowed to flip it to determine whether it is one of the trick
coins.
</P>
<P>
   But before flipping the first coin, you know that there's a 10
percent probability that it's one of the trick ones. That
probability will grow slightly after the first flip comes up heads
_ to 14.3 percent, according to the Bayes theorem. The probability
will continue to grow after each successive flip that comes up
heads. And though that probability will never reach 100 percent,
after enough flips, the majority of which come up heads, it becomes
a better than 50-50 proposition that the coin you're flipping is
one of the trick coins.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers used a similar process to measure the
probabilities that fund managers of 1,437 actively managed United
States diversified equity funds would beat benchmarks in the
future. It is a good analogy, because a superior fund manager won't
necessarily beat his or her benchmark all the time, just most of
the time.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of flipping coins, of course, the researchers looked at
a manager's performances in successive months relative to that of
the relevant benchmarks. And instead of the 10 percent initial
probability, used in the trick-coin example, the researchers used a
range of extremely conservative assumptions _ for example, that
just 1 in 5,000 portfolio managers had the ability to outperform a
benchmark.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Remember, this initial assumption gives you the base upon which
the subsequent probability data rest. In the coin example, it's a
given, but in looking at manager ability, the authors started with
extremely conservative probabilities in order to make a point.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the analogy pretty much holds up. The researchers
continually updated the probability that a given manager had the
ability to beat his or benchmark in light of his performance in
period after period. Even assuming that just two-hundredths of 1
percent of all fund managers had the talent to regularly beat the
market, it turns out that there were a few managers who performed
well enough to justify investing in their funds.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, though the study's extensive data base began in
1963, it ended in 1996. And its methodology is so complex that we
cannot update the data easily ourselves, so we don't know which of
today's fund managers have the highest probability of being market
beaters.
</P>
<P>
   But as of the end of 1996, and under the assumption that 1 in
5,000 can outperform, just five such managers, or teams, had funds
that beat their benchmarks by wide-enough margins to make them
worth betting on.
</P>
<P>
   Only one manager or team that made this cut through 1996 is
still managing the same fund: Ralph Wanger and Charles P. McQuiad
of the Acorn Fund, although Terance M. Hogan, who was also a
co-manager at the time, has left the fund. Those who are no longer
managing the funds cited in the study are Stephen A. Lieber of the
Evergreen Fund, Charles Albers of Guardian Park Avenue, Shelby
Davis of Davis New York Venture and Robert A. Lange of Lindner
Growth.
</P>
<P>
   As in the coin example, of course, we will never know with
certainty that these few select managers really have market-beating
ability _ no matter how many years they have been managing money
and by how much they have outperformed the market. But the
probabilities make it irrational not to bet on them, the study
argues.
</P>
<P>
   Deciding how much to invest with a particular manager depends,
in part, on the margin by which he has beaten the index.
</P>
<P>
   Before making that choice, consider what happens if you pick a
manager who, despite a stellar track record, turns out to be unable
to beat a relevant index going forward. It is safe to assume that
his stock picks will be no better or worse than random.
</P>
<P>
   This means that his performance over time should match the
market's before expenses, and lag behind it by an average of one
and a half percentage points a year after expenses and transaction
costs.
</P>
<P>
   Contrast that with the potential advantage of investing with a
manager who can beat the market by three percentage points or more
a year. To simplify a large part of the authors' study, so long as
there is greater than a 1-in-3 chance that she can do so, it makes
sense to invest with her rather than with an index fund.
</P>
<P>
   The authors, however, did not take taxes into account, so it is
impossible to know whether any managers would ``survive'' their
Bayesian analysis after accounting for the tax implications of
trading. So it makes sense to use actively managed funds only for
your tax-deferred accounts.
</P>
<P>
   But how much of those tax-deferred assets should you invest with
the best fund managers? It depends on how pessimistic you are about
the probability that managers, in general, have the ability to beat
their benchmarks.
</P>
<P>
   If you assume, for example, that only 1 in 5,000 fund managers
can do so, you should invest at least two-thirds of your equity
portfolio in the long-term, market-beating, actively managed
winners, according to the study.
</P>
<P>
   If you assume that the ratio is 1 in 1,000, the case in favor of
investing in the very top actively managed funds becomes so
compelling that you should put all your equity position in them.
Unfortunately, there's not enough statistical data to decide which
assumption is more valid.
</P>
<P>
   Score one, finally, for active fund management. But remember
that this good news applies only to a very few managers _ those who
can pass the rigorous testing, and who in most cases have been
managing for a long time. Indeed, the authors found that it makes
no sense to invest in the vast majority of actively managed funds. &QL;

JUDGE ISSUES INJUNCTION IN TEXAS FOOTBALL PRAYER CASE 

</HEADLINE>

c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ A federal judge issued an order Thursday allowing the
prayers to continue before Santa Fe High School home football games
through the end of the season.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Sim Lake's order thrilled religious
activists in the small school district south of Houston, though it
also appeared to set the stage for a continuing controversy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm ecstatic,`` said Marian Ward, 17, the Santa Fe student who
has been selected to lead the prayers. ``It's another step in the
right direction.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone is happy, though. Ward confirmed that civil rights
groups plan to protest at the Indians' game Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   The controversy stems from a lawsuit filed in 1995 on behalf of
two families with students in Santa Fe schools _ one Mormon and one
Catholic _ who objected to the prayers.
</P>
<P>
   Last April, the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans
ruled that nonsectarian prayer could be used in solemn events, such
as graduations at Santa Fe High School, but not at such events as
football games.
</P>
<P>
   Ward's family then filed another lawsuit last month, claiming
that prohibiting Ward from praying before the game constituted a
violation of her constitutional right to free speech.
</P>
<P>
   Lake on Thursday issued a preliminary injunction to allow the
prayers through the end of the season, extending the temporary
restraining order he issued last month.
</P>
<P>
   A trial on the issue has not been set.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if she has become sort of a hero to people of faith in
Santa Fe, Ward replied, ``It's flattering, but this is not really
about me. It's about freedom.''

 &HT;    Gingrich wonders if wife had detective trailing him
 &HT;    By Duane D. Stanford
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Newt Gingrich wants to know whether his estranged wife
put him under surveillance shortly before he became speaker of the
U.S. House.
</P>
<P>
   And it turns out the former Georgia congressman no longer has a
house to call home in Cobb County, at least for a while.
</P>
<P>
   The revelations came from a flurry of court filings and
documents released Thursday by attorneys in Atlanta and Washington,
D.C., as the Gingriches' divorce case moves toward a threatened
trial date.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the more significant developments of the day, a
Washington judge issued an order that puts Marianne Gingrich, 48, a
step closer to questioning Callista Bisek, 33, under oath about
Bisek's relationship with Newt Gingrich, 56. Bisek is an aide to
the House Agriculture Committee.
</P>
<P>
   District of Columbia Superior Court Judge Brook Hedge ordered
the attorneys for Bisek and Marianne Gingrich to meet by next
Friday to discuss a subpoena ordering Bisek to be deposed and to
produce a wide range of evidence. The items include letters, gifts,
phone records and other items Marianne Gingrich could use to prove
Bisek was having an extramarital affair with her husband.
</P>
<P>
   Bisek has asked the judge to block the subpoena, saying it was
issued incorrectly and is too vague. Bisek also argues that she is
being asked to incriminate herself. Adultery is a crime in the
District of Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   Hedge ruled Thursday that the subpoena was procedurally sound,
but the Washington judge wants the attorneys to agree on the scope
of the information that can be demanded of Bisek.
</P>
<P>
   In Cobb County, Gingrich has asked his wife to respond to 26
questions and demands for discovery evidence by Wednesday, so his
attorneys can prepare for a deposition of Marianne Gingrich
scheduled for Oct. 19.
</P>
<P>
   Most of Gingrich's questions are an attempt to learn everything
possible about the financial standing of his wife, who controlled
the couple's assets. And in most cases, Gingrich seeks financial
documents dating back to 1987, when the couple signed a separation
agreement splitting their possessions during a spat Gingrich says
lasted six years.
</P>
<P>
   Other questions in Gingrich's discovery notice seek to learn
about any marital improprieties on his wife's part. Still others
seek to know what, if anything, she has learned about Gingrich's
personal life.
</P>
<P>
   One demand by Gingrich reads: ``Copies of any surveillance or
investigation reports, notes, or memos from 1994 to the date of
trial.''
</P>
<P>
   This type of question is not uncommon in hard-fought divorce
cases, where spouses often hire detectives to sniff out everything
from finances to affairs, said Washington divorce lawyer Sanford
Ain. ``It's almost always asked when infidelity is an issue,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday also brought the public release of a Sept. 10 temporary
agreement the Gingriches signed splitting and securing their assets
while they litigate their divorce.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement gives Marianne Gingrich possession of the couple's
Marietta, Ga., home. Gingrich, who served metro Atlanta's 6th
Congressional District from Marietta for six of his 20 years in
office, will live in the couple's Washington apartment.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement also pays the Gingriches a monthly stipend of
$10,000 each. That represents an annual combined income of at least
$240,000.
</P>
<P>
   Exactly how much money is at stake between the Gingriches is
uncertain. Even they are trying to figure that one, according to
court records.

   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ Behold Kendall Square: 50-odd Cambridge acres
long a fallow welter of former factories, now the flourishing
center of what experts call the most concentrated single cluster of
biotechnology in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Behold it from, say, the muddy lot where Biogen Inc. broke
ground this week on a new six-story laboratory. Within view lie the
butterscotch-beige Genzyme building, the construction site of the
coming Amgen building and a new complex housing smaller companies
with typically futuristic names like Mitotix and Dyax and
Variagenics, all new in the last few years, most connected in some
way to two neighbors: the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and
Harvard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Biotech as far as the eye can see,'' Janice Bourque, executive
director of the industry's Massachusetts Biotechnology Council,
proclaimed with a bit of broad-brush artistic license.
</P>
<P>
   The much-trumpeted ``knowledge'' (or information, or innovation)
economy has its own geography, and it consists of much more than
Silicon Valley. Across America, high technology is creating
localized boomlets like the one in Kendall Square, which is home to
companies not only in the biotech sector but also in software and
related fields.
</P>
<P>
   And if there is one never-absent factor at work on these silicon
corners, experts say, it is the proximity of a research university
shifting from ivory tower to revving economic engine. Indeed, the
university is an increasingly powerful force in the knowledge
economy, both because its brains are greater assets than ever
before and because of a growing trend for institutions of higher
education to see themselves as generators of business, whether
professors' start-ups or technology licensing deals.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a great awakening that we're sitting on top of a
gunpowder keg'' of growth, said David Lampe, author of two books on
high-tech locales and associate vice president of Boston
University, which is building a major biotechnology center of its
own in Boston's South End.
</P>
<P>
   A gunpowder keg in more ways than one. As universities and their
communities, from Washington state to Georgia, strive for economic
horsepower, a host of fresh questions are being raised about what a
university's role should be, and what happens as the pursuit of
money competes with the pursuit of knowledge. Other concerns arise
as well, from congestion around the campus to the high potential
that high-tech booms like Boston's first one, on Route 128 a
quarter-century ago, can always fizzle.
</P>
<P>
   But to many, such concerns pale beside the possible benefits
shown in research like the comparative study issued this summer by
the independent Milken Institute, in Santa Monica, Calif. It
contended that the fast-growing high-tech sector was increasingly
``determining which metropolitan areas are succeeding or failing.''
Milken's analysis found that high-tech activity could explain 65
percent of the difference in economic growth among various
metropolitan regions during the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   And, it found, ``research centers and institutions are
undisputedly the most important factor in incubating high-tech
industries.'' The institutions, experts say, provide nearby
companies streams of cutting-edge knowledge and streams of smart
labor.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, universities have long churned out graduates and
ideas that have turned into companies, and have created jobs simply
by being huge institutional consumers. But in the knowledge
economy, where ideas and information become lucrative products,
these cultivators of knowledge are becoming more important than
ever, some experts say, not only because of the new economic logic
but also because of changes in academia itself.
</P>
<P>
   The incentives for universities to think commercial are
manifold, from the share they get of licensing payments, to the
jobs created for graduates, to industry grants for research and
even the ability to recruit professors who want a chance to get
rich outside the classroom.
</P>
<P>
   Some universities have for years been emphasizing the economic
energy they provide and promoting a commercial orientation. In
1997, MIT issued a report, ``The Impact of Innovation,'' describing
the impressive economic benefits flowing from the university,
including the creation of 14,000 jobs in Cambridge alone at
companies founded by its faculty and graduates.

 CAMBRIDGE, Mass.: and graduates.

<P>
   Similarly, in 1995, the University of California distributed a
report called ``UC Means Business'' pointing out that, among other
things, some 80 companies had spun out of the university's San
Diego campus, providing more than 7,000 jobs to the region, largely
in biotech and biomedical companies.
</P>
<P>
   Every one of the nine University of California campuses has a
high-technology cluster near it, said Robert Shelton, the system's
vice provost for research. And it is Silicon Valley's tale of
genesis that it all began with garage-based start-ups and vision
that came out of Stanford.
</P>
<P>
   Other universities are just now joining in this promotion of a
commercial emphasis. Last week Harvard, not exactly known as a
dirty-fingernails kind of place, detailed for the first time the
overall lift it gives the local economy. Neil Rudenstine, the
university's president, underscored in a speech to the Boston
Chamber of Commerce ``the dynamic connections between Harvard,
higher education and the rest of the economy _ the new knowledge
economy we are building together.''
</P>
<P>
   With that interconnection in mind, said Paul Grogan, the
university's vice president for community relations, Harvard is
seeking new economic roles, even contemplating ``research parks and
business incubators that would be very closely tied to parts of the
university.''
</P>
<P>
   Such roles, Grogan noted, raise ``all sorts of new questions:
where the lines are on this stuff, who owns what, how you use
students _ it's a million things, but these questions are part of
something that is exciting and breaking molds.''
</P>
<P>
   Molds can be messy to break, however. Experts say many
universities balk at commercialization of their long-sacrosanct
intellectual pursuits. Serious issues can arise: everything from,
say, the tension between a money-making engineering department and
a poor English department to worries that ``pure'' basic research,
with no business potential, will suffer.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Lazowska, chairman of the computer science and engineering
department at the University of Washington, is a great enthusiast
about the university-fueled high-tech economy, having watched it
transform the Seattle area with much help from Microsoft Corp. But
at the same time, ``the goal of universities is education and
research,'' he said. ``We're not in the business of business, and
we're not in the business of creating businesses. For example,
university research ought to be looking out 10 and 15 years,
because if we don't do it, companies don't do it for sure. You
don't want an environment in which universities are so fixated on
commercialization they start taking a short-term focus.''
</P>
<P>
   Mary Spaeth, an expert in the field for Angle Technology, of
London, said that in the transition from tower to marketplace, it
often had been very difficult ``for a university to reconcile those
things and not feel it's compromising its integrity.''
</P>
<P>
   Reviews are mixed, too, on the impact that the high-technology
boomlets spun out of universities have on local communities.
Kendall Square, with its brick high-rises and cleverly
rehabilitated factory buildings, may look palatial compared with
its sludgy former self. But neighbors complain about the congestion
it creates on some of the city's narrow streets, and that it is
more of a Wall Street-style business center than a lively
neighborhood mix.
</P>
<P>
   Complaints often arise in such growing areas, said Annalee
Saxenian, an associate professor of planning at the University of
California at Berkeley, who has written about Route 128 in the
Boston area and about Silicon Valley.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been cases,'' Ms. Saxenian said, ``where growth
that has been generated by the university spinoffs has displaced
lower-income communities, so there are new tensions that emerge in
some cases.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, university officials say, town-gown relations
tend to improve noticeably when a university becomes more
market-oriented.
</P>
<P>
   A generation ago, said Lita Nelsen, MIT's director of technology
licensing, the university was seen in Cambridge as ``this monster
using up space and not paying taxes and scattering unwashed
undergrads all over.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Now,'' she said, ``MIT is seen as a partner in Cambridge in
developing real estate and providing high-paying jobs in high-tech
industry, and I think that relations have been enormously affected
by it.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Around the country, there is a visible groundswell of
high-technology clusters, often growing with the active involvement
of universities that reach out through new ``business incubators''
that house and help start-up companies, as well as through research
parks and technology licensing programs. A single recent Internet
query about universities as economic engines brought a deluge of
responses from around the country. Among them:
</P>
<P>
   --From the University of Texas at Dallas: Called by some ``the
university the corridor built,'' it feeds graduates and research to
the 600-plus high-technology companies in the area's Telecom
Corridor, and local officials expect an additional 40,000 jobs
there _ beyond the 70,000 current ones _ by 2010.
</P>
<P>
   --From the University of Pittsburgh: ``The greater Pittsburgh
area has tied its economic renaissance on high-tech start-ups that
have grown from local universities.''
</P>
<P>
   --From the University of Alabama at Birmingham: The university
holds stock in 21 companies it has spawned, has begun building a
research park and has a commercialization office that has brought
in more than $10 million in royalties and licensing fees from
faculty discoveries (which pales a bit next to the nearly $96
million that Columbia says it earned in technology licensing income
in the last fiscal year _ the most in the nation, Columbia says.)
</P>
<P>
   --From the Tampa Bay-Orlando area: ``We are building a high-tech
corridor stretching from the Gulf Coast to the Atlantic'' and
anchored by the University of South Florida and the University of
Central Florida. Two new information technology companies are born
each business day along the corridor, local officials say.
</P>
<P>
   --From the University of Washington: A total of 140 spinoff
companies, most created in the last decade, are worth more than $10
billion and employ more then 6,500 people. Thirty were founded by
graduate students or medical residents.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of university-linked research parks are built or under
construction around the country, so many that there is an
Association of University-Related Research Parks, based in
Washington, with nearly 200 member parks. Many of them are modeled
on their grandparents, Research Triangle Park in North Carolina and
the Stanford Research Park, which continue to thrive.
</P>
<P>
   In other areas, university-side boomlets grow more
spontaneously, as is the case with Kendall Square.
</P>
<P>
   Biotechnology has a particular tendency to want to cluster near
a university, several experts said, because it tends to have such a
long research phase before coming up with marketable products.
Further, it needs to be close to a university as the source of many
of its employees, and near an affiliated hospital where clinical
trials can be run.
</P>
<P>
   Henri Termeer, president of Genzyme, which employs nearly 4,000
people, said the company had been so intimately connected with MIT,
from the postdoctoral students who did its early experiments to the
professors who advise it and the graduates it now hires, that it
most likely could not have gotten going elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you had the same ideas but you were away from these kinds
of skills, this very, very advanced leading-edge level, you could
not carry it out,'' Termeer said. ``You wouldn't get there. You
would just stay with the idea.''
</P>
<P>
   Kendall Square is far from the only home to Boston-area biotech,
and over all, California, with its Biotech Coast, has more such
companies than Massachusetts. But Ms. Bourque, of the Massachusetts
Biotechnology Council, said that within a radius of five miles or
so of the square, there were probably about 70 biotech companies,
making this the most concentrated cluster anywhere. And almost
everyone, she said, has a sense that this is only the beginning,
that ``we're not even in the golden years yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Kendall Square has seen something a lot like this before. In the
industrial era, it was the odoriferous home to everything from a
soap factory to meat-renderers. Then it hit a period of decline. It
did not help that under President John Kennedy, the federal
government cleared whole swaths of it, planning to erect here the
space center that, under President Lyndon Johnson, went to Houston
instead.
</P>
<P>
   The square's current dense amalgam of laboratories, offices and
hotels began taking shape in the 1980s, but lately, said James
Mullen, president and chief operating officer of Biogen, ``it is an
explosion.''
</P>
<P>
   MIT has done this before, too. It was seen as the primary
academic engine behind the high-technology cluster on Route 128;
but then that area fell from grace, as the industry shifted from
its mini-computers to personal computers. In her book ``Regional
Advantage,'' (Harvard University Press, 1994), Ms. Saxenian, of
Berkeley, posited that Route 128 suffered, while Silicon Valley
bounced back, in large part because of differences in business
culture: the more hidebound and high-walled Eastern companies
outdone by smaller and more cooperative Western ones.
</P>
<P>
   But Kendall Square, with its fluent flow among companies and
academia, seems to be avoiding the mistakes of Route 128, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a joke here that the only place that isn't trying to
replicate Silicon Valley is Silicon Valley,'' she said. In a small
way, she said, ``I think Kendall Square has achieved it.''

 &HT;    Falcons' Tobeck has handful vs. Saints' defense
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Falcons center Robbie Tobeck could end up with a big
headache Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   During most games, he has nobody lined up over him and spends a
lot of time helping guards double-team opposing tackles.
</P>
<P>
   But the Saints often play a defense with players lined up
opposite the center and both guards. Tobeck will face La'Roi
Glover, a 6-foot-2, 285-pounder, who is tied for the team lead with
2 1/2 sacks. The Falcons tried to claim him off waivers when the
Raiders released him in 1997. Last season, Glover was a first
alternate to the Pro Bowl after leading the Saints with 10 sacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their nose tackle is pretty good; Robbie is going to have his
hands full,'' Falcons offensive line coach Art Shell said. ``And
the `Bear' (defense) puts you in a lot of single-block situations,
makes it hard to double guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Tobeck, who makes the line calls, is more concerned with the
entire unit. The Falcons line has been better in pass protection
than last season in giving up 10 sacks so far. But run blocking is
another story.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons are averaging 71.5 yards rushing a game, next to
last in the NFL. The season-ending right knee injury to All-Pro
back Jamal Anderson has been the big loss.

   When the Saints line up with two tackles and two ends, they
blitz often. They lead the NFL with an average of five sacks per

going, no matter who is at running back.
</P>

   ``In the running game, we're not using the techniques we used
last year,'' Tobeck said. ``We're not coming off the ball the same;
our steps are not the same; we're not doing that.''

CONGRESS SQUEEZES 7 LUXURY PLANES FOR MILITARY LEADERS INTO TIGHT
BUDGET
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla.)  (rk) 
 By TIM WEINER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In the midst of its budget battles, Congress has
found the money for seven luxury aircraft for the Pentagon's top
commanders.
</P>
<P>
   The cost of obtaining and operating the aircraft over 20 years
comes to about $1 billion, according to the Pentagon, which never
formally requested the funds.
</P>
<P>
   A Pentagon spending bill _ agreed upon on Wednesday night, but
still being written Thursday _ allows the military buy a 737-300
jetliner and lease six smaller executive-class Gulfstream V jets to
ferry top commanders from base to base, said senior members of the
House Appropriations Committee's defense panel.
</P>
<P>
   The cost of leasing the Gulfstream jets is about $50 million a
year. They would serve the nation's nine top-ranking military
commanders-in-chief, eight of whom are based in the United States.
They now are flown in Boeing 707s. The cost of buying the 737,
which seats 126, is $63 million. It is for Marine Corps Gen.
Anthony Zinni and his successors at Central Command, which has
headquarters in Tampa, Fla., and is responsible for the Middle
East.
</P>
<P>
   No one in Congress was sure Thursday exactly how much money is
in the Pentagon spending bill for the 2000 fiscal year, although it
appears to be about $268 billion, not counting a separately
approved $1.8 billion military pay raise. That would be an increase
of more than $17 billion over the 1999 fiscal year, the biggest
such spending boost for the military in 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   Senior House and Senate negotiators approved the Pentagon bill
in a closed-door conference on Wednesday night. But their
colleagues were still requesting that money be added to the bill on
Wednesday afternoon, and their aides were still writing the bill
this evening.
</P>
<P>
   The two most senior House members at the conference, Rep. Jerry
Lewis, R-Calif., and John Murtha, D- Pa., said Thursday the bill
included $467 million for further research and development of the
Army's Comanche helicopter, which has been plagued by cost overruns
and technical problems and is on course to become the most
expensive helicopter in history.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a question whether that baby can fly,'' Lewis said. The
Comanche program _ a $37 billion project to build 1,292 helicopters
_ will consume more than half of the Army's budget for aircraft
when the aircraft start rolling off the assembly line nine years
from now, the Army concedes.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis and Murtha confirmed that the Senate majority leader,
Trent Lott of Mississippi, had convinced the House to add $375
million for an aircraft carrier to be built in his home state. ``We
try to take care of leadership whenever we can,'' Murtha said.
</P>
<P>
   Murtha said the Air Force would never be able to build 339 F-22
jet fighters, as it plans. The House-Senate conference approved
$2.5 billion in research and development funds for the aircraft,
but insisted that prototypes pass stringent flight tests before the
$200 million jet goes into full production.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not ever going to build the numbers they want to
build,'' said Murtha. ``They'll be lucky if they'll be able to get
two wings _ that's about 140 airplanes.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon wants to build three new types of fighter jets _
the F-22, the Joint Strike Fighter and an improved F-18 _ at a
total cost of $350 billion. Murtha described this as ``a $350
billion problem'' that cannot be solved without cutting costs or
dramatically increasing military spending.
</P>
<P>
   ``These prices are outrageous,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from the $17 billion increase for the Pentagon, many of
the other spending bills for government agencies are being cut or
frozen by Congress. The military spending increase, combined with
caps, or spending limits, enacted in 1997, is creating intense
pressure for Congress to dip into surplus Social Security funds,
which it has pledged to protect, in order to finance government
agencies.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Republicans are now weighing new across-the-board spending cuts
in domestic programs to protect the Social Security surplus.
</P>
<P>
   About $7 billion in the Pentagon bill will be designated as
``emergency spending'' to evade the caps. Congress also has put the
emergency label, usually reserved for wars and natural disasters,
on $8.7 billion in agricultural aid and $4.5 billion to finance the
2000 census. That technically takes those billions off the books,
but the money has to come from somewhere _ arguably, the Social
Security surplus.
</P>
<P>
   Aware of that argument, congressional aides said that the
``emergency'' designation for the census appropriation _ widely
ridiculed, because the Constitution commands that the census be
taken every decade _ soon may be removed.
</P>
<P>
   In other legislative action, the Senate Thursday night passed,
by a 73--25 vote, a $91.7 billion spending bill for the Labor,
Health and Human Services and Education departments. The bill
includes $18.5 billion drawn from a projected budget surplus for
the 2001 fiscal year. That is more money than Congress ever has
spent with advance appropriations in a single year, much less a
single bill.
</P>
<P>
   Though the measure actually increases spending for some
programs, President Clinton has vowed to veto it.

MAKER OF DIET PILL AGREES TO PAY $3.75 BILLION TO SETTLE LIABILITY
CASE
</HEADLINE>
   (sw) 
 By DAVID J. MORROW   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The American Home Products Corp. agreed on Thursday to pay $3.75
billion to thousands of individuals who contend they were injured
by taking the popular diet pill combination fen-phen.
</P>
<P>
   Under the settlement _ one of the largest ever in a product
liability case _ people who used one of the diet drugs for 60 days
or less would be eligible for $30 to $60 prescription refunds,
while those who have a heart valve injury could receive as much
$1.5 million. While executives and industry analysts hailed the
agreement, which was widely expected, it does not shield American
Home Products from all fen-phen liabilities.
</P>
<P>
   Some six million people took the diet drugs Pondomin, American
Home Products' brand name for fenfluramine, the ``fen'' in
fen-phen, and Redux, a similar drug. The drugs were hailed earlier
in the decade as miracle pills for obesity, as an alternative to
pure diet and exercise. Diet centers actively promoted the pills to
the obese and even people who wanted to lose a few pounds. In 1996,
doctors wrote 18 million prescriptions for the two drugs. But in
September 1997, the company removed the drugs from the market at
the request of the Food and Drug Administration after studies
linked them to heart valve damage.
</P>
<P>
   The two drugs, Pondimin and Redux, depressed appetite, while the
other drug in the combination, phentermine, increased the rate at
which calories are burned. Doctors at the Mayo Clinic reported that
the drugs may cause defects in the aortic or mitral valves.
</P>
<P>
   Since the drugs were pulled off the market, some 6,500 lawsuits,
encompassing 11,000 people, have been filed. Thursday's settlement
covers all of the six million who took fen-phen, but only those who
are found to have heart valve damage can collect an injury award.
The agreement, which must be approved by a federal judge, also has
some strings attached.
</P>
<P>
   It does not cover the 100 claims the company's faces from people
who contend fen-phen gave them primary pulmonary hypertension, an
often fatal lung illness. And if too many people _ a number
American Home Products did not define on Thursday _ choose to drop
out of the settlement, and pursue an individual lawsuit, the
company could scrap the agreement. Lawyers for fen-phen users said
on Thursday that was an unlikely outcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made this settlement flexible so that more people will
participate in it,'' said Stanley Chesley, a partner with Waite,
Schneider, Bayless &AMP; Chesley in Cincinnati, one of the lead
plaintiff lawyers. ``The way this settlement is set up, the
consumers have no disadvantage.''
</P>
<P>
   For American Home Products, the settlement is the latest in a
series of moves over the last three months intended to resolve
long-standing problems.
</P>
<P>
   In July, the company agreed to pay $54 million to settle claims
of women who said they were not adequately warned about the side
effects of the company's Norplant birth control device. Just three
days ago, American Home Products announced that it would
restructure its agricultural division, slicing 700 positions from
the unit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel good about the able efforts of our attorneys to bring
about the settlement,'' said John R. Stafford, chief executive
officer of American Home Products. ``The consumers of ours, who may
have been injured, the ones who used fen-phen for the long term,
which is a small percentage, the settlement gives them a quick and
fair resolution. I feel good about that.''
</P>
<P>
   Plaintiff lawyers who negotiated the settlement said the
agreement was especially comprehensive. The settlement, valued at
$3.75 billion before inflation, will be divided into two funds. One
fund, valued at $1 billion, will pay for drug refunds and medical
screening costs.
</P>
<P>
   The second fund, valued at $2.55 billion, will pay personal
injury claims, with awards ranging from $125,000 to $1.5 million.
The remaining $200 million from the $3.75 billion total has been
set aside for legal fees of medical monitoring claims.
</P>
<P>
   The fund will remain open for up to 16 years, leaving American
Home Products liable for a higher payout. Plaintiff lawyers
calculated on Thursday that with interest, American Home Products
could pay as much as $4.83 billion. That would put fen-phen as one
of the highest product injury settlements ever, dwarfing the $3.2
billion that Dow Corning paid last year to settle its silicone
breast implant claims.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even with the $4 billion settlement, you have to say that
American Home Products pulled off a good settlement,'' said David
Saks, a managing director at Gruntal &AMP; Co. ``Some of the early
estimates were everywhere from $3 billion to $10 billion. The
company was stuck in a quicksand of uncertainty.''
</P>
<P>
   The fen-phen settlement also represents a bit of unusual legal
maneuvering. It is rare for a national class-action settlement to
allow participants to ``opt out,'' and pursue an individual case,
at three points during the course of litigation. Under the fen-phen
settlement, consumers can opt-out in the beginning, or when they
discover they have a heart value regurgitation during the screening
process.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Consumers can also drop out when they discover the amount of
their personal claim. When the outlines of the settlement began to
emerge three weeks ago, analysts expressed concern that American
Home Products was being too lenient. Consumers would still pursue
litigation, leaving the company to face a large amount of
liabilities.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, the fen-phen settlement is not as lenient as first feared.
Consumers can drop out at three points, but if they do so at the
final two stages _ the screening process and the payout _ they
cannot seek punitive damages against American Home Products in an
individual case.
</P>
<P>
   While many plaintiff lawyers are thrilled with the settlement,
others are annoyed at some of its details. For consumers to receive
money from the personal injury fund, they must suffer heart valve
regurgitation that is measurable by a Food and Drug Administration
scale.
</P>
<P>
   People who seek money from the monitoring fund and have not used
fen-phen for more than 60 days can qualify for a refund in their
prescriptions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The payments are not going to be large enough to cover medical
expenses for a large number of people,'' said Ed Blizzard, a
Houston attorney who represents fen-phen users. ``A large number of
people only receive money for what they paid for the drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   The settlement, like other personal injury claims, provides a
sum for attorneys' fees. If the settlement is approved by the
court, some $429 million _ $200 million from the monitoring fund
and $229 million included in the personal injury fund. Chesley said
that he expected about 100 attorneys to collect fees.
</P>
<P>
   American Home Products said on Thursday that it would take a
$3.92 billion after-tax charge against third-quarter earnings to
pay for the settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts were optimistic that the company's stock would increase
now that it had moved aggressively to put the fen-phen liabilities
behind it. Shares of American Home Product rose $3.5625, or 7.8
percent, Thursday to close at $48.6875.

 Macromedia Picks Up Andromedia, Sets Shockwave Loose  &HT;     By Tom Stein 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Macromedia Inc., a mainstay of San Francisco's Multimedia Gulch,
yesterday agreed to buy privately held Andromedia for about $257
million in stock. Macromedia also said it plans to spin off its
online entertainment unit shockwave.com as an independent company.
<P>
   With the Andromedia acquisition, Macromedia hopes to move up the
e-commerce food chain by providing software that not only allows
clients to design Web sites, but also analyze the shopping habits
of consumers who visit those sites.
</P>
<P>
   Macromedia said that by melding its graphically rich Web
publishing applications with Andromedia's personalization and
customer profiling software, corporate clients will be able to
accurately measure the effectiveness of their Web sites and make
rapid design changes.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Andromedia's software figures out whether a
company's Web site is attracting new or repeat visitors, which
promotions are driving users to the site, and which content
visitors are clicking on the most. Brian Allum, Macromedia's chief
operating officer, said that information can then be fed back to
the design team, which who  &LR; can ``build a Web site that provides a
higher return on investment.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a good strategic fit for Macromedia,'' said Hany Nada,
an analyst with U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray. ``It allows them to go
from being just a tools company to an Internet infrastructure
player, which promises a higher value in the long term.''
</P>
<P>
   In the short term, however, wary investors pummeled the stock.
Macromedia shares fell $3.53, or more than 6 percent, to $51.44
yesterday. Still, the stock has tripled in value over the past
year. Nada said investors had several concerns, including the risks
associated with integrating Macromedia's applications with
Andromedia's. Software companies often run into technical and
financial trouble when they try to tie together product sets.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street also balked at Andromedia's high price tag, and the
negative impact the sale would have on Macromedias earning's over
the next several quarters.
</P>
<P>
   Andromedia, also based in San Francisco, was losing about $4.5
million per quarter, according to analysts. The company posted
revenue of $2.6 million in the six months ended June 30. Macromedia
officials said that all 125 employees at Andromedia would remain in
their jobs. Andromedia's chief executive Kent Godfrey will head up
business development and partnerships at Macromedia.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts still see plenty of upside in the deal. Specifically,
Macromedia will inherit a seasoned sales force that is accustomed
to knocking on the doors of Fortune 1,000 companies. Andromedia's
software, which typically costs tens of thousands of dollars, is
used by such companies as Audi, Intuit and Levi Strauss.
</P>
<P>
   ``Macromedia wants to become more of an enterprise-type company,
and they needed a strong direct sales force to do that,'' said Greg
Vogel, an analyst with Banc of America Securities.
</P>
<P>
   This new corporate focus also means that Macromedia's
consumer-centric shockwave.com unit no longer meshes with the
company's mission. Macromedia said it has hired investment bank
Robertson Stephens to consider financial options for the company,
including a possible public offering early next year. The
shockwave.com site was launched in August as an entertainment
destination with downloadable music, games and other content.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shockwave is a different business,'' said Macromedia chief
executive Rob Burgesss in an interview yesterday. ``It's an
entertainment company and we are a software company. You need to
run those two things as separate operations.''

 Problems Loom for BofA  &HT;     By Sam Zuckerman 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Bank of America faces problems controlling costs and generating
revenue as interest rates rise, trends that could hurt profits,
according to company documents obtained by The Chronicle.
<P>
   In a bid to meet its earnings targets, the Charlotte, N.C., bank
is taking steps to curb expenses, such as restricting staff travel
and hiring, employees said. The bank was created last year when
North Carolina's NationsBank bought San Francisco's Bank of America
and took its name.
</P>
<P>
   BofA isn't alone. Banks nationwide are scrambling for revenue as
rivals such as brokerages and consumer finance companies steal
customers. Rising interest rates also are eroding profits.
</P>
<P>
   BofA, the nation's No.2 bank, is especially vulnerable because
it holds a large portfolio of securities that carry fixed interest
rates. When the bank is forced to boost the rates it pays
depositors, the gap narrows between what it collects and what it
pays out in interest.
</P>
<P>
   ``The squeeze on margins has had a dampening effect on net
interest income, and rising rates have made further securities
gains unlikely,'' BofA Chairman and chief executive Hugh McColl
told managers last month, according to a recent employee
newsletter.
</P>
<P>
   ``The current economic environment will slow our ability to grow
revenues at the desired rate, so the short-term solution ... is to
bring down expenses,'' McColl noted.
</P>
<P>
   It's not clear how much the trends will show up next week when
the bank reports earnings for the quarter ended September 30.
</P>
<P>
   Internal BofA documents show that in July, the latest month for
which data are available, loans, deposits and revenue all fell
short of the bank's projections. Expenses, while down sharply from
the year before due to acquisition-related savings, were
significantly higher than expected.
</P>
<P>
   July revenue of $2.68 billion dropped 6 percent from June and
was $59 million below the bank's plan because of smaller investment
banking and trading profits, the documents show. That reversed the
trend earlier in the year when BofA's revenue came in ahead of
plan.
</P>
<P>
   Deposits as of July, though up slightly year-over-year, were $17
billion below the amount planned, due mainly to smaller balances in
accounts held in foreign offices. The bank's expenses for the first
seven months of the year were $10.5 billion, about 3 percent more
than planned due to higher-than-expected bonuses and fees for
professional services.
</P>
<P>
   The bank had 161,217 full-time-equivalent employees worldwide in
July, down a little more than 7,000 from the beginning of the year
as the bank combined overlapping functions of its two predecessors.
</P>
<P>
   The bank plans to cut another 2,437 jobs through year end,
mostly from its consumer and small-business banking division.
That's in line with its projection that it will shrink its staff by
about 18,000 during the next few years.
</P>
<P>
   A BofA spokesman declined to comment on the data.
</P>
<P>
   Despite public controversy over power struggles and the clash of
cultures between the NationsBank and the old BofA, the bank has
kept more customers than expected.
</P>
<P>
   During the first seven months of 1999, 89.8 percent of business
customers and consumers in the Western territory of the old BofA
stayed with the bank. That was better than the 87.6 percent
retention figure posted during the comparable period the year
before, and it exceeded the 87 percent goal set by the bank.
</P>
<P>
   Employee turnover was a mixed picture. In California, where
NationsBank systems and procedures have not yet been adopted, the
annualized turnover rate for tellers was 47.8 percent through July,
lower than the 52.5 percent rate the year before. But branch
managers left at a 6.5 percent pace for the first seven months of
1999, compared with 2.8 percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, in the Southwest, where NationsBank systems were
adopted, turnover rates for all categories of employees rose.
</P>
<P>
   ``After a takeover, there's usually a wait-and-see period,''
said B. Lynn Ware, an employee-retention expert with the Menlo Park
firm Integral Training Systems. ``The major test in California will
be when employees start seeing effects (of the takeover) on a
day-to-day operating basis.''

 &HT;    Carter: Nothing wrong with his 4-0
 &HT;    By Chip Towers
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS, Ga. _ It was first uttered in whispers early in the
season. But after Georgia's narrow escape against LSU on Saturday,
people were saying it out loud:
</P>
<P>
   ``What's wrong with Quincy Carter?''
</P>
<P>
   The Bulldogs quarterback, touted in preseason reports as a
Heisman Trophy candidate, has not lived up to that billing in four
games. While fellow Heisman candidates Joe Hamilton of Georgia Tech
and Drew Brees of Purdue have been lighting it up statistically,
Carter has been, well, average.
</P>
<P>
   But the sophomore is quick to mention he has one thing neither
of those quarterbacks has _ an undefeated record.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd love to stay in the (Heisman) race, if I was even in the
race as a sophomore. But as long as I'm 4-0 and we're winning, who
cares about that?'' Carter said. ``I think about Alabama and Jay
Barker, he was a winner. And (Tennessee's) Tee Martin was a winner
last year. As long as I'm labeled as a winner after the season,
I'll be happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter puts that undefeated record, and his reputation, on the
line when the 10th-ranked Bulldogs visit No. 6 Tennessee on
Saturday night in a nationally televised game.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a big game for Quincy,'' Georgia coach Jim Donnan
said. ``He's 0-3 against the `Big Three' (Tennessee, Florida and
Georgia Tech). As the starting quarterback at Georgia, that's what
you're judged by. We didn't give him any help last year (against
Tennessee). Hopefully, we can help him out Saturday.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter's numbers are respectable. He has completed 56 percent of
his passes (77 of 137) for 900 yards, six touchdowns and just one
interception. He is third in the SEC in passing average (225 yards
per game) and total offense (248.8-yard average), and seventh in
passing efficiency. Carter has thrown 129 passes without an
interception.
</P>
<P>
   Carter has been hurt by the youth surrounding him. The Bulldogs
had to replace their top four receivers, two tackles and leading
rusher from last season, and the inexperience has been evident.
Unofficially, receivers have dropped two dozen passes, including 11
in one game. If they had held on to half of those, Carter's
completion percentage would be 65 and he would have untold
additional yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quincy's fine,'' Donnan said. ``He's done a good job as far as
being the guy everybody looks up to, being a leader. But we can't
just be the `Quincy Carter Show' and do what we have to do to
win.''
</P>
<P>
   That was evident against LSU on Saturday. Georgia relied more on
running back Jasper Sanks as the game wore on. The sophomore got 17
of his 27 carries in the second half and finished with 156 yards
rushing in the Bulldogs' 23-22 victory.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia hopes to employ a similar strategy against the
defensive-minded Vols.
</P>
<P>
   ``My leadership ability is what we've got to have now,'' Carter
said. ``Jasper's going to carry us as long as we let him.
Hopefully, our passing game will come along.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite Sanks' emergence, Tennessee coach Phillip Fulmer
indicated Carter is the focus of his defensive strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Carter is) a very fine athlete but also a very fine
quarterback. I think sometimes you need to distinguish the two,''
Fulmer said. ``We've got to pressure him and hope to make him throw
before he's ready to.''
</P>
<P>
   The Volunteers neutralized Carter last year by coming after him
with a series of blitz packages. Carter completed 14 of 37 passes
for 195 yards and threw three interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   But those who huddle with Carter remain confident.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the way Quincy's playing,'' junior tackle Jonas
Jennings said. ``He's not getting caught up in the hype.
</P>
<P>
   Quincy Carter's a sophomore; he's got two more years to win the
Heisman. He knows it's all about winning games.''

SEATTLE MAY BAN PERFORMING CIRCUS ANIMALS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By KRISTIN DIZON  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Mayor Paul Schell wants to ban circus animals from
performing in Seattle, a move that would put the city at the
forefront of a national movement aimed at stopping the use of
exotic animals as entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   Should the City Council agree, Seattle would be the largest city
in the country to outlaw circus animal performances.
</P>
<P>
   Schell said the issue was raised during his campaign for mayor
two years ago and that after dealing with other priorities, he's
ready for Seattle to set an example.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor plans to forward an ordinance to the City Council next
month after the general election.
</P>
<P>
   His proposed legislation, still in draft form, would ban either
the display of exotic and wild animals in city owned and operated
facilities, or entirely within city limits. Schell's advisers are
currently hammering out the scope and specifics of the law.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can you really limit it on private property and say, nowhere
in the city of Seattle can you do this?'' said Lisa Fitzhugh,
special assistant to the mayor. ``That's the debate _ how far can
we go?''
</P>
<P>
   National groups such as the Humane Society of the United States
and People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) contend that
at best, circuses force wild animals into performing unnatural
tricks and living on the road. At worst, the animals are subjected
to abuse and cruelty, PETA and others say..
</P>
<P>
   They also cast exotic animals as a threat to public safety,
citing the deaths of 45 people killed since 1990 by captive
elephants alone.
</P>
<P>
   Circus operators deny such charges and say they treat their
animals well and adhere to the federal Animal Welfare Act, as well
as numerous state and local laws. They say there is no need for a
ban, which will deprive their audience of cherished entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   The Ringling Brothers and Barnum &AMP; Bailey Circus as well as
Circus Gatti performed in Seattle this year. Ringling Brothers was
in town last month at Seattle Center's KeyArena.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle's proposed ban would prohibit the exhibition, act or
performance of eight broad categories of animals such as primates,
large cats, bears, elephants and non-domesticated hoofed mammals
such as zebras.
</P>
<P>
   It also would exempt reptiles, birds, dogs and cats, according
to Fitzhugh. Additionally, the wording will be crafted so that the
Woodland Park Zoo would not be affected.
</P>
<P>
   Circuses are not the only wild animal displays that would be
affected, though they are the ban's main target. Exotic animals in
traveling petting zoos and those featured at photo opportunities in
malls or at fairs could be prohibited as well.
</P>
<P>
   A number of Canadian cities including Vancouver B.C., already
prohibit circus animal entertainment, and a handful of smaller
American cities have banned such performances, including Hollywood,
Fla., Takoma Park, Md., and Quincy, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, a bill, H.R. 2929 was introduced in Congress two
weeks ago that would prevent the use of elephants in traveling
shows.
</P>
<P>
   Citizens for Cruelty-Free Entertainment, a local volunteer
group, has been instrumental in pushing for the Seattle ban. They
gave the city draft ordinance language and gathered endorsement
signatures from more than 400 businesses and individuals, including
members of the Nordstrom family and David Hancocks, former director
of the Woodland Park Zoo.
</P>
<P>
   Jane Garrison, elephant campaign coordinator for PETA, said the
country's attitude toward wild performing animals has shifted. Part
of that trend is a proliferation in circuses without animals, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Twenty years ago, we'd see elephants being hooked and tigers
being whipped in the face and we never gave it a thought,'' she
said. ``Today, compassionate people don't want to support that
mistreatment of animals.''
</P>
<P>
   Catherine Ort-Mabry, a spokeswoman for Ringling Bros., said the
organization does not use any of those techniques in training.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mistreatment is never tolerated at Ringling Brothers,'' she
said. ``Our trainers devote their lives to these animals 24 hours a
day, seven days a week.''
</P>
<P>
   Ort-Mabry, who called the Ringling experience part of American
childhood, said the circus has enjoyed strong support in Seattle.
She said animals are an integral part of the Ringling presentation
and that in a recent nationwide survey, 70 percent of those queried
said animals were what draws them to the circus.
</P>
<P>
   Schell recalls trips to the circus as a child. But what he
remembers wasn't the lions, tigers or bears.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have fond memories of it, but it wasn't the animals doing
tricks,'' he said. ``It was the trapeze artists and other things.''
</P>
<P>
   Ort-Mabry, who called supporters of the ban a small, vocal
minority, promised that Ringling Bros. ``would oppose the
legislation and we would employ the appropriate tactics at the
time.''
</P>
<P>
   One group whom a ban would affect are the Shriners, a nationwide
fraternal organization. Jim Hart, secretary of the Seattle branch,
said the annual Shrine Circus raises between $60,000 and $100,000
for the group.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's getting more difficult because of the costs of putting it
on. I kind of wonder if it's worth it,'' Hart said. ``Laws are laws
and we'll live by the laws.''

WEIGHT OF U.S. TREATY VOTE EMERGES AT VIENNA PANEL 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also TEST-BAN-TREATY.) 
(th) 
 By DONALD G. McNEIL Jr.    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   VIENNA, Austria _ Speakers at a conference convened to press for
ratification of the nuclear test-ban treaty, including two of the
holdouts, Russia and China, suggested Thursday that the ban might
founder if it was not approved by the U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration and Senate Republicans have
maneuvered all week in advance of the floor debate on the treaty
that is scheduled to start Friday. Both sides agree that the ban
faces near-certain defeat if it comes to a vote, so the main debate
has been whether, and how, to postpone the vote _ and keep the
treaty alive _ until next year.
</P>
<P>
   Among the delegates gathered at the ornate Hofburg Palace, the
sense was that if the treaty failed to clear Washington, it would
most likely fail to win enough support among other nuclear nations
to go into force.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very important that the U.S. does ratify this and sign up
in full,'' said Peter Hain, Britain's minister of state for foreign
and commonwealth affairs. ``It's about leadership in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   The Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, signed in New York on Sept.
24, 1996, has been signed by more than 150 countries. But for the
treaty to go into effect, 44 nations that are believed to have the
ability to build at least a crude bomb must both sign and ratify
it. So far, only 24 have ratified the ban, while some _ including
India, Pakistan and North Korea _ have yet to sign.
</P>
<P>
   Of those that have signed but not ratified the ban, the United
States, China and Russia are the most notable. Of the other major
nuclear powers, France and Britain have both signed and ratified
the treaty.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting was organized by the United Nations under a
provision of the treaty that if it had not received the necessary
44 ratifications three years after it was signed, an international
conference ``facilitating its entry into force'' would be held.
</P>
<P>
   But while delegates took turns speaking in the Hofburg, most
eyes were on Washington, where the fate of the pact was really
being decided.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the U.S. ratifies the treaty, then Russia and China will
follow,'' said one senior diplomat. ``India and Pakistan will
follow them, and then we can isolate North Korea.''
</P>
<P>
   Pakistan, which tested a nuclear device last year, has indicated
that it is waiting for India to sign, and for sanctions punishing
Pakistan for its test to be lifted. India missed this conference
because of its national elections, but other diplomats said it
would probably sign and ratify if the Big Five powers and Pakistan
do.
</P>
<P>
   But if the United States fails to ratify the treaty, diplomats
said, the steam will leak out of the effort.
</P>
<P>
   Britain and France both sent ministers rather than ambassadors
to underline how strongly they felt. ``I think it's important that
the Senate understand the eyes of the world are on them,'' Hain
said. ``It's not a domestic issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Shaukat Umer, Pakistan's ambassador in Vienna, said delegates
felt ``a certain sense of apprehension as to what will happen on
Tuesday,'' the day the Senate is scheduled to vote. ``If the
largest power is out of this, it's all over _ this treaty is
dead.''
</P>
<P>
   Russia and China each made carefully worded speeches that
indicated they had prepared bills ratifying the treaty and were
poised to submit them to their parliaments.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``Russia has consistently and firmly advocated and continues to
advocate a complete ban on nuclear weapon testing,'' the Moscow
delegation said in a brief statement. Its position on ratification
``is based on the assessment of the overall ratification process
including those states whose ratification is required.''
</P>
<P>
   Ambassador Sha Zukang of China made a longer speech attacking
``negative developments'' for nonproliferation. Without naming the
countries involved, it criticized India and Pakistan for exploding
test bombs, the United States for considering an
anti-ballistic-missile system and NATO for bombing Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   China will continue to voluntarily abide by the treaty, he said,
but because of these negative developments, it will ``work to pick
up the ratification process as soon as practically possible.''
Afterward, while stressing that China would make its own decision,
Sha said, ``U.S. ratification will certainly facilitate Chinese
ratification.''
</P>
<P>
   Some delegations were so frustrated by the knowledge that the
Clinton administration badly wants the treaty passed but cannot
muster the two-thirds majority in the Senate that they discussed an
idea fairly unusual in diplomatic circles: writing a joint letter
directly to the Senate Republicans. But there were doubters,
including Sha, who said, ``I don't believe it's appropriate _ as
government delegations, we do business as governments.''
</P>
<P>
   Several delegates seemed mystified that hawkish Republicans
oppose the treaty. It was negotiated by a Republican president, and
polls show that 82 percent of Americans support it. It would freeze
the arms race while the United States enjoys a huge lead.
</P>
<P>
   And instead of paying 100 percent of the cost of the world's
second-most-sophisticated nuclear-test detection system (the
current American one), they said, the United States would pay only
25 percent for the world's most sophisticated one, with sensors
deep inside Russia, China, Iran and other nations where the United
States is not normally encouraged to gather data.
</P>
<P>
   The envisioned system would have 321 points gathering seismic,
infrasonic, hydroacoustic and radionuclide data. The preliminary
model is so good, boasted Wolfgang Hoffman, the executive secretary
of the commission overseeing it, that ``we knew exactly what was
happening in India and Pakistan'' when they carried out secret
tests. ``We were only 15 kilometers off spotting ground zero.''
</P>
<P>
   A recent test was even more accurate, he said. A bomb of 0.1
kiloton _ only a tenth of what the system has to detect _ was set
off in Kazakhstan and picked up in nine stations around the world.

 _ SF CHRON  
 When Your Job Goes Down the Drain  &HT;     By David Lazarus 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
``Rats,'' shouts Apollo Rojas from down the manhole near the corner
of Taylor and Eddy streets in the Tenderloin. ``A whole nest of
them.''
<P>
   ``Rats,'' repeats Gene Chruszcz with a look of mock horror,
enjoying the miserable expression on my face.
</P>
<P>
   Chruszcz (pronounced ``cruise''), 38, and Rojas, 53, are San
Francisco's only two full-time sewer inspectors. They have been
amusing themselves since the early morning preparing me for my
first (and last) foray into the city's underbelly.
</P>
<P>
   Rojas can be heard whooping and yelling down below.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's scaring them off,'' Chruszcz explains as he's lowered by
winch down the manhole.
</P>
<P>
   It's about 10 feet to the bottom. Watching from the street,
Charlie O'Neil, manager of sewer operations, shakes his head as
Chruszcz repositions his large frame to slither out of view.
</P>
<P>
   ``Offset manhole,'' O'Neil explains. For some reason _ O'Neil
has no idea why _ the original engineers designed this particular
entry to the underworld at a 90-degree angle. Most other manholes
open directly onto the sewer.
</P>
<P>
   I apprehensively check my harness and am clipped to the winch.
I'm wearing a bright orange jumpsuit, high rubber boots, a helmet,
surgical mask, gloves and assorted emergency gear.
</P>
<P>
   I feel decidedly underdressed.
</P>
<P>
   Readers who haven't yet finished breakfast may want to stop
right here. Things are about to get really, really yucky.
</P>
<P>
   The rungs down the manhole are long gone. Sewer workers seldom
use them anyway. Most rungs haven't been replaced since the sewer
was originally constructed nearly a century ago, and they now are
rusty and unreliable.
</P>
<P>
   The winch provides a soft landing amid the dirt and debris at
the bottom of the manhole. A narrow passage leads to the sewer,
where Chruszcz is waiting, twin lights shining from his helmet.
</P>
<P>
   The only way in is by crawling through, feet first.
</P>
<P>
   Cockroaches become visible, scurrying along the walls and
ceiling toward the lights on one's head. The roaches are 3, maybe 4
inches long.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're going to drop all over you,'' Chruszcz says. ``You
just brush them off.''
</P>
<P>
   The actual sewer is oval shaped, narrow at the bottom, wider up
top. It's 3 feet wide and ostensibly 5 feet high, though sand can
build up at the base, forcing inspectors to move about in a
constant crouch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Check this out,'' Chruszcz says, pointing a video camera down
the tunnel.
</P>
<P>
   The sewer running beneath Eddy Street reaches a dead end at
Taylor. At the edge of the beam from Chruszcz's helmet, about a
dozen gray rats can be seen scurrying against the bricks. They're
the size of small weasels.
</P>
<P>
   Cornered, the rats turn to face their assailants. If it's a
nest, they'll attack to defend their young.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's go the other way,'' Chruszcz suggests.
</P>
<P>
   No one opposes the idea.
</P>
<P>
   Downtown San Francisco has roughly 90 miles of 3-by-5 sewers,
the oldest part of the network. There are about 800 miles of newer
pipes crisscrossing the city elsewhere, most of which are routinely
inspected by camera-toting robots.
</P>
<P>
   The 3-by-5s, however, have to be surveyed on foot. That's
because a variety of obstacles can accumulate in the 100-year-old
tunnels, making passage difficult if not impossible for machines.
</P>
<P>
   The inspectors are looking for cracks in the brickwork, broken
masonry, structural weakness or, worse, whole cave-ins.
</P>
<P>
   Rojas' light is visible down the tunnel. Sewer inspectors always
work in pairs _ for efficiency as well as safety. Aside from the
vermin and waste materials, other potential hazards include toxic
gases, oxygen deficiency and, most common of all, injury by
slipping and falling in the muck.
</P>
<P>
   Chruszcz says sewer workers grow acclimated to the
disease-ridden environment and hardly ever get sick from their
travels in the underworld. For those new to the experience,
however, a day or two of intestinal troubles can be expected after
encountering all these microbes for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   Swell. Something to look forward to.
</P>
<P>
   Rojas is performing the initial inspection. As he spots cracks
or other defects in the walls and ceiling, he marks them with spray
paint.
</P>
<P>
   Chruszcz follows with the video camera, making a visual record
of the surroundings with his own commentary on what he sees. The
tape and accompanying paperwork _ there's lots of paperwork _ will
go to the Department of Public Works for follow-up maintenance.
</P>
<P>
   Heading away from the rats and the Taylor Street dead-end, the
base of the sewer quickly deepens with a dark, gooey slime that
envelops one's boots like pancake syrup.
</P>
<P>
   How horrible is it? Imagine the worst plumbing disaster you've
ever experienced. Now multiply by a million.
</P>
<P>
   Now imagine walking in it. And smelling it. And breathing it.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of guys wouldn't do this,'' Chruszcz says with
considerable understatement. ``You can really wig out. But you get
used to it. It's like a little adventure.''
</P>
<P>
   So what would possibly compel a person to spend each and every
working day in such an environment? The money, obviously. Both
Chruszcz and Rojas make about $22 an hour, which each says is a
good deal more than they would pull down in, say, construction
jobs.
</P>
<P>
   With each sticky step deeper into the tunnel, the roaches become
thicker on the walls and ceiling. There must be thousands up ahead,
streaming toward the helmet lights.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gets lots worse than this,'' Chruszcz says. ``I don't mind
if it's dirty. It's mobility I care about. You get on your hands
and knees, you start to worry.''
</P>
<P>
   It's awfully hard to imagine it being a lot worse than this. But
Chruszcz and Rojas agree that the city's absolute nastiest sewer
experiences are to be had below Chinatown and Fisherman's Wharf.
</P>
<P>
   It's the grease from the restaurants. It permeates one's hair
and clothing. It also serves as a smorgasbord for the rats and
roaches.
</P>
<P>
   Downtown has different challenges. ``When you're down here, you
go by some of the big hotels, with all their toilets and
restaurants, and the stuff comes out of the pipes like a jet,''
Chruszcz says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Engulfed,'' he adds. ``That'd be a horrible way to die.''
</P>
<P>
   If you live or work on the city's east side, there's a pretty
good chance that Chruszcz and Rojas have waded through your waste.
That's because after one flushes, all sewer-borne materials
gradually make their way to one of two treatment plants, one near
Cesar Chavez Street on the San Francisco Bay and the other facing
the ocean near the San Francisco Zoo.
</P>
<P>
   At the treatment plants, the waste goes through a series of
filters and purification processes before eventually emerging from
pipes either five miles into the bay or seven miles out to sea.
</P>
<P>
   Contrary to urban myth, no one has ever seen an alligator or
crocodile down in the sewers. Chruszcz says he heard that a body
turned up in a pumping station a couple of years ago but admits
this may be just a story. He doesn't know anyone who actually saw
it.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Rojas said the strangest thing that has ever happened
to him was losing his previous partner in the tunnels beneath
Stockton Street.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was opening manholes and calling for him,'' Rojas
remembered. ``I could hear him yelling and screaming. Took an hour
to find him.'' Apparently, the poor guy kept wandering down
connecting tunnels as Rojas chased after him on the surface.
</P>
<P>
   Chruszcz says it's unlikely anyone will get lost on this trip.
He and Rojas are inspecting only a few blocks and won't be making
any detours.
</P>
<P>
   But getting lost is the least of my concerns. With a nest of
angry rats to my rear, thousands of filthy, disgusting roaches
starting to drop onto my clothing, and standing ankle-deep in bile,
I'm finally rethinking my commitment to this series of articles.
</P>
<P>
   Before reaching the halfway point to the next manhole, I decide
that I've had enough and head back to the winch.
</P>
<P>
   ``You didn't miss anything,'' Rojas says up on the surface
shortly afterward. ``The roaches were everywhere farther down. The
sewage level came up to your knees.''
</P>
<P>
   ``All in all,'' Chruszcz says, stripping off his gloves, ``this
sewer wasn't that bad.''
</P>
<P>
   While they compare notes beside their truck, a street person
shambles over from the sidewalk and takes in the scene. He gazes at
the open manhole.
</P>
<P>
   ``You ain't going in there, are you?'' the man asks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We already did,'' Rojas answers.
</P>
<P>
   The street person, his clothes grimy and soiled, his skin and
hair a mess, gives the two sewer inspectors a look of amazement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Man,'' he says, shaking his head. ``I wouldn't do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Chruszcz and Rojas exchange a quick glance. They've heard it
before.

 _ SF CHRON  
 Disappearing Inc. for E-Mail Keeps Messages Private  &HT;     Benny Evangelista 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Whether you're a CEO plotting to put a rival company out of
business or a mail room clerk sending a steamy, private e-mail to a
friend, a San Francisco startup has a new product that could help
protect your secrets: self-destructing e-mail.
<P>
   The appropriately named Disappearing Inc. has come up with
software that automatically makes sensitive or personal e-mail
unreadable after a specified time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're allowing companies to shred e-mail just like they've
been shredding confidential documents for years,'' said Rod Lehman,
a Disappearing Inc. vice president.
</P>
<P>
   Disappearing Inc. hopes its message resonates with companies
that may be worried about sensitive e-mail lingering around in a
computer for an unintended person, or worse, a lawyer, to discover.
</P>
<P>
   Just ask Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates, whose old e-mail
messages about rival Netscape Communications Corp. were dredged up
to become a central part of the U.S. government's major antitrust
case against the Redmond, Wash., software giant.
</P>
<P>
   ``With this kind of system, where would it have left the
government's case?'' said Kerry C. Stackpole, president and chief
executive of the trade group Electronic Messaging Association.
</P>
<P>
   The Disappearing Inc. software is designed to work with any
e-mail program, such as Outlook, Netscape Mail or Eudora. It can be
programmed to scramble some or all messages, which are sent along
with a unique key code to unscramble the e-mail. Messages, however,
must be sent as attachments.
</P>
<P>
   If the recipient has installed Disappearing's program, the
message opens as a normal e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   If the recipient does not have Disappearing software, the
attachment launches a Web browser that automatically links to a
program on the Web that activates the decoding key.
</P>
<P>
   But the sender can program the software to destroy that key at
any time _ seconds, days or years later. E-mail messages that are
deleted can still exist on a computer hard drive, server or backup
tape and be retrieved later. But Disappearing officials claim
e-mail encrypted by their software would still be as unreadable as
shredded paper without the decoder key.
</P>
<P>
   Keith Rosema, one of the company's four co-founders and a former
asteroid tracker for the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory in
Pasadena, said only a government spy agency supercomputer would be
able to decode the message.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since in most of cases we're talking about people fishing for
dirt, they won't have the resources,'' Rosema said.
</P>
<P>
   The system isn't a safety net for beaming an e-mail to the wrong
person, since the text of the message can still be copied and
pasted to another file that won't disappear.
</P>
<P>
   Still, e-mail security is a problem, especially with electronic
messages now zooming along the Internet at a rate of about 7
trillion a year, Stackpole said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's more of a danger than people realize,'' Stackpole said.
``The world should understand that e-mails are more like postcards
than letters. You send it out in the open. Having a secure
messaging system is a key component to be able to do e-commerce.''
</P>
<P>
   Disappearing Inc. hopes to start selling its product to large
corporations in January, possibly for about $4 per month for each
computer user. Rosema said a consumer version may be ready later
next year.

 &HT;    Glover slowly developing
 &HT;    By Denberg
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHATTANOOGA, Tenn. _ Nearly a year has gone by since Dion
Glover's bright basketball future turned bleak in the agony of an
explosive knee injury that terminated his sophomore season at
Georgia Tech.
</P>
<P>
   His career might have ended, except for the capable medical
staff at Georgia Tech. Instead, he's beginning his first training
camp with the Atlanta Hawks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here I am on an NBA team, participating in training camp. I
would never have believed it,'' Glover said Thursday. ``I would
have thought I would still be doing rehab at this point.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is not to say that the rookie, who will turn 21 on Oct.
22, is ready for the NBA, either physically or mentally. But he's
making progress.
</P>
<P>
   ``My lateral movement isn't what it should be, but that's
coming,'' he said. ``Physically, I'm fine. Coach (Lenny Wilkens) is
working me in slowly. There's no pressure on me, and I appreciate
Coach for that.''
</P>
<P>
   Chances are Glover will start the season on the injured list.
After the heavy work of five practices, he limped noticeably early
Thursday afternoon. His lack of lateral mobility is glaring when he
is on defense, but he still has the glimpses of offensive explosion
that made him one of the ACC's most exciting players during his
season at Tech.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question he's a big-time talent,'' Hawks general
manager Pete Babcock said. ``If we have to wait on Dion, we will.
But at some point this season, he could well be ready.''
</P>
<P>
   With Isaiah Rider and Jim Jackson playing ahead of him, the
former Cedar Grove High School star can take all the time he needs
to get ready. Meanwhile, Glover plays with an increasing sense of
freedom. But he does not yet have the instinctive explosiveness
that once underscored his game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got to reach the point where I do something and then I
realize I did it, not have to think about doing it,'' he said.
``That's got to happen first. This past week, I've been really
working on making quick cuts. I know it will all come back.''
</P>
<P>
   PRACTICE GUESTS
</P>
<P>
   Hall of Fame forward Alex English attended camp as a guest of
Babcock and offered advice to the team's three small forwards,
LaPhonso Ellis, Chris Crawford and Roshown McLeod. The Hawks could
pick up a few pointers from English, the seventh-leading scorer in
NBA history and the league's most prolific scorer during the
1980s.... The coaches from Southern Tech in Marietta, Ga., watched
the morning practice and former Minnesota coach Clem Haskins, an
assistant to coach Lenny Wilkens on the 1996 Olympic team, is
expected to attend some practice sessions over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   SHORT SHOTS
</P>
<P>
   Ellis prevailed in a shooting game after an evening practice
when he floated home two half-court hook shots. Bimbo Coles was the
only other Hawk to sink a half-court shot, on a conventional
jumper.... In a scrimmage, Rider had a baseline runner blocked by
Dikembe Mutombo. Rider pointed to his own head, as if to say, ``I
remember who you are now.'' Next time down, he gave himself a lot
of room and sank a 3-pointer.... Among those trying out for the
team is former Oregon guard Terik Brown, whose father, Fred, played
for Wilkens' 1979 NBA championship team in Seattle.

NIKE IDENTIFIES PLANTS ABROAD THAT MAKE UNIVERSITY APPAREL
</HEADLINE>

 By STEVEN GREENHOUSE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   In a significant concession to the anti-sweatshop movement on
college campuses, Nike became the first large apparel company
Thursday to disclose the names and locations of dozens of its
overseas factories _ a move anti-sweatshop groups said was vital to
uncover unsatisfactory working conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Student groups applauded Nike's disclosures about factories in
Bangladesh, China, Guatemala, Thailand and other countries, saying
that having the names and addresses will make it far easier to
verify whether Nike has made good on its promises to improve
working conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Last spring, students held demonstrations at Harvard, Yale,
Princeton and dozens of other colleges and universities, demanding
that universities force companies making apparel with school logos
to disclose the names and addresses of their factories. All told,
manufacturers like Nike, Champion, Adidas and Gear for Sports
produce $2.5 billion worth of goods each year bearing the names of
hundreds of colleges.
</P>
<P>
   Nike, the giant footwear manufacturer, which has been a prime
target of labor rights groups, disclosed the names of the 41
overseas factories it uses to make athletic gear for Duke,
Georgetown, the University of Michigan, the University of North
Carolina and the University of Arizona. The 41 factories are in 11
countries and make sweatshirts, T-shirts, shorts and other apparel
carrying school names.
</P>
<P>
   Several student leaders said that Nike's move would improve the
image of a company that has been battered by a wave of criticism
that it used overseas sweatshops. Nike officials insist that they
maintain satisfactory conditions at the 545 factories the company
uses worldwide. They say every plant Nike uses is inspected
annually by an independent auditing firm.
</P>
<P>
   Until Nike's move Thursday, apparel companies refused to
disclose the names and addresses of their factories, asserting that
such information was a valuable secret. Many companies said they
feared that if their competitors learned where their factories
were, those competitors might try to supplant them at those
factories in an effort to expand.
</P>
<P>
   Nike's disclosures are expected to place considerable pressure
on other apparel makers to follow suit, especially because several
universities have threatened to drop their licensees unless they
make similar disclosures.
</P>
<P>
   ``What Nike did is important,'' said Eric Brakken, an organizer
for United Students Against Sweatshops, a coalition of campus
groups. ``It blows open the whole notion that other companies are
putting forward that they can't make such disclosures.''
</P>
<P>
   Brakken added, ``Disclosure is important because it allows us to
talk to people in these overseas communities _ religious leaders,
human rights leaders _ who are then able to go and examine and
verify working conditions.''
</P>
<P>
   In demonstrations last year, students demanded not only that
apparel companies disclose factory names but also that factories
pay a living wage and take strong action to prevent harassment and
discrimination against female workers.
</P>
<P>
   Nike announced its disclosure move by running advertisements in
the newspapers at the five universities. It also posted the names
and addresses of the 41 factories on its Web site
(www.nikebiz.com).
</P>
<P>
   ``We decided that it was the right way to go as a company,''
said Simon Pestridge, Nike's manager of labor practices. ``If a
university decides that disclosure is the way to go, then that
university has an absolute right to know where that product is
produced. We've never disagreed with the philosophy that students
and universities have a right to know that.''
</P>
<P>
   University officials welcomed Nike's move. Rutledge Tufts, an
administrator at the University of North Carolina, who is
co-chairman of that school's licensing labor code advisory
committee, said that Nike was setting a great example and that the
school was asking other licensees to do the same thing.
</P>
<P>
   Tufts said having factories inspected every few months might not
be enough to ensure fair working conditions.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're hoping is that with these disclosures, groups in
the communities around the factories will be able to support these
efforts to ensure satisfactory conditions,'' he said. ``That way,
we'll be able to get a picture of conditions across the entire year
rather than at moments in time.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Siegal, general counsel of the Collegiate Licensing Corp.,
which represents 180 colleges and universities in their
negotiations with manufacturers, said, ``Many universities will
certainly view Nike's action as a step in the right direction. Will
other license manufacturers follow suit? I don't know. But Nike has
certainly raised the stakes.''
</P>
<P>
   Nike's announcement was one of the biggest victories thus far by
the campus anti-sweatshop movement.
</P>
<P>
   Jo-Ann Mort, communications director for the nation's largest
apparel workers' union, the Union of Needletrades, Industrial and
Textile Employees, said, ``This is a small, but significant victory
gained by the student movement. Not too long ago, Nike and other
corporations insisted that public disclosure would destroy their
business.''

VIOLENCE A WAY OF LIFE IN THE NHL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PETE ALFANO 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _The replays are a chilling reminder and an
omen. Over and over, Mike Modano has watched himself tumble
headfirst and out-of-control into the end boards at Reunion Arena
on Saturday night, and he understands how fortunate he is to be
walking, maybe even to be alive.
</P>
<P>
   The injury has made the Stars' $6 million man reconsider the
price that he is willing to pay for the fame, fortune and celebrity
lifestyle that he enjoys as a superstar in the NHL, where fighting
is part of the game's tradition and random acts of violence seem to
occur as often as they do on city streets.
</P>
<P>
   ``It scares you and makes you wonder how much more can I take,''
Modano said in a news conference at the Dr Pepper StarCenter
yesterday. ``At times, I have second thoughts when I am by myself
and wonder how close it was. If this continues, I'm not going to
play anymore. I will quit before I can't react.''
</P>
<P>
   The injury to Modano, as well as incidents involving teammates
Darryl Sydor and Joe Nieuwendyk in Saturday night's game between
the Stars and Anaheim Mighty Ducks, have once again prompted debate
and inflamed passions about violence in hockey and whether the NHL
is doing enough to curb aggression.
</P>
<P>
   At the root of the debate is hockey's sanctioning of fighting.
Supporters say it is a necessary outlet for frustration and often
an honorable pursuit. Detractors argue that it condones violence
and sets a tone that has resulted in more flagrant acts that
jeopardize the careers of players and damage the image of the
league.
</P>
<P>
   There is also the bottom-line issue of whether fighting helps
hockey at the turnstiles. Spectators appear to enjoy fights; cable
and network TV newscasts often show fight highlights even if they
were isolated events that had no affect on the outcome of the game.
The NHL has passed stricter rules to penalize fighting, but has
stopped short of an outright ban.
</P>
<P>
   Even proponents of fighting, however, say that players in the
NHL are showing an increasing lack of respect for one another and
their livelihood.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a league problem, but a player problem,'' said Glen
Sather, president and general manager of the Edmonton Oilers.''That
bothers me the most. There are so many players now, and that leads
to unfamiliarity. They wear helmets and masks and have a false
sense of security.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a violent game by nature, but players have to police
themselves. The players association should encourage the league to
suspend guys for more games instead of defending these guys.''
</P>
<P>
   From the original six-team league in which almost all the
players were native Canadians, the NHL has evolved into a 28-team
league with many players from the United States and Europe. A once
close-knit fraternity has become a melting pot of cultures and
languages, which can divide players. The discrepancy in salaries
can also ferment jealousy and lack of brotherhood.
</P>
<P>
   Even Teemu Selanne, the Ducks' superstar forward, empathizes
with Modano. ``Sometimes, its like a jungle out there,'' he said.
``I think we need more respect for each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most dangerous thing now is players going full speed and
trying to hurt somebody,'' Selanne continued. ``I think every
player should think, `how about if somebody did that to me?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Modano said he plans to speak to NHL Players Association
officials about the incident in which Ducks defenseman Ruslan Salei
illegally pushed him from behind, knocking him awkwardly into the
boards. Modano suffered a concussion, broken nose and strained neck
ligaments. Salei was given a 10-game suspension without pay by the
league.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our players union and the owners have to get together to
change it,'' Modano said. ``It's turned into a vigilante mentality.
Do we have to wait for someone to be paralyzed or killed before the
league, teams and players come together and act?''
</P>
<P>
   Ducks defenseman Pascal Trepanier was suspended for five games
without pay for elbowing Nieuwendyk in the neck, and Jim McKenzie
was suspended four games without pay for punching Sydor repeatedly
in the back of the head as Sydor lay facedown on the ice. Sydor
suffered a hairline fracture of his left eye socket and is
sidelined indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talked with my wife and for sure, you think if it's all
worth it,'' Sydor said. ``You would like to get out \Rof the
sport\S and have fun after.''
</P>
<P>
   Modano and Sydor say that the suspensions could have been
tougher. The NHL says they fit the crime.
</P>
<P>
   The league says that it is cracking down on violence. It
attributes the perception that violence is increasing to increased
exposure through expansion and all-sports television networks that
sometimes show gore over goals. Players are also bigger and faster
than ever, making collisions more violent.
</P>
<P>
   NHL spokesman Frank Brown said that there were 51 suspensions
last season resulting from aggressive acts, costing players 147
games and $1.545 million in fines. Penalty minutes decreased by
5,000, and there were 344 fewer fights.
</P>
<P>
   Colin Campbell, a former player and coach, oversees fine and
punishment for the league, and knows the tricks of the trade as
director of hockey operations. The addition of a second referee for
all games this season is also seen as a deterrent.
</P>
<P>
   The spokesman said that Campbell took into account not only the
severity of the acts committed by the three Mighty Ducks, but the
history of each player before passing the suspensions. There is
also a provision in the rules that enables commissioner Gary
Bettman and Campbell to fine and suspend other team officials in
addition to the players involved. In theory, a coach or general
manager could be held accountable for what one of his players does
on the ice.
</P>
<P>
   But is this enough? The value of players cannot be measured only
in terms of games missed. For example, the combined annual salaries
of the three Ducks who were suspended is $1,850,000. Modano, Sydor
and Nieuwendyk (who was not sidelined) earn a combined $11 million
a year.
</P>
<P>
   It will take more than rules to change the players' mindset.
</P>
<P>
   Sather, who was a pugnacious player and coached the Oilers when
Wayne Gretzky was in his prime, was more upset that McKenzie had
violated the player code and attacked Sydor from behind, pounding
his head into the ice.
</P>
<P>
   ``What McKenzie did was premeditated,'' Sather said. ``It shows
a real lack of respect. I don't think Salei was trying to
intentionally injure Modano, although he has to be held accountable
for what he did.''
</P>
<P>
   McKenzie's attack seemed reminiscent of the days of the Broad
Street Bullies in the 1970s when the Philadelphia Flyers terrorized
opponents. After a bench-clearing brawl in Toronto in 1975, Ontario
(Canada) attorney general Roy McMurtry vowed to prosecute hockey's
goons as he would anyone committing a similar act on the street.
Commissioner Clarence Campbell issued a familiar refrain: He blamed
increased television exposure and expansion for creating a
perception that violence was on the rise.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps coincidentally, the NHL adopted the third-man-in rule in
1976, in which a player intervening on behalf of a teammate
involved in a fight is ejected. Eleven years later, the league
addressed bench-clearing brawls, handing out automatic suspensions
for players who left the bench during a fight. McMurtry is often
credited for instigating the changes.
</P>
<P>
   But what will it take now to curb violence? Will the NHL
eventually ban fighting? Will it be the players who advocate
tougher punishment?
</P>
<P>
   Or will the Modano incident become yesterday's news?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's getting to a point where players have to sit down and
really have a chat,'' said the Stars' Brian Skrudland. ``Hockey is
still a game and a game that when we all leave, we'd like to walk
away, not wheel our way out.''  &LR; tagtop:''Staff writers Mac Engel

GRAND JURY INDICTS FUGITIVE FINANCIER ON FRAUD AND OTHER CHARGES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs to correct hed)  (th) 
 By LESLIE WAYNE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The fugitive financier Martin Frankel, who fled the United
States and is now in a German prison, was indicted by a federal
grand jury Thursday on 36 counts of fraud, money laundering and
racketeering in a scheme that siphoned more than $200 million from
a group of Southern insurance companies and was used for his own
benefit.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment, sought by the U.S. Attorney's Office for the
District of Connecticut, is the latest turn in a bizarre tale in
which Frankel, 44, is accused of masterminding a complicated
financial plan that, for more than eight years, drained millions of
dollars from insurance companies and their policyholders. That
scheme ended in May when Frankel's Greenwich, Conn., mansion caught
fire and Frankel fled the country.
</P>
<P>
   The subject of an international manhunt, Frankel was captured in
a Hamburg hotel room by local police officers and an FBI agent in
September and was imprisoned there on charges of carrying a false
passport. Meanwhile, German authorities have been waiting for
American law enforcement officials to prepare more serious charges
against him.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment lays the groundwork for a formal extradition
process to begin. It is not known whether Frankel will fight
extradition. His financial assets have been frozen and he is now
being represented by Thomas Dennis, a public defender, who would
not comment Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Hugh F. Keefe, Frankel's former lawyer, said Thursday that
Frankel was currently facing ``two lousy options,'' either
remaining in German prison or returning to America for trial. Keefe
said he was no longer Frankel's lawyer because of the freeze on
Frankel's assets. He added, however, that Frankel's condition
``varies from day to day.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly,'' he continued, ``this is not a terrific place to be
for anyone and he is in a tough German prison.''
</P>
<P>
   Keefe added that, until this indictment, one of the grounds for
Frankel to oppose extradition had been that he had not been
formally charged with a crime. But Thursday's indictment ``lightens
the government's load,'' Keefe said. ``He will eventually be
extradicted back to America unless he waives it.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers with the U.S. attorney's office declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment offers some new details concerning how Frankel
conducted his insurance scheme and where the money went. In
two-pages of single-spaced type, the indictment describes how
Frankel, using a Swiss bank account, converted the money from the
insurance company into his multimillion dollar Greenwich mansion,
and into diamonds, gold coins from the Vienna Philharmonic,
traveler's checks, numerous automobiles and ``at least'' one
aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankel converted, stole and embezzled the majority of funds
for personal use,'' the indictment said. ``In total, in excess of
$200 million was converted, stolen and embezzled by Frankel through
the scheme and artifice to defraud.''
</P>
<P>
   The indictment also outlined how Frankel did business: He
created a trust, the Thunor Trust, that he used to acquire stakes
in a number of insurance companies and then took the assets of
these insurance companies by saying that the money would be
invested in safe assets, primarily U.S. government securities.
Instead, he kept the money.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   He also provided the insurance companies with false profit and
loss statements and, in some cases, returned enough cash to the
companies to prevent detection of the scheme by state insurance
regulators.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment also accuses him of controlling the St. Francis
of Assisi Foundation, which was to be used to acquire insurance
companies and use any profits for charitable causes. As part of
this fraud, Frankel even persuaded a high-level retired priest at
the Vatican to unwittingly back this charity.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the indictment lists a number of Wall Street firms
where Frankel maintained accounts. They included Dreyfus Corp.,
Prudential Securities and Bear, Stearns &AMP; Co., along with Banque
SCS Alliance in Switzerland. None of the firms are named in the
indictment and were listed simply as places were Frankel did
business.
</P>
<P>
   A native of Toledo, Ohio, Frankel agreed to a lifetime ban from
the securities business in an out-of-court settlement in 1992 with
the Securities and Exchange Commission. This came after he ran
afoul of financial regulators when a small investment fund he ran
generated steep losses for retirees who had entrusted their savings
to Frankel.
</P>
<P>
   But even before that agreement was final, he began the scheme
that lead to Thursday's indictment. Along the way, however, he
lived a lavish life, operating from inside his four-acre Greenwich
mansion, complete with walls of computer and trading equipment _
which was rarely used _ and staffed by women he recruited through
the Internet and help-wanted ads to be his personal assistants.
</P>
<P>
   About the time Frankel fled the country, his house caught fire.
While there, Greenwich firefighters found smoldering documents and
a ``to-do'' list in which item No. 1 said ``Launder Money.''
</P>
<P>
   Frankel was in his Hamburg hotel room with a female companion,
diamonds and cash, when he was arrested Sept. 4. Up to that point,
he had traveled through Europe, often openly, with several female
friends, and he had lived in apartments and hotels arranged for him
by contacts in Rome.
</P>
<P>
   If Frankel returns to the United States, he would be brought
before Judge Holly B. Fitzsimmons in Bridgeport. Keefe, Frankel's
former lawyer, said Frankel has not been allowed by German
authorities to meet with his new American lawyer yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is important,'' Keefe said, ``to remember that this man is
presumed innocent and has not yet had a chance to give his side of
the story.''

ANTARCTICA IS MELTING, BUT HUMANS AREN'T RESPONSIBLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TOM PAULSON  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A massive portion of Antarctica is melting away, as global
warming doomsayers have long warned, but the scientists who proved
the meltdown say it has nothing to do with human-caused climate
changes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ice sheet has been retreating for the last seven or eight
thousand years,'' said Howard Conway, a University of Washington
geophysicist and lead author of a report in Friday's Science
magazine.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's long before we could have had anything to do with it.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the most frequently cited catastrophic effects of global
warming is the predicted rise in worldwide sea levels by 15 to 20
feet should the massive West Antarctic Ice Sheet melt and flood the
planet's densely populated coastal areas.
</P>
<P>
   A complete melt-down of West Antarctica would submerge
significant portions of the world's coastal cities, completely
flooding vast lowland areas, including Florida and much of Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Conway and colleagues at the UW and University of Maine reported
on evidence that the ice of West Antarctica is indeed melting and
has already retreated about 800 miles over the last 7,000 to 8,000
years. The edge of the ice sheet is shrinking at a rate of about
400 feet per year.
</P>
<P>
   But the ice sheet's melt-off began thousands of years ago, they
found, and has been progressing steadily without a driving force
like human industrial effluent or rapid changes in climate.
</P>
<P>
   Conway emphasized that the West Antarctic Ice Sheet could melt
faster if ocean temperatures rise as a result of human-caused
climate change.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our research doesn't say anything about what's been happening
within the last 100 years,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   There is plenty of other data to support the claim that the
climate is being significantly altered by industrial emissions and
other human activities, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the Earth's other massive ice sheets in Greenland and
East Antarctica, the West Antarctic Ice Sheet rests on land below
sea level. Scientists have long regarded it as susceptible to rapid
melting from an increase in ocean temperatures, but there hasn't
been much hard evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Finding solid evidence of melting and of the rate of recession
has been a major scientific challenge for decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been called the grand unsolved problem of
glaciology,'' Conway said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sea level of the world is controlled by the big ice sheets
so these are fairly important questions,'' said George Denton, a
University of Maine glacial geologist and one of the co-authors on
the paper.
</P>
<P>
   A rise in sea level some 14,000 years ago probably started the
meltdown in West Antarctica, the scientists say. That's when the
last Ice Age ended and the ice sheets that covered much of the
planet melted.
</P>
<P>
   The new findings can help resolve these questions, Denton said.
Other co-authors are UW geophysicists Ed Waddington and Tony Gades
and Denton's colleague Brenda Hall.
</P>
<P>
   Years ago, Conway might have been considered an unlikely person
to solve a major scientific puzzle. The soft-spoken New Zealand
native is a former mountain climber who shifted from professional
guiding to glacier research after he helped Denton navigate an ice
field in Antarctica in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hired him as a guide to get us to an area where we did some
of the work that led to this paper,'' Denton said. ``He got
interested in the history of the Antarctic ice sheet ... and went
back to school for his degree.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Conway's team, two other scientific teams
published reports in Science providing further evidence of this
long-term meltdown of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet.
</P>
<P>
   A team led by Ian Joughin, a UW doctoral graduate now at the
California Institute of Technology, identified and reported on
``ice streams'' in West Antarctica _ rapid flowing internal
tributaries of ice and water that some believe could weaken the ice
sheet and lead to a catastrophic collapse.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Ackert Jr, at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
and his colleagues identified how much thicker the West Antarctic
Ice Sheet was 10,000 years ago by studying changes on the surface
of a volcano.
</P>
<P>
   The team led by Conway used two techniques to arrive at a
precise description of the recession of the ice sheet over the last
7,000 years.
</P>
<P>
   Denton and Hall performed radiocarbon dating to determine the
time of death of algae and shells on land now free of ice. When the
ice sheet retreats, land that has been compressed by the massive
ice sheet rises up and large amounts of previously submerged sea
life dies off.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rapid uplift takes place right after the ice recedes,'' Denton
said.
</P>
<P>
   The UW team used radar imaging to identify deformations in
sub-surface ice _ much like earthquake scientists use sonar to
detect fractures and potential faults in rock.
</P>
<P>
   The ice deformations, Waddington and Conway said, can be tracked
throughout the ice sheet and correlated with other data used to
identify the age and thicknesses of ancient layers.
</P>
<P>
   Using both sets of data, the UW and Maine scientists were able
to quantify and describe the historical retreat of the Ross Ice
Shelf over thousands of years in the Ross Sea area of West
Antarctica. Conway noted that most of the melting appears to have
taken place during a time of stable climate on Earth.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the biggest chunk of ice on the planet that is so
susceptible to change,'' Conway said. ``What our findings indicate
is that it might keep melting no matter what we do about global
warming.''

UNCLE OF SHOOTING VICTIM ARRESTED AS SINGER'S MURDER TRIAL
CONTINUES 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JAMES PINKERTON 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   UVALDE, Texas _ The bad blood between country singer Johnny
Rodriguez and the family of the man he is accused of killing was
evident in and out of the courtroom Thursday, as police confirmed
the victim's uncle was jailed for making a death threat.
</P>
<P>
   Uvalde County Sheriff Beaumont Watkins said Baltazar Borrego, an
uncle of shooting victim Israel ``Bosco'' Borrego, was arrested
Wednesday and is in the county jail for allegedly threatening to
kill a former lover. During the alleged threat, Baltazar Borrego
predicted Rodriguez ''would walk'' on murder charges, adding he
would kill the singer, Watkins said.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez, 47, is on trial in the Aug. 29, 1998, slaying of
Borrego after an all-night beer party. The singer's defense
attorneys claim Rodriguez shot Borrego, a convicted burglar, in
self-defense when he found him inside his mother's home in Sabinal.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, former Sabinal resident Arnulfo Avila testified the
dead man's older brother and a friend came to his home and pulled a
gun on him days after the shooting because he had attended the
party with Rodriguez.
</P>
<P>
   Avila said he moved out of town because of the threat, but he
has heard that the brothers have continued to threaten anyone who
might testify for Rodriguez.
</P>
<P>
   When pressed by a prosecutor, he said he had not heard of any
specific threats involving the killing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want any problems,'' Avila then told defense attorneys
who asked if he was afraid of the Borrego clan.
</P>
<P>
   Avila, and Borrego's widow, mother and older brother were called
by District Attorney Tony Hackebeil to show the victim and
Rodriguez had a close relationship.
</P>
<P>
   The district attorney, in opening remarks to the jury Wednesday,
said Rodriguez shot Borrego while in a ``drunken stupor'' and
because he was mad the man was in his mother's house cooking
breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he wasn't at his wife's, or my house, he was at
Johnny's,'' Alicia Borrego said of her slain son.
</P>
<P>
   She told the jury she went to the Rodriguez house on Pickford
street on three mornings to wake her son so he wouldn't miss work.
She said twice she walked into the unlocked house and slapped her
son awake, and one time she had to rouse Rodriguez who was, as
during the other visits, passed out drunk in a chair.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `Come in, Alicia. Excuse the mess ... we partied too
long,''' she recalled, adding the table was littered with empty
beer cans and cigarette butts.
</P>
<P>
   Under defense questioning, Alicia Borrego acknowledged her son
had said Rodriguez's sister had warned him not to return to the
house. But she said the warning was directed toward a group of
people and ``not straight to him.''
</P>
<P>
   Meliton Borrego Jr., one of the victim's four brothers,
identified photographs taken in December 1997 of Rodriguez with his
arm around his brother's shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes me, my brother and Johnny would party inside the
house,'' said Borrego, a 33-year-old construction worker. ``I
thought they were friends because I never did see them argue or
nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, a Sabinal police officer testified he arrived at
the Rodriguez residence shortly after 4 a.m. and saw a drunken
Rodriguez kicking Borrego as the shooting victim lay on the kitchen
floor.
</P>
<P>
   However, defense attorneys asked Dr. Robert C. Bux, the deputy
chief medical examiner for Bexar County, if he saw any bruises when
he conducted an autopsy on Borrego.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given that scenario, I would expect there to be some marks,''
Bux testified.
</P>
<P>
   But he also agreed with prosecutor Hackebeil that because of
massive internal bleeding caused by the single gunshot wound _ more
than two quarts of blood pooled in the victim's abdomen _ he would
expect no bruising due to a lack of blood in the skin or muscle
tissue.
</P>
<P>
   Bux said Borrego, whose blood alcohol content was 2 1/2 times
the legal limit, died of internal bleeding after a single
.357-caliber slug severed a vein in his back.
</P>
<P>
   Irma Rodriguez, a paramedic who responded to the shooting, told
how she had to strip the jeans and underwear from Borrego to find
the gunshot wound in his lower abdomen. As she did, two $20 bills
fell out of his pocket, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the courtroom, defense attorney Alan Brown said the $40
was stolen from the Rodriguez home by Borrego, and ``that was the
fruits of his burglary.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown said Rodriguez was within his rights to shoot an intruder
to protect his property.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the law in Texas. You can stop a burglar at night,''
Brown said. ``You can use deadly force for criminal mischief at
night or theft at night.''
</P>
<P>
   Borrego's widow, Anita, testified the last time she saw her
husband was the night before the killing when she bought him a
six-pack of beer and dropped him off at his grandfather's house to
drink.
</P>
<P>
   The widow, who is now raising three children, fought tears as
she told the jury about her stormy marriage with the victim during
which she pressed charges against him for assault. But she defended
him and said he was not a violent person, and she was ``shocked''
when she learned he was shot by Rodriguez.
</P>
<P>
   But under defense questioning, she agreed it would be justified
to shoot a burglar if it appeared he intended to harm her or her
children.

 &HT;    Jesus video: Deliverance by mail
 &HT;    By Ralph Ellis
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A mass mailing in parts of metro Atlanta aims to
spread Christianity through the VCR.
</P>
<P>
   A group called the Jesus Video Project is sending a video
portraying the life of Jesus to 154,896 homes, at a cost of about
half a million dollars. Churches raised the money, and some are
promoting the mailing with signs out front and in members' yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to say: Here, check this out in your home at your
comfort level,'' said the Rev. Barry Odom, pastor of Braelinn
Baptist Church in Peachtree City. ``We want to get the message to
them and let them decide.''
</P>
<P>
   The video is being sent to every residential mailbox and post
office box in Fayette, Coweta, Meriwether, Heard, Banks and Jackson
counties. Videos also will go to three ZIP codes around Woodstock
in Cherokee County (30114, 30115 and 30142), one in northwest Cobb
County (30066) and one in Rabun County (30357).
</P>
<P>
   Bill Laycock, state director of the Jesus Video Project,
conceded that promoting Christianity in Georgia might be considered
a case of taking coal to Newcastle. In fact, the project's state
board of directors balked at Laycock's original suggestion to
attempt a statewide mailing. ``They said, `This is the Bible
Belt,''' Laycock said. ``They felt the money would be better spent
on our overseas projects.''
</P>
<P>
   But churches in the targeted areas asked for the mailing and
pressed ahead with fund-raising. The cost was paid by churches in
the participating counties and ZIP codes, with an assist from an
anonymous supporter who chipped in $200,000, Laycock said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jesus,'' subtitled ``The Public Life of Jesus,'' was made by
producer John Heyman and released in 1979 for the Campus Crusade
for Christ. Organizers estimate 2 billion people have seen it.
</P>
<P>
   In April 1998, a businessman paid $3.3 million anonymously to
mail 1.7 million tapes to homes across Alabama. In Ohio, 385,000
videos were mailed out.
</P>
<P>
   The 83-minute film, which tells the story of Jesus as he is
born, teaches, is crucified and resurrected, ends with an
invitation to become a Christian.
</P>
<P>
   A card accompanying the video box can be mailed for contact with
churches.
</P>
<P>
   Ministers at participating churches said the video has been
warmly received. The Rev. Leslie Tuso, associate minister at
Mountain View United Methodist Church in Cobb County, said her
church would hold a prayer walk this weekend to celebrate the
mailing.
</P>
<P>
   Some Jewish members of B'nai Israel in Riverdale received the
video, Rabbi Julie Schwartz said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I certainly understand that the Christians who sent that are
trying to share very important things, for all the right reasons,''
Schwartz said. ``But for people who have a firm belief in another
faith, this doesn't have any effect on us.''
</P>
<P>
   Odom said supporters of the video don't want to be perceived as
pushy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not out to tell anybody they're wrong,'' he said.
``We're taking the flip side and saying, `This may be what you're
looking for.' And all the time we're saying, `You have 100 percent
control. You can toss this in the trash. It's in your hands to
process.'''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Some managers of international funds are beginning to remember
what winning feels like. But just barely.
</P>
<P>
   For the third quarter, international stock funds _ which have by
and large lagged behind their domestic counterparts in recent years
_ managed a relatively slim, 2.06 percent gain, on average,
according to Morningstar Inc., the Chicago financial publisher.
</P>
<P>
   But that was more than enough to beat the average United States
diversified stock fund, which was down 5.08 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The success of the international equity funds stems largely from
the resurgence of two sectors _ Japanese stocks and gold-mining
issues _ that have been thrashed soundly for most of this decade.
The stocks of Japanese companies have risen this year on
perceptions that Japan's long-suffering economy has at least
bottomed out.
</P>
<P>
   While the Nikkei 225 index rose just 2.8 percent in the quarter,
the strengthening yen magnified the effect for United States funds
that invest in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   And shares of the gold-mining companies rallied in the last week
of the quarter, after European central banks announced that they
would limit their sales of the metal for the next five years. The
price of gold rose 11 percent, to $299 an ounce, between the Sept.
26 announcement and the end of the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   (Morningstar considers precious-metals funds to be international
stock funds because of their high percentage of foreign gold
stocks.)
</P>
<P>
   Three managers of top-performing funds that invest abroad
discussed the stocks that made their funds winners this quarter and
_ in light of the heady run _ what they expect in the future. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A New Era for Japan &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Japan Fund, with 92 percent of its $840.9 million in assets
in its namesake country, returned 29.5 percent for the quarter,
earning it the No.5 spot on the list of 712 international stock
funds tracked by Morningstar. The fund, the oldest Japanese stock
fund, returned 121.3 percent for the 12-month period, though just
7.2 percent annualized over five years.
</P>
<P>
   Its lead manager, Seung K. Kwak, 38, says he tries to capture
the extra return between other investors' short-term valuation of a
stock and his own assessment of the value three to four years in
the future.
</P>
<P>
   NTT Mobile Communications Network, Japan's dominant cellular
phone operator, was among the fund's biggest winners in the
quarter. Kwak bought shares at their initial offering last October
at 780,000 yen ($6,619) each. He said NTT Mobile, which has a
leading proprietary system for the transmission of wireless data,
has a lock on that market in Japan and huge potential to grow
elsewhere in Asia. The shares closed at 2.1 million yen ($19,828),
on Sept. 30, up 28 percent for the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Another winner in the portfolio was Fuji Bank, which rose 52.4
percent. Kwak said the company's planned merger with the Industrial
Bank of Japan and Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank, announced in August, would
bring economies of scale. ``It was one of the loser banks,'' Kwak
said, adding that the stock also received a lift from an infusion
of government funds in March and has reduced exposure to bad debts
_ most of which were related to a weak company in its keiretsu, or
business network.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the market's run-up, Kwak said, Japanese stocks are
still cheap relative to their underlying assets, sales and cash
flow. The prevailing high price-to-earnings ratio _ 49 at the end
of the quarter _ is a relic of management's historical fixation on
revenue growth at the expense of profit margins, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, Japanese companies are being managed for the bottom
line,'' he said. ``We are in the early stages of a new era of
modernization comparable to the Meiji era at the turn of the
century.'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Going for the Gold &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The announcement by the central banks, along with their
reiteration of the value of gold as a reserve asset, was music to
the ears of Bill Martin, portfolio manager of the $275 million
American Century Global Gold fund.
</P>
<P>
   ``New age investors view gold as a wasting asset that has no
place in their portfolios,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Martin, 35, said his fund, which ranked No.6 among international
funds in the quarter with a 28.9 percent return, is almost fully
invested in gold stocks. But within the sector, he tries to keep
the fund diversified along three lines.
</P>
<P>
   The portfolio is spread out geographically, with 60 percent in
North American, 20 percent in South African and 20 percent in
Australian stocks. It has a mix of low- and high-cost producers.
And it includes companies with different strategies for hedging,
which locks in future prices. (Such strategies tend to be very
fluid.)
</P>
<P>
   The fund gained 5.3 percent in the 12 months ended Sept. 30,
though it has an annualized five-year loss of 11.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Last quarter, its best performers were high-cost operators.
</P>
<P>
   One of his holdings, Anglogold Ltd. of Johannesburg, rose 45.4
percent in the quarter. Mines in South Africa tend to be deep, so
labor costs are high. Anglogold's average production cost is more
than $200 an ounce, Martin said. So when the price of gold rose,
its gross margins almost doubled.
</P>
<P>
   He also invested in Battle Mountain Gold, based in Houston. The
stock rose 30.8 percent in the quarter, to $3.1875. ``The company
has a lot of proven and probable reserves that become economic to
mine with gold at $300'' an ounce, Martin said. Such small gold
stocks usually trade at a more modest premium to their net asset
value than their larger-capitalization counterparts, but Martin
said that the gap narrowed during the recent run-up in gold prices.
</P>
<P>
   Another company in his portfolio, Newmont Mining, the global
gold miner based in Denver, rose 30.4 percent last quarter. Also a
high-cost producer, it should benefit from increasing output at a
year-old Indonesian mine, Miller said.
</P>
<P>
   Looking forward, he said that he was ``neutral to bullish'' on
gold. Though he said that it was too early to guess where the price
was headed, he thought it was unlikely to drop below $280 an ounce
for at least the next year. He said he was keeping an eye on what
he considered the two main near-term determinants of gold prices.
</P>
<P>
   First is the extent of ``short covering,'' or the purchase of
gold to pay back gold that was previously borrowed, either by
producers as part of their hedging strategies or by speculators.
The second is the demand for $300-an-ounce gold, especially among
jewelers, during the pre-Christmas buying period. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Playing the Sector Game &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The way the world does business is changing,'' said Loretta
Morris, 46, co-manager of the $99 million Nicholas-Applegate
International Small Cap Growth fund, the No.19 international fund
for the quarter. ``There are a lot of great growth stories outside
the U.S.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Morris is mostly invested in Continental Europe and Britain
(about 50 percent of the portfolio) and Asia (40 percent), the bulk
of that in Japan. But she said she focuses more on sectors and
industries than on country weightings.
</P>
<P>
   Her current emphasis is on service companies (about 27 percent
of the portfolio), which are consolidating, and technology (23
percent).
</P>
<P>
   The fund returned 19.1 percent last quarter, 73.2 percent for
the 12 months ended Sept. 30 and 22.3 percent annualized over five
years.
</P>
<P>
   Among the retailers Ms. Morris likes are two Japanese
category-killers: Kojima, which sells discounted consumer
electronics and appliances, and Fast Retailing, an American-style
apparel discounter. Both are benefiting from increased consumer
attention to pricing, Ms. Morris said. Their stocks rose 42.9
percent and 62.3 percent, respectively, in the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Morris has also made money in Havas Advertising of France,
Europe's second-largest advertising company. Its shares were up 7.7
percent in the quarter. She thinks the same forces that have
powered the growth in ad spending in the United States are in place
overseas: an increasing emphasis on product branding, rising
expenditures by Internet and cellular telephone companies, and
millennium-related promotions.
</P>
<P>
   Those trends also helped lift another of her stocks,
M6-Metropole Television, a French TV broadcaster, whose shares rose
14.8 percent in the quarter. Like the WB Network in the United
States, M6 has the kind of young viewers that advertisers love, Ms.
Morris said.
</P>
<P>
   She expects pending regulations that limit ad time on
government-owned stations to push ad rates higher for publicly held
broadcasters.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Morris also bought the American depository receipts of
Internet Initiative Japan, an Internet service company, at its
August initial offering at $23 each. They were up 104.4 percent as
of Sept. 30.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Ms. Morris said she was paring holdings in Japan a bit,
largely because of the price run-up, and adding more in Europe.

CITING SUPPORT, TRUMP FORMS EXPLORATORY COMMITTEE ON PRESIDENCY
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By ROBERT D. McFADDEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Encouraged by ``amazing'' polls, ``unbelievable''
news media interest and a ``huge'' groundswell of public support,
Donald Trump deepened his flirtation with presidential politics
Thursday by appointing an exploratory committee to help him decide
whether his next big deal should be for 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   While exploratory committees may legally raise funds for
potential candidates, Trump said his would primarily be advisory _
telling him whether he could reasonably expect to win the White
House next year as the nominee of the Reform Party, whose leading
elected official is Jesse Ventura, the former wrestler who won the
Minnesota governorship in an upset last year.
</P>
<P>
   President Trump? If that seemed far-fetched, Trump was not
saying so.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless I thought I could win the whole thing, I would have no
interest,'' Trump said in a telephone interview squeezed into a day
of television appearances, meetings with advisers and, Thursday
night, a dinner with Ventura. A 53-year-old real estate developer
and casino owner, Trump has never run for public office.
</P>
<P>
   In the byzantine realm of Reform Party politics, Trump and
Ventura are shaping up as allies in a fractious nomination fight
that could pit Trump against Pat Buchanan, who is expected to bolt
the Republican Party to bid for the Reform nomination. Buchanan is
supported by a loose alliance with ties to Ross Perot, the Texas
billionaire who is the party's founder.
</P>
<P>
   Political experts say a Buchanan candidacy would siphon
Republican support from Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, who would
presumably prefer a race by Trump, who would have far less impact
on him. Trump, in capsule assessments Thursday, castigated Buchanan
but called Bush ``a strong front-runner.''
</P>
<P>
   Trump, whose name was raised by Ventura last month in the
preliminary skirmishing of a presidential campaign that, with more
than a year to go, is still in the stage of trial balloons and wild
guesses, may be as plausible as any of the actors, tycoons and
others being mentioned. He has name recognition and a net worth
estimated at $1.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not looking to raise money,'' Trump said, noting that, if
he runs, he will largely pay his own campaign bills. ``Fortunately,
I have plenty of money. That gives me one advantage over the
others. I wouldn't have to go through fund raising, with all the
obligations that involves. I wouldn't have to make deals.''
</P>
<P>
   Trump, saying he would decide early next year whether to run,
declined to identify the members of his exploratory committee,
whose main task seemed to be to advise him to go for it, and
perhaps to tell him how to win the internal struggle with Buchanan
for the Reform nomination. Merely appointing the panel gave fresh
momentum to Trump's budding campaign.
</P>
<P>
   He was on NBC's ``Today'' show Thursday and CNN's ``Larry King
Live'' Thursday night. On Wednesday night he appeared on
``Dateline'' on NBC. ``We have never seen such a barrage of calls
from the media and the press as in the last few weeks,'' he said.
``It's unbelievable.'' Referring to his possible run, he said,
``There is a lot of pressure to do this.''
</P>
<P>
   He cited polls with ``amazing results,'' indicating ``that I'd
win, or do very well.'' Asked for specifics, he cited a poll by The
National Enquirer that showed him ``neck and neck'' with Bush. The
poll, he said, gave 39 percent to Bush, 37 percent to Trump and 24
percent to Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Trump, a Republican who called himself socially liberal but a
fiscal conservative, said he opposed gun control but favored tax
cuts, abortion rights, a strong national defense and health care
for all. His positions, he said, are detailed in his latest book,
``The America We Deserve,'' to be published in December.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are looking for straight talk,'' he said. ``They are
tired of politicians.''

INDIANS CRUSH RED SOX, 11-1 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By JOE LAPOINTE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND _ For the Red Sox, their brief, shining moment in the
late-afternoon sun came around p.m. on Thursday and lasted for
about five minutes. After that, shadows and reality descended on
Jacobs Field as the power of the Indians eclipsed most Boston
hopes. When the game ended, around sundown, Cleveland had an 11-1
victory and a 2-0 lead in the three-of-five-game first-round
series.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians can clinch this American League division playoff
series in Fenway Park either Saturday or Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians won Thursday on home runs by Jim Thome and Harold
Baines and the pitching of Charles Nagy. The Red Sox lost with the
pitching of Bret Saberhagen, who said his problem was not his sore
right shoulder but his excitement. They were also hurt by two plays
involving Jose Offerman, one while running to second base, the
other while throwing a ball from there.
</P>
<P>
   The day ended with Boston's Jimy Williams invoking the name of
Babe Ruth, a strange choice for a man managing a team that has
suffered most of the century under the so-called Curse of the
Bambino. When someone asked Williams what he could do to improve a
lineup that has managed only three runs in two games, Williams used
Ruth's given names.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe I'll get a hold of George Herman,'' he said. ``I don't
know. What do you want me to do?''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps he could also use Ruth as a pitcher, as the Red Sox did
before selling him to the Yankees in 1920. They sure could use some
pitching now. Even if Boston's ace, Pedro Martinez, recovers
quickly from his back injury and replaces his brother, Ramon, as
Saturday's starter, the Red Sox, who have lost 18 of their last 19
post-season games, would have difficulty winning three consecutive
days against the Central Division champions, the most productive
team in the last half-century, the first team since the 1950 Red
Sox to score more than 1,000 runs in a season.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the biggest keys is not to get too relaxed,'' said
Thome, whose fourth-inning grand slam off John Wasdin was his
second home run of the series. ``By no means are they going to lay
down and die.''
</P>
<P>
   But they are certainly checking in with the doctor. Martinez,
probable winner of the Cy Young award as A.L.'s best pitcher, left
Game 1 on Wednesday night after four innings with a sore back.
Although Martinez spoke words of hope on Thursday, the team doctor
sounded more pessimistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have some improvement,'' Martinez said. ``I feel better
already. I really feel positive about it. Right now I feel looser.
I'm going to keep working.''
</P>
<P>
   But Dr. William Morgan, traveling with the team, said: ``Pedro
has a muscle strain in the mid-back area. There is a slight
improvement today but he does have persistent pain. He's undergoing
treatment right now, which includes ultrasound, anti-inflammatory
medication and rest. The plan is to start stretching tomorrow and
light exercise tomorrow. We will re-evaluate him tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   The game, before the usual capacity crowd, began at 4:10 p.m.
under blue skies in this jewel of a downtown ball park. Throughout
the afternoon, after lunchtime, fans in team clothing streamed
through the streets while office workers in business clothing
joined them. Cleveland won the opener on Wednesday night by coming
from behind for a 3-2 victory, and the civic buzz is growing here
for the first championship since 1948.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox took a 1-0 lead in the third inning on Thursday when
Offerman's two-out single scored Trot Nixon from second base. But
when the Indians cut off the throw from the outfield, Offerman got
caught between first and second and was tagged for the third out.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it was not a critical blunder, but it served as an omen.
In the bottom of the inning, when Cleveland's Sandy Alomar hit a
potential double-play grounder to shortstop Nomar Garciaparra,
Offerman's throw on the pivot pulled first baseman Mike Stanley off
the base. It was the catalyst for a six-run inning, highlighted by
Baines's three-run home run that drove Saberhagen out and made the
score 6-1.
</P>
<P>
   In the fourth inning, the Indians added five runs, four on
Thome's blast off Wasdin. With a 10-run lead, Nagy cruised into the
twilight, working seven innings and giving up five hits before the
bullpen took over.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eleven runs was a great help,'' Nagy said. ``A lead like that,
you just want to throw strikes.'' He ended an interview by citing a
pitch late in the game that bounced to the plate after he slipped
on the mound.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's my groove right there,'' Nagy said. ``Good dance
move.''
</P>
<P>
   The mood was less jovial for Saberhagen, 35, who spent three
stints on the disabled list this season and said earlier this week
that he might need shoulder surgery. He said he felt no pain on
Thursday and added: ``It felt very good. I shouldn't say too good,
but maybe too much adrenaline. Too excited.'' In 119 innings this
season, he walked only 11 batters. On Thursday, he walked three
batters in the third inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not me, that's what really hurt,'' Saberhagen said of
the walks.
</P>
<P>
   Regarding Baines' first-pitch swing, Saberhagen added: ``I made
a good pitch on Baines, down and away. He deposited it in right
field.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the series over all, Saberhagen said: ``The pressure is on
us. I know it's going to be a long flight home.''  &QL;

NATIONAL PANEL TO REVIEW RESEARCHER FUNDS CONFLICTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DOLORES KONG AND ALISON BASS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The National Institute of Mental Health will review its policy
on conflicts after learning of a Brown University professor who
received hundreds of thousands of dollars from drug companies while
he was receiving federal funds to test new drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Martin Keller issued favorable reports on the drugs and
Brown did not disclose the drug company payments to the federal
government, the Globe reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Steven E. Hyman, director of the NIMH, said Thursday that at
an upcoming advisory council meeting he would raise the issue of
how the institute can more effectively prevent financial conflicts
among federally funded academic researchers.
</P>
<P>
   Keller, a Newton, Mass. resident who is chief of psychiatry at
Brown, was paid more than $500,000 in consulting fees in 1998, most
of it from pharmaceutical companies whose drugs he touted in
medical journals and at conferences.
</P>
<P>
   Sheldon Krimsky, a Tufts University professor studying the
effects of ties between academia and industry, said: If this case
``does not represent a conflict of interest that should be avoided,
then I don't know what such a conflict would be.'' Krimsky is a
nationally known science policy specialist who has been concerned
by what he sees as a loss of objectivity in research.
</P>
<P>
   Keller earned a total of $842,000 last year, according to
financial records, and more than half of his income came from the
pharmaceutical industry, including companies such as Pfizer Inc.,
Bristol-Myers Squibb, Wyeth-Ayerst, and Eli Lilly _ all of which
market antidepressants that Keller lauded in a series of research
reports.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Keller was receiving millions of dollars in funding
from the National Institute of Mental Health for research on
depression and ways to treat it. In 1998, for instance, Keller
authored an article in the journal Biological Psychiatry in which
he cited his federal study on depression and concluded that newer
antidepressants, including Serzone, Zoloft and Effexor, were all
effective medications for depression.
</P>
<P>
   Pfizer, which makes Zoloft, paid Keller $218,000 in personal
income the same year; the psychiatrist also received $77,400 in
consulting fees from Bristol-Myers Squibb, which makes Serzone, and
$8,785 from Wyeth-Ayerst, which makes Effexor.
</P>
<P>
   Under federal regulations, scientists seeking US funds are
required to disclose to their research institutions any
``significant financial interests'' that could be affected by the
proposed study. Then it's up to the institutions to assess the
financial interests. If the institutions find a conflict, they must
report it to the US funding agency and protect the research from
bias, according to the 1995 regulations.
</P>
<P>
   But according to documents obtained by the Globe, Brown did not
notify NIMH of any financial conflict involving Keller.
</P>
<P>
   Laura Freid, Brown's executive vice president for public affairs
and university relations, defended Keller's and the university's
actions. Under university policy, she said, researchers must
indicate financial interest of greater than $10,000 and limit
outside consulting to one day a week.
</P>
<P>
   ``He made full disclosure in a timely manner. A committee
reviewed it,'' Freid said. ``The regulations do not require
notification. Our responsibility is to reduce, eliminate, and
manage potential conflict.''
</P>
<P>
   But Krimsky criticized both the federal regulations, for leaving
it up to research institutions to judge whether there's a conflict,
and Brown's interpretation of the regulations.
</P>
<P>
   Freid said that ``our integrity and that of our scientists'' is
such an important factor to protect, that that alone ``is a pretty
strong interest to counter any potential conflict.''
</P>
<P>
   Keller could not be reached Thursday despite messages left at
his office and home.
</P>
<P>
   The American Psychiatric Association announced this week it also
intends to investigate allegations that Keller did not fully
disclose money he received from pharmaceutical companies before
lauding their antidepressant drugs at the group's annual meeting in
1998.

   AMERICAN HOME PRODUCTS TO SETTLE DIET-DRUG CASE
</P>
<P>
   American Home Products agreed to pay $3.75 billion to thousands
of people who contend they were injured by taking the popular diet
pill combination fen-phen. Under the settlement _ one of the
largest ever in a product liability case _ people who used one of
the diet drugs for 60 days or less would be eligible for $30 to $60
prescription refunds, while those who have a heart valve injury
could receive up to $1.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   FED TO REVIEW DISCLOSURE POLICY
</P>
<P>
   Concerned that its latest attempt to be more open might be
confusing investors, the Federal Reserve has established a panel to
review its new practice of disclosing once-secret decisions about
tilting policy toward raising or reducing interest rates. The
establishment of the committee was disclosed in the minutes of the
Aug. 24 Fed meeting, where the central bank raised interest rates.
The minutes showed that the increase was approved 9 to 1. The
dissenter was Robert D. McTeer Jr., a leading advocate of the
theory that the economy is capable of higher rates of
noninflationary growth.

<P>
   SWEDEN GOES AGAINST THE GRAIN
</P>
<P>
   At a time when world leaders are fascinated by the United
States' economic success and its credo of less government and low
taxes, Sweden seems to be defying gravity. The Government consumes
nearly 60 percent of the national economy, and taxes and wages are
among the highest in the world. Yet this largely unreconstructed
welfare state is one of Europe's most vibrant economies.

<P>
   Slightly beating analysts' expectations, General Electric said
its third-quarter profit rose 16 percent, helped by acquisitions

industrial equipment. Shares of GE fell $1.8125, to $121.875. GE

GERMAN COMPANIES OFFER $3.3 BILLION IN SLAVE-LABOR SUIT
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By DAVID E. SANGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Germany's largest companies and the German
government offered $3.3 billion Thursday in compensation to
Nazi-era slave laborers _ several thousand dollars each for the
dwindling number of surviving victims.
</P>
<P>
   But lawyers and representatives for the hundreds of thousands
who would benefit rejected the offer at a tense meeting at the
State Department here. One called it ``an enormous
disappointment.''
</P>
<P>
   The negotiations, with Deputy Treasury Secretary Stuart
Eizenstat as a mediator, may drag on for weeks or months. But
Thursday was the first time that a broad swath of German industry _
including Deutsche Bank, DaimlerChrysler, Hoechst, Siemens and
Vokswagen _ has ever offered significant payments to the men and
women who are still alive, more than a half-century after they had
been forced to become factory workers or farmers for the German war
machine.
</P>
<P>
   Sixteen companies have been named in suits here and entered the
talks determined not to be swept into the recriminations and
battling that scarred Switzerland and its financial industry in the
suits there. Although the Swiss government refused to join its
banks in direct compensation to victims of the Nazis whose assets
were ``lost'' in Swiss banks, Germany has offered to pay roughly a
third of the total settlement offered to the slave laborers.
</P>
<P>
   The companies, by making a substantial opening offer, are also
hoping to appear far more willing than the Swiss banks were to
acknowledge financial responsibility. ``We believe that the
companies are standing up to their moral responsibility,'' a
spokesman for the companies, Wolfgang Gibowski, said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side of the negotiating table, though, Jewish
groups and representatives gf other forced laborers appear sharply
divided. Some advocate immediate talks and a quick settlement.
Others, led by Mel Weiss, a flamboyant lawyer in the class-action
suits in the American courts, called the offer insulting, noting
that it amounts to a few hundred dollars for each victim, in 1940s
dollars.
</P>
<P>
   The general counsel of the World Council of Orthodox Jewish
Communities, Mel Urbach, called the offer a ``fraction of what
would be honorable'' and a ``pittance when compared to the wealth
and economic success of these German companies.''
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point, at least, we see no way to continue these
negotiations,'' Urbach said, adding that his group will continue
its fight in court.
</P>
<P>
   The German companies say a quick settlement is essential if the
survivors are to benefit. With each week of haggling, additional
survivors die. ``This financial assistance will be very significant
for the hundreds of thousands of people who live in difficult
economic circumstances,'' the companies said in a statement that
was clearly intended to promote talks on their terms.
</P>
<P>
   There are three categories of Nazi-era victims who would
ultimately receive the money. The first is composed of former slave
laborers, mostly concentration-camp victims who worked for the
companies while in the camps. Eizenstat said Thursday that 230,000
were thought to be alive. Each would receive $5,500, assuming that
the estimate on survivors is correct and that all seek payments.
</P>
<P>
   The second category consists of forced laborers, who were
deported from their countries and sent to Germany, where they lived
in ghettos or in unguarded camps. Estimates of the number of
survivors range upward from 475,000. They would receive
approximately $1,950 each.
</P>
<P>
   Thirdly, some money would be for people who lost bank accounts
and other property, as well for survivors not in the other
categories.

<P>
   LOS PAJAROS, Venezuela _ To cross the Arauca River from Colombia
into this desolate patch of western Venezuela, you must borrow a
dugout canoe or swim the 100 yards. There are no ferries, no
bridge, no lifeguard to bail you out should the murky brown current
sweep you away.
</P>
<P>
   There's not much of anything, except for a few ducks and a field
flecked with cow dung. Yet the Venezuelan army lieutenant who has
agreed to show this American journalist around is clearly spooked.
</P>
<P>
   Trudging along the river's edge in an area known as Los Pajaros,
the lieutenant orders 15 soldiers to form a protective perimeter
around us. Crouching behind the bushes, they point their rifles
across the water at the invisible menace in Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I wander around here on my own, they will kidnap me,'' the
officer says.
</P>
<P>
   He is talking about the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia,
or FARC, the Marxist rebel group that dominates much of the
Colombian countryside. FARC rebels regularly slip into Venezuela to
escape the Colombian army, run guns and pull off kidnappings.
</P>
<P>
   It was one such cross-border caper by the FARC that spelled the
end for three Americans who were on a humanitarian mission to
Colombian Indian territory. The execution-style slayings of Terence
Freitas, Lahe'ena'e Gay and Ingrid Washinawatok blackened the
FARC's reputation around the world, outraged Washington and
threatened to derail a fragile peace process designed to end
Colombia's 35-year-old civil war.
</P>
<P>
   Why rebels chose to kill three Indian-rights activists who
shared many of the FARC's populist beliefs remains a mystery more
than half a year later.
</P>
<P>
   ``It goes against all the principles and teachings of the
FARC,'' says Daniel Garcia-Pena, a former Colombian government
peace commissioner who has dealt with the rebels. ``It was a major
screw-up.''
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 25 at about 10 a.m., two FARC guerrillas stopped a blue
Toyota pickup just outside the Colombian town of Cubara. Inside the
truck were Freitas, Gay and Washinawatok.
</P>
<P>
   They had just spent two weeks with the U'wa Indians. Largely
untouched by modern society, the U'wa are struggling to prevent
Occidental Petroleum Corp., the Los Angeles-based oil and gas
multinational, from drilling on what they consider sacred lands.
The Americans had ventured to their reservation in a show of
solidarity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was surprised,'' says Liliana Obregon, a Colombian who was a
friend of Freitas'. ``It's such a scary country for outsiders that
usually people don't do something like that.''
</P>
<P>
   But Freitas, Gay and Washinawatok were inveterate globe-trotters
who thrived on grass-roots research. Together, they formed a kind
of dream team of the indigenous rights movement.
</P>
<P>
   Terry Freitas had done more than anyone to call attention to the
plight of the U'wa and had cobbled together a surprisingly
effective U'wa support group in the United States. He was just 24.
</P>
<P>
   Lahe'ena'e Gay, 39, was the descendent of a royal Hawaiian
family. She was an anthropologist, a writer and the founder of an
indigenous rights organization in Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   Ingrid Washinawatok, 41, a Menominee Indian from Wisconsin, was
a board member of the U.N.-affiliated International Indian Treaty
Council and a high-profile activist since high school.
</P>
<P>
   Bouncing along in the Toyota with their Indian hosts, the
Americans were on their way from the U'wa reservation to a nearby
airport to begin their trip back to the United States. They never
made the flight.
</P>
<P>
   The two guerrillas, who wore bandannas over their faces and
carried pistols, ordered the three Americans into a taxi.
Washinawatok and Gay kept quiet. Terry Freitas, who spoke Spanish,
tried to maintain his composure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Terry said: `Sure. No problem,''' recalls Roberto Cobaria, the
U'wa leader who had invited the Americans to visit and was in the
pickup. ``The guerrillas told us that they would be back in half an
hour. But it was a trick.''
</P>
<P>
   During the next week, the rebels marched their bedraggled
captives 40 miles east, then crossed the Arauca River into
Venezuela. On the morning of March 4, a farmer in Los Pajaros was
startled by a burst of gunfire.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard 15 or 20 shots, and then everything was silent,'' says
Segundo Salamanca.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty yards from the river, Salamanca discovered three
blindfolded and bullet-pocked bodies lying face up in his cow
pasture. Tucked in the underwear of one was an American Express
card with the name Ingrid Washinawatok.
</P>
<P>
   Even in one of the most tumultuous corners of the world, the
triple murder was jaw-dropping.
</P>
<P>
   ``What kind of revolutionaries shoot two women and a young
guy?'' asks Ali El-Issa, Washinawatok's husband. ``It was like they
were shooting chickens in the road.''
</P>
<P>
   The killings occurred just as Colombian negotiators were
preparing for peace talks with the FARC, prompting critics to
charge that the guerrillas had revealed their true colors in this
cow pasture. On Capitol Hill, the bloodshed sparked calls for more
U.S. military aid to help the Colombian army take on the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the Americans were mistaken for spies. Some say the
operation was a ploy by hard-line FARC commanders to sabotage the
peace process. Others call it the ugly endgame of a bitter power
struggle between the guerrillas and the U'wa Indians.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to stonewalling by the FARC, such theories are little
more than shots in the dark.
</P>
<P>
   However, a look at events leading up to the slayings sheds light
on Colombia's lethal triangle of hell-bent revolutionaries,
multinational oil companies and newly enfranchised indigenous
groups.
</P>
<P>
   The deaths of Freitas, Gay and Washinawatok also offer a
cautionary tale about true believers who, without fully realizing
the risks, followed their hearts to a hot zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Terry loved the way the U'wa lived, that they could live so
peacefully, and he thought it was worth protecting,'' Julie Freitas
said the day after burying her son. ``When I expressed that I was
concerned, Terry said: `Mom, I'll always come back.' And he always
did come back. I just didn't expect him to come back in a box.''
</P>
<P>
   To understand why three Americans would journey thousands of
miles and risk everything to safeguard a tribe of 5,000 Indians, a
visit to the U'wa reservation in the mountains of northeastern
Colombia seems key.
</P>
<P>
   These days, the U'wa are in such demand at overseas conferences
that they are constantly breezing through the Colombian capital of
Bogota on their way to the international airport.
</P>
<P>
   Roberto Perez, president of the U'wa Traditional Authority, and
Roberto Cobaria, who just finished a five-year stint as president
of the U'wa Traditional Authority and was with the Americans when
they were abducted, agree to meet me.
</P>
<P>
   At the first interview, Perez slumps in a chair and drifts off
to sleep. At the second, Cobaria begins by filling his cheek with
coca leaves, the raw material for cocaine. He won't leave home
without them. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Cobaria charms people by sticking to his beliefs, by doing
things the U'wa way.
</P>
<P>
   His roundabout manner of conversing is because of the fact that
the U'wa have no written language. They sing and chant age-old
stories to establish their past. If you ask him a historical
question, he may start singing to refresh his memory.
</P>
<P>
   Such traits are examples of how the U'wa, unlike many of
Colombia's 82 indigenous groups, fiercely cling to their
traditions. Only a handful of U'wa have ever left the reservation.
Few speak fluent Spanish, because they have their own language,
with four dialects.
</P>
<P>
   Largely self-sufficient, the U'wa hunt, gather and fish. They
also work as seminomadic farmers who meticulously rotate their
crops to preserve the delicate ecosystem of the reservation.
</P>
<P>
   ``They would not, for instance, cut down a tree for firewood
whose fruits are eaten by forest animals,'' wrote Ann Osborn, a
British anthropologist who lived with the U'wa for 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   The U'wa way of life, however, is not all pastoral bliss.
Tuberculosis, alcohol abuse and other ills are pervasive on their
reservation. And some U'wa customs, such as abandoning newborn
twins in the wild because they are viewed as bad omens, horrify
outsiders.

LOS PAJAROS, Venezuela: horrify outsiders.
<TEXT>
<P>
   During the Spanish Conquest in the 1600s, the U'wa were pushed
into the Sierra Nevada de Cocuy mountain range near the present-day
Venezuelan border. The European invasion led the U'wa to make a
drastic decision.
</P>
<P>
   According to the tribe's oral history, to avoid enslavement by
the Spaniards, legions of U'wa put their children into clay pots
and flung them off a 1,400-foot precipice. Then, adults walked
backward off the edge after them. The spot came to be known as the
Cliff of Glory, and it was said that so many bodies piled up that
they changed the course of the river below.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a cultural strategy in which they preferred to commit
suicide rather than to surrender,'' says Gregorio Mesa, an U'wa
expert at the National University in Bogota. ``The U'wa say that
their god put them in this territory to take care of it. If they
can't do that, things get very complicated, and this is the
response.''
</P>
<P>
   Once again, things are getting complicated for the U'wa.
</P>
<P>
   This time around, the U'wa and their U.S. supporters portray
Occidental Petroleum as a modern-day conquistador.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute dates back to 1992, when Occidental purchased oil
exploration rights from the Colombian government for the Samore
block, which stretched across 494,000 acres and included the U'wa
reservation.
</P>
<P>
   The U'wa fear that an oil boom on their doorstep would invite
guerrilla violence and environmental havoc as well as jaded
outsiders and fast money that would destroy their way of life.
Tribal elders also contend that oil is ``the blood of Mother
Earth'' and that draining it from the ground would offend the gods.
</P>
<P>
   At first, the position taken by the U'wa puzzled Occidental.
Part of Colombia's Cano Limon pipeline, which began operating in
the mid-1980s and carries Occidental oil to the Caribbean coast, is
located close to the U'wa reservation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been in that area for the longest time,'' says one
former Occidental executive who asked not to be named. ``We never
heard of these things when the pipeline was built, that oil is the
blood of Mother Earth. But how can you question it? You don't want
to be insensitive.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, with engineers already conducting seismic studies in
the Samore block, the U'wa elders made a pronouncement.
</P>
<P>
   They declared that if Occidental goes forward with plans to
drill on their ancestral lands, the U'wa would return to the Cliff
of Glory en masse _ and jump.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our culture is not negotiable,'' says Cobaria, his cheek
bulging with coca. ``For the U'wa, it would be better for us to
die.''
</P>
<P>
   The apocalyptic threat put the U'wa on the map.
</P>
<P>
   And among those entranced by the story was a young man from
suburban Los Angeles named Terry Freitas.
</P>
<P>
   After graduating from the University of California at Santa Cruz
with degrees in biology and environmental studies, Freitas worked
with Navajo Indians in Arizona who were involved in a dispute with
a mining company. But when he learned of the do-or-die U'wa
dogfight with Occidental, whose corporate headquarters are located
20 miles from the Freitas home, he dropped everything. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; ``He said he had a moral obligation to defend the U'wa,'' says
Ebaristo Tegria, an U'wa Indian and one of the tribe's legal
advisers. ``He said: `I feel guilty, because I'm from
California.'''
</P>
<P>
   Freitas made his first trip to the U'wa reservation in 1997 and
became fast friends with U'wa leader Roberto Cobaria. Later, he
brought Cobaria to Washington, where he managed to set up a meeting
between the Indian and Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Freitas hounded U.S. activists to join the cause.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were, of course, all burnt out and cynical about such
things, but Terry kept on insisting and pushing us,'' says Danny
Kennedy, director of the Berkeley, Calif.-based Project
Underground, which lobbies against oil development.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, seven environmental organizations formed the U'wa
Defense Working Group and named Freitas its coordinator. Mailings
went out. Web sites were launched. Donations trickled in. Actor
Leonardo DiCaprio wrote a check for $25,000.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, Occidental's annual shareholder meetings in Los Angeles
became the site of boisterous pro-U'wa demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence Meriage, an Occidental vice president and spokesman,
goes out of his way to praise Freitas' motives. But he also
suspects that some groups jumped on the U'wa bandwagon mainly to
raise money.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you don't have an issue, your fund-raising dries up,''
Meriage says. ``I think the U'wa issue from an activist standpoint
is kind of a godsend. It has elements of almost biblical
proportions, of David and Goliath.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, in the battle for hearts and minds, the U'wa seem to
have the upper hand. In 1998, Cobaria won the prestigious Goldman
Environmental Prize as well as Spain's Bartolome de las Casas Award
for the defense of indigenous rights in the Americas.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, ``Oxy's reputation is being dragged through the
mud,'' says one oil industry analyst, using Occidental's nickname.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to the U'wa Defense Working Group, Meriage says that his
office has been flooded with mail from outraged Americans demanding
that Occidental leave the poor Indians alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get these letters coming in on recycled paper in envelopes
that have been reused and taped together with the old addresses
scratched out,'' he says. ``They think we ought to go back to
bicycles. They say: `Why don't you get into the windmill
business?'''
</P>
<P>
   In Colombia, such back-to-basics talk is akin to tilting at
windmills. Today, the Bogota government is making a stronger push
than ever for foreign oil companies like Occidental to drill new
wells.
</P>
<P>
   After major oil basins were discovered in the 1980s,
petrodollars cushioned the Colombian economy while other Latin
American nations suffered through recessions and hyperinflation.
Colombia now produces about 825,000 barrels of oil per day and
depends on petroleum for 25 percent of export earnings.
</P>
<P>
   But in recent years, high production costs, guerrilla attacks
and better deals elsewhere have convinced many foreign firms that
their Colombian operations should be scaled back. The government
insists that unless new reserves are discovered, the nation will be
importing oil by 2002.
</P>
<P>
   ``Colombia can't be condemned to poverty. Oil is a fundamental
part of the economy,'' says Juan Carlos Ucros, a lawyer for
Occidental's Colombian branch.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most promising sites for the next major strike is
Occidental's Samore block. One oil analyst says that the chances
for a gusher at Samore may be 20 percent _ double the industry
average for unexplored regions. By some estimates, the basin may
hold up to 1.5 billion barrels of oil.
</P>
<P>
   For wildcatters, however, it's not just a jungle out there. It's
a war zone.
</P>
<P>
   Accusing multinational oil firms of making off with the wealth
of the nation, the FARC and the National Liberation Army, or ELN,
Colombia's second-largest guerrilla group, have gone on the attack.
Since 1986, the rebels have dynamited Colombian oil pipelines 630
times.
</P>
<P>
   After one ELN attack last year, the resulting oil slick caught
fire, killing 60 people in a rural hamlet. In another incident,
guerrillas grabbed two engineers working in the Samore block,
hanged them from a bridge and used them for target practice.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, many ordinary Colombians no longer view oil as a
liquid cure-all. In fact, those living near pipelines often gripe
that they are worse off because of the threat of rebel attacks and
oil spills.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you put in oil infrastructure, the guerrillas target it.
Then the government militarizes the area, and the folks that are
caught in the middle are the local people,'' says Shannon Wright of
the San Francisco-based Rainforest Action Network.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know the cycle,'' she says. ``If you start laying pipeline
in U'wa territory, you will kick off a small war inside their
lands.''
</P>
<P>
   According to U'wa expert Gregorio Mesa, oil development has
degraded once-thriving Indian tribes, such as the Yarigue and the
Bari, in other parts of Colombia. ``It's not just due to petroleum,
but petroleum never comes alone,'' he says. ``It brings
colonization, new people, new customs.''
</P>
<P>
   Meriage points out, however, that Occidental provides locals
with jobs and scholarships and sponsors social development
projects. Colombia, he says, can't allow the FARC and ELN to drive
away foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
   Yet efforts to exploit the Samore block were botched from the
beginning. The Colombian government uncorked the controversy by
selling exploration rights without consulting the U'wa. Such talks
are required under the 1991 constitution, which mandates greater
autonomy for indigenous groups.
</P>
<P>
   Occidental tried to bring the U'wa on board, but the tribe's
leaders, claiming that the company had misled them, turned against
the project.

LOS PAJAROS, Venezuela: against the project
<TEXT>
<P>
   Eventually, a lawsuit was filed on behalf of the U'wa. After the
case ping-ponged around Colombia's legal system for two years, a
court ruled in 1997 that Occidental had the right to move ahead
with exploration.
</P>
<P>
   However, with protests mounting, Occidental announced last year
that it would give up exploration rights to 75 percent of the
Samore block, including the entire U'wa reservation. The company
then applied for a license to drill an appraisal well.
</P>
<P>
   ``The site we've selected is just off the main highway,''
Meriage says. ``This is not the rain forest.''
</P>
<P>
   But the U'wa say the drill site lies too close to their
reservation. They also claim that it is located on U'wa ``ancestral
territory,'' which their people roamed centuries ago but which is
not legally recognized as U'wa land.
</P>
<P>
   Exasperated Occidental officials point out that indigenous
groups once were present throughout Colombia. In theory, they say,
the entire nation could be considered ``ancestral territory'' and,
therefore, off-limits to development.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Occidental were to give up Samore _ lock, stock and 1.5
billion barrels _ Terry Freitas had come to the conclusion that
another petroleum company would likely take its place.
</P>
<P>
   For the long-term defense of the U'wa, he figured that schools
teaching traditional Indian values were critical. Thus in the
summer of 1998, he and U'wa leader Roberto Cobaria met with Ingrid
Washinawatok and Lahe'ena'e Gay in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   The two women were members of Pacific Cultural Conservancy
International, an indigenous rights group based in Hawaii. Gay, the
group's founder, had just returned from Panama, where she had
helped several Indian tribes design their own schools.
</P>
<P>
   Impressed, Cobaria invited Gay and Washinawatok to the
reservation to plan something similar for the U'wa. Freitas would
be their guide and translator.
</P>
<P>
   There were signs, however, that their journey would be tempting
fate.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, Freitas had received a rambling death threat in
Spanish on his telephone answering machine. And on a previous trip
to Colombia, he had been warned by the FARC to back off.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had been told to get out of the country and not come
back,'' says a U.S. State Department official. ``He was in the U'wa
villages, and the FARC came and told him. They said they didn't
agree with his purpose for being there.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the FARC claims to be fighting on behalf of indigenous
groups and other ``oppressed'' Colombians, U'wa leaders accuse the
guerrillas of a litany of abuses _ from trespassing on their
territory to conscripting Indian boys.
</P>
<P>
   The FARC, in turn, views the emergence of strong indigenous
groups as a threat to its authority, the State Department official
says. The rebels likely marked Freitas as a meddling American who
was fomenting U'wa autonomy, the official adds.
</P>
<P>
   And in truth, the FARC may have little use for the resistance
shown by the U'wa to Occidental. Despite the guerrillas' own
dictums about the evils of foreign oil companies, the FARC has made
millions by kidnapping petroleum workers and blackmailing their
employers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all know that the arrival of the oil companies is good for
the FARC, because it presents an opportunity for extortion,'' says
Juan Francisco Mesa, a lawyer for Free Country, a Bogota support
group for relatives of hostages.
</P>
<P>
   If the guerrillas seem more like desperados than freedom
fighters, that's because the FARC broke the mold for old-school
insurgents.
</P>
<P>
   Inspired by the Cuban revolution, the FARC was formed in 1964
and originally fought for social justice, land reform and a Marxist
state. But the organization has metamorphosed into a kind of
revolutionary-industrial complex.
</P>
<P>
   By kidnapping people for ransom, levying ``war taxes'' on
businesses and working in cahoots with drug traffickers, the FARC
earns up to $500 million annually, according to U.S. and Colombian
estimates. That positions the FARC among the most profitable
corporations in Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   As the Cold War ended and other Latin American revolutionaries _
from Nicaragua's Sandinistas to Peru's Shining Path _ disarmed or
were defeated, the FARC's big bucks financed a great leap forward.
The FARC now has 15,000 foot soldiers grouped into 61 fronts.
</P>
<P>
   In the last decade, some 35,000 people, mainly civilians, have
been killed in the conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the FARC's rapid ascent has bred problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a real breakdown of discipline within the movement,
and a lot of factions that operate on their own. Some are brutal
and hard-line. Others are much different,'' says Michael Shifter, a
senior fellow at the Inter-American Dialogue, a Washington think
tank.
</P>
<P>
   Among the most malevolent factions are the FARC's 10th and 45th
fronts, which moved into the eastern Colombian state of Arauca in
1996 with orders to fill the guerrillas' coffers. Experts describe
these two fronts as an assemblage of ruffians engaged in a
free-for-all of kidnappings and cocaine deals.
</P>
<P>
   They are commanded by German Briceno, who goes by the nom de
guerre Grannobles. Not known for his military prowess, Grannobles
was promoted mainly because he is the brother of Jorge Briceno, the
FARC's top military strategist, according to U.S. and Colombian
sources.
</P>
<P>
   ``Grannobles is not the brightest light in the force, but he's
brutally efficient,'' the State Department official says.
</P>
<P>
   Terry Freitas had no illusions about the rebels, but he was
intent on returning to the U'wa nation. Last November, he sent a
message to the FARC seeking assurance that he would be left alone.
</P>
<P>
   His go-between was an International Red Cross delegate in Arauca
state, who knew a local FARC commander. The guerrilla told the
delegate that he had no problem with Freitas' work.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the delegate says that he tried to discourage Freitas
from coming back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was able to warn Terry,'' the delegate says. ``His mistake
was to focus too much on the U'wa without better looking into the
socio-political reality of the area. Poor guy.''
</P>
<P>
   For Gay and Washinawatok, it was their first trip to Colombia.
If not exactly innocents abroad, they had a somewhat romantic view
of the FARC and little understanding of the deep rift between the
guerrillas and the U'wa.
</P>
<P>
   ``The FARC was not a problem. That's what Lahe'ena'e thought,
because that's what she had been told,'' says John Livingstone,
Gay's husband.
</P>
<P>
   Washinawatok considered herself more a friend of the FARC than a
foe, says her husband, Ali El-Issa. After all, she had studied
Spanish in communist Cuba, where she had shaken hands with Fidel
Castro.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ingrid wasn't worried about the FARC,'' El-Issa says. ``She
never thought the FARC would do anything to her.''
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts, the Americans had a grand old time with the
U'wa. They made dozens of friends as they toured communities and
received gifts of arrows and woven baskets.
</P>
<P>
   But back in New York, El-Issa was nervous. He knew that his wife
sometimes scoffed at danger as she went about her work. When she
made her final telephone call from Colombia, he admonished her to
play it safe.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `Sweetheart, use your brain, not your sympathy.' She
said everything is fine, no problem. She told me: `Ali, I am with
my people. I feel like I am back on the reservation in
Wisconsin.'''
</P>
<P>
   That was Feb. 18. A week later, the guerrillas pulled Freitas,
Gay and Washinawatok from the Toyota pickup to begin the long march
to the killing field.
</P>
<P>
   U'wa leader Roberto Cobaria, who witnessed the abduction,
immediately sent a fax to the U.S. Embassy in Bogota explaining
what had happened.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, relatives and family friends worked around
the clock. They burned up the telephone lines and sent e-mail
messages to FARC contacts in Colombia, Mexico, Ecuador and Europe.
Several packed their bags for a possible trip to Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all activists,'' says Dean Cycon, a lawyer and one of
Washinawatok's close friends. ``It's not like we're some family
sitting around waiting for the government to do something for us.
We immediately went into high gear.''
</P>
<P>
   At first, word that the three were in the hands of the FARC was
a relief. That's because when dealing with captives, the guerrillas
are generally more humane than drug traffickers, right-wing
paramilitaries and criminal gangs _ groups that also kidnap at will
in Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   But Grannobles and his FARC units in Arauca are seen as the evil
exception.
</P>
<P>
   Also disturbing was the lack of any word from the FARC.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we would have welcomed a ransom demand _ anything that
would have said that there's a negotiation and that there is
time,'' says Jose Barreiro, another friend of Washinawatok's.

LOS PAJAROS, Venezuela: of Washinawatok's.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Officials at the U.S. Embassy in Bogota tried to help.
</P>
<P>
   ``The U.S. government took as many steps as we could think of to
get the message to the FARC that this was very critical, and that,
in other words, `You've made a mistake. Let these people go,'''
says a U.S. official who spoke on condition of anonymity. ``But
they basically said: `We don't know anything.'``
</P>
<P>
   Finally, on the morning of March 4, the guerrillas in Arauca
told the Red Cross that FARC units in the region were holding
Freitas, Washinawatok and Gay. However, moments later, word came
that three bodies had turned up on the Venezuelan border.
</P>
<P>
   ``The initial report was of two male bodies and one woman. We
thought: This cannot be them. It doesn't match,'' Abby Reyes
recalls. ``One of us then talked directly with Venezuelan police.
One woman with an eagle tattoo, the other with a triangle. And one
young man with dark curly hair. It's them.''
</P>
<P>
   Interceptions of FARC radio messages by Colombian intelligence
agencies indicate that the kidnappers were suspicious of the
Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Surely these SOBs are from the CIA,'' Rafael, a member of the
FARC's 45th Front, says on a tape-recorded intercept the day after
the kidnapping.
</P>
<P>
   FARC fighters are notoriously paranoid about foreigners, because
Washington supplies a huge amount of military aid to Colombia. At
any given time, there are 200 to 300 U.S. military advisers on the
ground assisting the army and police.
</P>
<P>
   Still, analysts say, it would have been simple for the
guerrillas to confirm the Americans' identities. Mesa, of Free
Country, points out that the rebels are old pros at compiling
profiles of hostages, which they later use to calculate the amount
of their ransom demands.
</P>
<P>
   Colombian gumshoes believe that the guerrillas knew exactly who
they were dealing with.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators contend that the FARC specifically targeted the
Americans and were tipped off about their travel plans by an U'wa
Indian informant. An official at the prosecutor-general's office in
Bogota claims that the guerrillas planned all along to do away with
the Americans in order to intimidate the U'wa and scare off other
foreign activists.
</P>
<P>
   Another scenario comes from Colombian army chief Jorge Enrique
Mora. Deep in the jungle, he says, Ingrid Washinawatok was
apparently bitten by a spider and became extremely ill. Saddled
with a sick hostage and on the run from an army offensive, the FARC
may have panicked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think to take care of the problem, they decided to kill all
three,'' Mora says.
</P>
<P>
   In a Feb. 27 radio intercept, Grannobles, the FARC leader in
Arauca, and another guerrilla discuss how a woman was bitten by a
spider and taken to a clinic for treatment but how nothing could be
done for her.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, Rafael says to Grannobles: ``Tell the boss that
there are two women and a man, and that one is at the point of
dying.''
</P>
<P>
   Grannobles then offers a reply that intelligence officials
interpret as an order to execute the Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the fertilizer factory they sell cyanide, which is a mortal
poison. Buy a kilo, and apply it to the three, and make sure to
water them well.''
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutor-general's office has indicted Grannobles, who is
named as the ``intellectual author'' of the triple homicide, as
well as the suspected U'wa informant. But Mora believes that
Grannobles' brother, Jorge Briceno, was also involved.
</P>
<P>
   Briceno, the FARC's second most powerful commander, is believed
to oppose negotiations with the government, because the war has
been profitable for the rebels. Killing the Americans, analysts
say, may have been a way to anger the U.S. government, which has
backed the peace process, and to sabotage the talks.
</P>
<P>
   The radio intercepts indicate that Briceno might have signed off
on the executions, with the caveat that they be carried out on the
other side of the Arauca River in Venezuelan territory.
</P>
<P>
   On March 2, two days before the slayings, Grannobles tells the
guerrilla Rafael: ``The boss authorized the thing, but it's got to
be done on the other side so as not to leave any evidence. ... Take
care of it.''
</P>
<P>
   With its arbitrary decrees and draconian sentences, the FARC's
jungle justice may seem hopelessly out of balance. That's why few
people in the United States or Colombia take FARC spokesman Raul
Reyes seriously when he pledges that there will be a day of
reckoning.
</P>
<P>
   For example, instead of pinpointing top-echelon commanders like
Grannobles or Jorge Briceno, the FARC initially blamed the killings
on a rebel named Gildardo. But Mora, the army chief, says that
Gildardo doesn't exist.
</P>
<P>
   Reyes insists that the culprits could face a firing squad. But
Olga Marin, Reyes' wife and a prominent FARC member, says that the
guilty will atone for their sins through forced labor and, if they
are illiterate, by learning how to read.
</P>
<P>
   All along, the FARC has ignored requests by the families of the
victims for a coherent account of what happened. When asked about
the case, Jorge Briceno recently complained: ``Three gringos die,
and it turns into a major brouhaha.''
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, the bloodletting was, indeed, a watershed.
</P>
<P>
   It led to an immediate cutoff in contacts between the Clinton
administration and the guerrillas shortly after the first-ever
meeting, held in Costa Rica, between a State Department official
and a FARC representative.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional Republicans cited the slayings as another reason
to beef up U.S. assistance to the Colombian army. Lawmakers are now
studying the Bogota government's request for $1.5 billion in aid
from the United States, much of which would go toward fighting the
FARC.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, several Americans have endorsed an open-door policy
and have traveled to FARC territory to find out more.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the most bizarre meetings, Richard Grasso, the
president of the New York Stock Exchange, spent several hours with
Raul Reyes talking about the slayings, the war and the future of
Colombia. Upon leaving, the two men embraced, and Grasso invited
Reyes to visit Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents of such ice-breaking encounters argue that keeping
the guerrillas isolated only abets their violent ways.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rebels are in a separate world,'' says Michael Shifter of
the Inter-American Dialogue. ``So it's crucial to take advantage of
every opportunity to give them a sense of how the world works. This
will break down the narrow mentality that they have.''
</P>
<P>
   Shifter and others believe that the killings led to an internal
debate within the FARC and possibly strengthened the hand of
moderate rebel leaders who support the peace process. Still, 10
months after formal talks were supposed to start, the rebels have
yet to negotiate, and the war rages on.
</P>
<P>
   The calamity in Colombia also led to some corporate soul
searching at Occidental Petroleum.
</P>
<P>
   The death of Terry Freitas was difficult to ignore, since his
body lay at a funeral home a half-block from Occidental
headquarters before being flown to New Mexico for burial. Amid a
new round of pro-U'wa demonstrations in April, 13 percent of
Occidental shareholders voted for a resolution to carry out a
risk-analysis study of the Samore oil project.
</P>
<P>
   But Occidental spokesman Lawrence Meriage insists that the
company will go forward with its drilling plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``It hasn't really changed our focus,'' Meriage says of the
murders. ``I'm convinced that the tack we've been on from the very
beginning has been an honorable one.''
</P>
<P>
   The project received a partial go-ahead last month, when the
Colombian government approved Occidental's request for a permit to
drill an appraisal well just outside the U'wa reservation. Drilling
is expected to begin next year.
</P>
<P>
   Critics question the timing of the decision, which came just one
month after the government nearly quadrupled the size of the U'wa
reservation _ from 150,000 acres to 543,000 acres.
</P>
<P>
   But at a September news conference, Environmental Minister Juan
Mayr denied suggestions that enlarging the reservation was a
calculated move to win U'wa support for the oil project. The
expansion, he argued, would guarantee the survival of the U'wa
culture in the face of petroleum development.
</P>
<P>
   U'wa lawyer Ebaristo Tegria disagrees and insists that
collective suicide remains an option for the Indians.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in Hawaii, John Livingstone continues the work of his
wife, Lahe'ena'e Gay, at Pacific Cultural Conservancy
International.
</P>
<P>
   In Wisconsin, Ingrid Washinawatok, who left behind a 14-year-old
son, is buried on Menominee Indian lands. There are plans to
establish an Indian research center in her honor.
</P>
<P>
   Terry Freitas' funeral was held on Michael Gold's ranch in New
Mexico. His body was wrapped in sage leaves and red cloth, then
gently lowered into the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Among the U'wa, Freitas lives on as part of the tribe's oral
history, which takes a full two weeks to sing.
</P>
<P>
   In the final verse, the U'wa intone the memory of an American
who came to help, leaving his family in the north crying.

 By CARLTON THOMPSON  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
Derek Bell spent the first two games of the National League
Division Series cheering for his teammates, razzing Braves third
baseman Chipper Jones from the bench and otherwise adjusting to his
role as a $5 million cheerleader.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Today he'll get a chance to do what he's paid quite handsomely
to do.
</P>
<P>
   Because lefthander Tom Glavine will start for the Braves, Astros
manager Larry Dierker will tweak his outfield alignment, starting
two righthanded hitters who were in the dugout in Atlanta _ Bell in
right field and Matt Mieske in left.
</P>
<P>
   Bell wasn't sure he would see his name in the starting lineup
after he was benched during the last week of the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   ``That definitely went through my mind,'' said Bell, who
struggled through the worst season of his career in 1999. ``I
wasn't sure I was going to get to play again. That just goes to
show that if you keep the right attitude and the right frame of
mind, things will work out in the end.''
</P>
<P>
   Dierker is hoping his lineup change will work out in the end.
Bell and Mieske will replace Stan Javier and Daryle Ward,
respectively. Ward never has faced Glavine, and Javier has only two
hits in 27 career at-bats against the Braves lefthander.
</P>
<P>
   Mieske, whom the Astros acquired in a trade with the Seattle
Mariners in June, was brought to Houston for situations such as
this. He hit .354 against lefthanders this season, which is
indicative of the way he has performed against lefties throughout
his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``I anticipated a situation like this going into the playoffs,
because I knew we would be facing Tom Glavine if we played the
Braves or Randy Johnson and Omar Daal if we played the
Diamondbacks,'' said Mieske, who was slowed by back problems over
the final month of the season. ``I figured I'd get to play at some
point. It's just a thrill to be starting a playoff game, and I'm
looking forward to it.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was traded, I knew there was a good chance this team
was going to the playoffs, and I specifically thought of situations
just like this. It's a big game, but I'm not going to approach
anything differently. I know I'm ready for it.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the reasons Bell was benched was because Dierker and
general manager Gerry Hunsicker didn't believe he was ready to play
every day after missing two weeks with pulled rib-cage muscles.
</P>
<P>
   Although he has had only one at-bat since Sept. 28, Bell
believes he's ready to help his team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm excited to get the chance to play again,'' said Bell, who
hit a career-low .236 this season. ``I've been taking a lot of
extra batting practice, and I feel like I'm ready to help the team.
No matter what happens, I know that everyone in this clubhouse is
going to be behind me, and that feels good.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the kind of team we have, and that's why I was trying
to stay positive and support the guys when I wasn't playing. I
wasn't going to give up on them just because of the kind of season
I had. How could I give up on them when they never turned their
back on me?''
</P>
<P>
   Both Bell and Mieske view today as an opportunity to make a
larger contribution to the team, but even if they're back on the
bench Saturday when righthander John Smoltz starts, they will
continue to contribute in any way they can.
</P>
<P>
   ``I may just be a role player or bench player or whatever phrase
you want to use, but there's a lot of satisfaction in this job,''
Mieske said. ``There are a lot of guys who play every day who would
love to be playing in October.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a chance to win this thing, and I'll take that
opportunity any day, no matter what my role is.''

INDIANS ROUT RED SOX, 11-1 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  CLEVELAND _ The debate over when Pedro Martinez makes his
next start could be a short one.
</P>
<P>
   Try Opening Day 2000.
</P>
<P>
   If Martinez isn't sidelined first by his bad back, he may be
rendered obsolete by the Cleveland Indians. The Indians seized a
2-0 Division Series advantage over the reeling Red Sox with an 11-1
bashing here Thursday that began in late-afternoon shadows and
ended in darkness, the proper coda for the worst postseason defeat
ever absorbed by the Olde Towne Team.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got 'em right where we want 'em,'' said shortstop Nomar
Garciaparra, masking his disappointment behind a show of hollow
bravado. ``We're exactly where we want to be. They feel good about
themselves, and we're going home.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's really nothing you can say. The score speaks for
itself. They really beat us. They took it to us.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez, whose older brother Ramon is all that stands between
the Red Sox and elimination in Game 3 after their 18th loss in
their last 19 postseason outings, was neither guaranteeing another
start nor conceding defeat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a loser,'' he said. ``I expect to win the next time.''
</P>
<P>
   All season, Pedro the Younger has said his goal was to extend
this season deeper into October than the Sox did last year, when
they were ousted by the Indians in four games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try,'' he said, ``but you can't help Mother Nature. If it's
meant not to happen, it's meant not to happen. But there's still
time. Plenty of chances. Plenty.''
</P>
<P>
   Those chances evaporated quickly for Bret Saberhagen, a profile
in courage so many times in two years with the Sox, but a portrait
of frustration Thursday. Saberhagen walked more batters (3) in the
Indians' six-run third inning than he did in all but two of his 22
starts this season.
</P>
<P>
   Cranky shoulder? No, Saberhagen said. Blame it more on a crack
in composure. ``I maybe felt, I don't know, I shouldn't say too
good,'' Saberhagen said, ``but maybe I had too much adrenaline
going. I was a little too excited. It just didn't happen today.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sox once again paid dearly for careless defense. Second
baseman Jose Offerman's inability to turn a double play in the
third inning was not as flagrant a mistake as third baseman John
Valentin's throwing error in Game 1, but it ultimately had
consequences even more devastating.
</P>
<P>
   Offerman threw high to first baseman Mike Stanley after taking
Nomar Garciaparra's feed on Sandy Alomar's routine grounder.
Instead of two on and nobody out, Alomar reached safely.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm on first and I'm thinking, `We've got a cripple on first
and a cripple at bat,'' said Fryman, who is playing with a brace on
his right knee to protect a torn ligament while Alomar missed 125
games this season after knee surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was a double play for sure. Sandy just hustled
and it turned out to be a big play in the inning.''
</P>
<P>
   The next batter, Kenny Lofton, worked Saberhagen for a
full-count walk on a 10-pitch at-bat, and Omar Vizquel followed
with a two-run triple into a sun-drenched right-field corner, just
out of the reach of rookie Trot Nixon. Gone was the Red Sox' 1-0
lead, created by Nixon's double and Offerman's single in the top of
the inning.
</P>
<P>
   On deck, more carnage, which tends to happen against the
Indians, the team of a thousand runs. Robbie Alomar lashed a double
to right, scoring Vizquel to make it 3-1. Jim Thome walked. Harold
Baines, the 40-year-old Cleveland DH born when Ike was still
President, followed with a three-run home run.
</P>
<P>
   Saberhagen was finished, and so were the Sox. An inning later,
John Wasdin gave up a grand slam to Thome, and they might as well
have invoked the 10-run rule as Indians starter Charles Nagy, of
the Fairfield, Conn., Nagys, breezed through a Sox lineup that has
scored three runs and managed 11 hits, seven of them singles, in
two games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any team with a 10-run lead in the (fourth) inning, their
pitching is going to be pretty good,'' said catcher Jason Varitek,
who has no hits in eight at-bats in the No. 3 hole, his best effort
dying on the track in left fielder David Justice's glove in the
first inning.
</P>
<P>
   Even Garciaparra, the Indian slayer, went out quietly, failing
to get the ball out of the infield in three trips. By the time the
Sox arrived at their last at-bats, Lou Merloni was the Sox cleanup
hitter in Garciaparra's place. The Framingham Kid popped out to
Robbie Alomar to end the game, and the Sox headed for home, with
any designs of returning dependent on winning two games this
weekend at Fenway Park.
</P>
<P>
   The task of extending autumn falls Saturday on a pitcher whose
first name is Nomar spelled backward.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to go and score some runs, take some pressure off
our pitching,'' Varitek said. ``Go out there and battle.''
</P>
<P>
   Lineup changes? Williams already tried that Thursday, benching
the bollixed Belleville Basher, Brian Daubach, and Darren Lewis,
the sore-wristed center fielder, in favor of Butch Huskey and Damon
Buford. Net gain on those moves? Oh for six.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know, maybe I'll get a hold of George Herman,'' said
Williams, invoking the formal name of the Babe after an afternoon
in which the Indians made like the '27 Yankees, abetted by nine
walks by Sox pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   ``What do you want me to do, boys and girls? I'm going to bring
the same group that brung us.''
</P>
<P>
   Will that be enough?
</P>
<P>
   ``We're up, 2-0,'' Robbie Alomar said, ``but there's still a
long way to go. One of the reasons the Red Sox are here is they
have a great team. Teams have been down 2-0 and come back before.''
</P>
<P>
   But never the Red Sox. Not in this century.

 By ELIZABETH BECKER    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NORFOLK, Va. _ To combat the expanding threat of cyberwarfare,
the Pentagon established a new center on Thursday to defend the
United States from hackers and to plot ways to attack an enemy's
computer network.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an acknowledgment that in the world where
communication is critical, our ability to protect our systems and
potentially get inside an adversary's system and affect his
decision is critical,'' said Gen. Henry Shelton, chairman of the
Joint Chiefs of Staff.
</P>
<P>
   The cyberwarfare center will take over what is now a scattered
series of operations and will have headquarters in Colorado Springs
under Gen. Richard Myers of the Air Force.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Shelton officially confirmed that the United States
tried to mount electronic attacks into Serbian computer networks
throughout the air campaign over Kosovo. ``We only used our
capability to a very limited degree,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials disclosed over the summer that U.S.
intelligence was mounting computer attacks on foreign bank accounts
held by President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia and other
Serbian leaders, with the goal being to drain assets or alter
banking records.
</P>
<P>
   In future wars, U.S. cyberwarriors will try to disable air
defense systems, upset logistics and infect software through
advances made by the Colorado center, according to a Pentagon
official.
</P>
<P>
   At ceremonies here, Adm. Harold W. Gehman Jr. was put in charge
of another new center, where the job is to coordinate military
actions should an enemy target this country with biological,
chemical or nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The idea has been criticized strongly by civil libertarians who
argue that any homeland defense plan might open the door for the
military to assume the role of domestic police, which is prohibited
by law.
</P>
<P>
   Defense Secretary William Cohen described both centers as
answers to the newest threats facing the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Saying the United States must be prepared to fight the full
range of modern warfare, Cohen said the joint task force to
coordinate military actions would be ready to respond in the event
of an attack on American soil, but under the direction of a
civilian agency like the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are stepping into the future, to deal with the kind of
threats we are likely to face from chemical biological and even
nuclear weapons,'' Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
   But officials of civil liberties organizations said they were
wary. ``Our concern is that there be a bright line drawn between
law enforcement and the military,'' said Gregory Nojeim of the
American Civil Liberties Union. ``This not only blurs that bright
line but virtually guarantees further involvement of the military
in civilian law-enforcement activity.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with The New York Times last year, President
Clinton voiced support for such a task force to strengthen the
nation's defenses against new kinds of terrorism.

   ``What I want us to do is everything within reason we can to
minimize our exposure and risks here,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   In the past several years, Clinton has highlighted his fears of
the growing threat from cyberwarfare and of terrorists using
weapons of mass destruction in the United States. He approved these
new changes made by the Pentagon's top officials as part of a
routine revision of the responsibilities and roles of its nine
commands scattered across the globe.
</P>
<P>
   As part of those changes the Atlantic Command here will now be
known as the Joint Forces Command, to reflect new responsibilities
to train and create new doctrines for the Army, Navy, Air Force and
Marines in joint operations.
</P>
<P>
   But the new cybercenter in Colorado is to have far-ranging
responsibilities in future wars, according to Shelton, who said
that the Pentagon detected efforts to enter its computers by
unauthorized people in the Kosovo campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``During Kosovo, there is no question that day in and day out we
got hundreds if not thousands of hits,'' he said, saying that
classified U.S. computer systems were well protected.
</P>
<P>
   But he wants the new center to figure out how to improve the
protection for both classified and unclassified computer systems.
The Pentagon uses unclassified computer networks for what are
routine but sometimes sensitive transactions.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're dealing with a military operation you can't afford
to have anybody break into your system,'' Shelton said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the last five years we have certainly seen a proliferation
of information warfare organizations, and if this new center will
put all the focus and energies of the military in one place, then
it is a big deal,'' said William Arkin, an expert on cyberwarfare.

MUNICIPAL BONDS CAN PROVIDE A HEDGE WITH LIMITED THORNS  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, OCT. 10) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Wis., Minn., Ill., Calif.)   (af)  
 By ABBY SCHULTZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Yes, the headlines and the total return figures for municipal
bonds the last 12 months have made for ugly reading. Do the math,
though, and munis and muni bond funds come up a pretty attractive
buy.
</P>
<P>
   Municipal bond prices have been beaten down by a global flight
to supersafe Treasury bonds, booming equity markets and the whiff
of flat-tax talk in the presidential election campaign, according
to David W. Baldt, portfolio manager of Morgan Grenfell's municipal
bond funds. (Proposals like those for a flat tax would generally
strip municipals of their tax advantage over other bonds.)
</P>
<P>
   As a result, yields on municipals are now very attractive for
investors who want to limit risk in their portfolios, and they
compare favorably with Treasuries. On Sept. 30, top-quality 30-year
munis yielded 5.70 percent, on average, or 94.4 percent of the
yield on a 30-year Treasury bond, before taking taxes into account.
</P>
<P>
   Historically, muni bond yields are only 82 percent to 85 percent
of Treasury yields, said Steven D. Harrop, a portfolio manager at
Strong Capital Management in Milwaukee.
</P>
<P>
   Because municipal bond interest is not taxable for most
investors, after-tax yields work out very much in the munis' favor:
to beat that average yield on a 30-year triple-A rated muni after
taxes, a taxable investment like a Treasury bond would have to
yield 7.9 percent for investors in the 28 percent tax bracket or
8.9 percent for those in the 36 percent bracket; the actual long
bond yield that day was just 6.04 percent. (To find a
taxable-equivalent yield, subtract your tax rate from 1 and divide
the remainder into the yield.)
</P>
<P>
   The next question for investors is how best to buy municipals _
and the answer is not simple. Buying bonds directly, rather than
investing through a bond mutual fund, makes sense for investors who
want to hold the investment to maturity and recoup their principal
on that date. Investors who want a more flexible vehicle might
choose a fund instead.
</P>
<P>
   ``With a bond fund, there is no `maturity,''' noted David P.
Dresbach, a certified financial planner in St. Paul. Managers of
open-end mutual funds trade securities almost every day as money
flows in and out of the fund, and the portfolio is always being
refreshed with new bonds.
</P>
<P>
   Buying bonds directly also means a bigger commitment of money.
Bonds generally cost at least $5,000 apiece and should be traded in
lots of at least $20,000 to get better prices. Experts say an
adequately diversified portfolio requires $100,000 or more. Bond
funds, of course, provide such economies of scale _ and generally
require small minimum investments.
</P>
<P>
   Another consideration is credit risk. Muni bonds come in all
credit ratings, from sterling to junk, and some are not even rated
by independent agencies. Researching such bonds is possible for
professional managers but impractical for many investors, Dresbach
said.
</P>
<P>
   So a bond fund may be the answer for someone who does not have
$100,000 to commit to municipals or does not want exposure to
unknown risks. A fund can also offer greater flexibility and
opportunity to realize capital appreciation.
</P>
<P>
   If a bond fund is right for you, there is another fork in the
road: Should you choose an open-end fund, one whose price reflects
its net asset value, or a closed-end fund, which trades like a
stock?
</P>
<P>
   ``For most investors, it makes sense to start off simple and
work with the open-end fund,'' says Eric Jacobson, associate editor
at Morningstar Inc., the financial publisher in Chicago. He said
closed-end funds, which trade like stocks, were more suitable for
investors with sizable muni portfolios and plenty of time to study
their quirks.
</P>
<P>
   Open-end funds are often grouped by geography: funds that
concentrate on bonds from a single state and national funds that
buy munis from anywhere.

<P>
   Single-state funds provide investors in that state with income
that is free of federal, state and any city income taxes. They are
especially attractive for investors in high-tax states like New
York and California; they offer no advantage over national funds
for anyone not subject to that state's income tax.
</P>
<P>
   But single-state funds can have two disadvantages. Trouble in
that state's economy or politics, like the bankruptcy of Orange
County, Calif., in 1994, can send them sinking. And because demand
for municipal bonds is highest in states where taxes are highest,
muni yields in those states tend to be lower than elsewhere,
sometimes low enough to undo the benefit of the state-tax
exemption, said Harrop at Strong, whose company offers only
national funds.
</P>
<P>
   Both state and national funds may be divided into categories
based on the maturities of their bonds, from money market to long
term. Yields are higher with longer maturities, but so are the
risks that investors will be exposed to price volatility or locked
into interest rates that do not keep pace with inflation.
</P>
<P>
   An interesting offshoot of the national-fund category is the
high-yield muni fund, so called because its portfolio tilts heavily
toward bonds with low-credit ratings or none at all _ in other
words, the least expensive and riskiest bonds. About 87 percent of
the $98 million portfolio of Heartland High Yield Municipal Bond,
for instance, is in nonrated securities, according to Morningstar.
</P>
<P>
   Baldt at Morgan Grenfell said most investors should give these
types of funds a wide berth because they de-emphasize a goal of
most bond funds _ preservation of principal.
</P>
<P>
   With a muni fund, he said, ``you are really not looking to shoot
the lights out with high returns.'' High-yield bonds are
speculative but their historical returns are far below those of the
stock market, he added, and they usually do not outpace
higher-rated bonds by enough to be worth the added risk.
</P>
<P>
   But Jacobson at Morningstar says some high-yield managers find
good buys. ``You want to try to identify a fund with a good record
of managing its credit risk in the past,'' he said. One sign is
whether a fund's net asset value has ever eroded sharply. If it
has, find out from the fund if defaulted bonds were the reason,
Jacobson said, though he added that such information is not the
easiest to obtain.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike their open-end cousins, closed-end funds trade on
exchanges through brokers just as stocks do. That is where the
quirks come in: most closed-end funds trade at a discount to their
net asset value and are best bought in the secondary market, not
when first issued. The discount bolsters the effective yield of the
fund, just as buying a bond at a price below face value increases
its yield.
</P>
<P>
   Many closed-end funds are leveraged to further strengthen their
yield, meaning that they borrow money at short-term rates, usually
by selling shares of preferred stock, and use the proceeds to buy
longer-term, higher-yielding investments. The difference between
the two turns into added yield for fund shareholders, said Jeffrey
Kratz, director of exchange-traded fund marketing at John Nuveen &AMP;
Co. in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, he said, closed-end funds typically yield a
percentage point more than their open-end counterparts. But the
leverage also amplifies the funds' vulnerability to interest rate
risk compared with that of open-end funds.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With the nation's syphilis rate at the lowest level
since the government began keeping statistics in 1941, federal
health officials said Thursday that they believed they could
eliminate the disease from the United States in the next five
years.
</P>
<P>
   Just 6,993 cases of syphilis were recorded last year, down from
8,556 in 1997 and from 50,578 in 1990, when the disease last
reached its peak, according to the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention in Atlanta. The national rate dropped 19 percent from
1997 to 1998, to 2.6 cases per 100,000 people from 3.2 cases per
100,000.
</P>
<P>
   The disease control centers said half of all syphilis cases were
concentrated in 28 of the nation's 3,100 counties, which gives
public health officials an edge in curbing the disease by tracking
down infected people and treating them.
</P>
<P>
   The agency attributed the decline to prevention efforts,
including those aimed at reducing the spread of AIDS. And for
reasons scientists cannot quite explain, the disease runs in cycles
of seven to 10 years; the cycle is now at its low ebb. The goal is
to keep it from ever rising again.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stars are aligned for us to get this done,'' Dr. Jeffrey
Koplan, director of the CDC, said in an interview on Wednesday.
``For a modern, industrialized wealthy nation to tolerate the
continued transmission of this disease should be unacceptable. We
don't have to have it here.''
</P>
<P>
   Several other countries, including Canada, England, Sweden and
Denmark, have already eliminated syphilis, a centuries-old disease
that can be treated easily, and cheaply, with a single dose of
penicillin. (Remarkably, unlike many other bacteria, syphilis has
never developed antibiotic resistance.)
</P>
<P>
   To move the United States closer to its goal of elimination,
Koplan announced a new effort Thursday, focusing on 33 states and
cities with either a heavy burden of syphilis or a high potential
for re-emergence.
</P>
<P>
   The agency estimates that the effort will cost $37 million each
year for the next five years, said Dr. Judith Wasserheit, who
directs the CDC's Division of Sexually Transmitted Disease
Prevention. But Dr. Wasserheit said the direct and indirect costs
of syphilis, which can be spread from mother to child and also
helps spread the AIDS virus, were nearly $1 billion a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we are really going to put syphilis up on the shelf next to
diseases like cholera or malaria that are no longer a threat in
this country,'' she said, ``we have got to act now.''
</P>
<P>
   In announcing its new program, the agency identified the 28
counties with the highest numbers of syphilis cases. Baltimore was
first, with 456 cases, followed by Cook County, Ill., which
includes Chicago, with 364 cases, and Shelby County, Tenn.
(Memphis), with 343 cases. New York did not make the list; it was
ranked 44th among cities with more than 2,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   Syphilis is caused by a spirochete, a kind of bacterium. Its
first symptoms are genital sores, but the sores go away without
treatment and patients often do not realize they are infected. Six
weeks to several months later, patients experience a rash, which
fades if left untreated. The disease can then recur later in life,
causing heart damage, blindness and, ultimately, dementia.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the obvious public health benefits, wiping out syphilis
is important to the government for two reasons. First, the Clinton
administration has made eliminating racial disparities in disease
one of its top priorities, and in syphilis the disparity is
especially stark.
</P>
<P>
   According to the CDC, African-Americans are 34 times as likely
as whites to be reported with syphilis; this gap has narrowed from
as much as 64 times as high earlier in the decade. The rate for
blacks in 1998 was 17.1 cases per 100,000 people; for whites, it
was 0.5 per 100,000. In addition, African-American babies account
for nearly two-thirds of all cases of congenital syphilis.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, syphilis was at the center of perhaps the most
infamous episode in the history of medical research sponsored by
the government: the notorious Tuskegee experiment, in which poor
black men with the disease were recruited by federal health
researchers and then left untreated. In 1997, President Clinton
issued a formal apology to the few remaining survivors of the
experiment, which began in 1932.
</P>
<P>
   The memory of Tuskegee, and the distrust it engenders, resonates
strongly among African-Americans, said Dr. Stephanie Bailey,
director of the county health department in Nashville. ``I go and
present this data'' on syphilis ``to our black communities,
especially our religious leaders, and they bring up Tuskegee,'' Dr.
Bailey said.
</P>
<P>
   About a year ago, Dr. Bailey noticed the number of cases going
up in Nashville. So she drew church and school leaders, public
health officers and court officials into an antisyphilis campaign.
The cases seemed to be concentrated among prostitutes and crack
users; among the tactics the authorities used was to test the blood
of anyone jailed for crimes related to sex and drugs. They
identified 110 new cases that way.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Wasserheit of the CDC said the government frittered away an
opportunity to eliminate syphilis in 1955. That year, just 6,454
cases were reported. Thinking the epidemic was over, government
officials cut financing for syphilis prevention by 85 percent, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That,'' she said, ``was the beginning of a progressive
increase.''  &QL;

BAINES HAS GOOD LUCK, AND A BIT OF PLUCK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SIMON GONZALEZ 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND _ Harold Baines called himself lucky twice yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   He's lucky, he said, to be a member of the Cleveland Indians.
</P>
<P>
   And he was lucky to hit a three-run homer against Bret
Saberhagen, the key blow in the 11-1 victory against the Boston Red
Sox that gave the Indians a 2-0 lead in the Division Series and put
them one victory away from advancing to the American League
Championship Series.
</P>
<P>
   Baines is half right. He is fortunate to be with the Indians,
considering he spent most of the season with the Baltimore Orioles,
baseball's ultimate underachievers.
</P>
<P>
   The Orioles were going nowhere, so on Aug. 27, they traded the
40-year-old designated hitter to the Indians, perennial AL Central
Division champions and championship contenders.
</P>
<P>
   To go from a team just playing out the season to one that has
World Series aspirations certainly can be considered good luck.
</P>
<P>
   But about that homer.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just got the ball over the middle of the plate, and I was
fortunate enough to hit it,'' Baines said.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Baines has made a long career out of similar blows.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were able to add a professional hitter,'' Indians manager
Mike Hargrove said. ``There are guys that are absolutely pure good
hitters, and Harold brings that to the party.''
</P>
<P>
   Baines' ``fortunate'' home run came on a first-pitch fastball
after Saberhagen had walked Jim Thome. The pitcher already had
given up three runs and three walks in the inning, and Baines has
been around long enough to know he would try to get ahead in the
count.
</P>
<P>
   He got the pitch he expected. It was low but over the middle of
the plate, and Baines hit it out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I made a really good pitch on Baines,'' Saberhagen
said. ``He's a good hitter, and he deposited it.''
</P>
<P>
   The home run turned a pretty good three-run inning into a
back-breaking six-run inning and gave the Indians a 6-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Harold got the home run, and I think it relaxed our dugout a
little bit,'' said Thome, who hit a grand slam the next inning.
</P>
<P>
   It was Baines' fifth career postseason home run, and the second
of his two hits in the game. He is 4-for-7 in the two games of this
series, improving his career playoff average to .341.
</P>
<P>
   Lucky? To be with the Indians, certainly. To hit the home run?
Probably not.

LEADING ENVIRONMENTALISTS PUT SUPPORT AND MONEY BEHIND GORE 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Vice President Al Gore, who prides himself for his
environmental record, was stung last month when an environmental
group, Friends of the Earth, endorsed former Sen. Bill Bradley, his
rival for the Democratic presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday some of Gore's supporters struck back, holding a
fund-raising lunch in midtown Manhattan that featured endorsements
from some leading New York environmentalists, including Robert F.
Kennedy Jr. and Lawrence Rockefeller.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's our last best chance to save the planet,'' said Kennedy,
the oldest son of former Sen. Robert F. Kennedy and an
environmental lawyer, as he urged his audience to focus full time
on the election.
</P>
<P>
   ``Put down your litigation,'' he told the roughly 100
environmental leaders, many of them lawyers, who gave $1,000 each
to Gore. ``Put down your lobbying. Forget about Albany. Forget
about anything else you're doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Rockefeller, the nephew of former Gov. Nelson Rockefeller and
also an environmental lawyer _ and a Republican _ said he was
crossing party lines to support Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to put party labels aside and put our kids' future
first and the earth's future,'' he said, calling Gore ``an
environmental champion.''
</P>
<P>
   Both said that Gore, author of ``Earth in the Balance,'' had led
the fight to protect air and water quality and to clean up toxic
waste sites. They also lauded him for his efforts to combat global
warming and increase the fuel efficiency of cars without increasing
the costs, and for his ``livability agenda'' to reduce traffic jams
and preserve open space.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy said later that Thursday's event was held in part to
counter the Friends of the Earth's endorsement of Bradley, who the
group said was more effective in pushing environmental matters.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was among the events that brought us together,'' Kennedy
said, citing these others: ``Gore's getting a raw deal in the
press, that George W.'s getting a free ride and sometimes your
friends have to stand up when there's a lot of momentum against
you.'' The reference was to polls showing that Bradley is running
even, if not ahead, of the vice president in crucial states like
New York and New Hampshire and that Gov. George W. Bush of Texas,
the Republican front-runner, maintains a solid lead over both
nationally.
</P>
<P>
   But instead of comparing Gore's record with that of Bradley, the
Gore supporters _ and Gore himself _ compared it with that of Bush,
whose state is home to a quarter of the nation's oil refineries and
two-thirds of its chemical industries.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said that Houston was overtaking Los Angeles as the city
with the worst smog in America. ``Under Governor Bush, Texas has
ranked No. 1 in America for carcinogens in the air, No. 1 in
America for toxic releases into the air, into the water and into
the soil,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said Bush had received financial backing from polluters who
opposed environmental regulations. ``That kind of approach cannot
be taken into the White House,'' Gore said, describing Bush as ``a
person who carries water _ dirty water _ for the chemical
industry.'' As applause erupted, Gore said: ``I'm going to tell it
like it is!''
</P>
<P>
   Scott McClellan, a spokesman for Bush, defended his
environmental record. Under Bush, he said, Texas has planned to
reduce air emissions by 250,000 tons annually, the equivalent of
removing 5.5 million cars from the road. He also said that Gore,
whom President George Bush once labeled ``ozone man,'' had ``a long
history of weird and extreme environmental ideas,'' including his
support for the Kyoto global-warming treaty.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the vice president seemed to have Bradley on his mind as
he uttered some thoughts throughout his environmental speech about
``authenticity.'' Bradley supporters frequently cite that quality
as a strength in comparison with Gore, who is often criticized as
overcalculating and cautious.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said that everyone had an ``obligation to be authentic and
to integrate all the different parts of our lives into a coherent
and authentic expression of who we are and what's most important in
our lives.'' He said he had worked on environmental issues for a
long time, but then referred without elaboration to a challenge in
his personal life that forced him to think about environmental
policy anew.
</P>
<P>
   His remarks seemed to reflect his current struggle to try to
reveal more about himself in his campaign stump speech, which he
did not deliver Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just as in our personal lives when we find out how to be
authentic and speak from the heart, it turns out to be easier than
any other way of being,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   Teachers Unit Endorses Gore
</P>
<P>
   The political committee of the nation's largest labor union, the
National Education Association, endorsed Gore Thursday to be the
Democratic nominee for president _ with the expectation that the
association's executive board would issue the official endorsement
of him Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The move by the union, which has 2.5 million members, comes
after the nation's other large teachers union, the million-member
American Federation of Teachers, endorsed Gore on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The National Education Association is not part of the AFL-CIO,
which will debate at its convention next week whether to endorse
Gore. But an endorsement by the education association, because of
its membership and the size of its political action fund, is
expected to be a major boost for Gore in his race against Bradley.

RUSSIA INVESTIGATING ITS BANKS FOR ROLE IN SUSPICIOUS CASH
MOVEMENTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By MICHAEL R. GORDON    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ The nation's top tax official said that his
investigation was pointing to a single Russian bank as the
architect of the transfer of billions of dollars into accounts
under investigation in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander Pochinok, the chief of the Russian State Tax Service,
declined to name the bank. But he said in an interview that a small
group of Russian businessmen appeared to have pioneered the
practice of sending money through the Bank of New York accounts
that are under investigation by the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there is one main bank that was at least the
ideological center,'' Pochinok said in an interview. ``The
operations were all done in a similar way. And a number of firms
are connected with the people at this bank.'' The transfers
themselves were carried out by a number of banks, and he said that
a least 10 of them are under investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The aim of the money-moving schemes, Pochinok said, was to hide
income from the Russian tax authorities and avoid Russian taxes and
tariffs.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI is looking at a group of accounts at the Bank of New
York that American authorities say moved nearly $7 billion out of
Russia. On Tuesday, a federal indictment was unsealed in Manhattan
charging three small American companies and three Russian
immigrants with illegally operating a money transferring business.
The bank, which is cooperating with the investigation, has not been
accused of wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   Since news of the federal investigation at the Bank of New York
surfaced in August, Russia's response has taken several turns. At
first, government officials dismissed the charges as a political
campaign by Republicans in Congress to isolate Russia. They also
brushed them off as an attempt to embarrass the Clinton
administration, especially Vice President Al Gore, who has touted
his personal relationship with Viktor Chernomyrdin, a former prime
minister of Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Kremlin's aim appears to be to remove the taint of
corruption that has hurt all Russian businessman. The Russian
government has come under pressure by the United States to assist
its investigation.
</P>
<P>
   But the Russian anticorruption campaign has also raised concerns
here that the government may be looking for a convenient target or
scapegoat to put the inquiry behind it and divert attention from
allegations of kickbacks to the government that are unrelated to
the banking investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The tax agency has conducted two well-publicized raids on
Russian banks. While Pochinok has said he is investigating about 10
banks, he said Thursday that he plans to check more banks next
week. He declined to name all of them, saying they might sue the
government for libel unless the authorities had proof.
</P>
<P>
   He said he was concerned that some would destroy their computer
and paper records before his investigators could get to them.
Computer records at the first bank to be raided, Flamingo Bank of
Moscow, seem to have been tampered with, he said.
</P>
<P>
   That bank is the subject of a criminal investigation that opened
last week. On Tuesday, police raided Sobin Bank, which has had a
long and lucrative relationship with the Russian government and is
owned by powerful business interests.
</P>
<P>
   Pochinok said that investigators focused on Sobin Bank after
discovering payments made to the bank by Flamingo. A third bank,
Depozitarno-Kliringovy Bank, has also come under suspicion by tax
authorities.
</P>
<P>
   These banks, in turn, have links with other Russian banks and
businesses, which may also become targets of the Russian
investigation. All have denied any violations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are just following the path of the money,'' Pochinok said.
</P>
<P>
   As the head of the State Tax Service, Pochinok is charged with
finding violations of Russian tax laws. Pochinok said he has
received no help from the United States.
</P>
<P>
   He said the Russian investigation has already uncovered a huge
number of transactions that went through the Bank of New York
account established by Benex International Co., which the FBI said
handled nearly $5 billion of the $7 billion in Russian funds.
</P>
<P>
   ``A great number of banks had relations with the Bank of New
York,'' Pochinok said. ``The majority of these are normal interbank
relations. Unfortunately, among these operations there are some
that were used to evade taxes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``An enormous number of deals were made through Benex,'' he
added. ``And I have not uncovered all of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Pochinok said that Benex appeared to be well known to Russian
businessmen.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as I can tell, everyone knew that this firm could be
used to send money,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the suspicions transactions uncovered by Russian
investigators do not involve money laundering by criminal groups,
but efforts to avoid Russian tariffs and taxes.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The schemes, Pochinok said, took several forms. In transactions
between Russian companies, for example, payments were made using a
series of offshore banks, the Benex accounts at the Bank of New
York and several Russian banks, he explained. ``The idea of this
scheme is conceal the source of the money,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In another scheme, importers dodged tariffs by understating the
value of the goods bought from foreign suppliers. The importers
then made under-the-table payments to their foreign suppliers
through the Benex accounts.
</P>
<P>
   A third scheme, which was more popular before last year's
economic crisis, was used to hide the high prices paid for Moscow
apartments, Pochinok said. For a buyer wanting to pay $300,000 for
an apartment, for example, the official price might be set at
$30,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``You transfer $30,000, and $270,000 you send to the Bank of New
York account to go to the sellers,'' he explained. ``You are not
interested to show that you have this kind of money, and the seller
is not eager to pay the taxes from the sale.''
</P>
<P>
   Pochinok said that many transactions involving the Bank of New
York were legal. To find a violation, he said the authorities must
prove two things: the illegal export of hard currency and tax
evasion.
</P>
<P>
   ``In many cases, we know we will be able to prove it,'' he said.
``But for this we have to pin down the entire chain.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Russian authorities have taken their first steps to
investigate the allegations pertaining to the Bank of New York, it
is still unclear how far the inquiry will go. Powerful political
interests have often shielded the banks from disciplinary action.
</P>
<P>
   But Pochinok insisted his inquiry would go on.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are adding several more to the list, and beginning next
week will check several more,'' he said.

</P>
<P>
   IRAN: PAPER BOUNCES BACK
</P>
<P>
   Less than three weeks after a press court closed the reformist
newspaper Neshat for ``insulting Islam,'' the editors and reporters
involved in its publication used another publishing license to
begin a new daily, Asre Azadegan, that is almost identical in
layout, content and editorial line. The new paper is the fourth the
reformist group has put out in the past 16 months, after three
predecessors, including Neshat, were ordered closed.
</P>
<P>
   IRAN: U.S. REJECTED ON RELIGION
</P>
<P>
   Iran has rejected a State Department report that designated Iran
and four other countries violators of religious freedoms. The
official news agency quoted a Foreign Ministry spokesman as saying
that ``followers of divine religions practice their religion in
complete freedom'' in Iran, and dismissing as ``baseless'' the
State Department's accusation that Bahais had been persecuted.
</P>
<P>
   EUROPE
</P>
<P>
   ITALY: SPYING FOR SOVIETS
</P>
<P>
   Files leaked by the former KGB archivist Vasily Mitrokhin, whose
newly published revelations have resounded through Europe, suggest
that as many as 261 Italian journalists, diplomats and politicians
sold secrets to the Soviet Union. In Italy, the scandal focuses
less on high-level spies than on even higher-level ignorance.
British intelligence obtained the file in 1992. A former defense
secretary, Beniamino Andreatta, said he first learned of the spy
ring in 1996. Former Prime Minister Romano Prodi said he was never
told.
</P>
<P>
   SWITZERLAND: SLAVES' FREEDOM BOUGHT
</P>
<P>
   A human rights group said it had bought the freedom of 4,300
more African slaves in Sudan, paying $50 a person. Christian
Solidarity International, a Zurich-based group, has previously
bought the freedom of people enslaved in Sudan, incurring criticism
from Unicef that it was encouraging trafficking. The group has paid
for the return of 15,447 people.
</P>
<P>
   GERMANY: GRASS DUMPS LAFONTAINE
</P>
<P>
   Guenter Grass, the new Nobel literature laureate and veteran
Social Democrat, said he was ending his friendship with Oskar
Lafontaine, the former Social Democratic finance minister, over his
powerful personal attack on Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder in his
autobiography, ``The Heart Beats on the Left.'' Grass said ``the
damage he's done to his own party is too great and all I can say to
him is `Shut up!' ''
</P>
<P>
   GERMANY: SEIZED AS KILLER OF JEWS
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors announced that Julius Viel, an 81-year-old former
Nazi SS officer, had been arrested after accounts by some 900
witnesses that he shot dead seven Jews in Theresienstadt
concentration camp in 1945. He was arrested at his home near
Wangen, close to the Austrian border. The killings were said to
have taken place in early 1945 while the victims were digging
antitank trenches near the Czech town of Leitmeritz.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO: GERMAN HEADS NATO FORCE
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Klaus Reinhardt of Germany takes over Friday as commander
of KFOR, as the Kosovo peacekeeping force is known, replacing Gen.
Sir Mike Jackson of Britain, who has been leading NATO's mission in
the Yugoslav province since May. He is the first German officer to
take command of a NATO mission outside his homeland, a choice that
has been largely seen as the natural outgrowth of Germany's renewed
role in world affairs.
</P>
<P>
   THE AMERICAS
</P>
<P>
   MEXICO: PARTY LEADER ACCUSED
</P>
<P>
   Roberto Madrazo, a former governor who is seeking the governing
party's presidential nomination, demanded the resignation of the
party chief, Jose Gonzalez Fernandez, accusing him of collaborating
quietly with Francisco Labastida, a former interior minister who is
Madrazo's main rival in the primary race. The accusations by
Madrazo, who represents a wing of the party opposed to President
Ernesto Zedillo, appeared to increase chances of a party rupture
after the Nov. 7 primary.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PETERBOROUGH, N.H. _ Former Sen. Bill Bradley offered his
prescription for the stresses on families of global economic
competition, calling Thursday for $3.6 billion a year in new
federal spending to expand day-care services, improve community
colleges and encourage the elderly to work with children.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking in a crowded high school gym in this rustic mountain
hamlet, Bradley said the idyllic ``Norman Rockwell'' world he had
known as a child in Missouri had all but disappeared, replaced by a
high-pressure economy that often forced both parents to work and
left them little time for their children.
</P>
<P>
   ``The new global economy just doesn't care about the 6:30
dinner,'' Bradley told more than 1,000 students and supporters.
``It doesn't care that you don't know how to use a computer. The
global economy isn't worrying about you at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's speech came at a time when he is battling his lone
rival for the Democratic presidential nomination, Vice President Al
Gore, for the support of labor unions. Leaders of the AFL-CIO, are
debating whether to issue an endorsement at the labor federation's
meeting next week.
</P>
<P>
   Like the vice president, Bradley has come under heavy criticism
from many labor leaders for supporting trade policies, including
the North American Free Trade Agreement, that have spurred global
competition and caused, they say, layoffs and other economic
dislocations for American workers.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, Bradley, a former New York Knick forward who went on
to represent New Jersey for three terms in the Senate, asserted
that he understood the strains of juggling parenthood with work,
describing how he prepared frozen dinners for his daughter in
Washington while his wife, Ernestine, taught college courses back
home.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I took the oath of office, I raised my right hand high,
but in my left hand I held Theresa Anne,'' he said, referring to
his daughter, the couple's only child.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's speech, the second of four major policy addresses he
plans to make this fall, came a week after Bradley outlined his
proposal for extending health insurance to most Americans. Though
Bradley has criticized Gore for taking an ``incremental'' approach
to fixing the nation's problems, the plan he outlined Thursday
seemed relatively modest in scope, and included these elements:
</P>
<P>
   --The creation of a $2-billion-a-year program to finance day
care and other programs for the preschool children of working
parents of all income levels. Modeled after a North Carolina
program called ``Smart Start,'' Bradley's plan would allow
committees of local officials, business leaders, child-care workers
and parents to allocate the federal grants. The money could also be
spent counseling or education programs.
</P>
<P>
   --Giving $400 million a year in grants to community colleges, an
increase of nearly a third over current federal support. The money
could be used to improve programs intended to place students in
jobs in the local economy or to retrain older workers whose jobs
have changed or been eliminated by technological advancements. ``A
pair of strong hands are not what they used to be,'' Bradley said.
``Now those hands have to be able to use a keyboard.''
</P>
<P>
   --$200-a-month stipends to the elderly for working 15 hours a
week with young people in approved programs like tutoring or
counseling.
</P>
<P>
   --Expanding the Family and Medical Leave Act, which requires
employers with 50 or more employees to give workers up to 12 weeks
of unpaid leave a year for reasons like child-birth or family
illnesses. Bradley would expand the law to cover employers with 25
or more workers, bringing an additional 12 million people into its
reach. He would also require employers to give workers 24 unpaid
hours a year for less-pressing situations, like parent-teacher
conferences.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has called for a similar expansion of the leave act, as
well as for increasing federal subsidies for day-care services. He
has proposed providing tax incentives to companies that offer
day-care services. And he has called for eliminating the so-called
marriage penalty that causes spouses filing joint returns to pay
higher taxes than single people.
</P>
<P>
   Recent polls have shown Bradley and Gore in a dead heat in New
Hampshire, the site of the nation's first primary next February.
</P>
<P>
   Though Bradley received a standing ovation from the students,
who sat on bleachers in the rear of the gym, it was clear many of
them had no idea who he was. To underscore that point, the
principal, Susan Dell, said in her introduction of the candidate
that not a single student in one ninth grade class had heard of
Bradley, despite his candidacy and place in the basketball Hall of
Fame.

   ``I probably would know this guy if he ever had played
basketball,'' one of the students told his teacher, Ms. Dell said.

DOLE VOWS MORE BORDER AGENTS FOR DRUG FIGHT
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By DIANA JEAN SCHEMO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BORDERFIELD STATE PARK, Calif. _ With the U.S.-Mexico border as
her backdrop, Elizabeth Dole vowed Thursday to more than double the
number of border patrol agents if elected president, not as a way
to fight illegal immigration but to block the flow of drugs from
Latin America to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Dole, who is seeking the Republican nomination for
president, promised a renewed commitment to the war on drugs,
bringing into the fight two agencies, the U.S. Border Patrol and
the National Guard, whose primary mission has not traditionally
focused on fighting drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
   She called for bringing the number of agents patroling the U.S.
border to 20,000 from about 9,000, and said, ``Clinton/Gore
continues to nickel-and-dime this agency and has not asked for a
single new agent.'' She also pledged an infusion of high-technology
equipment for the border service.
</P>
<P>
   But a spokesman for the Border Patrol in San Diego, Roy
Villareal, said it had hired more agents and updated equipment
since 1994 under ``Operation Gateway,'' an effort to stem illegal
immigration. Similar operations had been started at other major
border crossings. The patrol's problem was not lack of money, he
said, but recruitment and attrition. ``For every 54 people we
interview,'' he said, ``we have one recruit.''
</P>
<P>
   In other respects, Mrs. Dole's proposal resembled the tenets and
language of a group of conservative Republicans in Congress, led by
Rep. Benjamin A. Gilman of upstate New York, who have pummeled the
Clinton administration over drug policy, particularly in Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Dole called rebels who control a swatch of Colombia the
size of Switzerland ``narco-terrorists'' and ``narco-guerrillas,''
as Gilman does, and said she would cut off all military aid to
Colombia until the government there forced the rebels to evacuate
the area.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will fight along the border,'' Mrs. Dole said. ``We will
fight on the streets; we will fight in our neighborhoods; and we
will fight in our schools.''
</P>
<P>
   Though congressional Republicans have called on the Colombian
government to reclaim the rebel-held area, it is hardly clear the
Colombian army could do so.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Dole's speech came a day after the Clinton administration
announced that it would ask Congress to approve $1 billion to $2
billion in aid to Colombia, where all sides, from leftist rebels to
right-wing paramilitary groups, feed off a drug trade that supplies
more than 75 percent of the cocaine sold in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's policy statement was Mrs. Dole's third in the last
two weeks. She delivered it earlier than expected, perhaps to
counter speculation about whether she will remain in the race.
Earlier, she had spoken on education and defense policy.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Dole, a former president of the American Red Cross and a
two-time Cabinet secretary, said she realized that drugs were not
at the top of voters' agendas, but said she cared deeply about the
issue. ``Just outside the nation's capital, a 16-year-old girl
turned in her parents for growing and smoking marijuana,'' Mrs.
Dole said. ``Think about the message that young woman was getting
at home.''
</P>
<P>
   As she headed to a fund-raiser in San Francisco, somebody asked
Mrs. Dole whether she thought ``this war was winnable.'' It was not
clear whether he meant the war on drugs or the war for the White
House.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Dole turned and gave the thumbs up sign. ``Oh, it's
winnable,'' she said.

FED RECONSIDERS POLICY OF DISCLOSING TILT ON RATES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas)   (af)  
 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Concerned that its latest attempt to be more open
might be confusing investors as much as helping them, the Federal
Reserve is reviewing its new practice of disclosing once-secret
decisions about tilting policy toward raising or reducing interest
rates, the central bank said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed said it had established a committee to study ways to
clarify the meaning of the statement the central bank issues at the
conclusion of each policy meeting. Since May, the Fed has used the
statement not only to disclose any immediate changes to monetary
policy, but also to say whether it had adopted a ``bias,'' a formal
decision that it sees a possible need to raise or lower rates in
the near future.
</P>
<P>
   But it has never been clear _ to investors who bet fortunes
based on their reading of likely interest rate moves, or to Fed
officials themselves _ whether the adoption of a bias is a clear
expression of the central bank's intent to shift policy within a
month or two or a much vaguer warning.
</P>
<P>
   The establishment of the committee was disclosed in the minutes
of the Aug. 24 Fed meeting, where the central bank pushed its
benchmark federal funds target rate up by a quarter-point, to 5.25
percent, as a protective move against a possible resurgence of
inflation pressures. The minutes showed that the rate hike was
approved by a vote of 9-1.
</P>
<P>
   The lone dissenter was Robert D. McTeer Jr., president of the
Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, who has become a leading advocate
of the theory that the economy is capable of higher rates of
noninflationary growth, in part because of huge investments by
business in efficiency-enhancing technology.
</P>
<P>
   McTeer had also dissented from the Fed's previous quarter- point
rate increase, in June. The minutes of the August meeting stated
that McTeer believed ``that positive supply-side forces will
continue to damp the impact of strong demand on output prices and
that productivity gains will continue to damp the effect of higher
wages on unit labor costs.''
</P>
<P>
   The minutes said the review of how the Fed discloses its policy
bias would be led by Roger W. Ferguson Jr., the central bank's vice
chairman.
</P>
<P>
   In May, the Fed said it had adopted a bias toward tightening, a
step it followed with an interest rate increase in June. At the
June 30 meeting, it moved to a neutral bias, which many investors
took to mean that the Fed had no intention of raising rates at its
next meeting, in August.
</P>
<P>
   But in August, the Fed tightened again, and again said it had a
neutral bias. At its latest meeting, on Tuesday, the Fed held rates
steady, and moved to a tightening bias, although it added that the
adoption of the bias should not be seen as a ``commitment to
near-term action.''
</P>
<P>
   Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Fed, noted at the August
meeting that ``the sentence relating to the directive was subject
to differing interpretations,'' and that the decision to make
immediate announcements about ``significant changes in the symmetry
or asymmetry in the directive had made it desirable to clarify its
meaning.''
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear what steps the committee may recommend to clear up
the confusion, although the minutes said the Fed was not
contemplating dropping the new practice altogether. The committee
is expected to report back by spring. In addition to Ferguson, it
is made up of all the Federal Reserve governors except Greenspan,
plus the presidents of three Reserve banks.

ANAHEIM EXPECTS NO RETALIATION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JENNIFER FLOYD 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Anaheim players say they aren't worried about
retaliation from the Stars for hits by Ruslan Salei, Pascal
Trepanier and Jim McKenzie.
</P>
<P>
   At least not on this go around.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Rusty \RSalei\S had played, he's got to expect he'll get
hit,'' Mighty Ducks goalie Guy Hebert said. ``But I don't think
they'll go after Paul \RKariya\S or Teemu \RSelanne\S. I think
they'll probably play a more physical game, but I think they
respect Paul and Teemu.''
</P>
<P>
   Selanne said he hoped that Stars players wouldn't target him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't do anything,'' Selanne said. Enforcer to start Winger
Chris Murray is the closest thing the Stars have to an enforcer,
and Stars coach Ken Hitchcock said he will make his first start
tonight against an Anaheim team that sent Mike Modano to the
hospital on a stretcher less than a week ago.
</P>
<P>
   Coincidence?
</P>
<P>
   ``People can read into it whatever they want, but I'm a hockey
player first, and I'm going to go out and help the hockey team
win,'' Murray said. ``I was going to play sooner or later, and
\Rtonight\S is as good as any.''
</P>
<P>
   With Murray playing tonight, injured winger Grant Marshall's
debut will be tomorrow against San Jose.
</P>
<P>
   Murray skated both days in Anaheim and said while he was
physically ready to play he'd rather begin in a place where the ice
isn't quite as bad.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ice is pretty bad,'' Marshall said of Arrowhead Pond.
``But I guess the biggest thing is I don't know if I can go back to
back right now. So I'll play \Rtomorrow\S and evaluate how I did in
the game and how I felt and go from there.'' Tough stars Stars
winger Mike Keane said the biggest change in the Stars' game might
be in the way the stars play instead of the way the enforcers and
tough guys play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you'll see the stars getting their elbows up, their
sticks up,'' Keane said. ``They're going to have to be ready and
realize that those cheap shots may be coming.''
</P>
<P>
   Message received, according to Stars winger Brett Hull.
</P>
<P>
   ``No question, you have to protect yourself,'' Hull said. ``You
say it before every game. If that guy comes at you make him eat
your Easton, and he won't come back at you again.''
</P>
<P>
   Easton, of course, is a brand of hockey equipment. Line doctor
The doctor was back at work yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Stars coach Ken Hitchcock was once again cutting and pasting his
lines.
</P>
<P>
   He had Joe Nieuwendyk back with his usual linemates of Pavel
Patera and Jamie Langenbrunner while Guy Carbonneau took Mike
Modano's spot centering the No. 1 line of Brett Hull and Jere
Lehtinen. Brian Skrudland jumped into Carbonneau's spot centering
the line with Juha Lind and Blake Sloan. The fourth line was Derek
Plante, Mike Keane and Chris Murray.
</P>
<P>
   ``As they said, the bingo king has juggled again,'' Hitchcock
said.

IN A ROUGH QUARTER, A SMALL VICTORY FOR STOCK-PICKING  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, OCT. 10) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass.)   (af)  
 By GRETCHEN MORGENSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Seismic shifts are often imperceptible in the stock market until
well after they have taken hold. But 1999 is looking more and more
like the year that index mutual funds lost their star quality.
</P>
<P>
   In the third quarter, the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index lost
6.5 percent of its value, while the average United States
diversified stock fund had a smaller loss _ 5.08 percent. Not much
for active fund managers to crow about, but outperformance
nevertheless.
</P>
<P>
   And encouragingly, for the first time since the early 1990s,
outperformance was the rule, not the exception among the managers.
According to Lipper Inc., more than half _ 57 percent _ beat their
market benchmarks in the quarter. For all of 1998, only one-fourth
of them did.
</P>
<P>
   Could it be that actual stock-picking will make a comeback among
fund managers, who for years made money simply by buying those
stocks that had been rising the most? Perhaps. But temper that
possibility with this fact: in the most recent quarter, successful
stock-picking was confined to just two sectors, technology and
precious metals _ a sign that the overall market has been an
unrewarding place to invest of late.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to the desultory market, most stock funds closed out the
quarter in negative territory. Specialized stock funds did better
than their diversified brethren, losing only 2.28 percent over all
in the quarter. But funds that invested in value stocks got
hammered, some losing as much as 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Only international equity funds managed to show a gain _ 2.06
percent, on average. This was largely attributable to the rebound
in Japanese equities.
</P>
<P>
   After years in which the same handful of stocks turned up in the
top-performing mutual fund portfolios, the third quarter of 1999
gave investors fresh blood. Of the six stock funds that topped the
performance list in the quarter, not one counted Microsoft, Intel,
Cisco Systems, Lucent Technologies or America Online as major
holdings.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the top-performing funds in the most recent quarter
hold relatively obscure and smaller companies. The biggest holding
of the Strong Enterprise fund, a mid-cap growth fund that returned
19.51 percent, the best of all diversified stock funds, is Applied
Materials, a familiar name in semiconductors.
</P>
<P>
   But its other top stocks include less-known names like PRI
Automation, a five-year-old company that helps semiconductor makers
automate their factories, and Sandisk, a maker of data storage
products. The No.2 fund, Van Wagoner Emerging Growth, returned
18.46 percent in the quarter. Its largest holding is Com21, a cable
modem company.
</P>
<P>
   These holdings reflect the overall market's sole pocket of
consistent strength in the quarter _ technology. Christine A.
Callies, investment strategist at Credit Suisse First Boston,
pointed out that through Sept. 27, technology was the only sector
in the S&AMP;P 500 that had increased in value during the previous 10
weeks. Eight other big sectors, including financial companies,
utilities and basic materials makers, deteriorated during that
period.
</P>
<P>
   Rising stocks were in a distinct minority. According to Salomon
Smith Barney, as of Sept. 28, NASDAQ stocks had declined almost 35
percent, on average, from their 52-week highs. New York Stock
Exchange stocks had fallen almost 28 percent, on average, and
shares in the S&AMP;P had dropped by 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
   More alarming, 52.1 percent of NASDAQ stocks were down 30
percent or more from their 52-week highs by Sept. 28, compared with
37.5 percent of Big Board stocks and 33.2 percent of the S&AMP;P.
Investors who didn't happen to be in technology stocks felt a lot
of this pain.
</P>
<P>
   Only when the price of gold spiked late in September, bringing
funds in that sector an average gain of 20.35 percent for the
period, did technology stocks get some competition.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Several developments damaged the overall market during the
quarter. The Federal Reserve Board raised interest rates twice over
the summer, for a total of half a percentage point. And the
weakening of the dollar, particularly against the Japanese yen,
coupled with rising commodity prices, raised fears that inflation
may recur.
</P>
<P>
   But rather than buying on the market's dips, investors slowed
their mutual fund investments as summer drew to a close. Investors
put $9.2 billion into stock funds in August, a decline of 25.7
percent from July. And Robert Adler, president of AMG Data
Services, said September's fund flows were still lower. Adler said
that most of the fresh money was still going into
big-capitalization index funds and large-cap growth funds.
</P>
<P>
   The slowdown in flows may indicate that investors are finally
growing wary of stocks. Ms. Callies pointed out that in the postwar
era, investors make broad shifts in their asset allocations once
every 15 years or so.
</P>
<P>
   The asset allocation change that began in 1982, with the onset
of a bull market in stocks, is now 17 years old. As a result, Ms.
Callies speculated that the era of equity investments may be
ending.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time that money is flowing less freely into stock
funds, mutual funds' cash holdings are low _ by Ms. Callies's
reckoning, at 4.8 percent, which she puts at the extreme low end of
the long-term range.
</P>
<P>
   As the market indexes have skidded, it is somewhat surprising
that managers are not building up cash to protect their portfolios
from being hurt by a flood of redemptions. Instead, fund managers
may be staying fully invested in stocks to try to jump-start their
returns.
</P>
<P>
   If the performance of well-known large-capitalization stocks is
beginning to flag, it would fit a pattern _ identified by analysts
at Sanford C.Bernstein &AMP; Co. _ that typically afflicts growth
stocks. In short, growth stocks do not remain growth stocks for
long.
</P>
<P>
   According to the firm's study, which looked at stocks between
1965 and 1998, only 42 percent of all growth stocks remained hot
growers for more than five years, while only 19 percent stayed
high-growth for more than 10 years. Over 20 years, only 5 percent
of growth stocks kept up their steam.
</P>
<P>
   The hurdles are even higher for technology companies. In that
sector, less than one in three growth stocks will remain
top-performers for more than five years. Looking out 10 years, the
share drops to 11 percent As for 20 years, only 3 percent made the
grade.
</P>
<P>
   The firm concluded that technology stocks _ the ones now holding
up the market _ were among the least reliable of growth companies.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the pouring of money into technology funds, Adler of AMG
Data Services sees a rising level of caution over all. He pointed
to the activity in high-yield corporate bond funds as evidence.
``There is an indication in the numbers that an aversion to risk is
beginning to evolve among investors,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, after the Russian debt default, he added,
``high-yield bond funds showed terrific inflows.'' Not today. In 10
of the last 11 weeks, there have been net redemptions from
high-yield bond funds, reflecting investor concern about risk.
</P>
<P>
   ``That continuous type of negative activity,'' Adler recalled,
``has only been experienced twice before'' _ when the Federal
Reserve raised interest rates in 1994 and in the Russian default.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, bond funds have been hurt by rising interest rates
and inflation fears. Only those funds investing in international
bonds did well, benefiting mightily from the weaker dollar.

AFL-CIO CONVENTION TO GET UNDER WAY IN L.A.
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Thousands of unionists are expected to converge
on Los Angeles this weekend for the 23rd biennial convention of the
country's largest labor organization, the American Federation of
Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations.
</P>
<P>
   The six-day event -- mostly at the Los Angeles Convention Center
-- will include presentations on sweatshops, human rights and
changes in the labor movement. Pre-convention events begin today,
and the formal convention -- with an estimated 700 delegates --
will convene Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The AFL-CIO, an umbrella group for 68 national and international
unions, represents about 13 million workers. Delegates from member
unions are slated to vote Wednesday on their endorsement for next
year's presidential race, but AFL-CIO officials say they may delay
that vote.
</P>
<P>
   Speakers scheduled to speak at the event include Gov. Gray
Davis, perennial presidential candidate Jesse Jackson and Juan
Somavia, director-general of the International Labour Organization.
</P>
<P>
   AFL-CIO spokesperson Deborah Dion said the organization chose
Los Angeles because of its growing union activism.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's where some of the most aggressive new organizing is
happening in the nation,'' Dion said. ``Organizing has been
(AFL-CIO President John) Sweeney's top priority.''
</P>
<P>
   Growing distress among workers at all wage levels is also
fueling the union effort here, according to Jack Kyser, chief
economist for the nonprofit Los Angeles Economic Development Corp.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people may feel they're getting shortchanged,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you talk to your peers, more and more people are saying
they are stretched to the limit,'' Kyser said. ``When you have that
type of situation, that opens the door'' to union membership.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles labor movement has used that opening.
</P>
<P>
   More than 90,000 area workers have joined unions since Jan. 1,
including 74,000 county home health care workers. Other union
efforts include 1,700 teaching assistants at the University of
California, Los Angeles; 6,100 aides in the Los Angeles Unified
School District; and 800 doctors in the county health system.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to increased activism, the Los Angeles County Federation
of Labor, AFL-CIO now includes more than 350 union locals with
about 800,000 members.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are turning it around,'' said Neal Sacharow, director of
communications for the federation. ``People are looking more and
more at unions as a way to get a bigger piece of the American
pie.''

EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK LEAVES INTEREST RATE UNCHANGED 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany _ The European Central Bank decided not to
stop Europe's party Thursday, but it bluntly warned that it would
probably move soon to slow things down.
</P>
<P>
   Despite steadily increasing concern about inflationary pressures
in Europe, the central bank chose to leave its core interest rate
unchanged at 2.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But the bank's president, Wim Duisenberg, issued his clearest
and most emphatic statement that the 11-nation euro-zone needed to
be cooled down and that a tighter monetary policy was almost
inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have now had a truly accommodative monetary policy for more
than a year,'' Duisenberg said after a meeting of the bank's board
of governors here Thursday. He said the bank was now looking ahead
to ``a monetary strategy that is conducive to sustainable,
non-inflationary growth. That is something different.''
</P>
<P>
   Investors, who had thought the bank might raise interest rates
Thursday, initially reacted by pushing down the value of the euro,
Europe's new common currency.
</P>
<P>
   But they reversed course after absorbing Duisenberg's
unambiguously hawkish remarks, which apparently convinced investors
that a tougher policy would come sooner rather than later.
</P>
<P>
   The euro ended the day up against the dollar, settling in New
York at $1.07100 compared with $1.06970 Wednesday. Major European
stock markets also ended higher, as investors apparently chose to
focus more on Europe's vibrant economy rather than the prospect of
higher rates.
</P>
<P>
   London's blue-chip index rose 1.69 percent, while Frankfurt's
main index rose 1.23 percent and France's rose 1.08 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The European Central Bank's decision paralleled a similar
verdict Thursday at the Bank of England, which left British rates
unchanged at 5.25 percent.
</P>
<P>
   It also meshed with an almost identical stance adopted by the
United States Federal Reserve Board on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   European bankers have been looking for guidance amid a welter of
sometimes conflicting data. The bank dramatically reduced its core
rate from 3 percent to 2.5 percent in April, because the European
economy had stalled and seemed dangerously close to a recession.
</P>
<P>
   But the outlook has brightened measurably in the last several
months, partly because Asian countries are recovering from the
financial crisis that first gripped that region two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Most forecasters expect the European Union economy to grow about
2.1 percent this year and nearly 3 percent next year. Exports and
industrial production are picking up in many countries, and
joblessness has creeped downward from more than 10 percent to about
9.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But bankers also see a growing body of warning signs. Businesses
and consumers are borrowing money at a much more rapid rate, with
private-sector credit expanding 10.7 percent in August. The money
supply, which is considered a barometer of inflationary pressure,
has climbed somewhat faster than the central bank would like. And
consumer prices have been nudged upward by big increases in oil
prices.
</P>
<P>
   Duisenberg now seems convinced that the main threat is inflation
and, by extension, the credibility of the euro in world markets.
Higher rates would tend to strengthen the European currency.

JUDGE DISMISSES CINCINNATI'S SUIT ON GUNS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)  (th) 
 By FOX BUTTERFIELD    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   A state judge in Cincinnati dismissed the city's lawsuit against
the firearms industry Thursday, saying the city was improperly
asking a court to change the way guns are designed, marketed and
distributed, something only a legislature could do.
</P>
<P>
   The decision was the first dismissal of one of the lawsuits
brought against gun manufacturers by 28 cities and counties over
the past year, lawyers for the gun industry said.
</P>
<P>
   Though it represented a victory for gun makers, lawyers for
several cities said their cases were based on different strategies
and state laws so the ruling would have little bearing.
</P>
<P>
   The decision also came within days of two unfavorable court
decisions for the gun industry.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Judge Meredith A. Jury of U.S. Bankruptcy Court in
Riverside, Calif., ruled that a gun maker could not avoid municipal
lawsuits by filing for bankruptcy protection. The judge, ruling in
the case of Davis Industries, one of several Los Angeles-area gun
makers that have been sued, said a company could not use the
bankruptcy laws to avoid a city's efforts to exercise its
regulatory or police powers.
</P>
<P>
   Last week a California appeals court said the gun makers could
be held liable when their products were used in a criminal
shooting, the first such decision in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate development, United Parcel Service, which ships
about 75 percent of the guns from manufacturers to wholesalers and
dealers, said it would now require that all guns be shipped by its
next-day service instead of its less-expensive ground delivery
service.
</P>
<P>
   The change, made because of a concern about the increasing
threat of litigation and because of several incidents involving
theft of guns, will increase costs for gun makers.
</P>
<P>
   The state judge in Cincinnati, Robert P. Ruehlman, said the
city's claims were vague, unsupported by precedent and ``an
improper attempt to have this court substitute its judgment for
that of the legislature.''
</P>
<P>
   Cincinnati had based its suit largely on the charge that gun
makers had failed to incorporate sufficient safety devices, like
trigger locks. But Ruehlman ruled, as almost all judges had in the
past, that guns were legal products and that the manufacturer could
not be held liable when the guns functioned as intended, even if
they killed people.
</P>
<P>
   ``The judge's ruling shows how flawed these cities' claims
are,'' said Anne Kimball, a lawyer for Smith &AMP; Wesson and Sturm,
Ruger &AMP; Co., two of the largest gun makers in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Officials from several cities said privately that they had filed
the suits to have the issue decided by urban juries familiar with
gun violence, rather than by legislators who are often influenced
by the National Rifle Association.
</P>
<P>
   Owen Clements, chief of special litigation for the San Francisco
City Attorney's Office, said Ruehlman's decision would not alter
his city's suit, because it is based on a California law that
prohibits harmful, unfair or deceptive business practices and is
not a negligence suit.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for other cities said the safety issue that was central
to the Cincinnati case was a lesser part of their cases, which were
based more on questions of marketing and distribution and on public
nuisance.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Ruehlman also dismissed the city's assertion that
the gun makers had created a public nuisance by the way they
marketed and distributed firearms, often selling large numbers of
guns to dealers in areas with lax gun control laws knowing they
would be resold in Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   The judge wrote, ``public nuisance simply does not apply to the
design, manufacture and distribution of a lawful product.''

DESPITE BEING ONE-HIT, ASTROS EXPRESS CONFIDENCE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICHIE WHITT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Houston, we have a ... reason to be happy:
</P>
<P>
   The NFL is coming back.
</P>
<P>
   Scottie Pippen is gone.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros are facing Tom Glavine.
</P>
<P>
   While cautiously cognizant of Glavine's Cy Young resume, popular
Nike commercial and recent mastery over them, the Astros are
thrilled to be facing any Atlanta Braves pitcher not named Kevin
Millwood today in Game 3 of their National League Divisional
Series, at 3 p.m. in the Astrodome.
</P>
<P>
   ``We understand how Glavine has handled us in the past,'' said
Astros manager Larry Dierker, ``but the only way he can be better
than Millwood is to no-hit us.''
</P>
<P>
   With their spin-doctoring in high gear and their glasses
half-full, the Astros spent yesterday's workout forgetting
Millwood's one-hitter in Game 2 and preparing to face a pitcher in
Game 3 who is 8-0 with a 1.35 ERA in his past 10 starts at the
Astrodome.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a reason those guys won 103 games,'' Houston first
baseman Jeff Bagwell said. ``They've got guys who can one-hit you
every night. Tom has the talent to throw a similar game at us, so
we've got to be ready to take it up a notch.''
</P>
<P>
   Defenseless against Millwood's pin-point fastball and nasty
curve, the Astros suffered the worst offensive performance in the
franchise's 25-game postseason history. They managed the one hit _
a second-inning homer by Ken Caminiti _ and sent only six balls out
of the infield. Millwood's gem was baseball's first postseason
complete-game, one-hitter since Boston's Jim Lonborg threw one in
the 1967 World Series.
</P>
<P>
   Houston, 2-7 combined in the 1997, '98 and '99 playoffs, is
planning its rebound around energy from an expected sellout at the
Astrodome and another clutch pitching performance from Mike
Hampton. Capping a 22-4 season that thrust him into Cy Young Award
contention, the left-hander beat the Cincinnati Reds and Los
Angeles Dodgers in crucial games last week to help Houston clinch
its third consecutive Central Division title.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel very confident,'' Bagwell said. ``We're in good shape.
We got a split against Atlanta and come home with Mike on the
mound. We couldn't ask for much more.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Dierker, ``They've got a great staff, but I don't know if
I'd rather have anyone else on the mound for me in this spot than
Mike.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astros also realize they have to get production from
offensive leaders Bagwell and second baseman Craig Biggio to win
this series. Without contributions from Moises Alou (hurt in spring
training) and Derek Bell (only 12 homers), those two carried the
Astros through the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   But Bagwell and Biggio had dismal performances the past two
Octobers, combining to go 6-for-49, and they have again gone
silent. They went a combined 2-for-16 at Turner Field with four
strikeouts and no runs batted in.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're too good of players not to break out of it sooner or
later,'' Dierker said. ``Those guys are the reason we're here, and
I know they'll keep competing and plugging away and helping us find
ways to win.''

WEBVAN IS DELAYING ITS OFFERING OF STOCK 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: N.Y., Ill., Wash.)   (af)  
 By MATT RICHTEL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Webvan Group, an online grocer with big advance billing,
temporarily shelved a public offering of its stock Thursday, not
because it had more selling to do to investors, but because it had
done too much already.
</P>
<P>
   In what may be a cautionary tale to other promising online
ventures, the company appears to have run afoul of regulators by
giving out unpublished information in a conference call.
</P>
<P>
   Disclosures about a company's condition and prospects are common
as executives court money managers and other big investors in the
days leading up to a stock offering. But disclosing information not
in the public filings may violate securities laws, lawyers and Wall
Street analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   Webvan and its underwriter, Goldman, Sachs, issued a brief
statement Thursday saying that the Securities and Exchange
Commission and Webvan ``have agreed to a cooling-off period prior
to the commencement of the offering.''
</P>
<P>
   The company declined to comment about when the stock offering
might be revived. Neither the company nor the SEC would comment on
who initiated the cooling-off period.
</P>
<P>
   Webvan is not the first company to postpone a public stock
offering after it was found to have disclosed information not
revealed in the prospectus filed with regulators, said John Heine,
an SEC spokesman, though he declined to elaborate on the Webvan
case specifically.
</P>
<P>
   Brian C. Oakes, a senior Internet analyst with Lehman Brothers,
suggested that the SEC could be sending a message that would have
longer-term ramifications for the market for new issues. Regulators
may be seeking to address the discrepancies in information
presented to individual investors and institutional investors who
are invited to the so-called road shows ahead of public offerings.
</P>
<P>
   In these presentations, companies describe _ some would say hype
_ their offerings by presenting additional impressions of the
business' prospects. Oakes made clear that he was not criticizing
the Webvan offering in particular.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are plenty of good quality Internet companies going
public but also plenty of overhyped Internet companies going
public,'' he said. ``The SEC is trying to let the facts speak for
themselves, rather than the hype.''
</P>
<P>
   Webvan, founded by Louis Borders, the founder of Borders Books,
has created a buzz even beyond that typical of Internet start-ups.
Though it only began delivering groceries in May, and in only a
handful of markets, its valuation could be $4 billion if it
succeeds with plans to sell 25 million shares at $11 to $13 in its
public offering. The offering had been scheduled for this week.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which filed its offering document on Aug. 6, began
presentations to institutional investors in personal meetings and
in conference calls the week of Sept. 20.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Adam Lashinsky, a reporter for the Internet
financial publication TheStreet.com, dialed into one of the calls.
Lashinsky said he identified himself by name and by his
organization, but not as a journalist, and was permitted to stay on
the call.
</P>
<P>
   Lashinsky said Webvan went on to describe to call participants
information not included in the documents it filed with regulators.
Among the details he said were provided by Webvan _ and not
included in the prospectus _ were that each of the 26 distribution
centers it is building would generate $300 million in annual
revenue, and that it planned to expand into Chicago and Seattle
next year.
</P>
<P>
   According to Borders and Kevin Czinger, the company's chief
financial officer, Webvan's operating margins will be 12 percent,
compared with 4 percent for the typical supermarket, Lashinksy
wrote in his column for TheStreet.com. In an interview Thursday,
Lashinsky said the company offered these details in what appeared
to be a ``prepared statement'' rather than in a question-and-answer
session.
</P>
<P>
   The distinction is important. Lawyers and analysts said it was
not uncommon for companies on a road show to clarify information in
a prospectus. But they said that regulators might view any
violations in that action as more egregious if the company
unilaterally offered institutional investors information not found
in the public documents.
</P>
<P>
   Under securities law, a company making a public offering is
required either to register with the SEC or, in rare instances, to
obtain an exemption from registration. Companies that register are
required to disclose material information so that potential
investors can have a fair and equal opportunity to make an informed
decision about whether to invest.
</P>
<P>
   Companies also tend to voluntarily adopt ``quiet periods'' in
the several months before and after an initial public offering. In
those periods, executives do not discuss the company's financial
prospects publicly. &QL;

 By ROBERT D. McFADDEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Encouraged by ``amazing'' polls, ``unbelievable''
news media interest and a ``huge'' groundswell of public support,
Donald Trump deepened his flirtation with presidential politics
Thursday by appointing an exploratory committee to help him decide
whether his next big deal should be for 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   While exploratory committees may legally raise funds for
potential candidates, Trump said his would primarily be advisory _
telling him whether he could reasonably expect to win the White
House next year as the nominee of the Reform Party, whose leading
elected official is Jesse Ventura, the former wrestler who won the
Minnesota governorship in an upset last year.
</P>
<P>
   President Trump? If that seemed far-fetched, Trump was not
saying so.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless I thought I could win the whole thing, I would have no
interest,'' Trump said in a telephone interview squeezed into a day
of television appearances, meetings with advisers and, Thursday
night, a dinner with Ventura. A 53-year-old real estate developer
and casino owner, Trump has never run for public office.
</P>
<P>
   In the byzantine realm of Reform Party politics, Trump and
Ventura are shaping up as allies in a fractious nomination fight
that could pit Trump against Pat Buchanan, who is expected to bolt
the Republican Party to bid for the Reform nomination. Buchanan is
supported by a loose alliance with ties to Ross Perot, the Texas
billionaire who is the party's founder.
</P>
<P>
   Political experts say a Buchanan candidacy would siphon
Republican support from Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, who would
presumably prefer a race by Trump, who would have far less impact
on him. Trump, in capsule assessments Thursday, castigated Buchanan
but called Bush ``a strong front-runner.''
</P>
<P>
   Trump, whose name was raised by Ventura last month in the
preliminary skirmishing of a presidential campaign that, with more
than a year to go, is still in the stage of trial balloons and wild
guesses, may be as plausible as any of the actors, tycoons and
others being mentioned. He has name recognition and a net worth
estimated at $1.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not looking to raise money,'' Trump said, noting that, if
he runs, he will largely pay his own campaign bills. ``Fortunately,
I have plenty of money. That gives me one advantage over the
others. I wouldn't have to go through fund raising, with all the
obligations that involves. I wouldn't have to make deals.''
</P>
<P>
   Trump, saying he would decide early next year whether to run,
declined to identify the members of his exploratory committee,
whose main task seemed to be to advise him to go for it, and
perhaps to tell him how to win the internal struggle with Buchanan
for the Reform nomination. Merely appointing the panel gave fresh
momentum to Trump's budding campaign.
</P>
<P>
   He was on NBC's ``Today'' show Thursday and CNN's ``Larry King
Live'' Thursday night. On Wednesday night he appeared on
``Dateline'' on NBC. ``We have never seen such a barrage of calls
from the media and the press as in the last few weeks,'' he said.
``It's unbelievable.'' Referring to his possible run, he said,
``There is a lot of pressure to do this.''
</P>
<P>
   He cited polls with ``amazing results,'' indicating ``that I'd
win, or do very well.'' Asked for specifics, he cited a poll by The
National Enquirer that showed him ``neck and neck'' with Bush. The
poll, he said, gave 39 percent to Bush, 37 percent to Trump and 24
percent to Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Trump, a Republican who called himself socially liberal but a
fiscal conservative, said he opposed gun control but favored tax
cuts, abortion rights, a strong national defense and health care
for all. His positions, he said, are detailed in his latest book,
``The America We Deserve,'' to be published in December.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are looking for straight talk,'' he said. ``They are
tired of politicians.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Vice President Al Gore, who prides himself for his
environmental record, was stung last month when an environmental
group, Friends of the Earth, endorsed former Sen. Bill Bradley, his
rival for the Democratic presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday some of Gore's supporters struck back, holding a
fund-raising lunch in midtown Manhattan that featured endorsements
from some leading New York environmentalists, including Robert F.
Kennedy Jr. and Lawrence Rockefeller.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's our last best chance to save the planet,'' said Kennedy,
the oldest son of former Sen. Robert F. Kennedy and an
environmental lawyer, as he urged his audience to focus full time
on the election.
</P>
<P>
   ``Put down your litigation,'' he told the roughly 100
environmental leaders, many of them lawyers, who gave $1,000 each
to Gore. ``Put down your lobbying. Forget about Albany. Forget
about anything else you're doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Rockefeller, the nephew of former Gov. Nelson Rockefeller and
also an environmental lawyer _ and a Republican _ said he was
crossing party lines to support Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to put party labels aside and put our kids' future
first and the earth's future,'' he said, calling Gore ``an
environmental champion.''
</P>
<P>
   Both said that Gore, author of ``Earth in the Balance,'' had led
the fight to protect air and water quality and to clean up toxic
waste sites. They also lauded him for his efforts to combat global
warming and increase the fuel efficiency of cars without increasing
the costs, and for his ``livability agenda'' to reduce traffic jams
and preserve open space.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy said later that Thursday's event was held in part to
counter the Friends of the Earth's endorsement of Bradley, who the
group said was more effective in pushing environmental matters.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was among the events that brought us together,'' Kennedy
said, citing these others: ``Gore's getting a raw deal in the
press, that George W.'s getting a free ride and sometimes your
friends have to stand up when there's a lot of momentum against
you.'' The reference was to polls showing that Bradley is running
even, if not ahead, of the vice president in crucial states like
New York and New Hampshire and that Gov. George W. Bush of Texas,
the Republican front-runner, maintains a solid lead over both
nationally.
</P>
<P>
   But instead of comparing Gore's record with that of Bradley, the
Gore supporters _ and Gore himself _ compared it with that of Bush,
whose state is home to a quarter of the nation's oil refineries and
two-thirds of its chemical industries.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said that Houston was overtaking Los Angeles as the city
with the worst smog in America. ``Under Governor Bush, Texas has
ranked No. 1 in America for carcinogens in the air, No. 1 in
America for toxic releases into the air, into the water and into
the soil,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said Bush had received financial backing from polluters who
opposed environmental regulations. ``That kind of approach cannot
be taken into the White House,'' Gore said, describing Bush as ``a
person who carries water _ dirty water _ for the chemical
industry.'' As applause erupted, Gore said: ``I'm going to tell it
like it is!''
</P>
<P>
   Scott McClellan, a spokesman for Bush, defended his
environmental record. Under Bush, he said, Texas has planned to
reduce air emissions by 250,000 tons annually, the equivalent of
removing 5.5 million cars from the road. He also said that Gore,
whom President George Bush once labeled ``ozone man,'' had ``a long
history of weird and extreme environmental ideas,'' including his
support for the Kyoto global-warming treaty.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the vice president seemed to have Bradley on his mind as
he uttered some thoughts throughout his environmental speech about
``authenticity.'' Bradley supporters frequently cite that quality
as a strength in comparison with Gore, who is often criticized as
overcalculating and cautious.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said that everyone had an ``obligation to be authentic and
to integrate all the different parts of our lives into a coherent
and authentic expression of who we are and what's most important in
our lives.'' He said he had worked on environmental issues for a
long time, but then referred without elaboration to a challenge in
his personal life that forced him to think about environmental
policy anew.
</P>
<P>
   His remarks seemed to reflect his current struggle to try to
reveal more about himself in his campaign stump speech, which he
did not deliver Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just as in our personal lives when we find out how to be
authentic and speak from the heart, it turns out to be easier than
any other way of being,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   Teachers Unit Endorses Gore
</P>
<P>
   The political committee of the nation's largest labor union, the
National Education Association, endorsed Gore Thursday to be the
Democratic nominee for president _ with the expectation that the
association's executive board would issue the official endorsement
of him Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The move by the union, which has 2.5 million members, comes
after the nation's other large teachers union, the million-member
American Federation of Teachers, endorsed Gore on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The National Education Association is not part of the AFL-CIO,
which will debate at its convention next week whether to endorse
Gore. But an endorsement by the education association, because of
its membership and the size of its political action fund, is
expected to be a major boost for Gore in his race against Bradley.

<P>
   To hear George Fellows tell it, everything is going great at
Revlon Inc. Market share is rising, and consumers love the
company's cosmetics. Investors should be happy that the company is
dealing with a huge inventory problem that is in no way its fault.
</P>
<P>
   But Fellows, Revlon's president, acknowledges that investors
aren't happy. In the week since Revlon disclosed the inventory
problem, its stock has plunged 41 percent, to $10.75, even after
bouncing back $2 Thursday. The prices of Revlon junk bonds have
also fallen sharply.
</P>
<P>
   It is not easy to tell whether Fellow's optimism _ he forecasts
that the company will have positive operating cash flow next year _
is justified. But it is clear that Revlon's near-term prospects
hinge on the kindness of the banks that have lent the company lots
of money.
</P>
<P>
   As the bank negotiations begin, say people briefed on Revlon's
finances, the company has $100 million in cash, which should be
enough to get it through the year, but just $35 million in unused
credit lines.
</P>
<P>
   At best, the banks will charge a higher interest rate, something
that will further damage the company's already weak cash-flow
outlook. At worst, they could pull the plug. Fellows is confident
the banks will cooperate, and he notes that Revlon expects to raise
$500 million by selling some subsidiaries soon.
</P>
<P>
   That Revlon is in this situation is a testament to how poorly
things have gone for the company in the 13 years since Ronald O.
Perelman took control after a bitter takeover battle. The takeover
left Revlon saddled with debt, a situation that has not improved
with time. The debt has risen every year since Revlon went public
again, at $24 a share, in 1996. Operating cash flow since the end
of 1996 has registered a negative $99 million.
</P>
<P>
   But even that figure may overstate how well Revlon has done. The
stores that sell its products now have shelves bulging with unsold
merchandise. So last week Revlon said it would all but quit
shipping products for the rest of this year and delay the
introduction of new products. That has put the company in violation
of loan covenants, giving the banks their new leverage.
</P>
<P>
   Fellows vigorously denies that the inventory problem might be an
indication that Revlon stuffed inventory into its customers'
warehouses to bolster reported profits. He says the stores have
simply used computers to manage their inventories more efficiently.
</P>
<P>
   Perelman owns 83 percent of Revlon, but his economic stake is
not that large. Twenty million of his 42 million shares are pledged
to secure $770 million in zero-coupon bonds that come due in March
2001. He could walk away from those bonds _ now trading at less
than 30 percent of face value _ and still keep control of the
company.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Perelman, Howard Gittis, said Thursday that
Perelman had faith in Revlon, which he called ``his most important
holding, if not from a financial standpoint, at least from a
reputational one.''
</P>
<P>
   That reputation was suffering even before Revlon encountered its
latest woes. In the 1990s, four companies owned by Perelman have
gone public, raising a total of $456 million. Each of the stocks
has lost value.
</P>
<P>
   Had the buyers put the money into the Standard &AMP; Poor's
500-stock index instead, they would now have more than $1.1 billion
instead of about $260 million.
</P>
<P>
   This decade has had one of the greatest bull markets ever. Those
who invested in Perelman's companies missed it. Call it the
Perelman Penalty.

SPORTS COLUMN: HENDERSON IN OCTOBER _ AHHH, STOLEN MOMENTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By MURRAY CHASS    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In the last 23 games Rickey Henderson played during
the season, he was on base 33 times. He tried to steal eight times
and was successful five times. In the first two playoff games
against the Arizona Diamondbacks, Henderson was on base six times
with hits and walks. He tried to steal five times and was
successful five times.
</P>
<P>
   Why has the Mets' leadoff hitter undergone such a startling
base-stealing transformation?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's Rickey time,'' he told a member of the Mets' family.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rickey time'' is October, or more precisely post-season games
in October. ``Rickey's a big-game player,'' said Steve Phillips,
the Mets' general manager.
</P>
<P>
   Though he cannot be mistaken for the man known as Mr. October,
Henderson nevertheless has invited coverage by as much mustard as
Reggie Jackson ever required. But while Jackson invited the ire of
others for his often pompous proclamations, Henderson has induced
consternation among his managers and teammates for his periodic
slowdowns.
</P>
<P>
   All they can do in those instances is shrug and say weakly,
``That's Rickey.'' But this is Rickey, too:
</P>
<P>
   Game 1: walk, stolen base, run; walk, stolen base.
</P>
<P>
   Game 2: single, stolen base, run; single, stolen base; walk,
stolen base.
</P>
<P>
   In the 7-1 loss in the second game, Henderson was the Mets'
offense, setting records for stolen bases in a division series game
and in a division series.
</P>
<P>
   ``He played two of the best games the last two that I've seen
him play and he's had a great year,'' Bobby Valentine, the Mets'
manager, said Thursday. ``I've seen Rickey play his entire career
and I don't know if he's ever played better start to finish, but in
those last two he was a force to be reckoned with.''
</P>
<P>
   Henderson's performance is no coincidence, Valentine added. ``He
enjoys the spotlight,'' the manager added. ``When it's on, he's
on.''
</P>
<P>
   Teammates of the 40-year-old left fielder readily agree.
``That's Rickey,'' Darryl Hamilton said. ``I can honestly say he
loves this. He loves the fact that he's in New York and the media
attention is high. He thrives on that. He's a different ballplayer
when it comes to the playoffs. He's unusual. Some guys don't like
the pressure, all the attention, but he does.''
</P>
<P>
   While the Mets can appreciate Henderson's post-season effort and
benefit from it, Kelly Stinnett, the Diamondbacks' catcher, has to
deal with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rickey is the greatest base stealer of all-time,'' he said.
``He's so good at anticipating. It seems like he knows when we're
throwing a breaking ball, and that's when he runs. When that
happens, I've got no chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Stinnett was hopeful that he would get help in Games 3 and 4 at
Shea Stadium on Friday and Saturday. Arizona will start two-left
handed pitchers, Omar Daal and Brian Anderson, who Stinnett said
are proficient at holding runners on.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have to keep Rickey close because he gets such great
jumps,'' Stinnett said. ``He times the pitchers. The pitcher just
flinches and he's gone. The thing with Rickey is, you know he's
going to get his bags. You just have to make it as hard as you can
for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Henderson's performance is nothing new. Baseball's
career-leading base stealer, he had 25 stolen bases in his previous
post-season appearances covering three World Series, five league
championship series and two division series.
</P>
<P>
   His most noteworthy series was the league playoff for Oakland
against Toronto in 1989. He had a total of eight steals in four of
the five games, including four in Game 2, and in the one game in
which he didn't steal he hit two home runs and drove in four runs.
</P>
<P>
   Because the Mets were losing the second game in Arizona from the
third inning on, Henderson played it straight. The night before,
however, he was at his impish best. After he stole second in the
third inning, he took a giant step toward the mound, toying with
the humorless Randy Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   He later said he was just ``trying to scare him a little bit.''
This, he added, is ``just a fun time of year.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Rickey definitely has personality,'' Valentine said, ``and he
has a style that's all Rickey.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically we have a bunch of guys who are workmen-like, who go
about their business in a rather professional way but also without
much flamboyancy. Rickey has brought a balancing act to that.''
</P>
<P>
   But Henderson doesn't always make it fun for his managers,
confounding them with his inexplicable slowdowns. Two weeks ago in
Atlanta, Henderson was on first base with the Mets leading, 2-1,
when Edgardo Alfonzo lashed a double to left field. First,
Henderson coasted into third instead of running hard and possibly
scoring. Then he ignored the coach's stop sign and decided he would
try to score. He didn't; he was thrown out.
</P>
<P>
   In August, he had another incident in which he didn't run hard,
that time on a fly ball off the left-field fence leading off the
ninth inning. Had he run from the start, he might have had a triple
and more easily scored the tying run. But he had to stop at second
and never moved from there as the Mets lost.
</P>
<P>
   Mookie Wilson, the Mets' first base coach, was asked after
Henderson's five-for-five performance if he could explain what
makes Rickey run.
</P>
<P>
   ``He goes when he feels like it,'' Wilson said. ``I don't know
what goes through Rickey's mind. I don't know why he does what he
does.''

RED SOX, SABERHAGEN LOSE CONTROL, FALL TO INDIANS
</HEADLINE>
 SOX-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND _ The Cleveland Indians, possessors of the best lineup
in the land, usually don't need much help when it comes to scoring
runs.
</P>
<P>
   Generally, the outfit that scored 1,009 runs during the regular
season _ the best in baseball since 1950 _ is quite capable of
doing damage. Give us your best stuff, they snarl, and we'll shove
it down your throat.
</P>
<P>
   In Game 2 of the American League Division Series, though, they
received aid from an unlikely source as they pounded the Boston Red
Sox, 11-1, Thursday at Jacobs Field.
</P>
<P>
   Red Sox starter Bret Saberhagen's normally impeccable control
deserted him, and the Indians parlayed three walks into a six-run
third inning that started the rout. Omar Vizquel drove in two of
the runs with a triple and Harold Baines hit a three-run homer.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the pitcher is not having a good day and makes mistakes,
chances are he's going to pay for it,'' said Indians third baseman
Travis Fryman, who drew the first walk.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians also made reliever John Wasdin pay for his three
walks in the fourth inning when they scored five more runs, four of
them on a grand slam by Jim Thome. That was more than enough
support for starter Charles Nagy, who held the Red Sox to one run
in seven innings.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians took a 2-0 lead in the best-of-five series, and are
one victory away from advancing to the American League Championship
Series for the fourth time in the past five years. The Red Sox,
meanwhile, face elimination as the series resumes Saturday in
Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not done yet,'' Red Sox manager Jimy Williams said.
``It's not over yet.''
</P>
<P>
   There were suggestions that it was over when Red Sox ace Pedro
Martinez left after four innings of Game 1 because of a strained
muscle in his back, allowing the Indians to rally for a victory.
</P>
<P>
   Williams reminded everyone before Game 2, though, that his team
still was in it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got Saberhagen going,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He wasn't just whistling in a graveyard. Saberhagen was 10-6
with a 2.95 earned-run average and would have ranked second in the
league in ERA, behind Martinez, if he had pitched enough innings to
qualify.
</P>
<P>
   What made Saberhagen so good this season was his control. He did
not walk a batter in 14 of his 22 starts, and walked only 11
batters in 119 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Fryman drew walk No. 12 to lead off the third, and after Sandy
Alomar hit into a force play that would have been a double play if
not for Jose Offerman's high throw to first base _ Kenny Lofton got
No. 13.
</P>
<P>
   Being a control pitcher means more than just throwing strikes.
It's also putting the ball where you want to in the strike zone,
and Saberhagen didn't do that either. He threw a fat pitch that
Vizquel pulled just out of the reach of right-fielder Trot Nixon
for a triple that scored Alomar and Lofton and gave the Indians a
2-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Roberto Alomar, the next batter, got a high fastball that he
pulled to right for a double that scored Vizquel. After Manny
Ramirez flied out, Saberhagen issued the third walk of the inning,
this one to Thome.
</P>
<P>
   Baines then went to the plate expecting a fastball, and he got
one on the first pitch. It was down, but over the middle of the
plate, and Baines hit it into the seats for a three-run homer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just didn't make some pitches when I had to,'' Saberhagen
said. ``Walking three guys in a game, that's not me and that's what
really hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   What really hurts is going to Boston with a two-game deficit
against the most prolific offense in the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``The momentum is going our way, but by no means are they going
to lay down and die,'' Thome said. ``We've got to still be focused
and just try to wrap it up.'' nn

CORNELL TO RECEIVE $100 MILLION GIFT 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By KAREN W. ARENSON    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   An anonymous donor has pledged $100 million to help Cornell
University revamp undergraduate housing, Cornell's president,
Hunter R. Rawlings III, is to announce Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Cornell has already embarked on a plan to build two dormitories
for freshmen and bring all its freshmen together on its North
Campus. The new gift will help Cornell turn its sights to housing
for the rest of its undergraduates and the creation of what it
calls a ``living-learning community'' for them on its West Campus.
</P>
<P>
   Cornell hopes to improve undergraduate education and to
integrate its white students and its minority students more fully.
Over the past two decades, the West Campus of Cornell became
occupied mostly by white students, while the other part, the North
Campus, attracted many of the school's minority students.
</P>
<P>
   The Ithaca, N.Y., university hoped to bridge some of those
racial and ethnic divisions by grouping its first-year students
together. That plan, announced in 1997, is also aimed at making the
dormitories a more explicit part of the educational process _ by
holding seminars in a dormitory, for example _ following a pattern
used by other universities, including Harvard and Yale.
</P>
<P>
   The anonymous gift is expected to cover about half of the cost
of the new dormitories.
</P>
<P>
   It is the second $100 million gift Cornell has received. Last
year, Sanford and Joan Weill pledged $100 million to support
Cornell's medical school, which was renamed the Weill Medical
College. It was among the two dozen largest gifts to higher
education.
</P>
<P>
   The housing changes are part of Cornell's effort to make
undergraduate education a priority amid criticism that research
universities put graduate students first. Cornell plans to invest
$500 million in programs and financial aid for undergraduates.
</P>
<P>
   Rawlings is also to announce that the university has raised $136
million of the $150 million it needs to have by Dec. 31 to earn a
$50 million matching grant. The money will be used for scholarships
and to maintain Cornell's ``need-blind'' admissions policy, under
which students are admitted without regard to financial need and
then provided with the financial support they need to attend the
college. &QL;

 By ADAM NAGOURNEY and STEVEN GREENHOUSE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ President Clinton came to New York Thursday to pay
tribute to two political constituencies that had proved central to
his electoral success _ labor unions and gay rights advocates _ and
now loom as critical to the political future of Clinton's wife and
his vice president.
</P>
<P>
   In the course of two hours, and in the space of two city blocks,
Clinton spoke at a dinner in honor of James P. Hoffa, the president
of the teamsters' union, and moved on to a fund-raiser for New
York's most prominent gay rights group, the Empire State Pride
Agenda. In both places, Clinton drew an exuberant reaction from
audiences that have, as often as not, been viewed as a political
liability by candidates and officeholders over the past 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank you for making New York the biggest, strongest union
city in America,'' Clinton declared to the cheers of labor leaders.
And when Clinton mentioned the guest of honor's name, he was
overwhelmed by shouts of ``Hoffa, Hoffa, Hoffa!''
</P>
<P>
   Labor and gay rights organizations have proved to be reliable
parts of Clinton's political base. But given the extent to which
those groups have been the subject of Republican attack over the
past 10 years, Clinton's appearances suggest the freedom he feels
as he approaches the end of his second term, and his evident
interest in helping Vice President Al Gore, who is running for
president, and Hillary Rodham Clinton, who is all but running for
the Senate from New York.
</P>
<P>
   After Clinton left the dinner, Hoffa told the audience, ``I got
a good idea speaking to the president: Why don't we all get
together and back Hillary Clinton as senator for the state of New
York?''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's appearance at the Hilton Hotel at the tribute to Hoffa
was the first time that a president had appeared so publicly with
the much investigated teamsters' union since Franklin D. Roosevelt
spoke at one of its conventions more than 50 years ago. Clinton
drew cheers from the audience as he shook hands with Hoffa, who has
been a leading opponent of an immediate endorsement of Gore in the
presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things that I wanted to do when the vice president
and I came into office was to change the way that America thought
about labor,'' Clinton said. ``I was so sick and tired of more than
a decade of people trying to make unions the whipping boy of
whatever it was that was wrong with America.''
</P>
<P>
   One issue of particular concern to his labor audience was the
North American Free Trade Agreement and its call to allow Mexican
trucks to drive freely in the United States. Clinton indicated that
he shared their concern because American officials have found that
two-thirds of Mexican trucks are not safe.
</P>
<P>
   From there, Clinton moved a block west to the annual dinner of
the Empire State Pride Agenda at the Sheraton. Clinton is one of
several candidates who have, over the years, turned to gay rights
organizations for campaign contributions. But in this case, the
president was the draw rather than beneficiary of a dinner that
organizers said would raise $1 million for lobbying and political
candidates sympathetic to gay rights.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's speech to the Empire State Pride Agenda was his third
appearance as president in a public setting before a gay rights
group. His attendance was testimony to the growing influence of gay
voters in New York elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``At our second annual dinner, we were wondering if David
Dinkins would show up,'' said Jeff Sorof, the co-chairman of the
organization, referring to New York's former mayor. ``This is quite
a change.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also did what he typically does on his frequent visits
to New York: raise money for the Democratic Party. In this case, he
was the featured speaker at a fund-raiser Thursday for the
Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee.
</P>
<P>
   The president appeared in New York alone. Mrs. Clinton was in
Italy. Gore was in New York, but he and Clinton did not cross
paths.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton attended the dinner for Hoffa just four days before the
AFL-CIO, which includes the teamsters, holds a convention in Los
Angeles, where several union leaders are urging an endorsement of
Gore over Bill Bradley, the former senator from New Jersey. It is
far from certain that Gore's supporters can command the two-thirds
majority needed to endorse him.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffa has urged other labor leaders to hold off on an
endorsement to see whether the administration will give assurances
on trade barriers and other matters. Among Hoffa's concerns is
persuading the government to end its decade-long supervision of the
union, which has been imposed to end corruption.
</P>
<P>
   The dinner was sponsored by the Labor Research Association, a
consulting group that advises unions. For decades, presidents have
shied away from the union because of its history of corruption. But
federal officials said that the 1.4 million-member union is
significantly cleaner after a decade of supervision.

LAKERS' SALLEY GLAD TO BE BACK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA BARBARA _ John Salley didn't have to come back to this.
The ice bags, the medical tape, the sweat, the aches and bruises.
But listen to the unretired 10-year NBA veteran, and it's clear he
needs this.
</P>
<P>
   ``I should have never left, this feels so good,'' Salley said
Thursday, after a morning practice at UC Santa Barbara.
</P>
<P>
   Three years after retiring, three championship rings on his
hand, Salley is back in training camp, a partially guaranteed
contract in hand as he tries to win a roster spot with the Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   A budding television career could have supported Salley, but it
failed to satisfy him. Returning to the court was surprisingly
easy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's second nature,'' he said. ``I feel like Mike Tyson, right
out of prison _ about to beat somebody's butt.''
</P>
<P>
   The jovial 6-foot-11 forward lets out a big laugh. But he turns
serious when it's suggested that, at 35 years old, long past his
glory years with the Detroit Pistons and Chicago Bulls, he might be
a long shot to make this team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a long shot,'' he said. ``There's only two guys on
this team that ever ran the triangle offense _ me and A.C. (Green).
I'm a close-shot. I can bring a lot to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Salley has an intimate understanding of coach Phil Jackson's
system, having played for him in 1995-96. He also can play power
forward and center, positions where the Lakers are thin. A
stringent Tae Bo regiment has kept him in good shape. Only the
Lakers' crowded roster poses a potential obstacle.
</P>
<P>
   But bet on Salley sticking _ and making an impact on the Lakers'
young stars. He's already giving daily advice to 21-year-old Kobe
Bryant and 27-year-old Shaquille O'Neal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to be close to Kobe, hopefully save him 10 maybe 12
years on his game,'' he said. ``Every day I teach Shaq a new
trick.... all that Kevin McHale stuff he terrorized me with.''
</P>
<P>
   Salley lobbied Del Harris for a tryout last season, but the
lockout-shortened season wasn't conducive to a comeback. He had
offers from Vancouver and the Pistons but wanted a shot at a fourth
championship _ and the chance to be the first player in history to
win titles with three teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``I even went to a Laker game one time and sat on the court and
watched, (and thought) `This is where I need to be,''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   So he's left behind his NBA on NBC gig and his role as host of
the family game show, ``I Can't Believe You Said That,'' trading
suit-and-tie for a practice jersey.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what I want to do, this is what I've been doing since
I was 6 years old,'' he said. ``There's a great movie called
`Sunset Boulevard,' and she said, `It's not a comeback, it's a
return.' That's what I'm looking at. I'm ready for my close-up.''
</P>
<P>
   UC-ya: This is the Lakers' second training camp at UCSB in the
last 10 months, and it's probably their last here period.
</P>
<P>
   Lakers owner Jerry Buss would like to return to Hawaii, while
Jackson is leaning toward El Segundo _ site of the team's new
practice facility, still under construction. Jackson's Bulls
trained in Chicago at the team's Berto Center, and he'd like to
follow suit here.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson prefers his players take about a month off, then train
the rest of the summer at the team's facility, under supervision of
team trainers. Staying home for training camp provides continuity
for Jackson's offseason program.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've held out the enticement of going to Hawaii, and I just
said, no, I don't know if Hawaii is the right spot for us,'' he
said. ``We'll see how we do this year, if we have a great year.''

TROOPER IN SHOOTING SUES STATE, SAYING HE WAS UNFIT FOR DUTY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: N.J.)   (af)  
 By PAUL ZIELBAUER 
  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. _ In an unusual legal tack, a state trooper
charged with attempted murder in a shooting during a routine
traffic stop on the New Jersey Turnpike last year is suing the
state and his commanders for allowing him to work even though, he
claims, he was emotionally unfit for duty.
</P>
<P>
   The civil suit, filed on Sept. 28 by the trooper, James Kenna,
seeks to place responsibility for the shooting with his superior
officers. The suit says that Kenna's commanders and the force's
physician negligently allowed him to work on the day of the
shooting even though he was still scarred by ``severe psychological
trauma'' from another turnpike confrontation one month earlier. The
suit was first reported in Thursday's Star-Ledger of Newark.
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 7, a grand jury indicted Kenna, 28, and fellow trooper
John Hogan, 29, on charges of attempted murder and assault. The
indictment accused the two troopers, who are both white, of firing
11 bullets into the van, which was carrying four black and Hispanic
men, all unarmed, at a traffic stop near Washington Township on
April 23, 1998. Three of the men in the van were injured.
</P>
<P>
   The troopers have repeatedly said that their fusillade was
justified because the van had begun rolling backward toward them,
forcing them to fire to protect their lives.
</P>
<P>
   But in his civil suit in state superior court here, Kenna seems
to back away from that claim, recasting his role in the shooting as
a result of emotional instability caused, he said, by an assault he
suffered on March 18.
</P>
<P>
   On that day, according to the suit, during a routine traffic
stop on the turnpike, Kenna was knocked to the ground by one of a
stopped vehicle's passengers, who then climbed into the police
cruiser and tried to drive over him. When Kenna tried to fire his
gun at the suspect, the suit claims, the weapon jammed.
</P>
<P>
   In the days after the incident, Kenna experienced psychological
trauma, the suit alleges, although it does not give any examples of
his behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Subsequent examinations by state police doctors, which are
required after such incidents, found him fit for duty, the suit
says. Their failure to diagnose severe mental stress ``created a
reasonably foreseeable risk,'' according to the suit, that he would
use his gun again ``if confronted with a potentially threatening
situation.''
</P>
<P>
   The state attorney general's office said it received a copy of
the lawsuit Wednesday, but would not comment on it.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Arseneault, the lawyer defending Kenna against the state's
criminal charges, said he had no role in his client's civil suit
and would not comment Thursday, except to say that his client had
filed the suit on his own behalf. Hogan's lawyer, Robert
Galantucci, also declined to discuss the suit.
</P>
<P>
   Kenna's civil suit, known as a cross claim, is typically
employed by defendants seeking to deflect court-imposed monetary
claims onto a third party, like the defendant's employer, said
Frank Askin, a law professor at Rutgers University Law School. ``It
would protect him against a financial judgment,'' Askin said.
``It's a perfectly appropriate procedural device.''
</P>
<P>
   The two troopers, who have been suspended without pay since
April, face civil suits filed by the three wounded passengers from
the van.
</P>
<P>
   Other lawyers said it was unusual for a defendant in a criminal
indictment to try to shift blame to an employer though a civil
claim.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems to me their versions are changing,'' said Wayne D.
Greenfeder, a lawyer representing Rayshawn Brown, 22, one of the
men injured in the van shooting last year. ``Originally they said
the shooting was totally justified. Now it seems like he's trying
to say that the shooting was caused at least in part by the state,
for allowing him to remain a trooper with a gun.''

VAJPAYEE'S INDIA 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times says in an editorial Friday, Oct. 8: &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee of India has won an
impressive election victory that gives his coalition a chance to
survive longer than recent governments in New Delhi. Stability
would be a welcome development after a succession of inconclusive
elections and short-lived ruling coalitions, including Vajpayee's,
which collapsed in April. No less encouraging is his promise to
revive negotiations with Pakistan, speed economic liberalization
and refrain from steps hostile to Muslims and other minorities.
Progress on these fronts should make the world breathe easier and
clear the way for President Clinton to visit next year.
</P>
<P>
   Vajpayee's triumph was helped along by a growing economy and the
voters' yearning for an end to unsettled governments. Voters also
appear to have been impressed by his confident but restrained
handling of the intrusion of Pakistani-backed militants in the
disputed state of Kashmir during the summer. Indian forces repulsed
the invaders without widening the conflict, while Indian diplomats
got the United States and other countries to press Pakistan for the
militants' withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of reducing regional tensions needs immediate
attention. India and Pakistan, which both exploded nuclear devices
last year, must quickly fulfill their commitment to signing the
nuclear test ban treaty and try to reach agreements on curbing
missile testing and producing nuclear materials. They also need to
resume discussions on preventing the Kashmir dispute from spinning
into a wider war.
</P>
<P>
   As 360 million Indians voted over the last month, the world's
largest and most fractious democracy once again set a stirring
example for all nations. For Vajpayee, the victory was more
precarious than he might have wished. His Bharatiya Janata Party
actually lost seats in India's most populous state, Uttar Pradesh,
a longtime party stronghold. But he can savor the vote as a gesture
of confidence in his leadership. He is now the first Indian prime
minister to win back-to-back elections since Indira Gandhi in 1971.
He has also managed to rid his party of some of its Hindu
chauvinist reputation by agreeing not to institute the party's most
virulent anti-Muslim measures.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the election dealt a significant defeat to the
Congress Party, which had turned to Sonia Gandhi, the
daughter-in-law of Indira and widow of former Prime Minister Rajiv
Gandhi. Mrs. Gandhi had been drafted to help save the party, but
after stirring up some initial excitement, she stumbled.
</P>
<P>
   India's rich diversity sometimes looks like an obstacle to
unity. But the latest election has proved that a commitment to
resolving differences peacefully and democratically can transform
diversity into a source of strength.

SHAQ CARRIES EVEN MORE BAGGAGE NOW
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA BARBARA _ Assists are going to be a bigger part of
Shaquille O'Neal's game this season. First-year Lakers coach Phil
Jackson has made that clear.
</P>
<P>
   So maybe the 7-foot center was simply practicing on reporters
the other day, feeding us the same way he'll feed Kobe Bryant and
Glen Rice come the start of the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what he did during his summer vacation, O'Neal could have
said he acquainted himself with the triangle offense that Jackson
is installing with the help of its architect, Tex Winter.
</P>
<P>
   He might have said he spent long afternoons in the gym shooting
free throws.
</P>
<P>
   He could have fleshed out the weight regimen that has added
obvious definition to his arms, which already were bigger around
than any Laker girl's waist.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, O'Neal flicked his critics an easy story angle, the
journalistic equivalent of a fast-break pass, as if daring us to
run with it. He said he didn't bone up on the triangle offense,
didn't concentrate on his free-throw shooting, didn't change his
diet, didn't do much except ``lift a lot of weights and chill
out.''
</P>
<P>
   He was either being disarmingly honest or disingenuous.
</P>
<P>
   Whether he was telling the truth or merely telling his critics
what he thought we'd write, anyway, the result was a slam dunk.
O'Neal cast himself in an unfavorable light, pumped-up pecs and
all.
</P>
<P>
   The muscle definition in O'Neal's arms is the first thing his
teammates noticed when they reconvened earlier this week. ``His
arms are definitely bigger,'' said forward Rick Fox. ``It's crazy
to think he got stronger.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, it's downright foolhardly. Jackson asked O'Neal to slim
down specifically because the 30 pounds the player has put on since
turning pro places extra stress on the back and knees and invites
nagging injuries.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal's rationale was as long as he added muscle, his weight
was immaterial.
</P>
<P>
   His joints will see about that. Muscle, fat, it's all just
pounds to them. If they could speak, they'd surely say, ``Lighten
up, Shaq!''
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal lost 54 games to injuries in his first three seasons with
the Lakers. It doesn't take a coaching genius to recognize O'Neal
is no good to the team in street clothes.
</P>
<P>
   You also don't have to be class valedictorian to figure out if
you prepare for the college boards, the actual exam isn't likely to
be as overwhelming.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that the triangle offense is supposedly harder to
grasp than advanced trigonometry. O'Neal said he didn't see any
reason to study the preparatory packet Jackson mailed to every
Laker.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basketball is basketball,'' O'Neal said. ``It really can't be
that hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, yes, and free throws are designed to be pretty easy, too.
O'Neal is shooting 53.6 percent from the foul line in his NBA
career, but he claimed not to have lost any sweat over it this
summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me it's just a concentration thing,'' O'Neal said. ``It's
a fact I'm not a good free-throw shooter. If you want to write
about that, go ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   The thing is, it's not as though lapses of concentration are a
kind of chronic illness. They can be treated, through repetition
and resolve. Dodgers shortstop Mark Grudzielanek wasn't a very good
defensive shortstop in 1998. Rather than throw up his hands in
defeat, he sought the help of former ballplayer Bucky Dent over the
winter and his fielding was vastly improved this year.
</P>
<P>
   We know questions about his free-throw shooting must be a pain
for O'Neal to field over and over and over.
</P>
<P>
   But the more he acts as though he doesn't care, the harder
O'Neal's free-throw shooting is to ignore. Some of his teammates
think with Shaq it's just that, an act. They believe he did more
over the summer than he's letting on.
</P>
<P>
   For example, O'Neal never let slip that he placed a telephone
call to Detroit _ to Larry Drew, who helped teach the triangle
offense to the Lakers' summer league team.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's his free-throw technique, which has looked better
in the first couple of practices.
</P>
<P>
   And for all of O'Neal's jokes about dreaming of Krispy Kreme
doughnuts, he left a table of the glazed goodies untouched during
media day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shaq seems to be learning the art of war,'' Fox said, smiling
slyly. ``Deflect attention from yourself. Don't let people know
what you're doing. For a person like him who lives in a fishbowl,
that's good.''
</P>
<P>
   If O'Neal thought the scrutiny was suffocating in his first
three seasons in L.A., he hasn't experienced anything yet. The
hiring of Jackson raised expectations and reduced the number of
scapegoats to a solitary one.
</P>
<P>
   If the Lakers don't win at least 60 games and battle San Antonio
and Portland for Western Conference supremacy, O'Neal will take
more abuse from the public than he does nightly in the paint from
opponents. He'll have to absorb more hurtful shots than he did last
year for his fourth-quarter disappearing acts and ghastly foul
shooting and stubborn insistence on shooting despite being double-
and triple-teamed.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal didn't fall out of the Brinks truck just yesterday. He
has to understand this season _ his eighth in the league _ will go
a long way toward sculpting his legacy. He had three months to mold
himself in the image Jackson prescribed for him, to get ready for
his career close-up.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson wanted O'Neal to come to camp weighing considerably less
than the 335 pounds he was carrying at the start of last season.
O'Neal showed up a bulked-up 340 and blithely announced, ``I'm
ready to be real receptive to what Phil's saying.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, better late than never. If Jackson didn't comprehend the
breadth of the challenge he was taking on when he accepted the job
in June, he surely does now. &QL;

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dr. Harold Varmus, the Nobel Prize-winning molecular biologist
who has presided over the National Institutes of Health during the
greatest expansion in its 112-year history, told President Clinton
on Thursday that he would resign at the end of the year to become
president and chief executive of Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer
Center in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   When he left the University of California at San Francisco to go
to Washington six years ago, Varmus had never run anything larger
than a research laboratory. His tenure at the NIH was blessed by a
good economy and an explosion in biomedical research, and he took
advantage of both to persuade Congress to increase the agency's
budget vastly, to nearly $15.6 billion this year from $10.3 billion
in 1993, with a $2 billion increase last year alone.
</P>
<P>
   At Sloan-Kettering, Varmus, 59, will meet entirely new
challenges. He is a basic scientist _ he won ``the Prize,'' as he
calls it, in 1989 for the discovery of a family of cancer-causing
genes.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, he will be forced to face something perhaps even
more intractable than a divided Congress: a rapidly evolving payer
system in which managed care, so far mostly disdained by the
hospital, rules. He will now also find himself dealing with
insurance payment contracts and market share wars.
</P>
<P>
   The appointment of Varmus suggests that Memorial Sloan-Kettering
is hoping to move in a new direction. Its president, Dr. Paul
Marks, 73, who is retiring, developed the center's research base,
but now, its directors say, they hope to merge that research better
with cancer treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Varmus was selected foremost for his clinical talents, said Dr.
William Hoskins, the deputy physician-in-chief of disease
management at Sloan-Kettering, who served on the search committee.
``Most of us in cancer realize the time is ripe to begin the
process of bringing the lab to the bedside,'' he said. ``I think he
has the vision to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent years many area hospitals have elbowed their way into
cancer care, drawing on a huge base of patients who increasingly
must pay for their treatment under programs of health maintenance
organizations. Marks, who often hobnobbed with famous donors and
patients, has shown little interest in this issue, focusing instead
on the development of the center's research arm and endowment.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Thursday, Varmus said that while he had mixed
emotions about leaving the NIH, he was ready for a change after six
years of government work. ``I wanted to run another organization,''
he said, ``and be in a position to see the fruits of 25 or 30 years
of cancer research in the lab come to fulfillment.''
</P>
<P>
   When Donna Shalala, the secretary of health and human services,
suggested Varmus for the NIH director's job, what most people knew
about him was that he had won the Nobel Prize, that he wore rumpled
clothes (he still does) and rode his bicycle 12 miles to work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people didn't know if he had the temperament to do the
political work, because it's an enormously political job,'' said
Dr. Herbert Pardes, dean of the College of Physicians and Surgeons
at Columbia University. ``I think he outperformed the most
optimistic expectations that anybody had.''
</P>
<P>
   He is credited with lifting flagging morale among scientists,
both inside and outside the agency, by recruiting some of the best
minds in academia to the NIH.
</P>
<P>
   And Varmus proved himself an adroit politician, keeping a low
profile as he navigated such tricky ethical issues as the
still-unsettled question of whether the government should pay for
research on human embryonic stem cells.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement Thursday, Shalala said Varmus' appointment to NIH
was ``one of the greatest accomplishments of this administration.''
</P>
<P>
   Varmus told the directors of the NIH that he was leaving during
a staff meeting Thursday morning. The meeting was emotional, said
Dr. Richard Klausner, director of the National Cancer Institute.
``There was a sense of the passing of an era, an era about which we
all feel very good.''
</P>
<P>
   But there was not universal approval of Varmus' leadership.
Patient advocacy groups often complained that with his interest in
basic science, Varmus did not pay enough attention to their needs
and complained bitterly at his refusal to finance research on
specific diseases. Varmus' philosophy was that ``a rising tide
lifts all boats.'' He believed that an understanding of how cells
work and other matters of human biology would lead to discoveries
in all diseases.
</P>
<P>
   ``The message out of NIH to the disease groups always seemed to
be, `Well, everything we do here benefits everything,' '' said
William Schmidt, a spokesman for the Juvenile Diabetes Foundation.
``Of course, that was very difficult for people to buy. It just
didn't sell well with our constituency.''
</P>
<P>
   And it also did not sell well with the Institute of Medicine, an
independent research arm of the National Academy of Sciences. In a
report last year, the Institute criticized the NIH for not paying
enough attention to patients and urged the federal health agency to
more systematically consider the deaths and suffering caused by
specific diseases when setting its research priorities.
</P>
<P>
   At Memorial Sloan-Kettering, Varmus will be greeted
enthusiastically, said Dr. Raymond Warrell Jr., an attending
physician and member of Sloan-Kettering.
</P>
<P>
   ``The clinical staff is hugely excited,'' he said. ``The biggest
challenge is to integrate basic science programs to the direct care
of patients with cancer as quickly as possible. It is a challenge
that many cancer centers have faced and the fact that he faced them
on a national level is a huge plus.''

ASTROS INTENT ON KEEPING CHIPPER JONES IN CHECK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICHIE WHITT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Learning from the recent mistakes of manager Bobby
Valentine and his New York Mets, the Houston Astros are determined
not to let Atlanta Braves third baseman Chipper Jones beat them.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he hits a bad pitch, we'll tip our hat to him,'' Astros
pitching coach Vern Ruhle said. ``But he's not going to see a lot
of fastballs across the heart of the plate if we can help it.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones burned the Mets by hitting four home runs in a key
three-game sweep that helped the Braves clinch the National League
East title. In the first two games against the Astros, he has one
hit and has walked three times.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's getting a little frustrating because I'm not even getting
strikes on 3-0,'' said Jones, whom the Astros even walked to load
the bases in Game 1 in order to face cleanup hitter Ryan Klesko.
``I've got to be patient and wait for my spots. We've got too many
good hitters for them to pitch around me every time. Sooner or
later they'll pitch to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe not.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing we don't want to do is let Chipper beat us because
he's proven all year to team that he will do it,'' Ruhle said.
Football fever Although they are in the midst of a playoff series,
the Astros were bumped to almost a footnote in the frenzied
aftermath of Houston getting an NFL team.
</P>
<P>
   Energy billionaire Bob McNair went to the NFL owners meetings in
Atlanta and brought back an expansion franchise. All the Astros
brought home from Atlanta was a 1-1 split.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's great for the city,'' Astros second basemen Craig Biggio
said. ``It was a real shame for these fans when the Oilers left.
They deserve better than that.''
</P>
<P>
   The new Houston team will play in a $310 million stadium being
built next to the Astrodome, giving the city two retractable-roof
stadiums by 2002. The Astros will move into downtown Enron Stadium,
also with an adjustable ceiling, next April. BRIEFLY
</P>
<P>
   _ Though almost 3,000 tickets remained late Thursday afternoon,
the Astros expect a sellout of almost 60,000 on Friday. ``It was
kind of a shame to see all those empty seats in Atlanta,'' said
Astros third baseman Ken Caminiti, referring to the 10,000
vacancies in Games 1 and 2 at Turner Field. ``I expect this house
to be full and rockin'.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Loud or not, the Braves don't exactly fear the Astrodome.
Atlanta is 39-16 in Houston since 1991, including 3-1 this season.
</P>
<P>
   _ Astros Outfielder Derek Bell, who had only 12 home runs and 66
runs batted in, might get a start against left-handed Tom Glavine
on Friday after sitting out the first two games in favor of Daryle
Ward. nn

CONGRESS AND WHITE HOUSE COMPROMISE ON ELEMENTS OF SPENDING
MEASURE
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ADDS first 4 grafs with compromise; SUBS headline, ELIMINATES
clause from 7th graf) 
(ATTN: Fla.)  (rk) 
 By TIM WEINER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In the first sign of a break in a bitter standoff,
the White House and Congress compromised on changes in a $82
billion spending bill Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   The talks between President Clinton's budget number-crunchers
and members of Congress on a bill for veterans, housing, space
exploration and other agencies led to additions of 60,000 housing
vouchers for working-class families, $100 million for NASA and $115
million for business enterprise zones and community development
programs.
</P>
<P>
   That money would be offset by cuts in housing and urban
development programs.
</P>
<P>
   A White House official called the talks ``the first significant
development'' in what has been a dialogue of the deaf between
President Clinton and Republicans in Congress over nearly $600
billion in spending bills. The talks lifted the president's veto
threat and appeared r the air for future negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   In the midst of its budget battles, Congress has found the money
for seven luxury aircraft for the Pentagon's top commanders.
</P>
<P>
   The cost of obtaining and operating the aircraft over 20 years
comes to about $1 billion, according to the Pentagon, which never
formally requested the funds.
</P>
<P>
   A Pentagon spending bill allows the military buy a 737-300
jetliner and lease six smaller executive-class Gulfstream V jets to
ferry top commanders from base to base, said senior members of the
House Appropriations Committee's defense panel.
</P>
<P>
   The cost of leasing the Gulfstream jets is about $50 million a
year. They would serve the nation's nine top-ranking military
commanders-in-chief, eight of whom are based in the United States.
They now are flown in Boeing 707s. The cost of buying the 737,
which seats 126, is $63 million. It is for Marine Corps Gen.
Anthony Zinni and his successors at Central Command, which has
headquarters in Tampa, Fla., and is responsible for the Middle
East.
</P>
<P>
   No one in Congress was sure Thursday exactly how much money is
in the Pentagon spending bill for the 2000 fiscal year, although it
appears to be about $268 billion, not counting a separately
approved $1.8 billion military pay raise. That would be an increase
of more than $17 billion over the 1999 fiscal year, the biggest
such spending boost for the military in 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   Senior House and Senate negotiators approved the Pentagon bill
in a closed-door conference on Wednesday night. But their
colleagues were still requesting that money be added to the bill on
Wednesday afternoon, and their aides were still writing the bill
this evening.
</P>
<P>
   The two most senior House members at the conference, Rep. Jerry
Lewis, R-Calif., and John Murtha, D- Pa., said Thursday the bill
included $467 million for further research and development of the
Army's Comanche helicopter, which has been plagued by cost overruns
and technical problems and is on course to become the most
expensive helicopter in history.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a question whether that baby can fly,'' Lewis said. The
Comanche program _ a $37 billion project to build 1,292 helicopters
_ will consume more than half of the Army's budget for aircraft
when the aircraft start rolling off the assembly line nine years
from now, the Army concedes.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis and Murtha confirmed that the Senate majority leader,
Trent Lott of Mississippi, had convinced the House to add $375
million for an aircraft carrier to be built in his home state. ``We
try to take care of leadership whenever we can,'' Murtha said.
</P>
<P>
   Murtha said the Air Force would never be able to build 339 F-22
jet fighters, as it plans. The House-Senate conference approved
$2.5 billion in research and development funds for the aircraft,
but insisted that prototypes pass stringent flight tests before the
$200 million jet goes into full production.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not ever going to build the numbers they want to
build,'' said Murtha. ``They'll be lucky if they'll be able to get
two wings _ that's about 140 airplanes.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon wants to build three new types of fighter jets _
the F-22, the Joint Strike Fighter and an improved F-18 _ at a
total cost of $350 billion. Murtha described this as ``a $350
billion problem'' that cannot be solved without cutting costs or
dramatically increasing military spending.
</P>
<P>
   ``These prices are outrageous,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from the $17 billion increase for the Pentagon, many of
the other spending bills for government agencies are being cut or
frozen by Congress. The military spending increase, combined with
caps, or spending limits, enacted in 1997, is creating intense
pressure for Congress to dip into surplus Social Security funds,
which it has pledged to protect, in order to finance government
agencies.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Republicans are now weighing new across-the-board spending cuts
in domestic programs to protect the Social Security surplus.
</P>
<P>
   About $7 billion in the Pentagon bill will be designated as
``emergency spending'' to evade the caps. Congress also has put the
emergency label, usually reserved for wars and natural disasters,
on $8.7 billion in agricultural aid and $4.5 billion to finance the
2000 census. That technically takes those billions off the books,
but the money has to come from somewhere _ arguably, the Social
Security surplus.
</P>
<P>
   Aware of that argument, congressional aides said that the
``emergency'' designation for the census appropriation _ widely
ridiculed, because the Constitution commands that the census be
taken every decade _ soon may be removed.
</P>
<P>
   In other legislative action, the Senate Thursday night passed,
by a 73--25 vote, a $91.7 billion spending bill for the Labor,
Health and Human Services and Education departments. The bill
includes $18.5 billion drawn from a projected budget surplus for
the 2001 fiscal year. That is more money than Congress ever has
spent with advance appropriations in a single year, much less a
single bill.
</P>
<P>
   Though the measure actually increases spending for some
programs, President Clinton has vowed to veto it.

 By ROBERT PEAR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ By a surprisingly lopsided vote, the House of
Representatives passed a bill on Thursday to give patients a wide
range of new rights, including the right to sue health insurance
plans that cause injury by denying care or by providing substandard
treatment.
</P>
<P>
   The vote, 275-151, was a stunning rebuff to House Republican
leaders. Sixty-eight Republicans defied their leadership and voted
for the bill, despite pleas from Speaker Dennis Hastert, who said
he vehemently opposed the measure because it could lead to a flood
of lawsuits against health maintenance organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's vote was the most serious setback for Hastert since
he became speaker nine months ago.
</P>
<P>
   The House bill, strongly supported by President Clinton, would
set uniform national standards for health insurance, a field
regulated mainly by the states for 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   In July, the Senate passed a bill providing patients with a more
limited set of rights. It differs from the House measure in two big
ways. Many provisions of the Senate bill would apply to only 48
million people, whereas the House bill would cover 161 million
people. And the Senate measure would not expand the right to sue
HMOs. Complicating the House-Senate conference that is to reconcile
the two versions, the House measure passed Thursday will be tied to
tax breaks passed on Wednesday that are opposed by Democrats and
the White House. Democrats said the tax breaks could jeopardize the
passage of any bill coming out of conference.
</P>
<P>
   The House bill on managed care was drafted by two of the most
stubborn and tenacious members of Congress, Reps. Charlie Norwood,
R-Ga., and John Dingell, D-Mich.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, in New York City on Thursday for a fund-raiser,
congratulated the House. ``The passage of this bill represents a
major victory for every family in every health plan,'' he said.
But, he added, when House and Senate negotiators try to thrash out
their differences, ``Republican leaders must resist the urge to
weaken the patient protections guaranteed in the Norwood-Dingell
bill.''
</P>
<P>
   Rejoicing with supporters after the final vote, Dingell, who has
served in the House since 1955, said, ``This was as fine a piece of
work as I've ever seen in Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   But the House Democratic leader, Rep. Dick Gephardt of Missouri,
said the bill could get bogged down in negotiations with the
Senate. ``I'm worried that this bill will go into a conference
committee that never ends, and nothing happens,'' Gephardt said.
</P>
<P>
   The House bill would guarantee patients access to emergency care
and medical specialists; would let them appeal coverage decisions
to an independent board, and would prohibit HMOs from retaliating
against doctors who fight for the needs of their patients.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would also make it much easier for patients to sue
health plans in state courts for injuries caused by the denial of
care.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since 1974,'' Norwood said, ``managed-care insurance plans
have enjoyed a near-total immunity from any legal accountability
for injuring and killing the citizens of this country for monetary
gain. No thinking, feeling American can agree to let that stand.''
</P>
<P>
   Another Republican who voted for the Norwood-Dingell bill, Rep.
Merrill Cook of Utah, said: ``If Americans have the right to sue
for a damaged fence or an unsafe toy, they should have the right to
sue if their life or health has been endangered. Doctors already
face liability, but often their decisions are forced upon them by
an insurance plan. It's only fair that insurance plans be held to
the same accountability.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Hastert said, ``Under the Norwood-Dingell legislation,
trial lawyers will be given unprecedented new rights to sue at any
time for any reason.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep, Thomas J. Bliley Jr., R-Va., said, ``Patients need care,
not courts.'' The same lawyers who sued tobacco companies and gun
manufacturers are planning to file similar lawsuits against HMOs
and employers who provide health benefits to their employees,
Bliley said.
</P>
<P>
   The House bill defining patients' rights was bundled together
with a bill, passed by the House on Wednesday, to create tax breaks
to help individuals and small businesses buy health insurance.
Republicans strongly support the tax breaks, which could cost more
than $40 billion over 10 years, but Clinton and other Democrats
said the benefits would go mainly to a small number of healthy,
affluent people.
</P>
<P>
   Conservative Democrats expressed concern about these costs on
Wednesday. But Clinton relieved some of the concern on Thursday
when he said, in a letter to House Democrats, that he would not
sign any legislation ``unless its costs are fully offset by the
conference committee.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's vote was a rare triumph of bipartisanship in a House
chamber that has been torn apart by bitter partisan strife for more
than four years. In that same period, Norwood, a dentist, fought
the leadership of his own party and a well-financed coalition of
insurance companies and businesses of all sizes, to get a
managed-care bill through the House.
</P>
<P>
   In a House where the outcome of most votes is clear before they
are taken, Thursday was unusual in that no one could confidently
predict the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   When Norwood's victory arrived, it came in a rush, with nearly
one-third of his fellow Republicans supporting the bill. Lawmakers
piled up ``yes'' votes so quickly that a majority was reached in
the first five minutes of the 15-minute voting period. Cheers went
up as the tally in favor of the bill passed 218.
</P>
<P>
   Nine of the 12 House Republicans from New York, all six
Republicans from New Jersey and one of the two Republicans from
Connecticut, Christopher Shays, voted for the bill, as did 206
Democrats and 1 independent. Two Democrats, Collin Peterson of
Minnesota and Virgil H. Goode Jr. of Virginia, joined 149
Republicans in voting against the measure.
</P>
<P>
   HMOs have helped employers control the cost of care, but in the
process they have infuriated many patients and doctors.
</P>
<P>
   The Norwood-Dingell bill was supported by many consumer
advocates and labor unions. But doctors and nurses made the
difference. The American Medical Association lobbied hard for the
bill. And Dr. Greg Ganske, R-Iowa, a surgeon, was a tireless
champion of the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors have rebelled against the constraints of managed care
because they feel that HMOs have compromised their decision-making
and their professional autonomy.
</P>
<P>
   By a vote of 238-193, the House on Thursday rejected a
substitute bill offered as an alternative by the House Republican
leaders. Twenty-nine Republicans joined almost all the Democrats in
opposing this bill, written by Reps. Tom Coburn of Oklahoma and
John Shadegg of Arizona, both Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   The Coburn-Shadegg bill would have provided patients with a
limited right to sue HMOs in federal court.
</P>
<P>
   The bill passed on Thursday would pierce the shield of immunity
provided to many HMOs by a federal law, the Employee Retirement
Income Security Act of 1974.
</P>
<P>
   Under this statute, courts have repeatedly rejected lawsuits
that relate directly to the administration of claims under an
employee-benefit plan. But in the last two years, judges have
become more receptive to lawsuits seeking damages from HMOs on the
theory that the quality of care was inadequate.
</P>
<P>
   Almost every provision of the House bill, including the right to
sue, has been enacted in some form by one or more states.
</P>
<P>
   The House and Senate bills address similar issues. But doctors
and consumer groups prefer the House version because it applies to
more people and sets more stringent standards.
</P>
<P>
   Both bills say that if an HMO denies a claim for benefits, the
patient could have the decision reviewed by an independent panel of
medical experts.
</P>
<P>
   Under the House bill, if a health insurance plan tries to
control the costs of prescription drugs by establishing a list of
recommended medications, it must allow patients to get other drugs
that are medically necessary. The Senate bill has a narrower
provision.
</P>
<P>
   The House bill also stipulates that HMOs must pay the routine
costs of care for patients who enroll in certain clinical trials
testing drugs. The comparable Senate provision applies only to
clinical trials of anticancer drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Both bills would prevent health plans from interfering with a
doctor's ability to discuss all treatment options with patients.
</P>
<P>
   Under the House bill, consumers in a group health plan could,
for an additional premium, buy coverage allowing them to use
doctors outside the network of physicians established by their
health plan. The Senate bill has a similar requirement, but many
employers would be exempt.

HOUSE HEARS GRIM TALES ABOUT MANAGED CARE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ga., Texas, Wis., Mo., Iowa, Tenn., Calif., Ariz., S.C.)  (See also CONGRESS-HEALTH) 
(js) 
 By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ One after another, the lawmakers told anecdotes
about constituents who had been harmed when they were denied
coverage by their health maintenance organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Ron Kind, D-Wis., told of a ``young family in Western
Wisconsin'' in which a little girl died after she was denied a
treatment for brain cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Sheila Jackson-Lee, D-Texas, told of ``little Steve Olson''
who could not have a CAT scan he needed.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the Democratic leader,
described how in the 1970s, before managed care became widespread,
his young son was thought to have terminal cancer. But a doctor
tried an experimental treatment, and it saved the boy's life.
Gephardt wondered whether an HMO would permit such treatment today.
</P>
<P>
   Then, at the end of the afternoon, Rep. Greg Ganske, R-Iowa,
trumped them all.
</P>
<P>
   He brought a guest onto the House floor, a 7-year-old boy from
Georgia, James Adams, who has artificial legs and no hands, and
with the boy seated in the front row in shorts and a tank top,
Ganske told his story.
</P>
<P>
   When James was 5 months old, Ganske said, he developed a high
fever. His mother called the family's HMO and was told to go not to
the local hospital but to another one 70 miles away. Halfway there,
the boy went into cardiac arrest. He was revived at the hospital,
but gangrene had set in, and it cost him both hands and both feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not an anecdote,'' declared Ganske, who is a surgeon.
``We need to fix this problem so these kinds of cases don't
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   The presentation may not have changed any votes, but it took the
wind out of the debate. No one else seemed to agree when the next
speaker, Rep. Van Hilleary, R-Tenn., complained that bringing the
boy onto the floor of the House ``borders on exploitation.''
</P>
<P>
   The managed-care industry was the subject of relentless scorn
Thursday before the House voted, 275-151, to give its patients a
wide range of new rights. No one rose to the industry's defense, to
say that rising medical expenses were destroying corporate profits
and draining the federal budget until managed care clamped down on
costs a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
   As far as the House of Representatives was concerned, the cost
of health care, one of the central political questions facing the
country, was a subject for another time and another place. On
Thursday, the members were responding to the concern of their
constituents that if they or their loved ones get sick, they might
be denied treatment they need.
</P>
<P>
   It was taken as a given that health maintenance organizations
are remote bullies run by greedy bureaucrats. The only question was
what to do about them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've all been there ourselves, and we've seen our
constituents there,'' said Rep. Dick Armey of Texas, the majority
leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``The patients' well-being,'' Armey said, ``comes before the
doctors, comes before the trial lawyers, comes before the health
care providers, comes before everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Everybody in the House agreed. But then Armey got to his main
point. ``How could anybody,'' he asked, ``say to a distressed
husband or father or mother or daughter, we give you our promise
that six months from now or maybe a year, we'll get you on the
docket, and we'll let the lawyers and the judges decide.''
</P>
<P>
   The question of lawsuits was what divided Armey and almost all
the other Republicans from the solid bank of Democrats and, on the
crucial midday vote, from a couple of dozen Republican allies like
Ganske and Rep. Charlie Norwood of Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   It gave Republicans the opportunity to vent their venom over
trial lawyers, who are major contributors to Democratic politicians
and the bete noire of the business interests that are the
Republicans' most important donors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trial lawyers will be given unprecedented new rights to sue
any time for any reason in any venue,'' said Speaker J. Dennis
Hastert.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bill Thomas of California declared, ``If you want to meet a
trial lawyer, follow an ambulance.''
</P>
<P>
   Representative John Shadegg of Arizona accused Democrats of
wanting to ``let the tort lawyers get rich and drive Cadillacs and
Lexuses.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers are hardly more popular nowadays than health maintenance
organizations, and in the past, such attacks have proved fruitful
for Republicans. That was the case, for instance, on measures to
limit lawsuits over faulty products and against the tobacco
manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   But lawyer-bashing was not nearly enough today. There was
applause from Democrats when congressman Norwood, a folksy dentist
from eastern Georgia who is loyal to the Republican leadership on
every issue except managed-care regulation, said, ``If you make a
decision and the patient dies, then you need to be liable.''
</P>
<P>
   And by the end of the day, after it became clear that
Republicans had lost the battle, some were making jokes about the
matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been a lawyer seeking punitive damages,'' said Rep.
Lindsey Graham of South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Then he looked across the well of the House at congressman
Norwood and remarked: ``One thing I'm not going to do when I leave
here is go practice dentistry. So I don't appreciate all these
doctors trying to rewrite the liability law.'' &QL;

WARNER SELLS REMAINING THEME PARK BUSINESS
</HEADLINE>

BY DAVE McNARY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BURBANK, Calif. -- Warner Bros. has decided to bail out of its
fledgling foreign theme park business, a year after selling its
dozen Six Flags sites in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The studio this week announced a $180 million deal in which Six
Flags buyer Premiere Parks also will acquire the 3-year-old Movie
World theme park in Germany and the yet-to-open Movie World in
Spain. The deal also includes licensing rights to use Looney Tunes,
DC Comics and Cartoon Network characters in European and Latin
American parks.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement reflects Burbank-based Warner's strategy of
expanding use of its brand names. The studio granted Premiere,
which will have 35 theme parks worldwide when the deal is
completed, exclusive domestic license rights for its characters at
theme parks in the $1.9 billion Six Flags buyout last year.
</P>
<P>
   The domestic deal included the Six Flags California complex of
Magic Mountain and Hurricane Harbor in Valencia.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very pleased to expand our successful theme park
partnership with Premiere Parks, the leading regional theme park
operator in the world,'' said Warner Chairman Barry Meyer in a
written statement. ``It enables us to further grow in the global
theme park industry while showcasing our characters on an even
larger scale.''
</P>
<P>
   A Warner spokeswoman said Premiere will offer employment to 40
staffers at the Glendale-based Warner Bros. International
Recreation Enterprises who have been working on construction and
design of the Spanish theme park for a 2002 opening. Nick Winslow,
chairman of the operation, has resigned to pursue other
opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   Oklahoma City-based Premiere officials said they expect to meet
analysts' earnings estimates for the rest of this year and noted
there has been explosive growth at the four U.S. parks, including
Marine World in Vallejo, converted to the Six Flags format with
Warner and DC characters. The parks have posted 22 percent gains in
attendance and a 31 percent gain in revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Premiere stock rose $2.875 to $30.438 a share Thursday.

WOODSON QUESTIONABLE AFTER INJURY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RAY BUCK 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Pro Bowl strong safety Darren Woodson was forced
to leave practice with a sprained left ankle Thursday and is being
listed as ``questionable'' for Sunday's game at Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being that it is a Thursday injury is probably the biggest
concern,'' Dallas Cowboys trainer Jim Maurer said. ``We'll just
have to see how it is in the morning. It'll be a day-to-day
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Woodson, who suffered the injury when his foot was stepped on
during a passing drill, walked off the practice field and
immediately went inside to receive treatment.
</P>
<P>
   If Woodson is unable to play Sunday, Izell Reese is expected to
join George Teague as the Cowboys safeties. Reese, a second-year
player,has not started an NFL game. The backup would then be Singor
Mobley. BRIEFLY
</P>
<P>
   _ Cornerback Kevin Smith took a step closer Thursday to starting
at left corner against the Eagles. With Kevin Mathis nursing a knee
sprain that is expected to keep him out this week, Smith has come
back from a bulging disk in his back just in time. Coach Chan
Gailey confirmed that Smith can start, but that the coaches ``will
keep an eye on him'' for fatigue because of his layoff. Smith
hasn't played since the Aug. 9 Hall of Fame game.
</P>
<P>
   _ Right guard Everett McIver (strained hamstring) surprised
Gailey with the amount of team practice he was able to get in
Thursday. McIver's response today to the extended activity will be
a key. ``It's getting closer on him, closer than I thought,'' said
Gailey, adding there's ``an outside chance'' that McIver could suit
up against Philadelphia. Meanwhile, Tom Myslinski is taking most of
the repetitions at right guard.
</P>
<P>
   _ Right tackle Erik Williams (strained quadriceps) had a full
day of practice, a good sign.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Cowboys' Oct. 31 game at Indianapolis has been moved to
3:15 p.m., by Fox TV. It originally was scheduled for noon. nn

ROAD HASN'T BEEN KIND TO USC
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ USC coach Paul Hackett has tried just about
everything to prepare his team for the road.
</P>
<P>
   He first broached the subject back in August during training
camp. Then he used loudspeakers in practice to simulate crowd
noise.
</P>
<P>
   Today, he will skip the traditional Friday walk-through practice
inside Arizona's 56,500-seat stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Hackett has tried just about everything because little has
changed the Trojans' luck so far. Since Hackett arrived, USC has
not distinguished itself on the road, compiling a lackluster 3-4
record.
</P>
<P>
   If you take out victories against traditional weaklings, the
Trojans are 0-4 in that span, failing to beat a single opponent
with a winning record.
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans get their latest test Saturday, when they play
Arizona in Tucson. It's another opportunity for USC to prove it can
go into a hostile stadium and defeat a team that isn't considered a
pushover.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to do it at some point. We will. When? I don't
know,'' Hackett said. ``You want to win a tough road game. That's
something you've got to get done if you're going to be a contender.
This is a momentum game.''
</P>
<P>
   It has to be, because the Trojans self-destructed two weeks ago
in Oregon, losing 33-30 in triple overtime and depriving themselves
of the biggest road win of the Hackett era.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Oregon game was so important for us. We knew it was a
chance to overcome (the stigma),'' Hackett said. ``More from a
coaching than player thought process.''
</P>
<P>
   There were no such worries when Hackett was an assistant at USC
in 1978, and the Trojans went to Alabama and defeated the
No.1-ranked Crimson Tide 24-14.
</P>
<P>
   But the latest struggles are not solely a Hackett phenomenon.
USC is just 5-8 in its past 13 conference road games since 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, the last time the Trojans defeated a top-25 team on
the road was in 1995, when they defeated Arizona 31-10.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think in the past guys have been intimidated or scared a
little bit,'' tailback Chad Morton said. ``I think times have
changed. Guys want to play on the road. I know I love playing on
the road.''
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans just don't seem to play well. It certainly didn't
look as though USC was road-tested against Oregon, when it
committed a school-record 21 penalties, including six false starts
by the offensive line in noisy Autzen Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   But Morton said that experience could propel the Trojans against
Arizona, no matter how loud the crowd might become in Tucson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite all the penalties, no one was arguing in Oregon. It
was something special in the huddle,'' Morton said. ``It made me
feel proud. Especially going to Arizona. It's going to help us in
that environment.''
</P>
<P>
   USC will take all the help it can get, and it's not just Hackett
who is concerned about becoming road kill again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been thinking about it a lot lately,'' quarterback Mike
Van Raaphorst said. ``We've had some heartbreaks and blowouts. It's
not the fact we didn't play well or play hard. I think we need to
take care of our business and have fewer penalties.''
</P>
<P>
   So what is the answer to the Trojans' road woes? Nerves?
Distractions? The on-going penalty problem? Strange grass?
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes you can say it's easy to lose focus, but I can't
pinpoint anything because if I could, we'd correct it,'' free
safety David Gibson said. ``It's like going to a foreign land and
winning a war.''
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans (3-1, 1-1) are aware that every time they go into a
difficult road game, somebody anticipates something negative will
happen. Arizona's fans will no doubt be happy to see some miscues.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're waiting for us to screw up,'' offensive tackle Travis
Claridge said. ``We have to use it to our advantage. We can use
Oregon as an experience game. A lot of the young guys hadn't played
in a noisy stadium.The only thing we have to prove is we can win.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be a breakthrough win if we get it.''
</P>
<P>
   No small feat, based on recent history.
</P>
<P>
   The plethora of penalties in Oregon has raised hopes within the
team that if it can avoid another meltdown, the Trojans should have
a good chance to end their drought with a victory over the
Wildcats.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fans have little impact. It's all us,'' linebacker Zeke
Moreno said. ``We made penalties and mental mistakes against
Oregon.''
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to see the silver lining, Morton was encouraged by
the way USC rallied behind Van Raaphorst after Carson Palmer broke
his collarbone. The Trojans came back from a 20-10 deficit against
Oregon and took a 23-20 lead in the final period before the Ducks
kicked a field goal with 30 seconds remaining to send the game into
overtime.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really feel we did face the worst situation we've ever been
in,'' Morton said. ``To come from behind like we did in the fourth
quarter, we're prepared for anything.''

BAFFERT LOOKS TO DOMINATE BREEDERS' CUP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARCADIA _ Between cell-phone interruptions and sips of Diet
Pepsi Thursday morning at Clockers' Corner, Bob Baffert ran through
his main Breeders' Cup contenders, starting with Forestry in the
Sprint.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had to say there's one race I know I can win, it'd be
his,'' Baffert said. ``Chilukki (in the Juvenile Fillies) would be
second. Then Forest Camp (in the Juvenile).''
</P>
<P>
   What about Silverbulletday in the Distaff?
</P>
<P>
   ``I forgot about her,'' Baffert said of the nation's No. 1
filly.
</P>
<P>
   Remembering all of his horses appears to be Baffert's biggest
problem going into two weekends of major preps for the Nov. 6
Breeders' Cup races at Gulfstream Park near Miami.
</P>
<P>
   There's a chance that in addition to Forestry, Chilukki, Forest
Camp and Silverbulletday, Baffert will have Tuzla in the Mile and
General Challenge and River Keen in the Classic. If all of them
make it, the Santa Anita-based trainer will be represented in six
of the eight Breeders' Cup races.
</P>
<P>
   Only one other trainer, D. Wayne Lukas, has run horses in that
many races at a single Breeders' Cup. Lukas was involved in six in
1988, 1989 and 1991, and saddled three winners in 1988 at Churchill
Downs (Gulch in the Sprint, Open Mind in the Juvenile Fillies and
Is It True in the Juvenile).
</P>
<P>
   But nobody has gone into a Breeders' Cup with obvious contenders
in as many races as Baffert will have if his luck holds up this
weekend and next at Santa Anita and New York's Belmont Park, where
the major steppingstone races will be held.
</P>
<P>
   In the latest rankings of Breeders' Cup hopefuls by the Daily
Racing Form's Mike Watchmaker, Baffert has favorites in
Silverbulletday (9-5), Chilukki (8-5) and Forestry (3-1) and second
choices in General Challenge (behind Behrens) and Forest Camp
(behind More Than Ready).
</P>
<P>
   The only trainers who've come close to that are Lukas (three
favorites or second choices in 1988) and Charlie Whittingham (four
favorites in 1987, including Classic winner Ferdinand).
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a long way off,'' said Baffert, the former quarterhorse
trainer who gained his first national attention in the thoroughbred
game when Thirty Slews won the Sprint in 1992, the last time the
Breeders' Cup was held in Florida. ``I've got to get past this
weekend and next weekend. Then I'll worry about it. I could have a
really good weekend or a really bad weekend.''
</P>
<P>
   Baffert will have odds-on favorites against small fields at
Santa Anita with Bob McNair's Chilukki (David Flores riding) in the
Oak Leaf Stakes for 2-year-old fillies on Saturday and Aaron Jones'
Forest Camp (Flores) in the Norfolk for 2-year-olds on Sunday. Both
are undefeated, Chilukki in five starts and Forest Camp in two, but
both will race 1 mile for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   Baffert's only fear about front-running Chilukki is that she'll
be tempted to run too fast early to keep up with Caesar
Dominguez-trained She's Classy (Alex Solis), and Craig
Dollase-trained Abby Girl (Chris McCarron) will pick up the pieces.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sprinters stretching out the first time, you never know,''
Baffert said.
</P>
<P>
   Chilukki, a stakes winner at Churchill Downs and Del Mar, is the
biggest draw the 2-year-old fillies division has produced in a long
time. But one fan who won't be here to watch her Saturday is her
owner.
</P>
<P>
   McNair, who, with his wife Janice, races as Stonerside Stable,
has had enough excitement this week, winning the next NFL expansion
franchise for Houston on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's gotta rustle up $700 million (to pay for the team),''
Baffert said.
</P>
<P>
   McNair, who runs power plants, got into racing in 1993 with
Arthur Hancock III of Kentucky, and had a one-third interest in
1994 Kentucky Derby runner-up Strodes Creek and a one-quarter
interest in 1997 Belmont Stakes winner Touch Gold.
</P>
<P>
   He bought Chilukki for $875,000 at a Kentucky auction earlier
this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a really likable guy, the kind of guy you root for,''
Baffert said of McNair. ``He's a good winner and a good loser.''
</P>
<P>
   Baffert ran a loser for McNair Thursday at Santa Anita. Delivery
finished fifth in the second race and earned $1,120. Now McNair
needs $699,998,880.
</P>
<P>
   Baffert will be at Santa Anita for the two stakes this weekend
and for Pacific Classic winner General Challenge (Flores) in the
Goodwood Handicap on Oct. 16.
</P>
<P>
   Assistants at Belmont will handle Hugo Reynolds' River Keen
(Chris Antley), who'll see if his Woodward Stakes-winning form is
good enough to beat top-ranked Behrens in the 1\-mile Jockey Club
Gold Cup, and Mike Pegram's Silverbulletday (Jerry Bailey), who
goes for her 10th consecutive victory over fillies and mares in
Sunday's 1[-mile Beldame.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Jones' Forestry, unraced since winning the Aug. 28
King's Bishop at Saratoga, isn't scheduled for a prep. The
3-year-old colt would go into the Breeders' Cup Sprint with two
weeks' more rest than Thirty Slews had before his 1992 victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's only got to go 6 furlongs,'' Baffert said of the Sprint.
</P>
<P>
   Forestry showed he's healthy by working 6 furlongs in a
fastest-of-the-morning 1:11 3/5 Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Baffert must decide whether to take Tuzla to the Mile after her
fifth-place finish in the longer Yellow Ribbon.
</P>
<P>
   But his other Breeders' Cup hopefuls will determine their own
immediate futures.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it goes right for you, it goes right,'' said Baffert,
whose barn leads the nation with $12.6 million in purses in 1999.
``I've just never had a barn with so many good horses.''
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to the Breeders' Cup, few trainers have. &QL;

MINIMED FOUNDER CONSIDERS $100 MILLION GIFT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY CHRIS SIEROTY  
 and JASON Z. COHEN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- MiniMed Inc. founder Alfred Mann, who already has
pledged $200 million to establish bioengineering institutes at two
Southern California universities, is discussing similar
arrangements with Johns Hopkins University, Harvard University and
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the renowned scientist
has told the Los Angeles Daily News.
</P>
<P>
   Mann also said he probably will take another of his biotech
companies public next year, although a specific timetable hasn't
been established.
</P>
<P>
   Mann, who in February 1998 gave $100 million each to UCLA and
the University of Southern California, now says he expects to make
a $100 million donation to Johns Hopkins in Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had talks with Johns Hopkins, and the institute will
probably happen,'' said Mann on Thursday, who wouldn't predict when
a final decision on the facility would be made.
</P>
<P>
   Although he has had several discussions with officials at
Harvard and MIT, ``the talks are in the early stages and any
donation would fund a joint project,'' Mann told the Daily News.
</P>
<P>
   Mann's relationship with Johns Hopkins dates back to the 1950s,
when he worked in the space division of its Applied Physics
Laboratories, designing solar electric generating systems. About 20
years ago, Mann donated several million dollars to the university
for laboratories used in joint projects with the Johns Hopkins
Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole concept was to do good, basic research,'' said Mann,
who spoke with the Daily News a few hours after speaking at a Town
Hall Los Angeles luncheon downtown.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis O'Shea, a spokesman with Johns Hopkins University, said
if Mann makes the nine-figure donation he will eclipse the $95
million given to the school by Bloomberg News founder Michael
Bloomberg, a 1964 graduate of the university. Bloomberg's donations
were made three years apart, in 1995 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had conversations with him,'' said Robert Lindgren, vice
president for development and alumni relations at Johns Hopkins
University, ``because we are interested in what he is doing at USC
and UCLA.''
</P>
<P>
   Mann's donations to USC and the University of California, Los
Angeles were among the biggest single grants the universities have
received.
</P>
<P>
   Mann has been aggressive in promoting biotech research in recent
years. In addition to the USC and UCLA donations, MiniMed is in the
process of moving its corporate headquarters to the north campus of
California State University, Northridge, where the biotech giant
expects to help train future biotech workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will have some interaction with the university,'' Mann
said. ``We will provide internships for students, and they will
have access to our telecommunications center, but it will not be
the same'' as the institutes at other universities.
</P>
<P>
   The founder of seven electronics and biomedical firms, Mann has
said he wants to turn some of the billions of dollars in revenue
from the biotech industry into the next century's biotech
discoveries. ``I've been very successful in my career, and I want
to give back,'' he said. ``This is a way I can be more effective.''
</P>
<P>
   Kurt Kruger, who follows MiniMed as an analyst for Banc of
America Securites, applauded its leader's altruism.
</P>
<P>
   ``His giving, divided by his net worth, is probably higher than
that of other people, such as Bill Gates,'' Kruger said. ``At his
very core, he wants to help people and patients' suffering through
the means he knows best, which is technology.

   ``Whether it plays back to MiniMed, I think, really doesn't

Advanced Bionics Corp. public next year,'' Mann said.

STATE FARM HALTS DISPUTED PLAN FOR COVERAGE OF AUTO REPAIRS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill.)   (bl)  
 By KEITH BRADSHER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ Having lost a $456 million jury verdict Monday, State
Farm, the nation's largest auto insurer, announced Thursday that it
would temporarily require that all crash repairs on its
policyholders' automobiles be done with parts produced by auto
manufacturers or their affiliates.
</P>
<P>
   An Illinois jury decided Monday that State Farm had breached its
contract with policyholders by insisting that body shops use parts
that are not factory authorized, which tend to be less expensive.
Lawyers for the group of policyholders that sued had contended that
the generic parts did not fit as well and were of worse quality
than parts authorized by the auto manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   Jack North, State Farm's senior vice president for auto
insurance claims, said that while the company still planned to
appeal the verdict, the policy was being changed immediately to
prevent confusion among State Farm's 36 million auto policyholders.
</P>
<P>
   He said that State Farm had not decided how long the new policy
would be in place, and added that the company's costs would begin
to rise if it required the use of more expensive parts for long.
</P>
<P>
   Because State Farm is a mutual insurance company, it is owned by
its policyholders and passes along its profits or losses to them in
the form of higher or lower rates. North said State Farm had
reserves to cover losses, and had no current plans to raise rates
to rebuild those reserves if its appeal of Monday's verdict was
unsuccessful.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Nealey, one of the lawyers who sued State Farm, said the
insurer had acted appropriately Thursday. Independent producers of
substitute parts should treat the company's decision as a warning
to improve quality, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The fight over State Farm's repair-payment policies coincides
with a move by auto manufacturers to spin off their auto parts
divisions into independent companies. General Motors' auto parts
unit became independent in May, while Ford Motor Co. is in
negotiations with the United Automobile Workers union this week
over Ford's plans to turn its auto parts business into a separate
company. The UAW told Ford on Wednesday that it would call a strike
at 11:59 p.m. Friday if disputes over parts' workers job security
and compensation cannot be resolved.
</P>
<P>
   DaimlerChrysler AG and most of the Japanese automakers already
buy most of their parts from independent companies. The products
from these independent companies are sold as ``factory-authorized''
parts even though the manufacturers have not made them.
</P>
<P>
   Virtually all manufacturers, however, continue to make their own
sheet metal parts, like hoods and roofs. Some of the fiercest
disputes between insurers and policy holders have been over whether
substitutes for these parts are truly identical. Sheet metal parts
are stamped out of huge sheets of steel using giant metal dies, and
substitute parts are not made using the same dies.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer groups have tended to advocate the use of substitute
parts, contending that their availability prevents auto
manufacturers from charging exorbitant prices for replacement
parts.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Gillis, the automotive expert at the Consumer Federation of
America, on Thursday warned that State Farm's decision would
eventually result in higher insurance premiums.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``I think that is just more evidence of the chilling effect that
this lawsuit is going to have on the consumer,'' said Gillis, who
is also the executive director of the Certified Auto Parts
Association, a nonprofit group that sets standards for parts that
are not factory authorized. ``This means that the consumer is going
to immediately have to start paying more for crash repairs.''
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers who sued State Farm have said that they might sue
other insurers and the association next.
</P>
<P>
   The Illinois jury verdict applies to insurance claims filed from
July 31, 1987, to Feb. 23, 1998. Included are $243.7 million in
direct damages and another $212.4 for ``installation damages,'' the
estimated cost to replace the generic parts.
</P>
<P>
   A separate portion of the verdict, alleging fraud by State Farm,
must still be decided by the judge, John Speroni, who could also
assess hundred of millions of dollars in punitive damages and
damages for fraud.
</P>
<P>
   Fees for the lawyers who filed the class-action case still must
be decided by the court.

<P>
   Baseball is a timeless game, a pastoral endeavor unbound by the
tyranny of a ticking clock. Nine innings can stretch to eternity,
often joyfully. But the charms of timelessness can yield to a sense
of the never-ending and that pushing the final buzzer would be an
act of mercy.
</P>
<P>
   Not that a long baseball game is by definition numbingly dull or
a short game necessarily taut with tension. Yet as Game 1 of the
Texas Rangers-New York Yankees division series Tuesday night
slogged toward a length of 3 hours and 37 minutes, it was evident
that the Yankees' 8-0 triumph was a classic exercise in ennui.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're only in the fifth inning and this game is creeping up on
two hours _ and I underline creeping,'' said Bob Costas, who called
the game for NBC.
</P>
<P>
   It was the longest playoff game of this post-season, 24 minutes
longer than the New York Mets-Arizona Diamondbacks series opener
later that night and 84 minutes longer than the one-hitter by the
Atlanta Braves' Kevin Millwood against the Houston Astros in Game 2
on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees play long games, the longest in baseball _ an
average of 3:08 _ 4 minutes longer than Cleveland's, 15 minutes
longer than the major league average, and exactly the time it has
taken to complete a game this season in the National Football
League, which sports a 60-minute clock.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees score oodles of runs (900, third in the American
League); their hitters force pitchers into deep ball-strike counts,
a skill mastered by second baseman Chuck Knoblauch, and generate a
lot of bases on balls (718, second in the league). This takes time,
and sometimes it's exciting and competitive.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Yankees are a better team, get more hits, send up more
players in an inning and inspire more pitching changes than
others,'' said Steve Hirdt, the executive vice president of the
Elias Sports Bureau, baseball's official statistician. ``The teams
that get a lot of walks play the longest games.''
</P>
<P>
   Scoring 900 runs in a season, as the Yankees did this year, adds
minutes to baseball's invisible clock. And forcing managers to
amble from the dugout (they never run, do they?) to pull their
pitchers once, twice, three times or more in a game adds up. After
a while, you get real time.
</P>
<P>
   And so, on Tuesday night, 306 pitches were thrown, 171 by the
four Rangers' pitchers, 135 by the Yankees' Orlando (El Duque)
Hernandez and Jeff Nelson.
</P>
<P>
   Those 306 pitches were seven more than the total thrown during
Game 2 of the Mets-Arizona series, yet that game _ with two more
hits (14 to the Yankees-Rangers' 12), but five fewer walks (9
versus 14) _ required less time to play.
</P>
<P>
   What made the Texas-Yankees game so slow?
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't just the lopsided score. Maybe it was Juan Gonzalez's
fault. After each pitch, the Texas slugger stepped from the
batter's box. Every batter these days thinks the advent of a new
pitch requires a promenade. But Gonzalez, the two-time AL most
valuable player, takes epic strolls, for he is a serial loiterer.
He typically leaves the box with a bit of gardening with his
spikes, steps back, strolls, swings his bat a little, then returns
where he belongs. No umpire urged him back to the box Tuesday
night. His average dawdle: 14 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez outdid the Yankees' leader in dillydallying: Knoblauch.
His habitual perambulations entail a brief spell of crucial
dirt-kicking (three times), a ritual bow and touching of his shins,
tugging his batting gloves and a final return to the chalked
rectangle. Average dawdle: 11 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   In fairness, it is worth mentioning that the Yankees' Paul
O'Neill and the Rangers' Ivan Rodriguez are modest promenaders,
usually departing the batter's box after a pitch for a mere five
seconds apiece.
</P>
<P>
   Some pitchers work quickly; some others are deliberate. Sele and
Hernandez broke no mound speed records Tuesday night. Mostly, they
took 15 to 20 seconds between pitches (time between getting the
ball from the catcher to the start of their windups). A simple
five-second reduction in their between-pitch contemplations would
have cut more than 15 minutes from the game.
</P>
<P>
   If El Duque had not shaken off catcher Jorge Posada's signs five
times, he would have saved nearly 90 seconds spent when his
dithering resulted in batters dallying out of the box. And
Hernandez could have cut another 24 seconds from his workday by
reducing his high leg kick, which made his quirky windup last 0.2
seconds longer than Sele's.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many adjectives can be used to describe this game,'' Costas
said late in the game. ``Brisk would not be one of them.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   (The only time unavoidably lost in the game came when the
Yankees' yoda, Don Zimmer, was hit on the head by a foul ball
batted by Knoblauch. The game was held up for 3 minutes 20 seconds
as Zimmer was led to the clubhouse.)
</P>
<P>
   The inevitable result of the Yankees' clubbing of the Rangers
was Texas manager Johnny Oates' four pitching changes. Such moves
should not require an average 3:15 to execute, but here, managers
and players shouldn't be blamed. The culprit is greed. A reliever
trotting in to take eight warm-up pitches should not be a
miniseries. But when Oates removed Sele, then Tim Crabtree, then
Mike Venafro, his slow saunter to the mound needed 30 seconds, but
his appearance cued more than two minutes of commercials.
Thankfully, he made his next pitching change totally within a
commercial break.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's game will very likely be remembered for Bernie
Williams' six runs batted in, on a single, a double and a home run
(could he have run out that dinger a little faster, saving a few
seconds?). But it was not a memorable game, not when precious time
was frittered away by a batter's kicking away the dirt like a bull
about to charge a matador, or by a pitcher's slowing down his
windup from two seconds to five seconds simply because he had
runners on base. That crazy El Duque.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have a great post-season game that lasts a long time,''
Hirdt said, ``the last thing you think is, `Boy, that was
boring.'''
</P>
<P>
   Better luck next time. &QL;

KEEPING THE TEST BAN TREATY ALIVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times says in an editorial Friday, Oct. 8: &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If the nuclear Test Ban Treaty fails to win ratification next
week, as it probably will, Senate Republicans will deserve much of
the blame. The Republican leadership has behaved in a narrowly
partisan fashion that paid little heed to America's international
interests and trivialized the Senate's constitutional role in
evaluating treaties. But the White House failed to put together a
coherent strategy for assembling the needed two-thirds Senate
majority, and then allowed itself to be outmaneuvered into a
compressed timetable that left too little time for an intensive
lobbying campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The resulting failure will weaken American security. India and
Pakistan will be more likely to develop their nuclear arsenals and
China will be increasingly tempted to resume testing to exploit new
weapons designs, some of which may have been stolen from the United
States. The goal now should be to try to limit the damage by
keeping open the possibility that the Senate can be persuaded to
ratify the treaty in the months to come.
</P>
<P>
   To that end, the White House must reject the terms the
Republicans now offer for canceling next week's vote. These include
the outrageous requirement that President Clinton not seek
ratification during his remaining 15 months in office. That would
make things worse than they already are, leaving other countries
wondering whether Clinton has abandoned the treaty he signed three
years ago. Unless the Republicans agree to a postponement without
this timetable, the White House should let the Senate proceed
toward a vote next week _ trying, between now and then, to win as
many extra Republican votes as possible. If that effort falls
short, Clinton should concentrate his presidential energies on
building enough support to justify a new ratification effort as
soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Republican senators have raised several arguments against the
treaty, most of which evaporate on close inspection. Some doubt
whether American intelligence agencies can detect very-low-yield
nuclear tests. Others worry that America's nuclear stockpile might
deteriorate without testing. Some mistakenly believe that missile
defenses will make arms control treaties unnecessary.
</P>
<P>
   The administration has answered these objections convincingly.
Approving the treaty would speed creation of a stronger worldwide
monitoring system. Despite doubts expressed Thursday by the heads
of America's nuclear labs, Washington's stockpile stewardship
program, based on computer simulations, can keep existing weapons
reliable and nurture the scientific skills that could create new
ones if the treaty ever broke down. Missile defense can at best
supplement arms control, not replace it.
</P>
<P>
   There is every reason for Republicans of conscience to vote for
this treaty, but little chance that they will. Clinton's challenge
now will be to sway enough Senate votes to make ratification
possible before he leaves the White House.

TRUMPED-UP POLITICS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The news that real estate wheeler-dealer Donald Trump is taking
``a very good, strong look'' at running for president on the Reform
Party ticket will be good news for those who regard presidential
politics as entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   But when all the hype and sizzle have subsided, the chances are
that Trump's foray into the presidential race will prove a good
thing for those traditionalists who continue to believe that
running the country is like performing brain surgery or pitching in
the World Series: an activity best left to experienced and proven
professionals.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there are refreshing qualities that a novice might
bring to the consultant-ridden wasteland of presidential politics.
The Donald, no less than his Reform Party backer, Jesse Ventura, is
not in the habit of quacking in consultant-speak.
</P>
<P>
   There he was on NBC's ``Today'' show, telling interviewer Matt
Lauer that his anticipated opponent for the Reform Party
nomination, Patrick Buchanan, was in love with Adolf Hitler. It was
the kind of indiscreet remark that high-paid advisers and pollsters
would never allow a mainstream candidate such as Al Gore, Bill
Bradley, or George W. Bush to utter.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Buchanan has made the most of his free media time
to discourse on his antique ``America First'' notions about how the
democracies were mistaken to distract Hitler from his primary
objective of conquering Stalin's Soviet Union. It was left to Trump
to point out that unlike Buchanan, he does not need to use a
presidential campaign to pump up sales of a book.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Jesse ``the Body'' Ventura was in Cambridge, Mass.,
at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government, valiantly defending
puerile remarks he made in a Playboy interview. In case Pat
Robertson and Jerry Falwell weren't paying attention, he reaffirmed
his belief that organized religion is ``a crutch for weak-minded
people'' and if he were reincarnated he would want to return as an
item of women's underwear.
</P>
<P>
   Ventura, Trump, and Buchanan are soon going to make voters
appreciate the dull gray virtues of professional politicians.

CHINESE EMBASSY URGES CONGRESS TO END PROBE LINKED TO PHOENIX
CENTER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service
 clients)  
 By JERRY KAMMER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
WASHINGTON _ Officials at the Chinese Embassy have tried to get
congressional investigators to back off from their probe of the
corpora tion that owns the COFCO Chinese Cultural Center in
Phoenix.
<TEXT>
<P>
   According to federal investigators in the case, the Chinese
officials warned investigators that the probe could jeopardize tens
of millions of dollars in Chinese purchases of U.S. grain.
</P>
<P>
   COFCO, the China National Cereals, Oils and Foodstuffs Import &AMP;
Ex port Corp., is owned by the Chinese government and is listed by
Fortune magazine as one of the world's 500 largest corporations.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese also warned U.S. offi cials against relying on
information provided by Jianwei Ding, a former COFCO executive who
lives in Phoe nix and is seeking political asylum, said James
Wilson, chief counsel of the House Committee on Govern ment Reform.
</P>
<P>
   Committee Chairman Dan Burton, R-Ind., on Oct. 7 sharply
criticized embassy officials Shi Jianxin and Ci Bin for attempts to
influence the investigation into allegations that COFCO's top
executive in Phoenix sought to buy influence with a State
Department official.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is an understatement to say that our meeting with Chinese
Embassy officials heightened our concerns,'' Burton said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have never heard of embassy officials coming to a
congressional committee trying to discredit a wit ness. It is very
inappropriate, and it raises a lot of questions.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Kevin Binger, staff director of Burton's committee,
the two Chinese diplomats ``made a highly improper request of us.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They conveyed a clear message that they wanted the committee
to end the investigation of COFCO and Elizabeth Mann (COFCO's top
ex ecutive in Phoenix),'' Binger said.
</P>
<P>
   He said that the Chinese also strongly implied that if the
investi gation continued, relations between the two countries could
be damaged.
</P>
<P>
   Ci Bin denied the claim that the embassy had used veiled threats
that the investigation could lead to can cellation of COFCO's
purchases of millions of tons of U.S. grain.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no such intention to influence (the investigation),''
said Ci Bin, the embassy's first secretary.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just wanted to let them know that this guy, Ding, is not a
good one. If you rely on what he says, maybe he gives you trouble,
because he lies all the time,'' Ci Bin said.
</P>
<P>
   However, committee investigators say that they regard Ding to be
a reliable source and that they have found independent verification
for much of what he has told them about the Phoenix operations of
COFCO.
</P>
<P>
   In July, a committee report stated that COFCO's top executive in
Phoe nix, Elizabeth Mann, provided gifts to a U.S. embassy official
in Beijing in an attempt to influence him to grant visas for travel
in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The committee investigation was triggered by articles in The
Arizona Republic. The paper reported that former embassy official
Charles Par ish had improperly accepted gifts from Mann, a native
of China and a naturalized U.S. citizen.
</P>
<P>
   Mann and Ding have been engaged in a series of legal battles
ever since Ding, in 1996, told the Arizona Attorney General's
Office that Mann had rigged a pair of corrupt real estate
transactions on the 24-acre 44th Street site where the cultural
center was built.
</P>
<P>
   The allegations led to an investi gation that was aborted when
the proposed deals were canceled.
</P>
<P>
   Ding, a COFCO executive at the time, refused a transfer back to
Beijing and filed for political asylum. He says that Mann would use
her political connections to have him ``jailed, tortured or
killed'' if he was forced back to China. An attorney for Mann calls
the claim ``silly and absurd.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Mann has won two judgments against Ding in Maricopa
County Superior Court, accusing him of cheating COFCO out of about
$40,000. Her attorneys are also providing information to the
Immigration and Naturalization Service attorney in Phoenix, who is
attempting to have Ding deported.
</P>
<P>
   Burton on Oct. 7 expressed concern about Ding's safety.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no way he should be returned to China,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Committee investigators said this week that Chinese Embassy
officials contacted them after the committee issued a subpoena for
a broad range of COFCO documents.
</P>
<P>
   The committee is particularly inter ested in Mann's ties to
Parish, the former embassy official in Beijing. They are also
interested in Parish's connections with Johnny Chung, a
Chinese-American businessman who is at the center of a Democratic
Party fund-raising scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Chung told Burton's investigators this summer that he saw a
Chinese beer company executive hand Parish a bag of cash while
Parish was directing the visa section of the U.S. Embassy in
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   When the Chinese Embassy officials met with congressional
investigators last month, they said Ding was living a lavish
lifestyle. James Wilson said the officials said Ding had bought two
luxury cars.
</P>
<P>
   Ci Bin said Oct. 7 that Elizabeth Mann had informed the embassy
that Ding owned not only the luxury cars but also an expensive
house.
</P>
<P>
   Ding, who delivers newspapers for The Arizona Republic, called
the claims ``ludicrous.'' He said he and his wife, an insurance
company employee, are buying a secondhand, 1998 Nissan pickup truck
with $1,000 down and leasing a Toyota Corolla for $200 a month. He
said the rent on their two-bedroom Phoenix apartment is about $530
a month.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know why the embassy just believes Elizabeth Mann
without talking to me,'' Ding said. ``I would love to talk with
them. I am not hiding.'' &QL;

   From the czarist campaigns of the last centurythrough Stalin's
mass deportations and into the post-Soviet period, Chechnya and the
northern Caucasus have been Russia's heart of darkness.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian assault of the past two weeks is no less insane than
the sight described by Conrad's narrator. It can hardly achieve the
Russian aims of apprehending terrorists or protecting neighboring
republics from Islamist troublemakers.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's current campaign against the Chechens may be even worse
because there are signs that the government of Prime Minister
Vladimir Putin and his old comrades in the security service
provoked the last round of chaos in the Caucasus.
</P>
<P>
   Recent incursions into Dagestan by a couple of guerrilla field
commanders in Chechnya were a response to the harassment of border
villages by groups believed to have been infiltrated by the KGB's
successor, the FSB. And Moscow has produced no evidence that four
recent apartment house bombings were the work of Chechens.
</P>
<P>
   For the sake of stability in the Caucasus and democracy in
Russia, Washington should exert pressure on Moscow to take up
Chechen offers of dialogue, mediation, and acceptance of
peacekeeping observers. In Russia's modern version of ``Heart of
Darkness,'' one lawless colonizer is firing blindly into the
territory of a lost colony that has fallen into the hands of its
own outlaws.

GORILLA MONSOON, 62, VILLAINOUS PRO WRESTLER
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By NICK RAVO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Gorilla Monsoon, one of the most famous athlete-entertainers
ever to don tights and climb into the professional wrestling ring,
died on Wednesday at his home in Willingboro, N.J. He was 62.
</P>
<P>
   He had long suffered from diabetes and heart ailments, said a
close friend, Bill Apter, the editor in chief of WOW magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Monsoon, whose seldom-mentioned birth name was Robert Marella,
played a growling, sometimes-bearded villain in more than 8,000
matches from the 1960s to the early 80s _ an era of small purses
and smoke-filled rings in towns like Toledo, Ohio, a spectacle
quite different from the glitzy phenomenon of the '90s.
</P>
<P>
   Often, Monsoon's nemesis was the equally legendary Bruno
Sammartino, then the matinee idol of televised wrestling. Bobo
Brazil and Haystack Calhoun were also among his contemporaries.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, the 6-foot-6, 400-pound Monsoon, known to his
friends as Gino, was an occasional guest referee, an interim
president of the World Wrestling Federation in Stamford, Conn., and
a television announcer, sometimes teaming with Jesse Ventura, a
former wrestler known as the Body, who is now the governor of
Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   ``The loss of Gorilla Monsoon saddens me deeply,'' Ventura said
in a statement released Thursday. ``He was both a friend and a
colleague, and I have many fond memories of the time we spent
together.''
</P>
<P>
   Monsoon's career highlights included world tag-team titles with
Killer Kowalski in 1963 and Cowboy Bill Watts in 1965. He also
once, in an exhibition in 1976, lifted up the boxer Muhammad Ali,
spun him over his head, and slammed him to the mat. Monsoon was
elected to the World Wrestling Hall of Fame in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was one of the best heels _ what wrestlers call a bad guy _
in the business,'' Apter said. ``But in real life he was very
polite and a real businesslike person. He almost always wore a suit
and tie and was a great P.R. man for wrestling.''
</P>
<P>
   Monsoon grew up in western New York State and began wrestling as
a child. In high school, he was a shot-putter and discus thrower.
After attending Ithaca College, where he received a degree in
physical education, he worked as a teacher before a wrestling
promoter offered him $500 in 1960.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unlike the heels of today, the Gorilla Monsoon image was
genuinely frightening,'' Apter said. ``No one in the audience
laughed at his gimmick. They were actually both afraid and
respectful.''
</P>
<P>
   Later in his wrestling career he became a became a good guy who
was cheered by fans.
</P>
<P>
   Monsoon also spent some time as the wrestling columnist for the
Philadelphia Bulletin, a newspaper that is defunct. After his
retirement from the ring, he also worked as an agent and a
coordinator for the World Wrestling Federation.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, one of his sons, Joey Marella, a former wrestling
referee, died in an auto accident, and Monsoon seemed to lose some
of the enthusiasm he had for what he once proudly called a sport.
It had become too funny, too carefully scripted.
</P>
<P>
   ``He probably didn't like the direction the wrestling business
had taken,'' Apter said in a reminiscence he wrote for his
magazine's Web site, www.wrestleline.com. ``He longed for the old
days.''
</P>
<P>
   Gorilla Monsoon is survived by his wife, Maureen Marella; two
daughters, Sharon Byrne of Marlton, N.J., and Valerie Marella of
Willingboro; a son, Victor Quiones of San Juan, P.R.; his mother,
Connie Marella of Las Vegas, Nev.; three sisters, and four
grandchildren.

McEWAN   IS WAITING IN THE WINGS 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A month ago, Scott McEwan was third on UCLA's
quarterback depth chart and rarely practiced with the starting
offense. Now, he's one tackle from taking command.
</P>
<P>
   If starter Cory Paus gets hurt _ not unreasonable, given his
bruised ribs _ McEwan will play significant minutes for the first
time in his career.
</P>
<P>
   Is he ready?
</P>
<P>
   Yes, and no.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mentally, he'll be fine,'' Bruins coach Bob Toledo said. ``He
knows what's going on. He knows the game plan. The problem is with
live bullets coming at you. That's when guys get unraveled.''
</P>
<P>
   McEwan, a sophomore from Thousand Oaks, has played sparingly in
two games and thrown one college pass, an incomplete against Ohio
State. As the backup, he takes 20 percent of the snaps in practice
_ not nearly enough to gain rhythm or confidence. And that's a
controlled situation: Quarterbacks are not touched in practice,
much less tackled.
</P>
<P>
   How will McEwan respond to a punishing hit? How will he respond
to a blitz, or zone coverage, or an interception?
</P>
<P>
   ``If he's comfortable, he can hurt a defense,'' offensive
coordinator Al Borges said. ``But I told him it's not just about a
classroom, it's about being in a lab. That's what games are, a lab.
</P>
<P>
   ``In class, you go through a syllabus. Now, he has to
successfully dissect a corpse. And he has to do it under pressure,
with incredible scrutiny, in front of a lot of people. You have to
be fearless.''
</P>
<P>
   Injury update: Tailback DeShaun Foster (sprained ankle) has been
upgraded from doubtful to questionable. Defensive tackle Anthony
Fletcher (sprained foot) is also questionable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think (Fletcher) will be able to go,'' Toledo said. ``Same
thing with DeShaun. But we'll have to wait and see.''
</P>
<P>
   Coming on strong: Linebacker Marcus Reese, a Parade All-American
from San Jose, has been one of UCLA's most impressive rookies.
</P>
<P>
   He's the second-string weakside linebacker (behind Ryan Nece)
and an important component to the pass defense _ both for his
blitzing ability and coverage skills. He's also fifth on the team
in tackles (22) despite playing fewer snaps than the players ranked
ahead of him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a very instinctive player,'' linebackers coach Marc Dove
said. ``He's a good tackler, he's a physical player, and he
separates from blocks very well.''
</P>
<P>
   Review of the Week: Defensive tackle Pete Holland, a history
major and six-time member of the director's honor roll, has agreed
to review a book each week for the Daily News. This week: ``Mr.
X'', by Peter Straub.
</P>
<P>
   ```Mr. X' is Straub's most-recent tale of fantastic and macabre
paranormality.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before his mother's death, protagonist Ned Dunstan returns to
his hometown of Edgerton, Ill., where she reveals his father's real
name. The short trip evolves into a longer stay, as Dunstan
discovers the secrets of Edgerton's society and his family.
</P>
<P>
   ``The book is somewhat compelling, but it falls short of
Straub's masterworks, `Mystery' and `Ghost Story.' As usual,
Straub's characters develop identities all their own. But in this
case, the confusing names and dates bog down the tale.''
</P>
<P>
   Rating: 2 sacks (out of four).!end! &QL;

POSSIBLE RELEASE OF FORTIER RAISES QUESTIONS,
 SPARKS IRE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service
 clients)  
 By MARK SHAFFER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
PHOENIX _ The blast ripped out an eye, put a large hole in his
head, severed ligaments in his wrist and left more than 100 other
cuts on his body.
<TEXT>
<P>
   So excuse Martin Cash if he's more than a little miffed.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Fortier, Timothy McVeigh's former best buddy, could be
getting out of prison Oct. 8 after serving four years for his role
in the worst domestic attack in U.S. history, the murder of 168
people in the bombing of the Murrah Federal Building in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's see, Mr. Fortier helped sell and store stolen weapons
for McVeigh, his wife made a false ID for McVeigh and McVeigh told
them how he was going to set up the bomb in the truck,'' Cash said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Fortiers don't sound like inno cent little doves, do
they?''
</P>
<P>
   Or, as Paul Heath, another survivor, put it, ``trying to say
Fortier is not like McVeigh is like saying Herman Goering is not
like Adolph Hitler.''
</P>
<P>
   But Fortier, a former Kingman resi dent, has the trump card. He
was the federal government's star witness in the trials of McVeigh,
who was sentenced to death, and Terry Nich ols, who was sentenced
to life in prison, and cut a deal that sentenced him to 12 years in
prison.
</P>
<P>
   Federal prosecutors also never estab lished that Michael Fortier
or his wife knew that $2,000 in proceeds from the stolen weapons,
which Fortier gave to McVeigh, would be used in the bombing.
</P>
<P>
   A federal appellate court ruled in June that Fortier should have
been sentenced under involuntary man slaughter, rather than
first-degree murder, statutes. He has served the maximum 51 months
on the lesser crime.
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys for the bombing survivors contend, however, that U.S.
District Judge Thomas VanBebbee has the latitude to resentence
Fortier Oct. 8 to the original 12 years, given the extraordinary
nature of the truck-bomb attack and death toll.
</P>
<P>
   There are other issues to sort out if Fortier is released:
</P>
<P>
   Will he be able to profit from the bombing with a book or TV con
tract? Shortly after the bombing, he boasted to friends of his
desire to make money from his knowledge of events leading up to the
attack.
</P>
<P>
   How much money in fines and restitution will he have to pay? He
originally was assessed a $200,000 fine and ordered to make $4,100
in restitution to Roger Moore of Ar kansas, whose gun collection
was stolen by Nichols to get money for bomb materials.
</P>
<P>
   Will Fortier hide out in the federal witness protection program?
Death threats against Fortier, his family and attorney Michael
McGuire have been commonplace.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he walks, and I hope it won't be in Oklahoma, I want him to
live his life with his own name so we can all see what happens to
him,'' said Cash, who was working on the fifth floor of the Murrah
building on the day of the bombing, April 19, 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Fortier, who allowed McVeigh to occasionally live in his
Kingman-area trailer in the two years after they both got out of
the Army, was convicted of conspiracy and trans portation of stolen
weapons, lying to the FBI and not telling law officers of McVeigh's
bombing plans.
</P>
<P>
   How deeply involved Fortier was has been a subject of
conjecture.
</P>
<P>
   In one court document, U.S. Attor ney Patrick Ryan noted that
Fortier ``did not willfully agree to use a weapon of mass
destruction'' while at the same time ``took action including the
transportation and sale of stolen firearms that facilitated the
bombing conspiracy.''
</P>
<P>
   That's an extremely fine line, families of the bombing victims
say.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyway you look at it, he's basi cally a co-conspirator,''
said Marsha Kight, whose daughter died in the blast. ``We want him
to do the entire 12 years, but it's so frustrating because even the
federal government wants to adjust his sentence down ward.''
</P>
<P>
   Four months before the bombing, Fortier accompanied McVeigh to a
storage shed in Council Grove, Kan., where he left 20 to 25 guns
stolen from Moore. The two also stopped in downtown Oklahoma City,
where McVeigh detailed his bombing plans. Back in Kingman, McVeigh
stacked soup cans on the trailer floor to demonstrate how he would
build the bomb.
</P>
<P>
   But there were many problems be tween Fortier and McVeigh.
</P>
<P>
   Fortier rejected McVeigh's offer to join the conspiracy in
September 1994. Fortier later refused to go with McVeigh to the
desert to test the detonation of a milk jug filled with ammonium
nitrate.
</P>
<P>
   While living with the Fortiers much of the time in the two
months before the bombing, McVeigh unsuccess fully tried to recruit
Fortier, court records say.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, McVeigh moved to sev eral Kingman hotels and cut off
contact with Fortier.

BRITAIN'S NATIONAL GRID TO SEEK MORE ACQUISITIONAS IN U.S. 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Northeast, Ore., Britain)   (bl)  
 By AGIS SALPUKAS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ David H. Jones, the group chief executive of National
Grid Group PLC of Britain, which has already agreed to buy a large
utility in New England, said Thursday that his company would seek
more acquisitions in the Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   He said in an interview that he would not begin his drive to
gain control of other utilities in the region until the Securities
and Exchange Commission approved his company's agreement, announced
in December, to acquire the New England Electric System for $3.2
billion. He added that he expected approval by early next year.
</P>
<P>
   Jones said his company was not yet negotiating with utilities in
the Northeast but that his staff was gathering background on
companies that he might want to acquire.
</P>
<P>
   Jones was in New York on Thursday to attend a ceremony listing
National Grid Group's American depository receipts on the New York
Stock Exchange. ADRs of National Grid rose $3.75 Thursday, to
$38.125.
</P>
<P>
   The foray of National Grid, Britain's largest power-transmission
company, into New England was one of the first significant moves by
British utilities to bring their experience in coping with
deregulation to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The drive to open utilities to competition in the United States
has been slower and more limited than in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Thinking that they had an advantage, companies like National
Grid and Scottish Power PLC are seeking to build their presence in
the United States, particularly in regions where the states are
deregulating the utility industry.
</P>
<P>
   Scottish Power distributes electricity throughout Britain and is
in the midst of a drive to become a big seller of power to
consumers not in its traditional territory.
</P>
<P>
   The company on Thursday won approval from Oregon regulators to
buy Pacificorp for $6.4 billion, a deal that was announced in
December. There are other regulatory hurdles, however.
</P>
<P>
   Scottish Power wants Pacificorp, which is based in Portland,
Ore., for its coal-fired plants, which produce cheap power that can
be marketed to Western states like California as they open their
markets to outside competitors.
</P>
<P>
   National Grid's strategy is different in that it will primarily
distribute electricity and other services to customers in the
Northeast. In acquiring New England Electric, National Grid will
gain control of a large transmission system. In addition, New
England Electric announced in February that it would acquire
Eastern Utilities Associates for $634 million. That will result in
a combined company that has 1.6 million customers in Massachusetts,
Rhode Island and New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   Jones said the goal was to bring down the operating costs of the
utilities once they were merged.
</P>
<P>
   He said that his company had found many ways to get more
electricity to flow through existing lines by upgrading equipment
and using ways of servicing the system without shutting down power
lines.
</P>
<P>
   Under one method used in Britain, line workers are suspended
from helicopters and work on power lines while electricity keeps
flowing.

HEALTH PLANS DEPICT LAWYERS AS THREAT 
</HEADLINE>
  (With CONGRESS-HEALTH) 
(js) 
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   This is a new 30-second commercial that the American Association
of Health Plans, the major managed care industry group, began
broadcasting in Washington this week. The commercial focuses on the
right to sue, the most contentious provision in the main patients
rights' bill, sponsored by Rep. John D. Dingell, D-Mich., and Rep.
Charlie Norwood, R-Ga.
</P>
<P>
   Producer:
</P>
<P>
   Mark Goodin and The Murphy Pintak Gautier Hudome Agency Inc.
</P>
<P>
   On the Screen:
</P>
<P>
   The commercial opens with ominous music that instantly stirs
memories of the movie ``Jaws.'' A shark is swimming through a
school of fish toward a camera. The camera zooms in on the shark
surfacing, then fades to black. A shot of the Capitol appears, with
the urging to ``call Congress today.'' That image is replaced by a
shark devouring bloody bait. The shark swims off, and the screen
fades to black.
</P>
<P>
   The Script:
</P>
<P>
   Announcer: ``America's richest trial lawyers are circling _ and
your health plan is the bait. Trial lawyers are pressuring Congress
for new ways to sue your health plan. Think that won't hurt you?
Better think again. If trial lawyers get their way, health care for
millions of Americans could simply disappear. Call Congress today.
Tell them to protect your family's health care from the trial
lawyer feeding frenzy. Because if the trial lawyers win, working
families lose.''
</P>
<P>
   Accuracy:
</P>
<P>
   The managed care industry asserts that the Dingell-Norwood bill,
by opening the industry to expensive lawsuits, would increase the
cost of insurance and thus result in a loss of coverage, because
employers would drop it or employees would decide it was too
costly.
</P>
<P>
   The Congressional Budget Office, analyzing an earlier patients'
rights bill, estimated that it would raise premium costs by 4.8
percent a month over five years, with the right to sue accounting
for 1.4 percent of that. (The monthly cost for an individual with
group coverage in 1999 was about $170.) Norwood estimates that his
bill would raise costs by an average of 3 percent a month. Diane
Rowland, an analyst at the Kaiser Family Foundation, a health
research group, said other studies had suggested that a right to
sue could result in a ``very, very modest cost increase in
premiums.''
</P>
<P>
   Scorecard:
</P>
<P>
   The managed care industry is trying to redefine a brutal
political battle that has allowed supporters of patients' rights to
seize the populist high ground. Those supporters have argued that
health maintenance organizations and other health plans ought to be
held accountable _ in court, if need be _ when they deny needed
care and a patient suffers as a result. But this commercial argues
that health plans are not the enemy _ lawyers are. The commercial
argues that those lawyers, in the primal image of the shark, will
enrich themselves in lawsuits to the point where health insurance
will simply become too expensive for ``working families.'' The
industry lost a major battle with the House passage of the
Dingell-Norwood bill Thursday, and this commercial begins to frame
the issue for the conference committee, where the measure is to be
reconciled with the Senate version. &QL;

GADZURIC BACK, BUT ARE HIS KNEES?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Bruins began their preseason conditioning
program Monday afternoon with center Dan Gadzuric, tender knees and
all, darting around Pauley Pavilion with his teammates. How long
that lasts may determine the course of UCLA's season.
</P>
<P>
   Potentially, Gadzuric is one of the most dominating players in
the Pac-10. He's a 6-10 sophomore with a hulking presence and
extraordinary athleticism. But Gadzuric has the knees of someone
twice his age, with chronic tendinitis in both and surgically
repaired meniscus in his left.
</P>
<P>
   ``Structurally, his (left) knee is fine in terms of recovering
from the surgery,'' Bruins coach Steve Lavin said. ``The tendinitis
is something he'll have to learn to cope with.''
</P>
<P>
   Gadzuric, who averaged 8.6 points and 5.7 rebounds, tore the
lateral mensicus in practice Feb. 24. He had arthroscopic surgery
the next day and missed the NCAA Tournament loss to Detroit. He
recovered in time to attend two summer camps for big men and, for
the moment, he's at full speed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a catch-22,'' Lavin said. ``If he does too much, he'll
wear his knees out. But he has to do enough to stay sharp.''
</P>
<P>
   Good and bad: NCAA rules prohibit conditioning programs until
fall classes begin. For UCLA, that's this week _ meaning the Bruins
are 4-6 weeks behind semester-system schools such as Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins will have just two weeks of conditioning before
practice starts Oct. 16.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are two ways to look at it,'' Lavin said. ``When you win
the national championship, people say it's because UCLA was fresher
late in the season. When you lose in the first round, people say
UCLA wasn't in as good condition.''
</P>
<P>
   Back and bigger: Sophomore guard Billy Knight spent last season
lifting weights and recovering from a groin injury. He has returned
15 pounds bigger and a step quicker.
</P>
<P>
   ``His redshirt year really helped,'' Lavin said. ``He worked as
hard as anybody in the offseason.''
</P>
<P>
   Roster stuff: Junior forward Todd Ramasar may miss the season
because of an injured left shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   Ramasar, junior Ryan Bailey and senior Sean Farnham are on
scholarship this season.
</P>
<P>
   Recruiting update: The Bruins have three scholarships available
as the 1999-2000 recruiting season heats up, but that would change
if Gadzuric and 6-10 forward Jerome Moiso turn pro.

   Lavin's emphasis is frontcourt players _ including Bill Walton's
son, Chris _ but the Bruins will be highly selective. The junior
class is one of the best in Southern California in years, and UCLA
already has a commitment from Mater Dei junior guard Cedric
Bozeman.

   ``We've got nine perimeter guys and three post players,'' Lavin

are 6-10 or bigger.'' &QL;

ASTROS LOOK TO HAMPTON TO SHUT DOWN BRAVES
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   HOUSTON _ Back on their home field, and with their best pitcher
ready, the Houston Astros said Thursday that they liked their
position heading into Friday's encounter with the Atlanta Braves.
</P>
<P>
   With the best-of-5 series tied, 1-1, the Astros will send Mike
Hampton to the mound shortly after 4 p.m. Eastern time. Game 3 has
all the makings of a pitcher's duel, with Hampton (22-4), a Cy
Young Award candidate, opposing Tom Glavine (14-11), a two-time Cy
Young winner who has won his last eight decisions at the Astrodome.
</P>
<P>
   For the Astros, the outcome will be an emotional lift or a
severe blow. Houston was 29-5 this season when Hampton started, and
manager Larry Dierker struggled to think of another pitcher he
would prefer to have for an important game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe Bob Gibson in his prime,'' Dierker said with a smile.
``Mike's our guy, the guy we usually win with. We've got good
pitching, but if you ask the guys out on the field who they feel
most comfortable with, I think they'd say Hampton.''
</P>
<P>
   A 27-year-old left-hander with excellent control, Hampton
elevated himself this year to the level of the game's best
pitchers. He had an 11-game winning streak, the longest in the
major leagues, and since June 4 has gone 17-2.
</P>
<P>
   Hampton won his only start against the Braves this season, 10-4,
and the Braves touched him for three runs in seven innings. But
that was in May. The atmosphere Friday will be far more intense,
and Hampton was looking forward to the challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a pressure situation, it's easy to get up,'' he said. ``If
you do well, you look great. If not, you look like a guy that's
choked. It's a double-edged sword. Those are the ones that test
your character.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astros will also be tested by Glavine, who knows how to win
big games. With his lengthy winning streak in the Astrodome, how
sad will Glavine be to see the Astros move into a new stadium next
year?
</P>
<P>
   ``For selfish reasons, I'm disappointed to see it go,'' Glavine
said of the Astrodome. ``I've had good success there. That's one of
the few parks you go into and feel like it's more of a pitcher's
advantage than a hitter's advantage.''
</P>
<P>
   Without question, Atlanta's past success against Houston is
another obstacle for the Astros to overcome. The Braves were 6-1
overall against Houston this season, and 3-1 in the Astrodome. The
Braves retain the swagger and confidence that comes from winning
eight division championships in the 1990s, and with John Smoltz
scheduled to pitch Game 4, the Braves have another top-flight
pitcher waiting no matter what happens on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've said all along that this series is going to be tough for
us, because they play well in our park,'' Dierker said. ``This is a
pitcher's park and they're a pitching team.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the Astros Thursday refused to believe that Atlanta held the
psychological edge. Houston has been eliminated in the first round
of the playoffs the last two years, but after splitting the first
two games of this series in Atlanta, the Astros believe they are in
position to pull off an upset.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would've been nice to win both games in Atlanta, but
looking at the big picture, that may have been a little
unrealistic,'' said Ken Caminiti, the third baseman, who has hit a
home run in each of the last two games. ``Winning Game 1 is
important, and I don't think anyone on our team is thinking about
what has happened in the past. We're loose and we're playing good
baseball. We're facing a great team, but we feel very good about
ourselves.''  &QL;

AD COLUMN: SEPHORA PLANS A CAMPAIGN TO RAISE ITS PROFILE AMONG
CONSUMERS. 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 BY STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Through the centuries, beauty has inspired philosophical musings
from ``Beauty's but skin deep'' (John Davies of Hereford, 1616) to
``Beauty is in the eye of the beholder'' (Margaret Wolfe
Hungerford, 1878) to ``Beauty's where you find it'' (Madonna,
1990). Now comes an advertising and marketing blitz seeking to add
``Beauty is how you see it'' to that list of pithy sayings.
</P>
<P>
   The phrase is the theme of an ambitious campaign to raise
awareness for Sephora, a nontraditional retailer owned since 1997
by the luxury goods powerhouse LVMH-Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton.
Sephora specializes in selling higher-priced cosmetics and
fragrances in ways intended to be significantly different from the
conventional methods of department stores.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, at Sephora's 219 stores in Europe and the United
States, products are arranged alphabetically rather than segregated
by manufacturer, the popular promotional tool known as ``gift with
purchase'' has been eliminated and customers are encouraged to
sample items like lipstick.
</P>
<P>
   Sephora and the New York office of DDB Worldwide Communications
Group, the Omnicom Group unit that became the retailer's agency
early last month, are introducing the campaign to coincide with two
events planned for October 14: the opening of a big store in
Rockefeller Center in Manhattan and the revamping of the Sephora
World Wide Web site (www.sephora.com) to add electronic commerce
abilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been very effective in public relations but were
reluctant to invest much in advertising,'' said Howard Meitiner,
president and chief executive for the Sephora Americas and
Asian-Pacific operations, who is based in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``But with the advent of the E-commerce site, the competitive
marketplace and our opening larger, more important stores,'' he
added, ``we found it was time to take our message to the
consumer.''
</P>
<P>
   Sephora plans to spend $25 million on the campaign, which began
last week with ``teaser'' ads and is scheduled to run for 16
months. DDB was selected after a review that began in early summer,
which involved asking several agencies for ideas.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign proposed by DDB ``distanced itself from all the
others presented to us to such a degree that they immediately
became the front-runner,'' said Steve Bock, executive vice
president for merchandising and marketing at Sephora.
</P>
<P>
   ``They instantly understood the concept of Sephora,'' he added.
``We didn't want ads with another beautiful woman. We wanted
something as distinctive as Sephora.''
</P>
<P>
   The DDB idea was to center the campaign on images resembling the
inkblots familiar from Rorschach tests, reproduced in a spectrum of
colors representing the colors found in the Sephora stores and
products.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Rorschach represents the personal interpretation of
beauty,'' said Di Walker, the associate creative director at DDB
who is the art director on the campaign. ``The power is in the
individual.''
</P>
<P>
   To test whether the inkblots were too ethereal, nebulous or
complicated for a sales pitch, Ms. Walker and Kate Murphy _ her
copywriter partner on the campaign, also an associate creative
director at DDB _ showed mock-ups of the ads to Manhattan
pedestrians.
</P>
<P>
   ``People knew they were supposed to `see' into them,'' Ms.
Murphy said. ``Some saw a turtle, some a face.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was fun,'' she added, ``and it helped us refine the
campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   The ersatz Rorschachs _ say that three times fast _ are
accompanied by brief sentences meant to reflect that ``there's a
mystery surrounding Sephora because it's a new concept,'' Ms.
Murphy said.
</P>
<P>
   For example, one ad asks: ``Have you ever wondered what other
people see? Does it really matter?'' A second ad declares ``What's
so amazing about you is that no one else is.'' A third promises
that Sephora stores offer ``hundreds of skin care lines, an
infinite number of cosmetics and your imagination.''
</P>
<P>
   One ad, devoted to the Web site, declares that it offers
``virtually every'' product in categories like eye shadow, nail
color and fragrance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We carry products from around the world,'' said Jim Kenney,
acting chief executive at Sephora.com. ``We're celebrating global
culture.''
</P>
<P>
   The inkblot is ``a global symbol of self-interpretation,'' he
added, ``that will catch people's eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   The campaign, which will run in metropolitan New York and in
national media, includes television commercials; ads in magazines
like Details, Elle, Interview, Harper's Bazaar, Marie Claire, New
York, Paper, Vogue and YM; posters on telephone kiosks, buses and
taxicabs; postcard ads from Max Racks and Hot Stamps, and inkblot
images projected onto buildings by a company called Off the Wall
Projections.
</P>
<P>
   The new Rockefeller Center store, at 21,000 square feet, is
intended to be the Sephora worldwide flagship outlet. It is one of
37 stores in this country; plans call for more than 50 to be open
by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Sephora has two other stores in Manhattan. The first opened last
year in SoHo and the second opened last week in Times Square, next
to the new street-front studio for ABC's ``Good Morning America.''
</P>
<P>
   There is little concern about the midtown Sephora stores being
so close to each other, given that retailers like Gap and Starbucks
can be found every few blocks in crowded urban markets.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the chains can merge to form a retail giant,
Gaphorbucks.

CLINTON MOVES TO CURB DEVELOPMENT ON NATIONAL FOREST LAND 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Western states, Va., W.Va.)   (bl)  
 By DAVID STOUT   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton wants the Forest Service to draft
a plan to protect up to 40 million acres of national forest land in
35 states from commercial development, a White House official said
Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   The official said the president would announce the plan next
week. It will be in the form of a directive that requires no
approval from Congress, although some lawmakers from Western states
are almost certain to try to undo the directive by legislation, the
official said.
</P>
<P>
   The official said Clinton was taking the action ``to preserve a
lot of pristine forest that might otherwise be turned into
something else.'' The proposal would be a major initiative in land
preservation.
</P>
<P>
   The president's intentions were reported in Thursday's
Washington Post.
</P>
<P>
   The official said the lands in question were ``spread out across
the country'' and included some tracts in Virginia and West
Virginia. But vast stretches of the forest territories lie in the
West, and a plan to keep them away from loggers and builders is
sure to foment spirited debate over the environment vs. the economy
and the federal government's right to tell states how to treat land
within their borders.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's directive to the Forest Service will ask for an
environmental analysis on how best to safeguard those reaches of
forest land still undeveloped, the White House official said. He
said the president's decision was not motivated by a desire to
protect endangered birds or animals but simply to leave as big a
legacy of unspoiled land as he could.
</P>
<P>
   Forest land that is still undeveloped, or ``roadless,'' is often
the most valuable to the timber industry. Conversely, many
environmentalists say that keeping forests empty of roads is the
best way to keep them full of trees.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, members of Congress from Western states have
complained bitterly about economic hardships that they say are
caused by conservation-minded politicians who know too little of
life outside of Washington, let alone far west of the Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is scheduled to visit the George Washington National
Forest in Virginia on Wednesday, and the White House official said
the announcement might be made then.

 By GINIA BELLAFANTE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ There are always big thoughts to think as a fashion
season winds down: how designers translated the work of their
predecessors, which editors had the newest Prada bags a dozen hours
after they appeared on the runway, how Ivana Trump (seated in the
front row Wednesday) would look in Alexander McQueen's studded
wrestling helmet for Givenchy.
</P>
<P>
   But the question that usually trumps the others boils down to
sex and to what extent designers read and misread how adventurously
women want to emphasize it. At a basic level, fashion offers women
a range of sexual poses _ ravenous, assured, aloof, hesitant,
indifferent. As the spring collections conclude here Friday, after
a week of hot pants, lace-up stiletto boots and halter tops, it
would be easy to say that those who showed had a narrow idea _ a
very ``Cinemax late at night'' idea _ of how a woman wants to
present herself.
</P>
<P>
   But that would be a lazy statement. McQueen at Givenchy and
Stella McCartney at Chloe put sex in the forefront, but they did so
in a considered, literate way that many young American designers
can't quite manage. By comparison, the clothes that fill the
boutiques of NoLIta in Manhattan seem as sophisticated as a
Tupperware party: sequined knee-length skirts and dainty
three-quarter-sleeve cardigans, the kinds of clothes that young
women reading ``The Girls' Guide to Hunting and Fishing'' would
wear to impress their girlfriends.
</P>
<P>
   McQueen's Givenchy show created a world of invulnerability.
Turning the Carrousel du Louvre into a mock high-school gym,
McQueen played with a notion of cool sexual bravura, the kind you
might see among teen-age girls riding the subway after school. They
own the town, they intimate, and you wish you could, too.
</P>
<P>
   McQueen's missteps _ bright yellow mesh athletic wear, that
goofy wrestling helmet _ might be written off as building blocks
for his message. Above it all were his confident suits, with their
masterly cuts, along with lots of leather and sleek racing
sweaters.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble is that the atmosphere McQueen creates at his shows
is so at odds with that of the Givenchy stores. Entering the
Givenchy shop on the Rue du Faubourg-St.-Honore after seeing his
show is like going to a Marilyn Manson concert, then visiting the
singer at home, only to find that he lives in a chintz-splattered
colonial in Scarsdale. The shop is stuffy and unhip, to say the
least, and appears to have little of what's shown on the runway.
</P>
<P>
   A few hours before the Givenchy show, Ms. McCartney sent out a
collection for Chloe that in the hands of many other designers
would make women look as though they ``date,'' in the 10th Avenue
sense of the word. Ms. McCartney offered more of the glamorously
tailored wide-bottom trousers and delicate dresses for which she is
famous. But more strikingly, mere strings of fake diamonds were
turned into bare tops and tight, frayed white-denim short shorts.
Silk halters were done up with fake jewels, too.
</P>
<P>
   How she didn't fall off the balance beam is a bit of a mystery,
but it might have something to do with the fact that Ms. McCartney
has a keen understanding of the contemporary young woman _ and a
sense of humor, too. She knows that sometimes women want to be
objectified. Why else would they wear strips of jewelry over their
breasts and think they were sufficiently clothed to leave the
house? But she also knows that they want to  &UR; appear &LR;  as if they're
above all that. So throw on some white jeans with that racy top,
which is how Ms. McCartney presented it.
</P>
<P>
   Her ironic take on the whole subject came through in T-shirts
that depicted bent-kneed topless women, the kind that might be
tattooed on the arm of a longshoreman.
</P>
<P>
   When Rei Kawakubo of Comme des Garcons presented her show
earlier in the week, it wasn't sex that was on the program _ that's
not her metier _ but femininity. In recent seasons, she has
increasingly explored notions of what the world interprets as
feminine. On Tuesday, she showed a collection striking in its
wonderfully saturated colors: deep pinks, purples, bright greens.
Central, too, were elaborate ruffles resembling the crepe paper
flowers schoolchildren make.
</P>
<P>
   As always, Ms. Kawakubo's clothes left one to marvel at how they
were made. She applied her inventive spirit to patterns, lining
jackets and coats with fabric cut larger than the exteriors and
scrunching it underneath. The resulting garments almost appeared to
be blossoming.
</P>
<P>
   Femininity was what Martine Sitbon, a minimalist at heart, aimed
for, too. Before her show Wednesday, she said she wanted to capture
the sense of possibility young women feel before they go out at
night. ``It's exactly the moment when girls are together, putting
on their makeup, and they don't know what will happen,'' she said.
``I wanted this collection to be happy.''
</P>
<P>
   The sorority sister, ``maybe I'll meet Johnny Depp tonight,''
mood was not achieved, however. Ms. Sitbon, who had stunning
clothes in her fall collection, showed somber skirts, geometric
satin patchwork jackets and dresses that looked as though they were
forcing themselves to have a good time. Some of the clothes were
styled with blue pantyhose that would surely make the wearer feel
out of place at a party rather than the life of it.
</P>
<P>
   If anyone understands what it means to be the life of the party
it is Emanuel Ungaro, who spent the 1970s feverishly mixing prints
for women who probably didn't go anywhere that wasn't Biarritz. The
Ungaro woman lived for the action, and if a shadily financed
boyfriend was picking up the checks, well, all the better. With
Donna Summer blaring, Ungaro re-embraced the world of the revolving
mirrored ball. There were big tropical prints and polka dots, lots
of asymmetrical chiffon. Disco can be an objectionable subject, but
there's something harmless, altogether honest, about someone like
Ungaro invoking it. ``I'm reviving myself,'' he joked at his
atelier the day before the show.
</P>
<P>
   Sexiness that's elegant seems to be the goal of Cristina Ortiz,
a former Prada designer who has been redirecting the house of
Lanvin. Ms. Ortiz seemed freed a bit from her rigid shapes of last
season. Her show Wednesday offered fitted red cotton dresses and
coats, some bare backs, low-slung trousers and a beautiful skirt
made up of thin, glimmering triangular tiles. A woman would not go
to Lanvin to outfit her wildest self, but if that unabashed self
isn't surfacing as much as it used to, a pair of Ms. Ortiz's
needlepoint hip-huggers might be just bold enough.

WELDON CASE, 78, FORMER CHAIRMAN AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF ALLTEL 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By SAUL HANSELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Weldon W. Case, the former chairman and chief executive of the
Alltel Corp., died on Sept. 30 at Boca Raton Community Hospital in
Florida. He was 78 and lived in Boca Raton.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was heart failure, an Alltel spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
   Case was born in Hudson, Ohio, where his family owned the local
telephone company. In 1910, his grandfather, Weldon C. Wood, was
among the first telephone company executives to bury phone cables
underground rather than hang them on poles.
</P>
<P>
   Case joined the company, the Hudson Underground Telephone Co.,
at 14 as a member of the line crew and worked his way up to general
manager and president. Hudson Underground eventually became known
as the Western Reserve Telephone Co.
</P>
<P>
   The days of the independent small-town operator, however, were
numbered. In 1960, Case combined five small Ohio telephone
companies into a holding company called Mid-Continent Telephone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expect the attrition of smaller companies to continue at an
even smarter pace,'' he told the New York Society of Security
Analysts in 1963. At that point, Mid-Continent owned nine Ohio
companies that served 95,000 homes.
</P>
<P>
   In 1983, it merged with the Allied Telephone Co. of Little Rock,
Ark., forming Alltel. Case was chairman and chief executive until
he retired in 1991. At that point, the company had a million
customers in 19 states.
</P>
<P>
   Case attended Case Institute of Technology and Ohio Wesleyan
University.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Beatrice Kuhn Case; two brothers,
Nelson H. Case and Theodore H. Case, both of Carmel, Calif.; two
sons, Thomas W. Case of Little Rock and William R. Case of
Columbus, Ohio; four grandchildren, and three great-grandchildren. &QL;

DEVILS' GOALIE EJECTED IN 7-5 LOSS TO PENGUINS
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ In their first meeting since the
elimination of the New Jersey Devils by the Pittsburgh Penguins in
the first round of the playoffs last spring, New Jersey lost its
goaltender to an ejection early, then spent the rest of the game
trying to catch up as the Penguins went on to a 7-5 victory
Thursday night before a Continental Arena crowd of 17,507.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Brodeur, the goaltender, slashed Matthew Barnaby in the
late stages of the first period and was ejected for the first time
in his career. The Devils, in their home opener, fell behind twice
by two goals and failed to fully recover.
</P>
<P>
   Brad Bombardir, Bobby Holik, Jason Arnott, Brian Rolston and
Sergei Brylin scored the goals for the Devils, who are now even for
the season after winning the season opener last Saturday in
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Alexsei Morozov led the Penguins with a natural hat trick, the
first of his career, before the game was 12 minutes 39 seconds old.
</P>
<P>
   Jiri Slegr, Jaromir Jagr, Robert Lang and Alexsei Kovalev also
scored goals for the Penguins, who also lost their starting
goaltender, Tom Barrasso, in the first period, to a knee injury.
</P>
<P>
   Brodeur was given a five-minute major and a game misconduct for
slashing Barnaby to the right of the net in a sequence in which
Barnaby and Brodeur collided behind the goal with 5:28 left in the
first period.
</P>
<P>
   Brodeur's ejection came after he faced eight shots and allowed
three goals, all to Morozov, who registered his hat trick in a span
from 5:27 to 12:39. It was the first hat trick in Morozov's career
and the first the Devils allowed at home since Mario Lemieux's, on
Oct. 28, 1995, in a 5-3 loss to the Penguins.
</P>
<P>
   Barrasso aggravated his knee 8:22 into the game, when he
sprawled to his left with a crowd in front. Barrasso allowed a goal
on two shots and his place was taken by Peter Skudra, who was
Barrasso's backup last season.
</P>
<P>
   Morozov's first goal of the season matched Bombardir's goal for
New Jersey, which came 36 seconds into the game on a blast from the
right circle that beat Barrasso on the first shot he faced.
</P>
<P>
   A giveaway by the Devils in their zone led to Morozov's second
goal, 11:44 into the period. Morozov completed his hat trick 54
seconds later with a backhander immediately after Robert Lang won a
faceoff from Sergei Nemchinov.
</P>
<P>
   Holik narrowed the gap for the Devils with his third goal of the
season, at 2:35 of the middle session, on a second effort in front
of Skudra. But the Penguins widened the lead to two goals again 37
seconds later, with Slegr's first of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Power-play goals by Arnott and Rolston just over two minutes
apart tied the score for the Devils. Arnott's came on a two-man
advantage as the Penguins kept taking penalty after penalty.
Pittsburgh incurred five minor penalties in five minutes midway
through the period and paid the price. Jagr and Lang scored their
first goals of the season late in the second period to re-establish
a two goal lead for the Penguins, 6-4, as the wild game swung into
the the third period.

E.C. BANFIELD, 83, MAVERICK ON URBAN POLICY ISSUES, DIES 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By RICHARD BERNSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Edward C. Banfield, a professor emeritus of government at
Harvard University whose work on urban policy and the causes of
poverty gave him a reputation as a brilliant maverick, died Sept.
30 at his summer home in Vermont. He was 83 and lived in Cambridge,
Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Banfield, born on a farm in Bloomfield, Conn., held Harvard's
Henry Lee Shattuck Chair in government for many years. He was one
of the intellectual leaders of the Harvard-Massachusetts Institute
of Technology Joint Center for Urban Studies in the 1960's and
70's, when the problems of cities were prominent on the national
political agenda.
</P>
<P>
   His books and articles had a sharp contrarian edge. He was a
critic of almost every mainstream liberal idea in domestic policy,
especially the use of federal aid to help relieve urban poverty.
Banfield argued that at best government programs would fail because
they aimed at the wrong problems; at worst they would make the
problems worse. He fostered generations of graduate students, some
of whom became leading figures in American intellectual life. They
included James Q. Wilson, who succeeded him in his chair at
Harvard, and Christopher DeMuth, president of the American
Enterprise Institute in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Banfield received his B.A. in English from the University of
Connecticut in 1938 and went to work for the U.S. Forest Service.
After jobs with the New Hampshire Farm Bureau and the United States
Farm Security Administration in Washington and California, he went
to the University of Chicago to work on his doctorate in political
science. Chicago at that time, under the influence of figures like
Milton Friedman and Leo Strauss, was a bastion of laissez-faire
politics, a cause that Banfield later promoted in his own work.
</P>
<P>
   He served briefly on the faculty in Chicago, moving to Harvard
in 1959. He taught at the University of Pennsylvania before
returning to Harvard at the end of his career.
</P>
<P>
   In 1955 Banfield and Meyerson collaborated on ``Politics,
Planning and the Public Interest,'' which examined Chicago's public
housing projects. That book was one of several in which Banfield
found government programs to be foiled by a law of unintended
consequences. In the Chicago case, he predicted that creating tall
institutional buildings full of small apartments would have the
unintended effect of racially isolating the urban poor.
</P>
<P>
   A major theme of Banfield's work on poverty, which was often
angrily criticized in liberal circles, is that culture plays a more
important role than factors like discrimination or lack of
education in impeding a person's economic progress.
</P>
<P>
   Among his most influential books was ``The Moral Basis of a
Backward Society,'' a study of a small village in southern Italy,
researched in collaboration with his wife, the former Laura Fasano.
Banfield's thesis, summed up in a term he coined, ``amoral
familism,'' was that the narrow focus on family relations prevented
people from cooperating with those outside the family or village.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife; a daughter, Laura Banfield Hoguet, a
lawyer; a son, Elliott A. Banfield, an illustrator, and four
grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Banfield's emphasis on culture as the basic element in poverty
drew accusations that he was promoting a ``blame the victim''
attitude. In his 1970 book ``The Unheavenly City,'' and in various
papers that he published in the late 60s, he recognized the
existence and harm of racism but propounded the view that economic
class and not race was the essential ingredient in poverty.
</P>
<P>
   In that book Banfield constructed a sociological portrait of
what he called ``the lower-class individual'' as someone who was
very different from the middle-class professionals who sought ways
to solve his problems. ``The lower-class individual lives moment to
moment,'' he wrote. ``Impulse governs his behavior either because
he cannot discipline himself to sacrifice a present for a future
satisfaction or because he has no sense of the future. He is
therefore radically improvident.''
</P>
<P>
   Banfield's role as an adviser to President Richard Nixon and
chairman of his Model Cities Task Force gave his published views an
extra measure of controversy. During the Reagan administration he
served on a task force seeking ways to increase public support for
the arts. But his subsequent book, ``The Democratic Muse: Visual
Arts and the Public Interest,'' argued that federal support of the
arts was neither justified by the Constitution nor useful in
practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Affording enjoyment to people is not a proper function of
organizations serving the common good,'' he wrote in that book.

TOUCHDOWNS, BIG PLAYS PULL COWBOYS' ELLIS OUT OF HIS SHELL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CLARENCE E. HILL JR. 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ The differences between Greg Ellis' rookie
campaign in 1998 and his start to the 1999 season seem endless.
</P>
<P>
   Two-and-a-half sacks in three games make surpassing the
personally disappointing three he recorded last season virtually a
given.
</P>
<P>
   Two astonishing touchdown returns, an 87-yard interception jaunt
against the Falcons and a team-record 98-yard fumble rumble against
the Cardinals, have quieted the
Cowboys-should-have-picked-Vikings-receiver-Randy Moss talk.
</P>
<P>
   Ellis's defensive line mates have taken to calling him Mr. TD.
And Cowboys cornerback/punt returner/preacher Deion Sanders wants
to teach him a touchdown dance.
</P>
<P>
   However, the change Ellis likes best is at home, where his wife,
Tangie, no longer has to tiptoe around a sulking husband.
</P>
<P>
   Ellis _ respected so much by Texas coach Mack Brown (his former
college coach at North Carolina) that Brown said he would consider
allowing Ellis to adopt his children if something ever happened to
him and his wife _ knew he wasn't himself last season.
</P>
<P>
   He admitted his unyielding desire to succeed, the thought that
he was letting ``Mr. (Jerry) Jones'' down because of his paltry
sack totals after being the eighth pick in 1998 draft, and the Moss
reference drove him into a shell at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't go home yelling and screaming,'' Ellis said. ``I just
sheltered myself away and wanted to be alone. We've been together
since high school. She knows me. My actions and the way I would go
about things at home let her know I wasn't happy. I'm sure she got
tired of me crying about not getting enough sacks.''
</P>
<P>
   Three games into the 1999 season, he has come out of his shell.
His two touchdowns _ legendary Cowboys defensive ends Ed Jones and
Harvey Martin played a combined 26 seasons without scoring a
touchdown _ have turned him into an instant star.
</P>
<P>
   However, Ellis refuses to get caught up in the hype. He said he
understands that the season is young and that he has a long way to
go to reach his goal of becoming a Pro Bowl-caliber performer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those long runs capture the fans' attention,'' Ellis said.
``That's good. However, the most important thing is to improve as a
football player. I feel I'm making progress, getting more pressure
on the quarterback and everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Everything Ellis is doing is what the Cowboys coaches are noting
as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get a lot of notoriety for the big plays,'' Cowboys coach
Chan Gailey said. ``But the thing most impressive about Greg is how
he has really paid attention to the details of the position. He's
made dramatic improvement in a lot of areas.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of the improvement was expected, said Cowboys assistant
defensive line coach Jim Jeffcoat, who said better play was bound
to come from a player a year older and a year wiser in the league.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffcoat also emphasized that Ellis was far from a bust last
season when he became the first rookie defensive lineman to start
the season opener for the Cowboys since Hall of Fame member Bob
Lilly in 1961. Ellis started 16 games and became the first rookie
to lead the defensive line in tackles (63) and quarterback
pressures (22).
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys didn't seem to view the minuscule sack numbers as a
big deal either, considering that the defensive scheme called for
Ellis to focus on stopping the run rather than pressuring the
quarterback. Jeffcoat said Ellis, though listed as a defensive end,
was more of a ``third defensive tackle,'' positioned inside the
offensive tackle.
</P>
<P>
   Ellis repeatedly heard such rationale during the season and
during individual player evaluations after the playoff loss to the
Cardinals in January. However, the 6-foot-6, 286-pounder, who
surpassed Hall of Fame linebacker Lawrence Taylor as the all-time
sack leader at North Carolina, still played the shell game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just beat myself up,'' Ellis said. ``The coaches told me I
had a good rookie year. But I wasn't satisfied with it. I was like,
`Man I wanted to get more sacks.' I am really critical of myself.
I'm one of those guys that doesn't have to have a coach yelling in
his ear because I yell at myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Already considered a hard worker who avidly studies game film _
Ellis has a video library in his home of all his games and opposing
offensive tackles _ the personal dissatisfaction of his rookie
campaign resulted in an off-season of even harder work and more
study of film.
</P>
<P>
   Thinking he gained too much weight as a rookie, Ellis trimmed 10
pounds off his playing weight and reduced his 40-yard dash time
from 4.7 seconds to 4.6.
</P>
<P>
   ``The weight doesn't seem like a whole lot, but it is to me,''
Ellis said. ``I feel lighter.''
</P>
<P>
   Also helping hasten his improvement was the team's move back to
a traditional 4-3 defensive alignment from the overshifted 4-3
scheme they used last season. Jeffcoat said Ellis is succeeding
more because he is being used to his fullest ability.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got him in a position to attack the quarterback and be more
of a playmaker,'' Jeffcoat said. ``He's not in there battling a
340-pound tackle head up. He's on the edge outside the tight end or
the tackle like he was in college.''
</P>
<P>
   Ellis, who plays tackle in the Cowboys' nickel pass-rush unit,
has recorded 13 tackles, a forced fumble and four quarterback
pressures to go with the sacks and touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   But, more importantly, owner Jones' safe pick is no longer
considered a bust. Ellis has justified the Cowboys' faith that he
was not only the safe pick in the 1998 draft, but the right pick.
</P>
<P>
   Jones said Ellis is proving what the Cowboys always thought:
that he is a great player as well as a great person.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy with his play from the standpoint of him being the
eighth pick in the draft,'' Jones said. ``He makes us look good.
Greg Ellis is a player. He is going to be a great player for a long
time to come.''
</P>
<P>
   And for Tangie's sake, the shell game has ended. nn
