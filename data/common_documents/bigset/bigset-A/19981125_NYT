THANKSGIVING HOLIDAY CREATES PUMPKIN PIE PANIC FOR NON-BAKERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 &HT;    By GREGORY J. WILCOX  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Wait until Thanksgiving Day to snag a freshly
baked pumpkin pie and you may end up cooling your heels in line
while the pie is in the oven or, even worse, be forced to eat pound
cake from a convenience store.
</P>
<P>
   Credit that great holiday refrain -- ``leave room for some pie''
-- for turning a brown fruit dessert into a Thanksgiving must-have.
(Ever eat a pumpkin pie at a Fourth of July picnic or after Easter
dinner?)
</P>
<P>
   You can credit the pumpkin pie with spawning another tradition:
putting down a deposit on a pie and then waiting in a long line to
pick it up.
</P>
<P>
   That's right. Pumpkin pies are so popular, yet apparently too
much work for home bakers, that people will gladly line up to pick
up pies beginning this morning that they ordered and paid for
several days ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have lots of orders for (today) already,'' said Judy Brown,
who with her husband, Sheldon, owns Brown's Victory Bake Shop in
suburban North Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   The neighborhood shop, redolent with the aroma of pumpkin and
other baked goods this week, was busy Tuesday filling orders for
200 pies, most of them pumpkin.
</P>
<P>
   Brown recommends placing an advance order so a pie can be had
before the store closes tonight.
</P>
<P>
   ``It might be a good idea,'' she said. ``There is a possibility
we could run out of pies, but we keep them coming out of the oven
all day long, so we try to have them in stock.''
</P>
<P>
   Her husband was just one of the bakers across the city's San
Fernando Valley area up to their elbows in flour as they scrambled
to keep up with the pumpkin pie demand.
</P>
<P>
   Danny Klein, owner of Gelson's Pastry Shop, said he reached his
limit Tuesday. He can't take any more pie orders.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trouble is I don't have any place to put them,'' Klein
said. ``I'd love to take more orders, but I don't have any more
room for the pies.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, he's too busy to think about how many pies he has
baked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no idea,'' Klein said. ``Call me after the holiday and
I'll tell you.''
</P>
<P>
   Pam Dinkowitz, who with her husband, Steven, owns Classic Cakes
bakeries in suburban Porter Valley and Valencia, has been in the
business for 35 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a lot of people who reserve the pies, and then again
we have a lot of them on hand so people can walk in and pick up a
pumpkin pie,'' said Dinkowitz, who also has six other varieties on
hand.
</P>
<P>
   The store will go through about 800 pies, about half of which
have been pre-ordered. A baking crew came into work at 1 o'clock
this morning, and the ovens will stay hot until about 5 p.m. to
meet demand.
</P>
<P>
   For those who procrastinate until Thursday, Marie Callender's is
one of the few options. The restaurant chain, which has nine
eateries in the San Fernando Valley, will be winding down a pumpkin
pie baking marathon.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the company produces more pumpkin pies this time of
year than almost everyone.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Locke, senior vice president of food and beverages for the
company, said Marie Callender's ovens across Southern California
were turned on Tuesday night so bakers could work around the clock
to keep up with the Thanksgiving pie demand.
</P>
<P>
   About 750,000 pumpkin pies will be sold during the holiday, and
reservations are recommended.
</P>
<P>
   Pie pickup lines will probably spring up as early as this
afternoon. The lines are especially long between 8 and 11 a.m.
Thanksgiving Day, but walk-in customers will most likely be able to
get a pie.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because we are serving Thanksgiving dinner, we are using pies
for the restaurant, so we are baking them all through the day,''
Locke said. ``But the volume is so huge they could have to wait a
little bit, which no one wants to do.''
</P>
<P>
   The demand is so heavy that some former employees even show up
at various stores every Thanksgiving to help pass out the pies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of them are guys that the wife just wants out of the
house for the morning so she can cook, and this is a good place for
them to go,'' Locke said.

JOHNSON OFFERED 4-YEAR DODGERS DEAL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Los Angeles Dodgers added a fourth year
Tuesday to their contract offer for Randy Johnson, but the total
package of more than $52 million might not be enough to bring the
free-agent left-hander to Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels and Arizona Diamondbacks have made similar offers and
enjoy the advantage of ties to Johnson's home outside Phoenix. The
Angels hold spring training in nearby Mesa and the Diamondbacks
play less than 30 minutes away.
</P>
<P>
   But Dodgers general manager Kevin Malone, who spent Tuesday in
Arizona examining potential spring-training sites, said if his team
is out of the running, he hasn't been told.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talked to (Johnson's agent Alan Nero) this morning and if we
are no longer players, I haven't heard that,'' said Malone, who did
not meet with Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, who has said he wants a deal in place by the
Thanksgiving weekend, could make his decision today or Friday.
Despite a four-year, $50 million offer from Texas, Johnson has
hinted he does not want to play for the Rangers, who also train in
Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson went 10-1 with Houston after being acquired from Seattle
at the July 31 trading deadline. The Astros pulled out Tuesday
after refusing to budge on their three-year, $33 million proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to clearly take a fourth year to remain in this
competition,'' Astros general manager Gerry Hunsicker said. ``We
were not prepared to do so at this time.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's other agent, Barry Meister, said Tuesday from his
office in Chicago that the stakes have been raised.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to make it clear Randy is trying to sign with a club
where he is going to finish his career and we honestly believe
he'll play four more years,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the Dodgers' pitch to Johnson, 35, is the proposed
spring-training move to Arizona in 2000. Malone and club president
Bob Graziano flew to the Phoenix area Tuesday to examine a site in
Ft. McDowell, 15 miles north.
</P>
<P>
   Graziano has not decided where the club will hold spring
training after the 1999 season. He said Monday that all renovations
on Dodger Stadium have been postponed until after the club gets a
better grasp of its 1999 payroll, which is expected to pass $70
million.

MALL SANTAS MAY BE IN SHORT SUPPLY AS SEASONAL JOBS GO UNFILLED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ENRIQUE RIVERO  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Southern California's healthy economy is giving
retailers the holiday blues.
</P>
<P>
   With the economy in high gear and unemployment rates at
generational lows, retailers say their pool of job applicants for
temporary holiday retail jobs is as dry as Death Valley.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, hundreds -- maybe thousands -- of temp jobs are
going unfilled across the region, despite the ubiquitous ``Help
Wanted'' signs on storefronts along area boulevards and indoor
malls alike.
</P>
<P>
   All this has retailers afraid that they won't be able to find
enough qualified help to get them through the typically busy
holiday shopping season that will start Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Just how fearful are they?
</P>
<P>
   ``It even gets down to people being afraid there will be a
shortage of people to play Santa in the malls,'' said Jack Kyser,
chief economist for Los Angeles Economic Development Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Giss, a partner with the retail services group of the
accounting firm Deloitte &AMP; Touche LLP in Los Angeles, said the temp
jobs just aren't appealing to the vast majority of people who now
have good-paying, full-time jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got very low unemployment and these are temporary jobs
and they're relatively low-paying jobs,'' Giss said. ``With the
economy in good shape, they're less attractive and appealing than
they otherwise might be.''
</P>
<P>
   Retailers of every size are feeling the crunch, from small
independent operations to big chains like Target stores, a division
of Minneapolis-based Dayton Hudson Corp.
</P>
<P>
   For the past few years, the chain has started beefing up its
temporary holiday staff a little earlier in the year, said Target
spokeswoman Denise Workcuff. Each store typically hires between 50
and 150 employees for the holidays, most of them part time.
</P>
<P>
   This year the holiday hiring started in August.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always a challenge. This year it's going to be more of a
challenge than in years past,'' Workcuff said.
</P>
<P>
   Target has started offering a number of incentives to reel in
the applicants. For example, besides offering ``very flexible
hours,'' Target pays 50 cents to $1 an hour more for tough-to-staff
evening and weekend shifts, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's no more challenging for Target than it is for any other
retailer,'' Workcuff said. ``We're just trying to meet the
challenge by starting (hiring) earlier and trying to be more
creative.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past, it's taken Denise Williams only until about
mid-October to find all the holiday help she needed to work at her
Lavender's Hallmark store in the Sherman Oaks Fashion Square in
suburban Sherman Oaks.
</P>
<P>
   But here it is well into November and Williams has filled only
half of her six temporary slots -- which means she and her managers
have to come in to work up to two hours early each morning to get
things ready in time to open the doors.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a little more difficult; that's basically it,''
Williams said. ``There are no applicants, very few qualified
applicants.''
</P>
<P>
   She's not alone. Many of the 125 stores in the Sherman Oaks
Fashion Square are having a difficult time filling their temporary
holiday positions, said mall general manager Ruth Tewalt, who has
heard repeated complaints from store owners and managers about the
shortage of qualified help.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just walking through (the mall) you see the `Help Wanted'
signs,'' Tewalt said. ``That's the biggest indication that folks
are looking.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Target store in suburban Woodland Hills, about half of
the 60 or so temporary positions have been filled so far, said
store manager Joyce Atkinson. Many of them have been filled by high
school-age employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's more of an influx this year than in years past,'' she
said. ``They've worked out quite well for me.''
</P>
<P>
   The robust economy might not be entirely to blame. According to
Kyser, the holiday season typically generates 12,000 to 13,000
temporary jobs. But there are some 300,000 people in Los Angeles
County who are officially classified as unemployed.
</P>
<P>
   ``That means there should be a pretty decent labor pool,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   So why aren't more people diving in?
</P>
<P>
   ``In a lot of cases people are saying, If I do this, will this
take me away from my goal of finding a real full-time job?'' he
said. ``Whenever the economy is good, it makes it difficult for the
retailers.''
</P>
<P>
   Not all area retailers are finding themselves high and dry.
</P>
<P>
   One of the lucky ones is Dave Dutton, owner of Dutton's Books in
suburban Valley Village, Burbank and downtown Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Dutton gets plenty of people who've worked past holidays who are
eager to come back. And people who clerked in his stores as high
school students are returning during their holidays from college.
</P>
<P>
   He said he always tries to hold positions open for the veterans.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just seem to have a pretty good pool of college returnees
to draw from, and I haven't made any plans to take on any new
people,'' he said.

TERMINATOR HEADS FOR THEME PARK UNDER DEAL WITH UNIVERSAL STUDIOS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE McNARY  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Universal Studios Hollywood announced that it has
joined forces with director James Cameron to open a ``Terminator 2
3-D'' attraction at the theme park this spring.
</P>
<P>
   The project, a 12-minute sequel to Cameron's
robots-from-the-future blockbuster with live-action motorcycle
stunts and three 50-foot-wide screens, will be similar to the
highly successful Terminator 2 attraction that opened two years ago
at Universal's theme park in Orlando, Fla. Construction recently
started on the park's western side on the site of the Family
Challenge theater.
</P>
<P>
   Universal, which faces the task of distinguishing itself from
family-friendly Disney parks, noted that a recent Fodor's travel
guide called the Florida ``T2'' the world's best theme-park
attraction.
</P>
<P>
   ``The T2 in Florida is a fabulous convergence of digital film,
robotics and live action,'' said Tim O'Brien, Southeast editor at
Amusement Business magazine. ``It's the first time these elements
have been put together and it works very well. They even have a
character saying, I told you I'd be back.''
</P>
<P>
   ``T2 3-D,'' using technology developed at Cameron's Digital
Domain effects studio, will be the 18th attraction at the
California park and will seat 700 people at once. Cameron shot the
footage over two weeks at a deserted steel mill in Desert Center in
neighboring Riverside County.
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien said the attraction has helped boost attendance at the
Florida theme park, which hit 8.9 million last year, an impressive
tally but still lagging each of the three Disney theme parks in
Florida and Disneyland. Universal Studios Hollywood followed with
5.9 million, the magazine estimated.

EDITORIAL: TIME FOR A UNION TAKEOVER 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Wednesday, Nov. 25:
</P>
<P>
   New York City's largest union, District Council 37, is in a
colossal mess. The Manhattan district attorney, Robert Morgenthau,
is investigating charges against union officials ranging from
embezzlement to falsifying records to kickbacks for Thanksgiving
turkeys. Now comes an even more serious charge, of vote fraud in
the crucial 1996 ratification of an unpopular city contract. The
contract, which became the linchpin of Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's
budgetary and labor policy, imposed a two-year pay freeze on most
municipal workers.
</P>
<P>
   Stanley Hill, executive director of District Council 37,
announced that he had dismissed two top aides who knew about the
fraud. He also assured the 120,000 members of the council's local
unions that ``we will clean our own house and weather this storm.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, Hill's promises are too late and too weak for a
union that now needs some real industrial-strength cleaning from
the District Council 37's parent union, the American Federation of
State, County and Municipal Employees. Although none of these
charges have touched Hill directly, the parent union's trusteeship
of District Council 37 is necessary to revamp the union's feeble
governing structures and to find a stronger, reform-minded leader.
</P>
<P>
   The vote fraud on this 1996 contract is the final straw. Ever
since the results of that election were announced, union reformers
have been protesting that the numbers smelled wrong. Hill dismissed
these complaints until a news article about the vote fraud last
week. The contract's pay pattern affected other workers like
policemen, whose union was forced to accept the wage freeze after
arbitration.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani's lawyers argue that despite the vote fraud, the
contracts are valid and will remain in force. Hill and a number of
prominent labor lawyers agree. The larger question is what happens
to the work performance of employees who feel bamboozled by their
own representatives. To insure more openness and fairness, the
council and its unions should allow greater access by members to
financial records and encourage outside supervision of elections.
</P>
<P>
   Hill, who has ignored excesses among union leaders until these
recent allegations, said he had agreed to stricter financial rules
and some outside monitoring of local union votes. The parent union
has also sent in an investigative firm to determine whether the
strange 1996 contract vote was really tainted. These responses are
reactive at best. Hill has proved he cannot control his union. It
is time for the parent union to take charge.

   NEW YORK _ It was music's mean season when Bob Dylan abandoned
folk music to embrace rock-and-roll in the summer of 1966. The
ensuing hostility can be witnessed in the film ``Eat the
Document,'' on view at the Museum of Television and Radio in
Manhattan and its Los Angeles branch through Dec. 20. Made for
ABC's ``Stage 67,'' the documentary was shelved when the network
became confused by its stream-of-consciousness flow. Bootleg copies
have been in circulation for years, but the museum's version
presents the work as it was intended. The screenings coincide with
the release by Columbia Records of Dylan's ``Live 1966'' CD's.

   Over the last 18 years, the National Yiddish Book Center in
Amherst, Mass., has recovered nearly 1.5 million volumes that serve
as a record of Jewish life before the Holocaust. Brittle with age,
many of the works are now threatened with extinction. Steven
Spielberg hopes to remedy the situation. His Righteous Persons
Foundation has made a grant of $500,000 to create ``The Steven
Spielberg Digital Yiddish Library.'' Using digital technology, the
library intends to preserve works permanently by reprinting them on
demand, issuing them as CD-ROM's and making them available on the
Internet. The project, whose first volumes will be out early next
year, insures access to a ``lost Atlantis of cultural treasure,''
said Aaron Lansky, the center's founder.

   He champions the Baroque and the contemporary. But when Julius
Rudel takes the podium at the Metropolitan Opera on Wednesday
night, it's Puccini's war horse ``La Boheme'' that will commemorate
his 20th season at the Met. Rudel made his debut there with
Massenet's ``Werther'' in October 1978; since then he has conducted
18 different operas with the company, ranging from Handel's
``Samson'' to Mozart's ``Magic Flute.'' The maestro will lead ``La
Boheme'' and Mozart's ``Nozze di Figaro'' this month and next.

   People in the United States prefer Canadians, if the nominees
for the 26th annual American Music Awards are any indication. Some
20,000 listeners were bowled over by the Canadian country siren
Shania Twain, who led with five nominations, including best female
artist and best album in both the pop-rock and country categories.
Celine Dion was nominated for top female artist and album in the
pop-rock category and favorite artist in the adult contemporary
genre. But Americans weren't shut out. Will Smith, who began his
career as the rapper Fresh Prince and went on to television and
movies, earned four nominations. The awards will be handed out on
Jan. 11 in Los Angeles.

ANGELS AND VAUGHN ARE CLOSE, SAY SOURCES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB KEISSER  
 c.1998 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Within the next 48 hours, beleaguered Angels fans might actually
have reason to be thankful.
</P>
<P>
   A variety of sources say the team is close to signing free-agent
first baseman Mo Vaughn to a six-year, $72 million contract.
Official papers have been written and exchanged, and Angels
executives have been advised to keep their Thanksgiving plans
fluid.
</P>
<P>
   And if that's not enough, here's the cranberries: The Angels are
still in the chase for Randy Johnson, to the degree that their
future first baseman and the former Mariners left-hander have
discussed the possibility of playing on the same team.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle traded Johnson to Houston last summer when contract
talks broke off. Despite his going 10-1 and helping them win the NL
Central title, the Astros bailed out of negotiations Tuesday. They
would not extend their offer to Johnson beyond three years.
</P>
<P>
   A source close to the Angels said, ``We let Randy know how much
we want him.'' (The club entertained Johnson last week.) ``The
question now is how much more we're willing to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, Angels fans are no longer dealing with the Disney
Sports group that once resided in Fantasyland. Among themselves,
Disney chief Michael Eisner and Angels president Tony Tavares might
continue to believe no single ballplayer is worth $10 million
annually. But they seem to have recognized that $10 million or more
is the market for players like Vaughn and Johnson, and that the
alternatives aren't good business.
</P>
<P>
   It was Tavares who said no player is worth $10 million. In terms
of dollar-for-dollar value, he's correct. But in terms of
team-by-team competitiveness, he's wrong. The baseball community is
one of the quickest in separating contenders from pretenders,
perhaps because newspapers print the standings each day.
</P>
<P>
   The education offered this past season was convincing. The
Padres gambled on Kevin Brown and won. The Astros gambled on Randy
Johnson and won. The Rangers gambled on Todd Stottlemyre and won.
The Angels did not make a deal and they reeled in September.
</P>
<P>
   Disney brass might not know a slider from a sinker, but it seems
to have learned the difference between Mo Vaughn and Cecil Fielder.
</P>
<P>
   Perception often is reality in sports, and Disney is viewed as
somewhat of a Scrooge outfit, renowned in the entertainment
industry for squeezing every bit of green out of a buck. But the
Angels' total team salary last season was $46 million, which is an
increase of $20 million over what it was five years ago when the
late Gene Autry and his wife Jackie ran the show.
</P>
<P>
   Now, if Vaughn and Johnson decide to become Angels, the annual
tab will climb past $65 million. Add that to the $100 million
Disney spent to renovate the park and you have a sizable financial
commitment.
</P>
<P>
   The other thing the Vaughn and Johnson negotiations have done is
give the team some off-the-field credibility. Before this, the
Angels were viewed by agents and some rival general managers as
small-timers, a team that would blink once the game began or,
worse, not even play.

L.A. CARDINAL MEETS WITH REGION'S JEWISH LEADERS TO HEAL RIFTS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DEBORAH SULLIVAN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- L.A. leads the world in Catholic-Jewish
relations, but more cooperation is needed to fight social ills and
heal historic rifts between the two faiths, Cardinal Roger Mahony
told the Southern California Board of Rabbis.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Catholic-Jewish dialogue in the United States is the
oldest and most advanced in the world,'' Mahony said Tuesday, ``and
much of this dialogue was pioneered here in Los Angeles.''
</P>
<P>
   But Catholic-Jewish cooperation has slowed in recent years, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Mahony's speech, at the invitation of Board of Rabbis President
Lawrence Goldmark, marked the first time the leader of the Los
Angeles Archdiocese has addressed the Jewish body.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having the leader of the Roman Catholic Church speak to the
rabbis of Los Angeles' Jewish community is incredibly important,
because it is the continual building of bridges between communities
that will dispel ignorance and ill will that have existed for
thousands of years,'' Goldmark said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Jewish people have to realize that the Catholic Church has
changed.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, the Vatican apologized for Catholic silence
during the Holocaust, and Mahony noted that a Los Angeles
Jewish-Catholic group produced a similar statement on the
atrocities in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Mahony stressed that the church in recent decades ``turned its
face toward, rather than away from the Jewish people'' and adopted
an understanding of Judaism ``in which there is not the slightest
hint of contempt, and not an iota of a conversionist agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   Rather than praying for Jews to convert to Catholicism, he said,
the church now calls for Catholics to pray that Jews remain
faithful to their own religion.
</P>
<P>
   The growing understanding and cooperation between the two faiths
must be harnessed to serve the city's immigrant poor, Mahony said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The archdiocese of Los Angeles has labored long and hard in
the inner city, remaining in many cases the primary focus of hope
and stability,'' he said. ``Now, more than ever before, we need you
to join us.''
</P>
<P>
   Rabbi Steven Jacobs of the Kol Tikvah synagogue in suburban
Woodland Hills urged Mahony and other leaders to remember the San
Fernando Valley's poorer neighborhoods as well.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobs said a once-thriving Jewish-Catholic dialogue in the
Valley has diminished from its peak 25 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Mahony attributed that decline to turnover and deaths among the
Valley's clergy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have had an almost total transformation of priests in the
Valley,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobs said the Valley religious leaders from both faiths have
become overwhelmed by the area's surging population and changing
demographics.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, he said, they have focused on immediate needs of
their own congregations at the expense of social action and
interfaith collaboration.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a great influx of poorer people in the Valley, and
more than ever we need to cooperate to preserve the dignity of the
human being,'' Jacobs said.

HOLIDAY TRAVELERS CAN HELP THEMSELVES TO AN EXTRA SERVING OF
TRAFFIC
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MICHAEL COIT  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- This is traditionally the busiest day of L.A.'s
travel year, and it's likely to be busier than ever thanks to the
strong economy and low fares that have more people on the move this
Thanksgiving holiday weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe that's why the Flyaway parking lot in suburban Van Nuys
was already full Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had some spots open, and then by 10 or 11 o'clock the lot
was filled up.'' said Pat Freudenburg, a spokeswoman for the
airport service.
</P>
<P>
   The Flyaway bus remains an inexpensive option for suburban San
Fernando Valley residents flying in and out of Los Angeles
International Airport. But you need a ride to the bus terminal
because the 2,020-space lot likely will remain full through the
holiday weekend, Freudenburg said.
</P>
<P>
   The rush already was on Tuesday at LAX and suburban
Burbank-Glendale-Pasadena Airport. Even worse, crowds are expected
to increase 30 percent to 50 percent today. By tonight, motorists
-- some driven by gas prices 25 cents a gallon lower than a year
ago -- will clog Southern California freeways.
</P>
<P>
   There will be long waits even if you're flying. Airport
officials suggest arriving two to three hours early. And if you're
driving, make sure the vehicle is ready for the road and get some
rest before the drive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thanksgiving is a traditional go-see-the-family kind of
holiday,'' said Jeff Spring, spokesman for the Auto Club of
Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   ``Based on what we've seen the last five years, the number of
people traveling on this holiday is increasing. There's a better
economy and people are more comfortable with taking trips.''
</P>
<P>
   The swell of travelers began surging into the area's two main
airports Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're seeing a slightly higher volume coming through the
airport today,'' Sean McCarthy, a Burbank Airport spokesman, said
Tuesday. ``We will see it probably peak tomorrow afternoon and
evening, and then there will be another spike Thursday morning. We
can expect a similar rush of return passengers on Sunday and Monday
morning.''
</P>
<P>
   Burbank Airport's daily crowd count will increase from 12,000 to
some 16,000 on those days, McCarthy said. The normal daily load of
nearly 200,000 travelers at LAX will grow by 100,000 today and
again Sunday, said Cora Fossett, airport spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   ``The majority of people are pretty busy in life in general and
are just rushing around at the last minute. So many people during
the holiday period are once-a-year travelers. They're in a state of
heightened anxiety and excitement,'' she said. ``That's why we
advise people to arrive earlier.''
</P>
<P>
   Driving will be the preferred mode of transportation during the
holiday weekend, according to a national Auto Club survey. Of the
nearly 34 million Americans expected to travel over the period,
27.7 million will drive, Spring said.
</P>
<P>
   So expect congestion on the Ventura Freeway north as far as
Santa Barbara, on Interstate 10 through San Bernardino, on
Interstate 15 to Las Vegas, and on Interstate 5 through the
Grapevine and into the Central Valley, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   If you're heading north on I-5, beware of road repairs from
rural Castaic to Gorman. The California Highway Patrol and state
Department of Transportation predict 20-mile backups from the
combination of road work and traffic.
</P>
<P>
   The first project involves work on the bridge at the I-5/Highway
138 interchange that requires the closure of the two right-hand
lanes. For the second project, crews have been repairing a
half-mile section of road south of Templin Highway near Castaic.
The open lanes there are rough and bumpy, and traffic will be
reduced to 45 mph.
</P>
<P>
   Given that one in six highway deaths are caused by drivers who
fall asleep at the wheel or are drowsy and not alert, the Auto Club
has launched a public awareness campaign providing free Solution to
Drowsy Driving tip cards at AAA offices across the region.
</P>
<P>
   ``Expect the roads to be busier,'' Spring said. ``They don't
have to be more dangerous; just use common sense.''
</P>
<P>
   Weather conditions should be favorable. Mostly clear skies with
daytime highs in the mid-70s are forecast for Los Angeles County
and neighboring Ventura County today and Thursday, said Stuart
Seto, a National Weather Service specialist in Oxnard, in Ventura
County.
</P>
<P>
   Travelers going into the Central Coast and Northern California
should expect rain tonight with snow above 6,000 feet, and a second
storm late Friday and into Saturday, Seto said.

SEAHAWKS YET TO ROPE `STUDHOSS' QB 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Local fans of football irony, this is your week.
</P>
<P>
   The week that the Seahawks pick a no-pedigree mutt from Central
Washington as their starting quarterback, they play a team that has
a no-pedigree mutt from Milton College who was, and is, the best
quarterback in Seahawk history.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Krieg is a backup for the Tennessee Oilers and might not
play Sunday in the Kingdome. But he's still in the NFL at 40, just
two years younger than Warren Moon and with a Seahawk resume that
is superior to his more heralded counterpart.
</P>
<P>
   Krieg's return combined with the Seahawk move to Jon Kitna makes
a thunderous point about the Seahawks as their 23rd season dwindles
down in the same ignominious fashion as so many others:
</P>
<P>
   Never have the Seahawks had a prime-time quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   Among the 15 who have thrown passes for the Seahawks, there have
been good QBs, fun QBs, winning QBs and in Moon, a Hall of Fame QB.
</P>
<P>
   But never in their nearly quarter century in the NFL have they
had a studhoss at his peak.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, they've tried. My goodness, they have tried.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, the Seahawks squandered a first- and fifth-round pick
on Kelly Stouffer. In '91, they squandered a first-round pick on
Dan McGwire. In '93, they squandered a first-round pick, second
overall in the draft, on Rick Mirer.
</P>
<P>
   What all those franchise resources _ plus more that have been
wasted on lesser luminaries _ add up to is a grand total of three
wins in the playoffs and a soon-to-be-10-year absence from the
postseason.
</P>
<P>
   Krieg, a stumpy, undrafted free agent from a college that
expired, was the QB for all three playoff wins.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, the long-term Seahawk woes are attributable to far
more than a wretched few decades at one position. For example,
having an owner's right-hand man indicted for murder (you haven't
forgotten Mike Blatt, have you?) is just one of many signals that
this franchise must have been born upon a violated burial ground.
</P>
<P>
   More to the football point is that the Seahawks also never have
had a Pro Bowl offensive lineman. That's five positions times 23
years, and not once have they possessed a big ugly in his
pancake-making prime. In the NFL, that is almost a mathematical and
strategic impossibility.
</P>
<P>
   But when, year after year, the Seahawk observer sees team after
team advance to the playoffs in large part because of a stable,
solid signal caller, the Seattle void screams.
</P>
<P>
   A good QB is not a guarantee of success, of course. But not
having one is virtually a guarantee of failure.
</P>
<P>
   That's not to say that Kitna won't be the answer. He has offered
up enough intrigue in his limited playing time to suggest there are
decent possibilities here.
</P>
<P>
   Except the Seahawk fan has been down that road before.
</P>
<P>
   The sheer weight of franchise history conspires against his
success.
</P>
<P>
   If we confine this gridiron anthropology dig to the past 10
years, the record shows that in 1988, when Krieg took the Seahawks
to an AFC West championship with a 9-7 record, he had a quarterback
rating of 94.6, second best in the NFL that year and just shy of
his 1983 club record of 95.
</P>
<P>
   None since, including Krieg in his final three Seahawk seasons,
have approached that number. Even Moon last year, when he set club
records for passing yards and completions, had only an 83.7 rating,
largely because of his propensity for the interception.
</P>
<P>
   The rating system is hardly an absolute measure of quarterback
contribution. But it is one consistent device through the seasons
that measures the key virtue of passing efficiency. It doesn't take
into consideration all the other variables in the offense, but hey,
I have only 20 newspaper inches to make a point. Indulge me.
</P>
<P>
   Krieg probably will find this comparison amusing, since during
his time here he often was criticized for all the things he
couldn't do instead of praised for the things he could do. Hey,
he's still the NFL's career leader in fumbles (official) and
soap-dish passes (unofficial).
</P>
<P>
   But Mudbone had a grittiness and resolve about him that overcame
his mistakes and physical limits and pushed him, and his team, as
far as anyone could have expected.
</P>
<P>
   It's just that few have expected a lot from the Seahawks.
</P>
<P>
   Except for now, under Paul Allen.
</P>
<P>
   As Seahawk followers know, the owner's investment in payroll has
created a team far more talented than the 5-6 record, which is why
coach Dennis Erickson couldn't be more finished here than if he
were sanded, varnished and buffed.
</P>
<P>
   Much has been expected. Unfortunately for him, four years of
middling results will be remembered ironically for the period's
offensive desperation: The franchise had to rely on a
fortysomething trigger man who had the audacity to hold out of
training camp for more money. And he got at least some of it.
</P>
<P>
   Revered as he is in Seattle and the NFL, and as untouchable as
his longevity records will be, Moon should not have been in
position to leverage the franchise as he has.
</P>
<P>
   Don't blame him for being a smart businessman. Blame almost a
quarter century of bad judgment and bad luck that made the Seahawks
so vulnerable at the game's most important spot.

HUSKIES ACCEPT HAWAII BOWL BID 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By BUD WITHERS  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ As expected, Washington and Colorado accepted bids
Tuesday to the Bowl Games of Hawaii doubleheader on Christmas Day.
Now the waiting begins to see which team fills the fourth berth
and, consequently, establish the match-ups.
</P>
<P>
   Air Force (10-1) was first to get an invitation to the
first-ever bowl doubleheader. The Huskies make it as a result of
the Pac-10's contract to place the No. 4 and No. 5 Pac-10 teams in
the Aloha or Oahu Bowls, and Colorado got a bid as an at-large
entry.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're actively talking to the Big East,'' said the CEO of the
bowls, Lenny Klompus. ``We believe we do have a backup position
with the Big East.''
</P>
<P>
   If Arizona State doesn't get the requisite sixth victory against
Arizona on Friday, and if UCLA and Arizona fill possible slots in
the Fiesta and Rose Bowls, the Hawaii bowls would be short one
Pac-10 entry. Their position suggests that they will take the loser
of the Miami-Syracuse game this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   But a final decision likely would have to wait until it is
determined whether UCLA beats Miami Dec. 5 and wins enough Bowl
Championship Series ranking points to get into the Fiesta Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Pac-10 is volatile at best,'' Klompus said, ``and we're
going to sit tight and wait until the (BCS) is completed.''
</P>
<P>
   Since an Air Force-Colorado pairing would minimize TV ratings,
Washington is almost sure to play one of those teams. Speculation
has been that the Hawaii games would like a USC-Colorado match-up
if the Trojans fall to Notre Dame.
</P>
<P>
   ABC-TV will show the Aloha Bowl opener and will have a strong
say in the match-ups for the 12:30 p.m. (PST) game. ESPN has the
Oahu Bowl 75 minutes after the first game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to be playing both those teams in the near future,
so there's pretty good carry-over,'' UW coach Jim Lambright said of
Air Force and Colorado, which the Huskies host on consecutive weeks
next September.
</P>
<P>
   The Huskies will stay at the same Waikiki hotel they did a year
ago when they walloped Michigan State, 51-23, in the Aloha Bowl.
Because of the four teams' practice demands, none will work out at
the Aloha Bowl as they did a year ago; the Huskies will practice at
traditional power St. Louis High School.

PEPPERDINE LAW SCHOOL PUTS THE BIBLE IN THE COURTROOM  
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs lead graf to correct location of Pepperdine University
campus) (htv) 
 By William Glaberson   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MALIBU, Calif. _ A towering cross dominates the sweeping
hillside of the Pepperdine University campus here, perched in the
Santa Monica Mountains northwest of Los Angeles with a view of the
glittering Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   The cross is a symbol of the University's commitment to
Christian values and nowhere is that more evident than at the
Pepperdine School of Law, an institution that is proudly at the
edge of mainstream legal thinking.
</P>
<P>
   Pepperdine's public courtship of independent counsel Kenneth
Starr to be dean of its law school has brought unprecedented
attention to the school, which is one of a handful of law schools
that say their mission is to incorporate the values of Jesus Christ
into the law, and are working to influence legal thought
nationally.
</P>
<P>
   But a visit to the law school, while Starr's congressional
testimony is making news in Washington, offers a look at the
conservative Christian legal community that can claim both Starr
and Pepperdine. Pepperdine's students and professors described a
Christian approach to the law that some of them said was designed
to combat the amorality of the American legal system. With lawyers
perceived widely as dishonest opportunists and with public opinion
polls traditionally ranking the legal profession near the bottom in
integrity, some people at Pepperdine said, a more spiritual
approach to legal education seemed justified.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not just here to learn to be attorneys but to learn to
be virtuous attorneys both in our performance and in our hearts,''
said one third-year student, LeAllen Frost, from Duncan, Okla.
</P>
<P>
   Often in conversations here, Starr was cited as an example of a
moral lawyer while Clinton's legalistic distinctions were used an
examples of strategies that Christian lawyers should reject. ``At
Pepperdine,'' said Jennifer Vanse, a second-year student, ``they
teach you: `Don't try and get off on your little technicalities.'''
</P>
<P>
   Liberals and conservatives both criticized Starr's plan in 1997
to resign as the independent counsel to take up an academic life at
Pepperdine. After at first delaying his arrival, Starr said last
spring that he would not come here at all.
</P>
<P>
   At the law school, the only one in the country affiliated with
the Churches of Christ denomination, professors cover all the usual
law school material and then they add another dimension. The
Churches of Christ is a theologically conservative denomination,
which historically has discouraged drinking, smoking and dancing.
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer's morality, said Douglas W. Kmiec, a Pepperdine
professor, can be as important to clients as a solid knowledge of
the statutes and court decisions. ``If you're going to hold
yourself out as a counselor giving people advice,'' he said, ``you
can't give incomplete advice.''
</P>
<P>
   So, in one of his classes, he said, students read papal
encyclicals in addition to court opinions. Some professors hold
Bible study groups. Some urge their students to ask combatants in
litigation to read scripture as a path toward the resolution of
lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   In one class, students said, a professor who opposes abortion
rights presented all the material including cases dealing with
abortion and then asked his students, ``OK, now you know the law,
now we're going to discuss the law: What do you think of it as a
Christian?''
</P>
<P>
   There are 37 religiously affiliated law schools in the United
States, although most do not emphasize those ties. Law schools at
many of the country's large religiously affiliated universities,
including some at the major Roman Catholic universities, teach law
much as secular schools do. Legal educators say that only about a
dozen of the 180 law schools in the country emphasize their
religious values in their courses. Pepperdine administrators say
their school is among the ones that are most committed to the
religious mission.
</P>
<P>
   Pepperdine's approach differs from that of most American law
schools, where moral or religious convictions are often avoided in
the classroom. Traditional law schools focus their attention less
on questions of right and wrong than on a more objective mastery of
what the law is.
</P>
<P>
   The difference between Pepperdine and most law schools is
intentional, said Richardson R. Lynn, a soft-spoken law professor
with a graying beard and a bias for bow ties who was named dean
when Starr failed to arrive.
</P>
<P>
   Lynn, who like Starr was raised attending the Church of Christ,
says the school focuses on taking a Christian view of the law.
Asked for an example, he said that would include training students
to challenge clients involved in immoral businesses like Internet
pornography. Law students, he said, are not asked to reject clients
of whom they disapprove and are taught to represent their clients
as zealously as any other lawyer. But they are also taught ``to
think about what they can do to raise with clients the moral
dimensions of what their business is.''
</P>
<P>
   Many law schools across the country in recent years have tried
to increase their focus on lawyers' ethics. But their approach,
legal educators say, has emphasized the secular rules of the
profession, like the concept that every person is entitled to a
defense no matter how reprehensible the act he is accused of
committing.
</P>
<P>
   Some legal educators say Pepperdine's focus flies in the face of
the pragmatic approach to the legal profession that, for good or
ill, has shaped many law schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``Students are very bread-and-butter-oriented,'' said Barry R.
Furrow, the interim dean of Widener University School of Law in
Wilmington, Del. Few young lawyers, he said, would be comfortable
delving into the morality of their clients. ``Their first
concern,'' he said, ``is not to alienate a client.''
</P>
<P>
   Lynn said the sense of morality extended to the administration
of the school, which has 650 students who take standard bar
examinations and work in traditional legal jobs, like clerkships
with judges and positions in law firms all over the country.
Pepperdine, which, like many regional law schools is typically
ranked well below the elite schools, seeks to make produce students
who can compete with graduates of other law schools for jobs. But
several students said in interviews that smaller firms in small
cities seemed most receptive to them.
</P>
<P>
   Students agreed that the fierce competition that characterizes
many law schools was not the norm here.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Some students said, too, that Pepperdine encouraged a constant
examination not only of what the law was but whether it was moral.
Eric Nelson, a student from Menomonee Falls, Wis., said he had been
taught that ``just because the law says what it says doesn't mean
you should stop there.''
</P>
<P>
   Some students also expressed irritation at what they called the
cliched portrayals of Starr, Christian lawyers in general and
Pepperdine in particular. After Starr announced his decision to
become dean and to head a new public policy school, some of his
critics called Pepperdine a haven for right-wing activists.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Mellon Scaife, a wealthy conservative who has
contributed to many conservative causes, has given some $13 million
to the 7,800-student Pepperdine University over the years. Scaife
has not given money to the law school, but Pepperdine said a
foundation associated with him gave $1.2 million of some $20
million in start-up costs for the public policy school.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the students and professors acknowledged that their own
politics were politically conservative. But some of them complained
that stereotypes have shaped the public view of Christian lawyers
and of Starr, who has said he likes to start the day singing a hymn
and offering a prayer.
</P>
<P>
   ``There just seems to be this view that if you are a Christian,
you think everybody else that's not just like you is wrong,'' said
Chad Brown, a 25-year old law student who grew up in Texas.
``That's just not it. That's not how the original man we named our
religion after _ Jesus Christ _ was; he wasn't judgmental.''
</P>
<P>
   But at the school, the line between moral and political
positions sometimes seemed to blur. In his constitutional law
class, Kmiec questioned students about a series of cases just as
professors do at secular law schools.
</P>
<P>
   But then he led the discussion toward what he called ``natural
law,'' which he and several of the students agreed was a force more
powerful than the precedents of courts. Many conservatives say the
natural law of God requires that abortion or assisted suicide
should be outlawed no matter what the courts have said.
</P>
<P>
   The routine at Pepperdine sometimes seemed much like that of
other law schools and the students, in T-shirts, looked like
students everywhere. But occasionally the differences seemed
evident.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the Pepperdine faculty members seemed anxious to show
how different from traditional law schools Pepperdine is. William
P. Haney Jr., who has been teaching law at Pepperdine for 22 years,
was one who pointed out distinctions.
</P>
<P>
   Haney is a professor of juvenile justice issues, calls himself a
community service activist and describes himself as very
conservative. Every year he trains some 200 law students to work
with him to help prisoners and disadvantaged inner-city residents
through programs he runs that he said stress character, strong
values and Christian redemption.
</P>
<P>
   The philosophy he teaches law students, he said, is that there
are good and bad people. ``One of our functions as lawyers,'' he
said, ``is to make sure that the good people win.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, from a room across the hall from his law school office,
Haney summoned a 15-year old boy. Haney said the boy was a former
gang member who had been imprisoned for robbery and had a mother
who was a drug addict. The boy shook hands politely.
</P>
<P>
   Haney said the boy was one of 20 who have lived with him and his
wife. The boy, he said, was working with him ``preparing to be a
good person.'' Under his supervision, Haney said, the youth does
several hours of homework every day and, when he goes to school, is
not permitted to accept school lunch money because of Haney's
objections to government intervention.
</P>
<P>
   ``In some law schools,'' Haney added, ``I would be considered
out of step.''

OCEAN ENERGY AND SEAGULL SET TO CREATE MAJOR OIL CONCERN 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By AGIS SALPUKAS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ocean Energy Inc. and the Seagull Energy Corp. have agreed to
merge in a stock swap creating the nation's 10th-largest
independent oil company, executives said on Tuesday night. The deal
is expected to be announced on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   James Flores, the president and chief executive of Ocean Energy,
said in an interview that the companies, which will have a combined
market capitalization of $1.9 billion, decided to merge to cut
costs and increase efficiency.
</P>
<P>
   He said about $45 million in yearly savings would come mostly
from cutting duplicate staff. Flores said about one-third of the
1,200 employees of the combined companies would lose their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are striving to be more efficient and drive our costs
down,'' said Flores, who is 38 and will become the chairman of the
combined company, which will be called Ocean Energy Inc. It will be
based in Houston. James Hackett, who left Duke Energy to take over
as president of Seagull just a few months ago, will become
president and chief executive officer of the combined company.
</P>
<P>
   Hackett told analysts this month that he was seeking to merge
with another independent oil company.
</P>
<P>
   Low crude oil prices are forcing many oil companies to seek ways
to cut costs or to find merger partners to share the expense of
exploring and producing.
</P>
<P>
   Independent oil companies, most dependent on the revenue they
get from selling crude oil and natural gas, have been particularly
hard hit. They do not have refineries and retail outlets to sell
gasoline to help them get through long periods when crude oil
prices remain depressed.
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of the deal, each Ocean Energy shareholder will
get one newly issued share of Seagull common stock for each share
of Ocean Energy. There will be 165 million shares outstanding, with
61.5 percent owned by Ocean Energy shareholders and the rest owned
by Seagull shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Seagull fell 56.25 cents, to $10.8125 on Tuesday.
Shares of Ocean Energy rose $1.6875, to $10.25. Both are traded on
the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Flores said the combined company would concentrate on increasing
production from its domestic fields and in the Gulf of Mexico. &QL;

LONGING FOR FAST LANE, PEPPERDINE CRAWLS TO WIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MALIBU, Calif. _ Tie an anvil to Carl Lewis' track shoes, strap
Linda Tripp on his back and place him in a broom closet, then tell
him to sprint. That roughly approximates the boiling, bottled-up
frustration felt by Pepperdine right about now.
</P>
<P>
   As the Waves play through a stretch of walk/don't-run opponents,
their up-tempo style slowed to a maddening crawl, the games are
losing some aesthetic value. But the Waves continue to compensate
with victories, the latest a 60-50 decision over Wichita State on
Tuesday at Firestone Fieldhouse.
</P>
<P>
   Pepperdine endured a painfully slow and physical opening half to
take an eight-point lead by halftime, then held off a handful of
surges from the Shockers to close out the win. The Waves are 5-0
for the first time since the Carter administration, and it only
seems like it's been that long since an opponent let them run full
speed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would like to get loose. We feel like we're locked up right
now,'' guard Jelani Gardner groused.
</P>
<P>
   For perspective, consider that Wichita held the Waves to just 41
field-goal attempts, about 12 fewer shots than their season
average. The slowdown produced rushed shots, turnovers and minimal
electricity. It was the second straight game, following a victory
at Long Beach State, in which Pepperdine has had to win at half
speed.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of teams want to slow us down, because they know that's
our strength. . . . We've proven that we can play either way and
win,'' Gardner said.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, he must admit, ``I think guys get bored with this
style.''
</P>
<P>
   He isn't kidding. But the Shockers' strategy was effective to
the extent it kept them in the game. After trailing continuously
since early in the first half, and by as many as 13 in the second
half, Wichita chipped the lead down to five, 55-50, when Jason
Perez hit a 3-pointer with 1:18 left in the game.
</P>
<P>
   The shot capped a 5-0 run over a three-minute span in which the
Waves missed a pair of free throws and turned the ball over on
mishaps such as Gardner stepping on the baseline.
</P>
<P>
   ``We became a little impatient at that point,'' Waves coach
Lorenzo Romar said. ``We are at our worst when we begin to hurry.''
</P>
<P>
   But the threat from Wichita, which had pulled no closer than six
points in the half, was short-lived. Gardner fed Marc McDowell for
an easy layup to make it 57-50, and at the other end, Kelvin Gibbs
blocked Maurice Evans' 3-point attempt with about 30 seconds
remaining to seal the win.
</P>
<P>
   Not that it would have even been that close if the Waves could
shoot free throws. They hit 14 of 25 (56 percent). Gibbs missed
four of his 10 foul shots but led Pepperdine with 13 points and
eight rebounds. Gardner and McDowell scored 10 each.
</P>
<P>
   They'll be itching to crank up those numbers soon and might get
their wish against Cal State Fullerton on Saturday and certainly
against Kansas on Dec. 5. &QL;

SLOW START, LATE ROUT FOR USC
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ There was the upset of Nevada-Las Vegas. There was
the handful of votes in this week's Top 25 poll. There was Tuesday
night's opponent.
</P>
<P>
   Is it any wonder USC got off to a slow start against Long Beach
State?
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans, basking in the good fortune of the past few days,
were ahead by just six points at halftime against the 49ers. But
perhaps in a demonstration of how differently this year's team is
developing, USC quickly regrouped and routed the 49ers 74-48 before
2,836 at the Sports Arena.
</P>
<P>
   USC (3-0) is off to its best start in 10 years, and handed the
49ers their second-worst loss in the two-plus seasons of coach
Wayne Morgan.
</P>
<P>
   But early in the game it didn't look like it would be that way.
The Trojans were nip and tuck with the 49ers for the entire first
half, fortunate to scratch out a 33-27 advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were very sluggish. Our practices the last two days were
the same way,'' USC coach Henry Bibby said. ``You kind of expect
that coming off a big win over UNLV, a nationally known game. It
takes time for guys to get in sync.''
</P>
<P>
   Then Bibby dropped a bombshell. He said he feared the 49ers
(1-3) more than UNLV, whom the Trojans defeated last Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was really scared of Long Beach State,'' Bibby said. ``They
have athletes. They rebound. I really feared this team, probably
more than Vegas, from a standpoint of a letdown.''
</P>
<P>
   Bibby snapped USC out its first-half funk by giving the team an
earful at halftime. Among those who listened was guard Jeff
Trepagnier, who had 12 points and three blocked shots, after
scoring just one point in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess it was the halftime speech. Coach said if I wanted to
play, I would have to do something,'' Trepagnier said. ``Everybody
says I play hard and they feed off my energy.''
</P>
<P>
   Trepagnier energized the Trojans by making two impressive
blocks, then followed up with a spectacular dunk that resulted in a
three-point play.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jeff's dunks (make a difference),'' forward Brian Scalabrine
said. ``The whole crowd goes nuts. We say to ourselves, `OK, it's
fun. Let's play basketball.' He's the key to our team.''
</P>
<P>
   So is Scalabrine. He had 19 points, four rebounds and four
assists and is already USC's best player, despite sitting out last
season at Highline Community College in Des Moines, Wash. There's
been no trace of rust on 6-foot-9 redhead, who hadn't played a real
basketball game in nearly two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I redshirted, but I worked out before practice, during
practice and after practice,'' Scalabrine said.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Trepagnier, the Trojans' other spark came from forward
Greg Lakey, who was motivated by being limited to five minutes in
the victory over UNLV. Lakey had nine points and nine rebounds in
16 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really wanted to come in and show (Bibby) I could do what I
needed to do,'' Lakey said. ``I felt kind of angry and put it in a
positive mode to get the job done. I was trying to be everywhere,
so next time he'll think of me.''
</P>
<P>
   !arrow!Note:!off! With minutes in short supply, forward Shannon
Swillis found himself the odd man out and did not play. After going
16 minutes in the opener against San Diego State, Swillis has
played just five minutes in the previous two games.

RANDY JOHNSON LOOKING WEST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Rangers are in danger of losing out in the high-stakes race
to sign free-agent pitcher Randy Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Major-league officials close to the negotiations said yesterday
Johnson is leaning toward signing with either the Arizona
Diamondbacks or the Anaheim Angels. However, Alan Nero, his agent,
said the Rangers and the Los Angeles Dodgers haven't been
eliminated.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Rangers are clearly being considered,'' Nero said. ``They
have made a very competitive offer, a very formidable offer. Randy
has a lot of respect for that organization. They're a contender,
and he's made it clear that he wants to play for a contender.''
</P>
<P>
   All four teams have offered Johnson a four-year contract. The
Rangers offered four years at $50 million on Monday. But a source
said the Dodgers have made the highest offer at $52 million, and
the Diamondbacks have offered somewhere between $48 million and $50
million.
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers general manager Kevin Malone said, ``If we're out of it,
we haven't been notified.''
</P>
<P>
   Rangers president Tom Schieffer said yesterday he had not talked
with Nero or agent Barry Meister since their face-to-face meetings
at The Ballpark in Arlington on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a real quiet day, but we expected that,'' Schieffer
said. ``We gave them a lot of information to digest, I think
they're in the process of doing that. I think something will happen
in the next few days. When, I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   Nero said Johnson could make a decision today or would wait
until after Thanksgiving.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels fit Johnson's desire to play for an American League
team that has a chance to win and is close to his home in Arizona.
The Diamondbacks are getting strong consideration because Johnson
lives in a Phoenix suburb and wants to stay close to his family.
</P>
<P>
   All indications are Johnson's decision will come down to either
staying home to pitch with the Diamondbacks or with one of the
three other teams who are considered legitimate contenders.
</P>
<P>
   But the second-year Diamondbacks, who finished 65-97 last year,
are also making a strong bid to become competitive quickly. They
have already signed pitcher Todd Stottlemyre and have talked with
the agents of free-agent outfielders Bernie Williams and Steve
Finley.
</P>
<P>
   The Disney-owned Angels are close to signing first baseman Mo
Vaughn to a deal potentially worth $80 million, and general manager
Bill Bavasi spent much of yesterday meeting with ownership
officials, discussing if the club could afford both Vaughn and
Johnson. A source said they could.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers' offer did serve to eliminate the Houston Astros and
New York Yankees from contention. Houston Astros general manager
Gerry Hunsicker, who traded for Johnson on July 31, said yesterday
his club is no longer pursuing him. Sources said the New York
Yankees have also declined to match the Rangers' offer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a discussion with Randy Johnson's representatives
yesterday, and he officially notified us that to stay competitive,
we would have to commit to a four-year contract,'' Hunsicker said.
``We're not prepared to do that. It just came down to economics,
that's not a level where we can participate financially.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astros had offered Johnson a three-year deal worth
approximately $33 million. The Rangers trumped that with a
three-year, $39 million offer earlier this month, then went even
higher on Monday.

 &HT;    Movie review of 'Bug's Life'
 &HT;    By Chris Garcia
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ An annoying little film that strives to
entertain with a bullhorn, ``A Bug's Life'' will mollify the Happy
Meal lot as surely as it will chafe anyone who no longer finds the
noun ``butt'' a sufficient punchline. It's buggy, all right _ like
a caffeinated gnat buzzing in your ear. You want to squish it.
Hard.
</P>
<P>
   Brought to us by twin mavens of manipulation Disney and
computer-animator Pixar _ the same team that conspired on the
richer, wittier ``Toy Story'' _ ``A Bug's Life'' pales under the
long and fruitful shadow of last month's crawly cartoon comedy
``Antz.'' That movie boasts more quality laughs in its first 10
minutes than its paltry brethren summons in 90.
</P>
<P>
   Both films center around computer-drawn, anthropomorphic ant
colonies, but while ``Antz's'' comic sophistication crackles with
knowing satire, ``A Bug's Life'' lacks a whit of originality. The
characters don't budge beyond hackneyed types that could be plucked
from any animated Disney feature, and the story is nothing more
than a caramel-dunked ``Seven Samurai.''
</P>
<P>
   Needless to say, Pixar is no schlump in the art department. The
gleaming, often striking computer images move wonderfully and emit
a kind of waxed car sheen, a plasticky perfection. But the script
is steadfast in its pursuit of common denominator yuks, vanilla
gags aimed at suburban TV sensibilities.
</P>
<P>
   A scene that gets some of the biggest laughs shows a fly who is
drawn into a bug-zapper, hypnotized by the contraption's purple
radiance. (``Look away from the light!'' his pal cries.) A
typically lame one-liner comes when a female spider says her
husband is dead and chirps, ``I'm a black widow widow.'' ``A Bug's
Life'' fairly chokes on cutesies like these.
</P>
<P>
   A bland Dave Foley (from TV's ``NewsRadio'') provides the voice
of Flik, an earnest young ant who departs his teeming colony to
enlist help against a marauding band of grasshoppers. The
grasshoppers, led by ruthless Hopper (Kevin Spacey), invade the ant
colony by the seasonal clock in order to pillage their crunchy
harvest. Why, we never know. The movie needs a villain, so why not
rapacious grasshoppers?
</P>
<P>
   When Flik stumbles across a feckless flea circus, he thinks he's
found a worthy crew of mercenaries, unaware the motley troupe is
literally a bunch of clowns. Drama mounts as Flik's expectations
are frustrated and the ant colony appears doomed, and the
floodgates of predictability gleefully swing open.
</P>
<P>
   Three-alarm slapstick reigns in ``A Bug's Life,'' and the shrill
vivacity could be mistaken for wit if its contrivances weren't so
graceless. Pinging and clanging in a tireless clamor Spike Jones
would find obnoxious, the story finally winds down with a deflating
why-didn't-they-think-of-that-before? resolution.
</P>
<P>
   The too-tidy ending is steeped in Disney's didactic fondness for
order and conformity, inoculating us with sweet incantations about
self-esteem and perseverance. It's nice stuff for the children, but
it's also conventional to the bone.
</P>
<P>
   My adult star rating for ``A Bug's Life'' is two stars. If I
were 5 years old, it would be a giggle-laced three. Sorry, kids.

 &HT;    Either way, Bailey's best
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS, Ga. _ Georgia's Champ Bailey won't win the Heisman
Trophy. In fact, the Bulldogs' two-way star probably won't be
invited to New York's Downtown Athletic Club for the Heisman
presentation on Dec. 12.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, the Heisman rarely goes to college football's best
player, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't make any difference what spot it is _ cornerback,
wide receiver or return man _ Bailey does it all better than
anyone, including former Michigan star Charles Woodson, who
parlayed his versatility and knack for making big plays in big
games into winning last year's Heisman.
</P>
<P>
   Bailey, a 6-foot-1, 186-pound junior from Folkston, first
displayed his penchant of making big plays on both sides of the
ball in Georgia's 27-24 win over Georgia Tech in last year's
regular-season finale. On Saturday, he'll get another shot at the
Yellow Jackets in what could be his final game in Sanford Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Bailey, who starts at both left cornerback and wideout for the
No. 12 Bulldogs, is projected to be a top-10 pick in next year's
NFL draft if he leaves Georgia after this season. Bailey says he
won't announce a decision regarding his future until after the
Dogs' bowl game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hear people say stuff about it (turning pro), but I still
don't know what the facts really are (on his possible draft
position),'' Bailey said. ``I'll just have to wait and see. I don't
know what's going to make me decide.''
</P>
<P>
   What others are saying is that Bailey, a finalist for the Thorpe
Award, which goes annually to the nation's top defensive back,
could be among the first five players drafted. If he leaves Athens
a year early, he could be the first defensive back taken, ahead of
Arizona's Chris McAlister and Ohio State's Antoine Winfield.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's somewhere in the top 10 players, depending on what
juniors come out,'' ESPN draft analyst Mel Kiper Jr. said. ``He's
certainly in the top five to 10. I've heard that he's probably
coming out. When you look at the corners, it's Bailey and McAlister
with Winfield right behind them. They'll all probably go very
high.''
</P>
<P>
   Bailey's versatility has some NFL scouts pondering what position
he'll play at the next level. Last year, Bailey was only a novelty
on offense. He had only 12 catches for 234 yards and five rushes
for 15 yards. But his big-play capabilities proved very fruitful
against Georgia Tech.
</P>
<P>
   With only 48 seconds left in Bobby Dodd Stadium, Georgia trailed
Tech 24-21. The Bulldogs started their final drive at their 35-yard
line. On first down, quarterback Mike Bobo hit Bailey with a short
screen pass, which he turned into a 28-yard gain to the Tech 37. On
the next play, Bobo hit Bailey on a slant pattern for a seven-yard
gain to the 30.
</P>
<P>
   After a nine-yard pass to tailback Robert Edwards and a
controversial pass interference call against the Yellow Jackets,
Bobo found Corey Allen in the end zone, giving the Bulldogs a 27-24
win.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got confidence in Champ to make the plays,'' said Bobo,
now a graduate assistant at Georgia. ``Coach (Jim) Donnan wanted to
get the ball to the fastest guy on our team and let him make
something happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Bailey has made things happen on offense ever since. This
season, he's Georgia's biggest weapon on offense. Bailey has seen
action in 855 plays and made an impact on offense, defense and
special teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see myself as a defensive back and wide receiver,'' Bailey
said. ``I think I've probably got better potential as a defensive
back in the NFL. I'd like to play both on the next level, though.''
</P>
<P>
   As a defensive back, Bailey has three interceptions this year,
despite opposing quarterbacks' reluctance to throw to his side of
the field. His workload _ Bailey has been involved in 49.9 percent
of Georgia's plays this season _ has somewhat diminished his skills
in the secondary.
</P>
<P>
   Bailey, who spends halftime taking fluids intravenously, has
surrendered two touchdowns this season. He got beat on a couple of
crossing patterns in last week's 24-17 win over Mississippi, but
Bailey played in that game with a bruised left thumb, which remains
in a soft cast.
</P>
<P>
   On offense, Bailey leads the Bulldogs with 43 catches for 706
yards, an average of 16.4 yards per catch, with five touchdowns. On
special teams, he's a threat to break a big return at any time _
against Kentucky he returned three kickoffs for 90 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to get the ball to Champ on offense more,'' Donnan
said. ``Every time we've thrown him a deep ball, he seems to catch
it.''
</P>
<P>
   While Georgia stands to lose a Bailey for the second year in a
row _ his older brother, Ronald, graduated last year after starting
at right cornerback for two seasons _ the Dogs will gain another
one.
</P>
<P>
   Bailey's cousin, Kenny Bailey, verbally committed to Georgia on
Saturday. Bailey, an all-purpose player from Charlton County High,
enrolled at Hargrave Military Academy in Virginia after originally
signing with Wake Forest in February. He'll join Boss Bailey,
Champ's brother and a freshman linebacker for the Bulldogs.

 &HT;    Still feeling burn from '97
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The touchdown that gave Georgia the victory over
Georgia Tech last year went from quarterback Mike Bobo to receiver
Corey Allen on a pass route called a fade.
</P>
<P>
   For Georgia Tech cornerback Kofi Smith, that play has done
anything but fade.
</P>
<P>
   Smith's Georgia-Georgia Tech experience _ and for a while, all
of his Georgia Tech career _ was whittled from 60 minutes to 48
seconds to one single moment. Since then, he has seen it dozens of
times on videotape. He has stared at it frozen in time in a framed
newspaper photograph, which captured Allen clutching the ball at
his chest a foot away from Smith's outstretched left arm. Both of
them were airborne at the edge of the end zone in Bobby Dodd
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was me and the receiver and the quarterback and the
clock,'' said Smith, who started that game in place of injured
Jason Bostic. ``I held the guilt on me, the loss on me.''
</P>
<P>
   The touchdown to end the 27-24 loss _ Tech's seventh in a row in
the series _ came with eight seconds left in the game, but to Smith
it felt like eight seconds had been left in his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought that was it for me as a player,'' Smith said. ``I
had all intentions of giving up my football career after that play.
That was the hardest thing I have ever faced. I took it pretty bad.
I was walking around saying I lost the game. . . . I didn't feel I
could attend Georgia Tech anymore and look into the other students'
eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   After a couple of weeks, Smith started to bounce back, taking
comfort in some words from a friend, who reminded him that
``sometimes God closes a door to open up a new window.''
</P>
<P>
   By his door, Smith hung a framed copy of the newspaper picture
of the play.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever I went out the door, it made me think about it, to
make sure it would never happen again,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   Heading into his final game against Georgia on Saturday, Smith,
who is a reserve cornerback used mainly on special teams, has taken
the picture down. He doesn't want to focus on the negative. But the
play is still fresh in his mind, as is the last drive, and he still
uses it as a motivating force.
</P>
<P>
   The same goes for every Tech player on the field and on the
sideline during the final drive. For the Yellow Jackets, that drive
did more than break their hearts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your rib cage is ripped out,'' Tech coach George O'Leary said.
``From kickoff to score, we didn't do very much right. It's a
60-minute game. I think our team has learned from that. . . . They
made plays, and we didn't make a play. It's a simple fact.''
</P>
<P>
   Five plays, 65 yards, 40 seconds, six points.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia's winning drive was set up by a kickoff out of bounds by
Tech's David Frakes, jumpstarted by a 28-yard screen pass from Bobo
to Champ Bailey and pumped with new life following a pass
interference call against Donte Booker, which negated a Travares
Tillman interception and gave Georgia first and goal at the 8.
</P>
<P>
   The call went against Booker, then a reserve sophomore outside
linebacker from Pittsburgh whom Tech coaches decided to use for his
cover skills on Georgia's big-play receiver Hines Ward across the
middle.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I turned in, I was in good position,'' Booker said. ``I
was trying to 'wall' him in, keep him from beating me on the
inside. He dove and I dove after him. I landed on top of him. Three
and a half yards away Travares Tillman had intercepted the pass. I
got up to celebrate, (and) then I saw the flag.''
</P>
<P>
   Booker and his teammates still doubt the call. Georgia players
said afterward they thought it was good call.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a big-time NFL prospect; I'm playing against him looking
for my first big break,'' Booker said. ``I have a chance to make
the winning stop. . . . I was the one who gave them another chance
to score on us. I had to live with it.''
</P>
<P>
   It brought Booker to tears. It disturbed his sleep. It put him
on his knees to pray.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the next month and a half, I dreamed about it a lot,''
Booker said. ``It's been on my mind ever since. I still have a bad
taste in my mouth every time I think about Georgia. I'm looking for
a chance Saturday to redeem myself.''
</P>
<P>
   The year-old memories aren't anywhere close to fading, but for
the Yellow Jackets, maybe that's not just a bad thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``You always want to remember where you came from,'' senior
defensive end Jesse Tarplin said. ``Every long drive we have is a
reminder of the Georgia game. We feel like if we ever get in a
situation like that again, we can come up with a big play.''

 &HT;    Dusty Renfro shows determination, good attitude
 &HT;    By Mark Wangrin
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Normally, Dusty Renfro would deal with this
problem like he did anything else, just bludgeon it into submission
with sheer determination. Kind of like he did with the speech
impediment, or in winning district in the shot and discus with a
broken hand, or in becoming the driving force of the Longhorn
defense with the song of too-small, too-slow, ringing in his ears.
</P>
<P>
   Sleep is a different animal, though. The more you try to drift
off, the more your mind races with possibilities, and Sunday night
the senior linebacker's head was ground zero of cranial activity.
</P>
<P>
   He crawled into bed at 11 p.m. with visions of Friday's game
against Texas A&AMP;M, his final home game as a Texas Longhorn. He
picked off a pass. Made a sack. Stood up the running back at the
goal line. The clock ran, but the game must have gone into
quintuple overtime, because it was 4:30 a.m. and he was still
tackling, blitzing and sacking.
</P>
<P>
   Once was a time when Renfro had a sure-fire cure for anxiety
induced insomnia, courtesy of his mom, Mary. One night long ago,
after visions of a horror movie melded with the imagination of a
4-year-old, dust bunnies became monsters, fears became tears and
sleep became out of the question. Thinking quickly, Mary filled a
spray bottle with water and slapped on a hand-written label that
read, ``Monster Spray.'' Spritz a little under the bed before you
go to sleep, mom said, and monsters stay away. Every night at
bedtime. Spritz. Spritz. Spritz.
</P>
<P>
   This time was different. Monster spray wasn't needed, because
monsters weren't what Renfro feared. If anything, in his dreams he
was the monster and the Aggies were the petrified 4-year-old.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to have the game of my life,'' Renfro says.
</P>
<P>
   To do that, Renfro would have to outshine his more illustrious
counterpart, Aggie inside linebacker Dat Nguyen, a Butkus Award
finalist. ``I definitely want to outplay Dat,'' Renfro says. ``That
means I'd be doing more for my team than he is for his. Really,
I've got to.''
</P>
<P>
   Renfro finally drifted off in the pre-dawn hours Monday,
presumably dreaming of just how he was going to do that. It's a
tall order, but Renfro is used to standing taller than his listed
6-feet, hitting harder than his 239-pounds and running faster than
his 4.8 speed in the 40 yard dash.
</P>
<P>
   ``His desire to be good is his No. 1 asset,'' says Texas
linebacker coach and defensive coordinator Carl Reese. ``If you
drew up the prototype linebacker, that would be the No. 1 asset.
Then you'd want him to be 6-4, run a 4.4 _ but he's got the thing
I'd pick first in a linebacker.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've gained more appreciation for him from the first day than
any player I've ever coached,'' head coach Mack Brown says. ``He's
a great role model for us in recruiting. I told our coaches, go
find players with the heart, desire and academics of Dusty Renfro.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been a fun year of coaching, and he's one of the
reasons.''
</P>
<P>
   Renfro, who over the years has been a regular at the weekly
press luncheons despite having to stomach a steady diet of
questions about the defense's shortcomings along with the brisket
and sausage, doesn't shy away from the criticism.
</P>
<P>
   ``They always forget that I'm one of the strongest players (450
bench press, 585 squat) on the team,'' Renfro says of his
detractors. ``Also, I'm about to become the fifth-leading tackler
in school history. That's got to count for something.''
</P>
<P>
   Fact is, Renfro was cut out to play linebacker from the moment
he was born to Mary and her husband Terry, who had aspired to play
college football at UT-Arlington before learning Mary was pregnant
with their first child, Chad, after which he took two jobs to make
ends meet while going to college. ``My dad tells me all the time
I'm living out his dream,'' Dusty says.
</P>
<P>
   The first word out of the infant Dusty's mouth was ``ball.'' His
parents bought him a ``little bitty'' football uniform and he
worked on his tackling technique in the front yard. ``If it wasn't
his brother, it was the trees,'' Mary recalls. ``I don't think he
won too many of those battles _ the trees are still standing.''
</P>
<P>
   Dusty started playing football for real in second grade, moving
in immediately at middle linebacker on the Alvarado Chiefs of the
Brazos Valley Pee Wee Football Association, a team that included
third and fourth graders. When the team went into one-on-one
tackling drills, the other players suddenly grew interested in
math. ``They were always back there counting positions, to see who
was going to face him,'' says Terry, who coached that team. ``They
were always playing musical chairs, trying not to face him.''
</P>
<P>
   He was always strong. As the family was preparing to go to the
funeral of a cousin died of Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever, Dusty
developed a high fever, too, and Mary noticed a tick bite on his
neck. They took Dusty to the hospital, and it took three adults to
hold down the 7-year-old to take his blood. (Turns out he hates
needles. Also turns out he did have Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever,
and only a quick dose of tetracycline saved his life, Mary says.)
</P>
<P>
   At 12, he tried the bench press for the first time and promptly
lifted 200 pounds. His strength earned him the requisite nicknames
_ Bam Bam and Tank _ and it also attracted the attention of
Alvarado High School football coach and athletic director Jim
Skinner, who wanted Renfro to throw the shot put and discus for the
track team. Renfro made him a deal: I'll win the shot and disc at
district for you; you get me a powerlifting team. Agreed.
</P>
<P>
   On the eve of both competitions, Renfro got something else _ a
broken hand from a fist fight with, as Renfro put it, ``a couple of
Harley-Davidson guys.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought he shouldn't life with a broken hand,'' Terry says,
``but he was bigger than we were.''
</P>
<P>
   So he lifted, finishing second in the 242-pound class at the
state meet, held at A&AMP;M (''I strutted around in my Texas hat, shirt
off, staring everyone down,'' he recalls warmly). He also made good
on his promise, winning the shot and discus at the district track
meet.
</P>
<P>
   Though he nearly committed to Spike Dykes on his recruiting
visit to Texas Tech, he wound up becoming a Longhorn, something
he'd always dreamed about. He backed up Tyson King at inside
linebacker as a freshman and became a full-time starter as a
sophomore, missing two games with a thumb injury. Last year he
began the season at strongside linebacker in the new 4-3 set, but
moved back to the middle after Aaron Humphrey's trial there didn't
pan out.
</P>
<P>
   This year he hasn't made as many tackles as his career-high 116
last fall _ a function of the defensive improvement _ but he
already has more sacks (6) and as many pressures (3) as he had in
his three previous seasons combined.
</P>
<P>
   What Renfro lacks in speed, he has to make up for in smarts.
Before each game, he watches each of the take-home videotapes of
the opponent's three previous games twice. ``I'm trying to find
something that will tell me the play before the snap,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Against Oklahoma State, Renfro noticed that when the right
tackle was in a two-point, pass-blocking stance while all the other
linemen were in three-point stances, it meant a weakside lead run
was coming. Every time OSU lined up that way, Renfro shouted the
call to his teammates (''It was Fat Boy,' in honor of the tackle,''
Renfro grins) and the play was shut down.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt he's dreaming of similar feats against the Aggies, and
he isn't about to let someone tell him it isn't possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the last time,'' Renfro says. ``There are things I
want to get done.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked for his favorite Dusty story, Terry pauses and says,
``Really, every time he plays the game. We expect the best and he
delivers it. All the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard Mack Brown say that he used to think Dusty was an
overachiever, because he didn't run a 4.5 40, but that he realized
that after you keep doing it for a while, you become an achiever.''

 &HT;    Movie review of 'Home Fries'
 &HT;    By Chris Garcia
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ When a movie has to graft on a Cobra attack
helicopter as a major comic device, you can be sure the script is
wanting just a wee bit.
</P>
<P>
   In the hopelessly dumb ``Home Fries,'' the airborne conveyance
pops up twice, out of nowhere and for no apparent reason. Um, it
looks cool? It creates the illusion of a big-budget movie?
</P>
<P>
   My theory is that director Dean Parisot has a friend or uncle
who owns a Cobra chopper and he just couldn't resist using it in
his movie. He should have, for the result is one of the most
awkward and unnatural visual gags I've ever seen. And I'm just
pointing out the most blatant example of forced ``wacky humor''
that makes ``Home Fries'' such a queasy dud.
</P>
<P>
   Filmed in Bastrop two years ago this month (the finished movie
moldered in limbo for well over a year), the dark Southern farce
stars Drew Barrymore as a drive-thru clerk at the local
Burger-Matic. She's burstingly pregnant, but the sad-sack father is
not only married, he just died of a heart attack caused by, guess
what, that infernal helicopter. (The scene is astonishingly
preposterous.)
</P>
<P>
   The copter pilots are dim-bulb brothers (Luke Wilson and toothy
Jake Busey) and the guy they snuffed is their stepfather. Their
mother (Catherine O'Hara), mortified by his adultery, nudged the
boys to do it. Now she wants the guilty mistress deleted as well.
Thing is, one of the boys has fallen for the mistress (Barrymore)
and ... well, the story plummets to embarrassing depths of inanity
from there.
</P>
<P>
   Lacking an authentic moment, a smart joke or persuasive acting
(even the doleful Shelly Duvall just kind of lies there), ``Home
Fries'' tries desperately to work off its white-trash quirks and
hillbilly cutes, from the drunk, scrappy redneck to the big-haired
bimbo who lives in a trailer. We're supposed to laugh. I winced.
</P>

   Hoopla for Williams won't include stopping game
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The 81,000 fans expected at Royal-Memorial
Stadium Friday morning will be in for huge dose of Ricky Williams
if the star Texas running back breaks the Division I-A rushing
record against Texas A&AMP;M.
</P>
<P>
   But the huge dose won't come until after the game.
</P>
<P>
   UT officials planned Monday for a Williams celebration, figuring
that he likely will rush for the 63 yards he needs to break Tony
Dorsett's career rushing record of 6,082.
</P>
<P>
   Don't expect the game to be stopped when Williams gets the
record. The football, if the game officials allow it, will be
secured and taken safely to the sideline. It will be sent, along
with Williams' jersey, to the National Football Foundation Hall of
Fame in South Bend, Ind.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't intrude on the integrity of the game,'' said UT
associate athletic director Chris Plonsky. ``If he breaks it, you
announce, and the game keeps going.''
</P>
<P>
   After the game, there will be about a two-minute video tribute
to Williams on the JumboTron scoreboard. Coach Mack Brown also
plans to address the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Williams said Monday he wants no fuss.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it were up to me, there would be no big deal,'' Williams
said. ``We'd keep playing the game, then I'd go into the locker
room, no big deal.''
</P>
<P>
   But it's obviously not up to Williams.
</P>
<P>
   ABC will broadcast the game to a national audience. The network
has been hyping Williams and the game since last weekend.
</P>
<P>
   And Dorsett plans to fly to Austin on Friday morning. His plane
lands 25 minutes before kickoff, and he will be given a police
escort to the stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Dorsett has been issued a sideline pass. He will be accompanied
by former UT great and Heisman winner Earl Campbell, who saw his UT
career rushing record broken by Williams earlier this season.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, there have been more than 500 media passes issued.
Along with the state newspapers, representatives of Sports
Illustrated, the New York Times, the San Diego Times-Union and the
Chicago Tribune will be on hand to chronicle Williams' assault on
college football history. Even the Columbia Missourian has
requested a credential. Officials with the Walter Camp Football
Foundation also have been given press passes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The in-state papers are doubling and tripling their
coverage,'' said Bill Little, UT assistant athletic director. He
said the media throng rivals the number of journalists who covered
the UT-Notre Dame game in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   However, a number of the credentials were issued to reporters
and photographers from small weekly papers around the state. The
px is full, and the overflow will be given sideline passes.
No more credentials will be issued.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every weekly paper got a pass because of Mack Brown's feeling
that this game is so important to the state of Texas,'' Little
said.

 &HT;    Travel agents face cut in pay, online booking
 &HT;    By Jerry Mahoney
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Just as she did three years ago, Austin travel
agent Beth Barnes is once again looking around her office for ways
to cut costs.
</P>
<P>
   If it isn't needed, it faces elimination. Expenses for
conferences, new equipment, even magazine subscriptions are
scrutinized.
</P>
<P>
   Like Barnes, travel agency owners across Central Texas and
throughout the country are trying to figure out how to absorb what
amounts to another pay cut from several major airlines.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, American Airlines and Delta Air Lines announced they
would match United Airlines in capping commissions on all
international flights at $100 round-trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been very devastating for our business,'' said
Barnes, owner of B. Barnes Travel on Shoal Creek Boulevard in
Austin.
</P>
<P>
   The average international fare is $2,420 for a round-trip
ticket, according to the American Society of Travel Agents.
</P>
<P>
   With an 8 percent commission, travel agents would make $193.60
when they sold a ticket at that price. Now they get $100.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a long-range blow to our income,'' said Nancy Linares,
co-owner of Holidays 'N Travel of Austin. The agency, which employs
10 agents, gets 80 percent of its revenue from international
travel, she said.
</P>
<P>
   It's not just airlines putting the squeeze on travel agents
these days. Increasing sales of airline tickets over the Internet,
at sites like Microsoft's Expedia Travel, Travelocity and at
airlines' proprietary Web sites also are cutting into some
agencies' profits.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, travel agents still arrange an estimated 80 percent of
all airline flights, according to Linares.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't the first time that airlines, looking for ways to cut
their own costs, have cut commissions for travel agents.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, most major U.S. airlines capped commissions on domestic
flights at $50 for a round-trip fare. Commissions on international
bookings stayed at 10 percent until September 1997, when they were
cut to 8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Following 1995's cuts, employees of Round Rock Travel &AMP; Tours
thought they could make up the lower commissions by booking more
flights.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were just all getting frazzled and we were making
mistakes,'' said owner Bill Peckham.
</P>
<P>
   The agency stopped booking travel for some of its biggest
customers, including Southwestern University in Georgetown. Like
many agencies, Round Rock Travel &AMP; Tours now focuses on companies
that specialize in cruises or tours, which still pay 10 percent
commissions, Peckham said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tour companies and the cruise companies still love us,''
Peckham said.
</P>
<P>
   Delta said it paid more than $1 billion in travel agency
commissions last year, and expects the new cap to save $40 million
to $45 million annually.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers may soon be asked to make up for the lost revenues.
</P>
<P>
   Holidays 'N Travel's Linares, who also is on the board of the
American Retail Travel Agents Association trade group, said
agencies will be forced to charge travelers fees _ or if they
already charge fees, raise them _ to make up for lost commissions.
</P>
<P>
   The ASTA is quick to blame it on the airlines.
</P>
<P>
   ``The airlines know perfectly well that since they're reducing
the level of compensation below what it costs agents to process
tickets that the agents will have to turn to the consumers with
service fees,'' said Steve Loucks, a spokesman for the travel
agents society.
</P>
<P>
   According to an ASTA survey taken in June, 64 percent of member
agencies are charging some type of fee for doing services such as
issuing refunds, canceling trips and sending faxes to customers.
The average fee for a service is about $10.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent announcement has travel agents wondering what to
do next.
</P>
<P>
   The travel agent society said it is considering whether to try
and make an antitrust case, claiming the airlines are trying to
monopolize all ticketing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Independent studies have shown travel agents provide lower
fares than when the consumer contacts the airline directly,''
Loucks said. ``We believe that United's move is part of a
far-reaching strategy on the part of all the carriers to move
consumers to book directly with the carriers, so they'll pay more
for their tickets.''
</P>
<P>
   The Department of Transportation is already looking into whether
airlines discriminate against online travel services and travel
agents who use the Internet to obtain tickets.
</P>
<P>
   In his small offices across town from Dell Computer Corp., whose
online sales average more than $10 million a day, Peckham of Round
Rock Tour &AMP; Travel said he believes the Internet is overrated as a
means to buy airline tickets.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, there is no assurance the Internet sites display
the most current or lowest information, Peckham and other agents
say.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet is estimated to account for only about 1 percent of
airline ticket sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, there are too many of us old people who want to
come in and talk to somebody who has been on that ship,'' said
Peckham, who is 70.

 &HT;    UT should to retire Williams' No. 34
 &HT;    By Kirk Bohls
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Friday's war will be the final time that we'll
see Ricky Williams running wild at Royal-Memorial Stadium. Other
than the bowl game next month, it should also mark the last time
we'll see his jersey number anywhere in college football.
</P>
<P>
   In what should be the biggest no-brainer since Playboy chose to
feature Katarina Witt over Dick Button, the University of Texas
should announce this week that it is retiring Williams' No. 34.
</P>
<P>
   No Longhorns player could duplicate or exceed the
accomplishments on or off the field that this guy with the funny
hairdo and the genteel manner has compiled over the last four
glorious seasons. Consequently, Texas should extend him the
ultimate honor and take his jersey number out of circulation for
all-time.
</P>
<P>
   ``That'd be nice,'' Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   Few, if any, would argue the impact that Williams has had on any
number of levels, be it recruiting, exposure _ even fund-raising,
since he has helped raise $18,000 for the general scholarship fund
through the Doak Walker Award and ABC Player of the Game
decorations and should bring in another $10,000 with another Doak
Walker trophy. Williams has certainly been one of the top five
players in the history of this school.
</P>
<P>
   Come Saturday morning, he will awaken as the greatest running
back in college football history. Actually, he can wake up today as
the same, but the official coronation won't come until yard No. 63
against Texas A&AMP;M on Friday gives him the all-time Division I-A
rushing mark that currently belongs to Tony Dorsett.
</P>
<P>
   A decision to retire Ricky's garment might not be the slam-dunk
most would think. Remember, this is a school that has retired only
one jersey of the 64 All-America football players who have put on
the burnt orange and white, 31 of them consensus choices. Texas
didn't even remove Earl Campbell's No. 20 from use until 1979, two
years after he won his Heisman Trophy in his senior season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a precedent of retiring Heisman winner jerseys,''
Texas Athletic Director DeLoss Dodds said. ``There are a couple of
other people we've got to look at.''
</P>
<P>
   That would be linebacker Tommy Nobis (No. 60), considered the
greatest defensive player ever at the school, and quarterback Bobby
Layne (Nos. 41, 22), probably the school's greatest offensive
player preceding Campbell and Williams. Here's a vote for both of
theirs to be retired soon as well.
</P>
<P>
   Former Texas baseball coach Cliff Gustafson set off a firestorm
years ago when he publicly announced the school was retiring jersey
No. 21, which belonged to now-five-time Cy Young winner Roger
Clemens. The men's athletic council simmered privately after
Gustafson's presumption but eventually approved the move. The
backlash was considerable, because in the the next year the council
rebuffed Gus' plans to retire three-time All-American Burt Hooton's
jersey, which is why the lonely No. 21 sits on the right
center-field wall of Disch-Falk Field.
</P>
<P>
   Remember also that, while deserving now, Clemens never so much
as won All-Southwest Conference acclaim, a stinging rebuke that
irritates him to this day. Greg Swindell, who also wore No. 21, was
three times the UT pitcher Clemens was, but he has not been so
honored to this day. But then, Texas put Denton Cooley in its
Longhorn Hall of Honor more for replacing hearts than being the
heart and soul of the 1939-41 basketball teams.
</P>
<P>
   At North Carolina, Mack Brown said the Tar Heels have 15
``honored jerseys,'' as opposed to retired ones, for consensus
All-Americans, but running back Amos Lawrence doesn't fit in, even
though he and Dorsett are the only two backs to rush for 1,000
yards in four consecutive seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``The good thing is we have too many (potential honorees)
here,'' says Brown, now the Texas coach. ``But it's something I'd
like to see discussed.''
</P>
<P>
   Every school handles this delicate dilemma in its own way.
Alabama hasn't retired a single number despite 36 consensus
All-Americans. Neither has Notre Dame, despite having more than 30
players in the College Football Hall of Fame. As Irish football
spokesman John Heisler said Monday, ``There'd not be enough numbers
left to play a game. It's a difficult thing politically.''
</P>
<P>
   Illinois has retired Dick Butkus' No. 50 (he wore 51 for the
Bears) and Red Grange's No. 77. Ricky's wouldn't even be the first
No. 34 to be set aside nationally because Georgia has retired
Herschel Walker's, along with three other jerseys.
</P>
<P>
   Michigan has retired five numbers representing seven players.
Surely you recall the three Wistert brothers, ``Whitey,'' ``Ox''
and ``Moose'' _ all All-America linemen with All-American
nicknames. Even Gerald Ford's No. 48 was taken out of circulation.
He was a center on two national championship teams and a team
captain, but ``being president helps,'' Michigan's Jim Schneider
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Wolverines haven't retired his helmet because, of course, he
didn't wear one.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: E-mail to Gates: I feel your pain
 &HT;    By Stebbins Jefferson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Each morning when I read the newspaper, I look to the comics for
a bit of humor to jump-start my day. One day this week, however, I
found the best laugh in the Business section. There, I learned that
Bill Gates, the nation's richest man, has a lot in common with the
average computer dummy.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Gates is fighting an antitrust case. Like the rest of us,
he's finding out that e-mail is an unforgiving convenience.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department and 20 states are suing Mr. Gates'
company, Microsoft. They claim that to eliminate competition in the
computer software business, Microsoft embedded Internet browser
software into each Windows operating system. Microsoft's
competitor, Netscape, needs to sell its browser for the company to
grow.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, Mr. Gates is accused of trying to create an
illegal monopoly to force out competitors. He denies it. Though
Netscape may have been hurt, he says, he's just trying to improve
his product and better serve consumers.
</P>
<P>
   The case seems to hinge on intent, not consequences. That's
where Mr. Gates' own electronic words _ he writes more than 100
e-mails a day _ could reveal more than he wants the court to know.
</P>
<P>
   In January 1996, for example, he messaged top aides that
``winning Internet browser market share is a very, very important
goal.'' When asked in court what he meant by that statement, he
said he couldn't remember. In fact, the Harvard dropout who hired
Harvard graduates and made them all millionaires has trouble
answering any questions related to e-mail. He can't remember what
he was thinking when he wrote the memo or what his words meant.
Alas, he can't even remember wriels for pre-teens.
</P>
<P>
   Now, that's what I'd call girl power.

   At this time of year, the simple act of setting the table means
creating a backdrop festive enough for holiday meals. And what
could be more glorious than a table laden with fruit? Fruit is
nature's bounty and an eloquent symbol of its richness.
</P>
<P>
   The Dutch and Flemish masters immortalized fruit, as well as
flowers, in their prettiest still lifes. But it was the French,
during the 17th and 18th centuries, who refined fruit centerpieces
into soaring pyramids of glistening cherries and grapes; elaborate
epergnes whose branches were filled with strawberries, figs and
miniature apples; or a single golden pineapple served up on a
pedestal.
</P>
<P>
   The best fruits for creating table decorations have sturdy skins
and can thrive without being refrigerated. Apples, oranges and
lemons, for example, may last several weeks; grapes stay pretty for
four or five days.
</P>
<P>
   Combining fruit is as rich an art as arranging flowers _ and
just as rewarding, if you learn to appreciate fruit for its color,
shape, texture and size, as you do your favorite blooms. Be simple
or be grand. A single pear crowning a slender candlestick can be as
eloquent as a lily in a bud vase. Or a tower of plums, pears and
grapes can have the intricacy of a lavish bouquet.
</P>
<P>
   You can make delectable arrangements with surprising ease.
Construct a tall cone of fruit simply by piercing each piece of
fruit with a toothpick, then piling the fruit in circles on a
Styrofoam form. Create sparkling table ornaments with a coat of
spray-on adhesive and a frosting of granulated sugar. A single
piece of fruit can shine, dressed with a ribbon, at each place
setting.
</P>
<P>
   For still richer arrangements, combine fruit with greenery.
Sprigs of princess pine or boxwood can enliven a fruit pyramid. Red
fruit will look even more vivid against bluish evergreens, such as
eucalyptus or white pine.
</P>
<P>
   Wired to a wreath or garland, apples and plums will resemble
luscious Christmas-tree balls. And don't forget artificial fruit: A
swag garnished with polystyrene fruit is both lightweight and
long-lasting.
</P>
<P>
   Fruit is so vibrant it can provide a color theme for your table
or the decoration of an entire dining room. Fruit can also spin a
mood. A spiky pineapple and the bright, sunny hues of oranges,
lemons and limes may call to mind the tropics.
</P>
<P>
   But what fruit does best is help you welcome the holidays, and
your guests, with one of nature's sweetest, most prized gifts.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some ideas to try:
 &UR; SUGARED LEMONS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A light coating of sugar turns lemons into sparkling
decorations. Although they're not edible, sugared lemons are
long-lasting and especially easy to make.
</P>
<P>
   For an informal centerpiece, fill a bowl with sugared lemons, or
set them in eggcups or small goblets and dot them across the table.
</P>
<P>
   To make them, you'll need lemons; bamboo skewers; Spray-Mount (a
quick-drying adhesive available at art-supply or crafts stores);
granulated sugar; a spoon; a bowl; and craft paper.
</P>
<P>
   Insert a skewer into one end of a lemon. Working over craft
paper, hold lemon by skewer and coat with Spray-Mount. Sprinkle
granulated sugar over lemon with spoon, holding the fruit over bowl
to catch granules that do not adhere. Set sugared lemon on clean
piece of craft paper to dry.
 &UR; SHEER FRUIT POUCHES &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Gold-mesh bags filled with pears and lady apples or other fruit
can be grouped on a sideboard or as a centerpiece, or used singly
to mark each guest's place at the table. At the end of the evening,
your guests can carry them away.
</P>
<P>
   To make a pouch: Cut one piece each of gold tulle and
gold-metallic organza 4 inches wide and 8 inches long; pin
together.
</P>
<P>
   With scissors, round the two corners of one of the 4-inch sides.
Machine-stitch around the U, leaving the top open.
</P>
<P>
   Turn bag right side out, fill with fruit and tie with ribbon,
adding a sprig of grapes or an artificial ivy leaf and vine if you
wish. You may also want to trim the tops of the bags.
 &UR; FRUIT PYRAMID &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   To make a 12-inch apple pyramid, you'll need 40 to 50 dwarf
apples; boxwood sprigs; a 12-inch polystyrene cone; toothpicks;
scissors; and a pretty urn, footed bowl or platter. The same basic
technique can be used for larger pyramids made of different fruits,
or combinations of fruits.
</P>
<P>
   Cut off the point of the cone so the top is flat. Poke
toothpicks into bottoms of apples; insert on cone in rings,
starting with largest apples at the base. Finish top with one
apple. Fill in spaces by tucking short sprigs of boxwood between
apples.
</P>
<P>
   Set pyramid atop your desired container, adding more boxwood
sprigs beneath the bottom row of apples, if you wish.
 &UR; DECORATING WITH REDS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ripe red fruit can transform an otherwise quiet dining room for
the holidays. Here are several simple, inexpensive ways to
incorporate a variety of fruits into your table setting.
</P>
<P>
   _ As a centerpiece, fill a silver or crystal footed bowl with
pears, apples, pomegranates, crab apples, and litchi nuts in
countless shades of crimson.
</P>
<P>
   _ Tie individual red apples with sheer silver ribbon and place
one at each place setting. The shiny red apples make tasty gifts
for dinner guests, who can eat them with dessert or save them for a
healthy midnight snack.
</P>
<P>
   _ Surround pillar candles, on heatproof plates or in wide glass
cylinders, with plump cranberries (the berries should reach no
higher than a quarter of the way up the sides of the candles).
</P>
<P>
   _ On a surface like a mantel or sideboard, perch red pears on
one pair of candlesticks, and make tiny wreaths of viburnum berries
to encircle another pair. Line the mantel or sideboard with
cuttings of greenery to provide contrast in texture and color, and
nestle a few more pieces of red fruit among the cuttings.
</P>

   Ripe red fruit and scarlet seat cushions on the Gustavian-style
dining chairs transform an otherwise quiet green-and-white dining
room for the holidays. On the antique brass-edged mahogany dining
table, a handblown Murano glass bowl holds pears, apples,
pomegranates, crab apples and litchi nuts in countless shades of
crimson; a single apple marks each place setting. A similar mix of
red fruits, the papery litchi contrasting with the smooth apples,
dresses up the mantel. In shimmering niches displaying a collection
of creamware, tiny wrapped gifts and still more red fruit add dots
of color.

 (FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE)
 ADAPTED FROM ``DECORATING FOR THE HOLIDAYS: CHRISTMAS WITH MARTHA
STEWART LIVING, VOLUME 2''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; (EDITOR'S NOTE: Information about the ``Decorating for the
Holidays'' book is offered at the end of this article. THIS
INFORMATION MUST BE INCLUDED WITH THIS PIECE WHEN IT IS PUBLISHED
IN YOUR NEWSPAPER.) &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With only gray skies surrounding it, a house in early winter can
look stark. But hang a wreath or a swag on the front door, and your
house will spring to life.
</P>
<P>
   Cuttings of evergreen are sweet compensation for the leaves that
are missing from most of the trees, and the tart hues of winter
berries are reminders that nature has not forgotten about color,
even though the garden is no longer in bloom. Add wide ribbons and
twinkling lights, and holiday spirit brims over.
</P>
<P>
   The Victorians, who never willingly left a surface unadorned,
are sometimes credited with the custom of hanging Christmas wreaths
on front doors. In more recent years, front-door displays have
taken many forms, from flashy tinsel wreaths with silver-metallic
bows to electric-light garlands that spell out ``Season's
Greetings.''
</P>
<P>
   The most eloquent outdoor ornaments, however, are usually simple
and natural, made from the hearty fruit and greenery that flourish
while almost all of the landscape hibernates.
</P>
<P>
   Winter's harvest abounds with unexpected textures and shapes,
such as spiky pinecones and smooth little eucalyptus seeds. And the
palette is more than the red and green we expect. We do get those
colors, of course, in abundance: scarlet cranberries, blood-red
rose hips, crimson Pyracantha and a cavalcade of greenery _
silver-green eucalyptus, blue-green cedar, deep-green boxwood, and
the astonishing chartreuse and olive-green of the intriguingly
named golden hinoki false cypress.
</P>
<P>
   But there is also the tangy purple of privet berries, the spongy
gold of kumquats and the yellow pods and wild-red centers of
bittersweet.
</P>
<P>
   To make decorations for your front door, you may find all the
raw materials you need growing in your own yard or garden, but if
you don't, visit garden centers, florists, Christmas-tree lots,
even greengrocers.
</P>
<P>
   If the greenery you have chosen feels sappy or prickly, be sure
to wear work gloves. And remember that although there is nothing
wrong with a big spray of holly tied with a red bow, embellishing
the traditional recipes can yield lovely results. For example, try
finishing a large wreath with crisscrossed strings of cranberries
instead of a bow. (See instructions below.)
</P>
<P>
   Once you have learned how to cut and wire greenery, outdoor
ornaments are easy to construct and make enjoyable projects for
brisk winter days, especially when you are working with fragrant
greens. If you select cuttings that are as fresh as possible, and
the weather stays cold, your outdoor displays should last for
weeks, spreading holiday cheer throughout the season.
 &UR; CRANBERRY-LACED WREATH &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This large, cranberry-wrapped wreath looks as handsome on a
window or wall as it does on a front door. You can also make two
small wreaths and strands of ribbon and cranberries to frame it _
or to decorate an interior window or mirror.
</P>
<P>
   To make the entire arrangement, you'll need a 20-inch tubular
straw wreath form; two 6-inch single-wire wreath forms; floral
pins; 24-gauge floral wire; cranberries; 4-inch-wide ribbon; and
golden hinoki false cypress. We chose this greenery because the
dark cranberries stand out against its varied hues of green;
light-colored fancy cedar can also be used.
</P>
<P>
   1. To make the large wreath, place the straw wreath form on a
table and, using floral pins, attach sprigs of greenery all the way
around. Vary the wreath's color by alternating light, medium and
dark greens.
</P>
<P>
   2. To make cranberry strands: First twist one end of a length of
floral wire into a knot. String cranberries, one by one, onto wire,
piercing each berry from end to end. Finish the strand with another
knot, to keep berries on wire.
</P>
<P>
   3. To decorate the wreath, lay strands of berries on the wreath
to plot a crisscross pattern; use floral pins to indicate where the
strands intersect. Be sure the ends of the strands fall on the back
of the wreath. When you are pleased with the pattern, anchor the
cranberry strands with floral pins.
</P>
<P>
   Draping the cranberry strands can be difficult so, if possible,
have someone help you: One person holds the wreath and the other
weaves the strands.
</P>
<P>
   4. To complete the doorway decorations, make two wreaths using
6-inch wire wreath forms, floral wire and sprigs of golden hinoki
false cypress. Secure the end of the floral wire to the wire form.
Place a few sprigs of greenery on the form, and wrap the wire
around the cut ends and the form several times, securing the
greenery to the form; do not cut the wire.
</P>
<P>
   Add more sprigs, overlapping the first ones by about half; wrap
with wire. Continue adding sprigs until the form is completely
covered. Cut and wrap the wire to secure.
</P>
<P>
   Hang the small wreathes from nails placed above opposite sides
of the door. Thread two cranberry strands and a long length of
satin ribbon through the two wreaths. The ribbon and cranberry
strands should swoop gracefully above the door.
</P>
<P>
   When the ribbon and cranberry strands are positioned correctly,
cut the ribbon ends on a diagonal.
</P>

 &HT;    Pondering the dream refrigerator
 &HT;    (EDS: Embargoed for Nov. 26)
 &HT;    By Kitty Crider
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Oh, for the ultimate fridge today. A walk-in
cooler with limitless room to stash turkey and dressing, molds and
bowls of salads and vegetables, relish trays, pies of pecan,
pumpkin and sweet potato, all without having to rearrange three
shelves to make things fit.
</P>
<P>
   And it would not have to be a one-day wonder. Come summer such a
haven of refrigeration could be a secret hideout. Pull in a
La-Z-Boy, stock the shelves with beverages and books, shut the door
and chill out July and August's mind-frying heat.
</P>
<P>
   That would be so cool. But definite overkill.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, maybe I should go with a Traulsen, that commercial
refrigerator loved by chefs and food pros who even sneak it into
their homes despite the fact that it lacks door shelves and an ice
maker and doesn't meet energy codes for residences. It has great
space and refrigeration. But if I slip one into the neighborhood,
I'm going to feel really bad if I take out everyone's power during
the holidays.
</P>
<P>
   So maybe there's time to have a Sub-Zero delivered today before
noon. Basic appliances in upscale homes, Sub-Zero fridges are so
popular that the manufacturer can hardly make them fast enough,
even at prices more expensive than some new cars my husband and I
purchased in our early married days.
</P>
<P>
   With two compressors, one for the fridge and one for the
freezer, Sub-Zeros last forever. I opened a friend's the other day;
it has been humming happily for more than 20 years. That's more
than I can say for mine.
</P>
<P>
   But other friends are frustrated because large deli platters and
baking sheets won't fit on the Sub-Zero's trademark shallower
shelves. Probably wouldn't be very energy-efficient to leave the
door cracked to accommodate that oversize turkey platter, now would
it?
</P>
<P>
   Besides, such open-door actions would spoil the looks of these
fridges, known for their beauty. We're talking wood-paneled doors _
extra charge of course _ that cleverly conceal the unit. I can just
visualize my relatives and good friends rummaging through the
cabinets looking for the Dr Pepper.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, if I go with this elegant paneled or trendy stainless
steel look, I'm going to have to give up the photo album on my
fridge. Sure, some might consider it a cluttered look, but I call
it a fridge with personality. No matter what mood I'm in, I always
smile as I approach the refrigerator door and look at the snapshot
of our sons cutting up, view the photo from a friend's wedding,
admire the new baby of a former baby sitter. My fridge is not just
an appliance to hold good food, but a reminder of good times, too.
</P>
<P>
   Gee, I thought my ultimate fridge search would be simple: a unit
that is at least 20 cubic feet but no wider than 36 inches. It must
keep my celery and lettuce crisp for more than 30 minutes. I want
spill-proof shelves, adjustable to accommodate big birds and tall
bottles of oils and condiments. Give me a deli/cheese drawer, big
produce bins, shelves on the door and some freezer space that does
not turn the ice cream to crystals. Is that asking too much?
</P>
<P>
   ``Have you checked out the new 25-cubic-foot side-by-side
fridges?'' asks a veteran home economist in the appliance industry.
They have pull-out freezer shelves, adjustable door bins that hold
gallons of milk or soda, humidity controls on the crispers, and
those optional ice-maker and water dispensers Is that ultimate
enough?
</P>
<P>
   If not, these fridges also have a quick freeze shelf in the
freezer, extra cold bins for meats and drinks, wine racks and
filtered water systems, all for under $2,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Get real!'' admonishes my nephew, the television sportscaster,
touting the finer points of a dorm fridge. It's big enough to hold
a jar of salsa, a six-pack, a leftover turkey leg and a piece of
pie. It can sit by your chair where you can open the door with one
hand and hold the remote with the other. It's even the right height
to serve as a TV stand.
</P>
<P>
   All in the eyes of the remote beholder. Refrigerator Buyer's
Guide Ranges from 1.7 cubic feet in a small dorm refrigerator to 24
cubic feet or more for a large kitchen model. About 20 cubic feet
is good for a family of four.

   Pondering the dream TV
</P>
<P>
   (EDS: Embargoed for Nov. 26)
</P>
<P>
   By Diane Holloway
</P>
<P>
   C. 1998 Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Size counts. Anybody who thinks otherwise is
probably humming the national anthem of Monaco.
</P>
<P>
   Big is good, but huge isn't necessarily better _ or realistic _
when it comes to the ultimate home entertainment center.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on the size and configuration of your viewing area,
super-huge TV screens, like the appalling 100-inch,
front-projection home theaters that are lurking out there, look
grainy and distorted at relatively close range.
</P>
<P>
   So, with a belly full of turkey and a heart full of thanks, I'll
settle in front of my ``dream wall'' to gobble up a football game
or two and wind up the day with a sappy Frank Capra movie or a
blood-chilling Alfred Hitchcock thriller. That swell little
picture-in-a-picture feature allows me to keep track of the news on
CNN.
</P>
<P>
   The picture on my fantasy TV is clear as a bell, thanks to that
home satellite dish. Experts say big-screen TV sets, like my brand
new 53-inch Sony rear-projection model, aren't nearly as impressive
on cable or antennae. You've gotta do the dish for maximum visual
pleasure. But you've also gotta keep cable or buy an outside
antenna to keep the local stations.
</P>
<P>
   Most people with ultimate entertainment on their minds ignore
the built-in sound systems in big-screen TVs and install a
``surround sound'' system, like the one that shakes your drink cup
in a movie theater. This requires a pre-amplifier, an amplifier, a
sub-woofer and five. You can turn up the volume sky high and not
get a single scratch, pop or distortion. Your ears may bleed, but
it's a joyful bleeding.
</P>
<P>
   I've chosen this fantasy home entertainment center with a
modicum of restraint. My den is a modest size, so I've opted for
the 53-inch set rather than one of those monstrous 60-, 65- or
80-inch rear projection models or one of those wall-sized, 100-inch
front projection models. (I've also ignored those petite 36-inch
models. Fine for real life, but, hey, this is a fantasy.) Since the
sole purpose of our living room is to shelter the Christmas tree
every year, the den is the only place I'll put a TV _ except for
the tiny TV/VCR hidden in our bedroom.
</P>
<P>
   It's not just a matter of wall space. You've got to be able to
get far enough away from the screen that you're not looking at
lines and dots. A guide from the Consumer Electronics Manufacturing
Association says your viewing range for a TV larger than 46 inches
should be between 13 and 15 feet. Our den can accommodate
pleasurable viewing of a 53-incher without anyone going blind.
</P>
<P>
   With this fabulous (and fabulously large) picture, Troy Aikman
appears to be throwing the old pigskin right into my turkey-greased
hands. And I hear every awful crunch and crackle on the field. This
is not necessarily good, hearing bones break, so I might switch off
the surround sound and return to the TV sound for the duration of
football.
</P>
<P>
   Next up on the dream wall is movie time. Slip a video disc into
the shiny new DVD player and up comes the real reason people
mortgage their houses to buy big-screen TV sets. Watching a movie
on disc on the dream wall is almost as good as watching one in a
top-notch stadium seat theater. And this is where super digital
stereo surround sound can take your breath (and eyelashes) away.
</P>
<P>
   You may be wondering where I've put all this ultimate home
entertainment stuff, and the answer is this: in the ultimate home
entertainment center cabinet. Mine is wood, to match the other
furniture in the room, and it's remarkably tasteful. Some of these
things look like altars, which can make couch potatoes feel a tad
guilty.
</P>
<P>
   But this one has two columns of shelves on each side (to hold
sound equipment, VCR, DVD and other necessary accessories) with an
adjustable hole for the TV in the middle. It's adjustable so that I
can accommodate up to an 80-inch high-definition TV when the
digital age fully arrives. Of course, I'll also have to win the
lottery and trade up to a much larger house at the same time.

 &HT;    Get ready, Florida: Here comes Field Hockey!
 &HT;    By Ron Hayes
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WELLINGTON, Fla. _ You know what field hockey is _ right?
</P>
<P>
   It's kind of like polo, but without the horse.
</P>
<P>
   A little like soccer, but they play it with sticks.
</P>
<P>
   A bit like football, but the ball is round.
</P>
<P>
   The sport, which has never been very popular outside the
Northeast, and largely limited to Ivy League schools, is about to
become very good for Palm Beach County.
</P>
<P>
   About 4,500 field hockey players and family members arrive today
for four days of games at Palm Beach Polo Club.
</P>
<P>
   Along with their passion for the little-known sport, they also
will bring about $2 million into the local economy, according to
Pam Gerig, executive director of the Palm Beach County Sports
Commission, which has lured the U.S. Field Hockey Association back
for another National Hockey Festival.
</P>
<P>
   The athletes will stay in 13 different hotels, eat Thanksgiving
dinner at eight local restaurants and rent 100 vehicles from local
agencies during their stay. And they'll be back next year, for
sure, and have an option for the 2000 games.
</P>
<P>
   This year's festival is a return visit for the association,
which held its 1996 games here after the sports commission hosted a
``familiarization day,'' driving representatives of various sports
associations to local venues.
</P>
<P>
   That first visit was sweetened by a $15,000 grant from the
commission, and another $20,000 this year and next, Gerig said. The
money comes from the county bed-tax.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never thought we could host field hockey because it's not
really known or played in South Florida,'' Gerig conceded, ``but
when we showed them the polo grounds, they said, `Wow!''
</P>
<P>
   Field hockey is played by two teams of 11 players each, with
each team scoring points by knocking the ball into the goal. It
requires a playing area 100 yards long by 60 yards wide. With 165
teams participating in the association's largest event ever,
festival organizers figured they'd need about 22 fields.
</P>
<P>
   Palm Beach Polo Club, with 14 polo fields 300-by-160 yards each,
has more than enough space, and sunny days in November, too.
</P>
<P>
   Now all they need is more local fans.
</P>
<P>
   The event will bring players from 30 states, Canada, Germany,
The Netherlands and the Cayman Islands. But none from Palm Beach
County.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this country it suffers from the same problems as soccer,''
says Howard Thomas, an association spokesman. ``It's not on TV, and
it's not a professional sport.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're working to change some of that, and we hope this
festival helps the exposure.''
</P>

 &HT;    The recline of Western civilization
 &HT;    (EDS: Embargoed for Nov. 26)
 &HT;    By Patrick Beach
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ To have a La-Z-Boy recliner, preferably one of
those with the side pocket for magazines and the remote, is to have
a beach house in the middle of your living room _ to have, within
walking distance, a retreat. You don't sit in a La-Z-Boy _ that
most American piece of furniture _ so much as succumb to it. You
accept what the La-Z-Boy offers: peace, torpor, a chance to say I
am not available at this time. I was working, and now I am not.
Open a cold one, grab the remote and take your brain off-line for
routine maintenance.
</P>
<P>
   To sit in a La-Z-Boy (practice saying it with me, boys and girls
_ don't utter a rushing headlong ``lazyboy'' rather but ``Lay''
(pause) ``Zee'' (pause) ``Boy'' _ is to sit with your eyebrows,
elbows, navel. It is to sit with your essence.
</P>
<P>
   To sit in a La-Z-Boy is to recline, to be at an angle _ not
horizontal, because that would imply being sickly, sleepy, dead or
comatose. To be in a La-Z-Boy at an angle is a paradox of
relaxation: to be in a state of deep rest, to be sure, but also
catlike, ready to shoot out of the chair in an instant if, for
instance, a person needs to be forcibly shooed away from blocking
your view of the football game.
</P>
<P>
   To sit in a La-Z-Boy is to be perfectly average, middle America
incarnate, fat, happy, full of turkey and smack dab in the great
American mean. You are middle class. Not upper middle, not lower
middle. You are in the exact middle of the middle class in your
La-Z-Boy. You are so middle-of-the-road, if you were on Interstate
35, you'd get run over. You embrace this knowledge. Say it again,
slowly: Lay. Zee. Boy. Exhale slowly as you say that last word,
feeling the worry empty out of you through toes perched atop the
foot rest.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, you could easily spend more on a reclining chair. You could
spend more on a reclining chair than you probably spent on your
car, but who can relax in an expensive reclining chair? At what
point would you stop hearing the little voice saying, You spent
FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS on this thing? Never, that's when. You'd sit
in your expensive chair waiting for your first heart attack, and
when you'd had it you'd have the privilege of worrying about how
much that was going to cost you.
</P>
<P>
   No. Instead you investigated La-Z-Boy (Lay. Zee. Boyyyyyyy.).
You discovered La-Z-Boy sold not just recliners, not just sleeper
sofas, not just modular units (the mind reels _ astronomical
possibilities) but entire sets of furniture. They sell a way of
life. A philosophy.
</P>
<P>
   You read about the Dreamtime Reclina-Rocker, described in
pornographic detail: ``The sleek, eye-catching detail of Dreamtime
is sure to capture the attention of the contemporary consumer.''
(That's me! The contemporary consumer!) ``The bold, radiused front
posts are padded and skirted. The overstuffed back area offers
unique lines that are positioned to offer the utmost comfort.
Dreamtime _ a bold, new direction in the contemporary reclining
chairs.''
</P>
<P>
   You considered the Avenger, $879 in top grain leather, easy to
clean up those salsa stains, yessir. Not quite as voluptuous and
accommodating as the Dreamtime, maybe, but then the Dreamtime is
sort of the Monica Lewinsky of La-Z-Boy reclining chairs. But
terribly manly, the Avenger. If only it had an afterburner.
</P>
<P>
   You read more about this all-American company. You read about
two cousins named Ed who started making chairs shortly before the
crash of '29, how they accepted payments of livestock, how people _
even in the height of the Depression, or perhaps more then than at
any other time _ needed the life the La-Z-Boy offered. How that
same company posted $1 billion in sales last year.
</P>
<P>
   And then you drifted off, the La-Z-Boy way, folded into a dream
of bold, radiused, padded and skirted front posts, dreaming of a
place where everything was as good and pure as the La-Z-Boy, where
all you had to do was run the remote control and all it took to get
a refreshment was barking, ``Marge! Beer me!'' The La-Z-Boy
recliner: better than life itself.
</P>

 &HT;    Dell to market its own credit card
 &HT;    By Jerry Mahoney
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROUND ROCK, Texas _ In a new bid to increase sales to consumers
during the holiday season, Dell Computer Corp. is offering gift
certificates, a Visa credit card and easier terms in its leasing
program.
</P>
<P>
   Dell said Tuesday that the Platinum Visa cards will be issued in
association with First USA, a national credit card company that has
a call center in Northwest Austin.
</P>
<P>
   The card offers a 120-day grace period with no payments and no
interest on the initial purchase from Dell's Home Systems group.
After that, the card has a fixed annual percentage rate of 9.99
percent for purchases and 19.99 percent for cash advances.
</P>
<P>
   Customers can apply through Dell, which offers Dell Dollars
toward future Dell purchases each time the card is used. In that
regard, the card is similar to cards with which consumers gain
frequent flyer miles or points toward purchases each time they use
them.
</P>
<P>
   The gift certificates, which come in $100 increments, can be
purchased online.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rather than being strapped for money this holiday season,
these new payment options give customers flexibility when buying
technology products,'' Dave Hood, vice president and general
manager of Dell Home Systems, said in a release.
</P>
<P>
   Dell Financial Services, the company's leasing arm, is cutting
rates by up to 10 percent for leases in December.
</P>
<P>
   Dell, which recently has been announcing contracts with some of
its big customers, also said Tuesday that Mobil Corp. agreed to a
three-year, $75 million contract to buy Dell desktop computers,
notebooks and servers.
</P>
<P>
   Dell, in the third quarter, had a 29.8 percent market share in
sales to companies with at least 500 employees, according to a
recent study by ZD Market Intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq Computer Corp. has dominated that market for at least two
years. Its share declined from about 27 percent in the second
quarter to 23.6 percent, ZD Market Intelligence said.

 &HT;    Family lore connects holidays past
 &HT;    (For release Sunday, Nov. 29.)
 &HT;    By Martha Ezzard
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TIGER, Ga. _ ``Ma'' Clyde remembers holidays in Tiger when the
wind was so fierce that the rug on the living room floor rippled
along the cracks in the wood. My husband's 90-year-old aunt is my
favorite source of Rabun County farm lore. Clyde Arrendale
Pleasants, now Clyde English, knows what has changed and what
hasn't.
</P>
<P>
   I took her some cranberry relish a few days ago and lingered, as
always. Her white frame farmhouse, built in 1828, is just down the
road from our new home at the foot of Tiger Mountain. It has rifle
slots in the side of the staircase, for aiming guns at Indians. (If
I had to choose, I'd aim at developers clear-cutting mountainsides
before I'd be rid of the Cherokee. At least they were good stewards
of the land.)
</P>
<P>
   Old timers take back the moutains in late November when the last
reds and yellows fade from the sourwood, maple, hickory and wild
dogwood trees. When the seasonal lake-people leave, the natives get
out the water-ground meal for corn bread dressing and start the
home-made fruit cakes swimming in rum.
</P>
<P>
   Clyde says turkey wasn't always the main feature of mountain
Thanksgivings. Sometimes there was pork roast, dove or quail. Her
daughter recalls folks who considered fried squirrel a delicacy,
boiling it first over an open fire. We're lucky wild turkeys have
reappeared, Clyde says. In her day, hunting was unlimited and they
were scarce.
</P>
<P>
   As the firelight flickered over the hand-hewn beams, I wondered
if a city girl like me could ever qualify as a Rabun native. No
question about my husband, though. His ancestors on his mother's
side date to Thomas Arrendale, a hunter who got what became the
Arrendale farm in the 1820 land lottery. In estate recordings of
the time, it was valued at a dollar an acre _ a wonder to John and
me, having just bought acreage from his siblings in today's market.
</P>
<P>
   I love Clyde's memories of holidays past, but I didn't always
love the ``wimen folk'' roles of mountain culture. On visits to the
farm when I was younger, I detested a day of chopping and cooking
when a hike or a good book beckoned. Now, though, I relish holiday
times in the kitchen. I gloat over my first jars of grape jelly
tucked away from summer. The old Concord grape vineyard John's dad
planted three decades ago was bountiful and irresistible in August.
Now, with the leaves gone, its twisted locust posts are a stark
contrast to the new metal trellises supporting the wine grapes.
John and I love the symbolic vineyard link with the past. Our
decision a few years ago to leave Denver after 25 years and bring
our lives full circle to the South, where we both grew up, was
risky. Changing careers in our 50s was even riskier. Now we have no
regrets.
</P>
<P>
   Clyde looks out her bedroom window toward our house and talks
about changes the land's been through. First it was apple orchards,
wiped out in successive spring freezes. Then her father, John V.
Arrendale, tried celery and cauliflower, a sweet potato kiln,
making hickory ax handles and wood products. John V., as John's
granddad was known, was the county surveyor, too. Rabun County
history books credit him with starting Black Rock State Park and
with bringing blueberry farming to the county _ a tradition carried
on by John's dad, Col. W.T. Ezzard. The colonel had a successful
dairy business until he got called back into the army for the
Korean War.
</P>
<P>
   As John lays out rows of posts for another new vineyard, the red
clay of a Rabun farmer is surely in his veins. I hope our children
won't some day say to their children, ``Remember when Dad planted
those silly European wine grapes?'' I hope they talk instead about
the joy of growing something on the Ezzard farm.

MONEYBOX: WHAT'S IN NETSCAPE FOR AOL 
</HEADLINE>
  By JAMES SUROWIECKI 
 (www.slate.com) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   News that AOL is in the market to acquire Netscape for $4
billion had investors bidding up the stocks of both companies
Monday and reporters singing the praises of what they termed a
substantial challenge to Microsoft. But although the Internet
economy often appears to operate by its own strange set of rules,
in the case of mergers and acquisitions the offline and online rule
is exactly the same: In general, acquisitions are bad news for
everyone except the acquired company's shareholders. And while AOL
has done a great job of turning unpredictable moves into unexpected
successes, the economics of this deal seem questionable.
</P>
<P>
   The question to ask about this deal is the same question you
have to ask about any merger: ``What does buying a company let AOL
do that it couldn't do otherwise?'' And the answer to that question
remains somewhat unclear.
</P>
<P>
   Even if AOL were to replace Microsoft's Internet Explorer as its
default browser with Netscape's Navigator (something it says it
won't do), it doesn't have to acquire Netscape to do so. Netscape's
Web site, Netcenter, is supposedly on its way to becoming a portal,
and generates a lot of business traffic. But if AOL wants to build
its brand name on the Web, it could invest heavily in www.aol.com,
which is already one of the most heavily trafficked sites.
</P>
<P>
   Netcenter does have the great advantage of being the site to
which Navigator automatically directs users. But that hardly seems
like a long-term competitive advantage, especially since Microsoft
is bundling (or whatever you call it) Explorer with every copy of
Windows.
</P>
<P>
   More to the point, AOL is itself a portal to the Internet, and
spending $4 billion to establish itself on the Web seems somewhat
at odds with its basic business strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Consolidation in the portal industry is probably in the cards.
But the portal strategy, built as it is on advertising, is hardly a
surefire success, and the minuscule profits being earned by even
the most popular sites are a healthy reminder of how up-in-the-air
all this remains.
</P>
<P>
   AOL is the best Internet company in existence because it has a
steady stream of revenues from its users and because it's figured
out a way to leverage those users into income from advertisers,
content providers and retailers. But both sides of that equation
are essential to its success. With Netcenter, the first part of the
equation--the subscription fees--will disappear. Will what's left
be enough to justify the price tag?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe. Things are fluid enough on the Net to make every judgment
provisional. But we know that companies tend to overpay for
acquisitions, that they underestimate the difficulty of fitting
companies together, and that they overestimate the synergistic
benefits. AOL President Bob Pittman has done a brilliant job
turning AOL into a dominant business. But is this really the best
way AOL has of spending $4 billion?

DISPATCH, NOV. 23: THE MICROSOFT TRIAL 
</HEADLINE>
  By DAVID PLOTZ 
 (www.slate.com) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Although I may be the only Microsoft employee who
also worked for the Department of Justice, I have so far refrained
from commenting on the Microsoft antitrust trial. I knew that my
broad (dare I say vast?) expertise--nine whole months as a
paralegal in the DOJ's Environmental Defense Section, two full
years covering noncomputer issues for Slate--could intimidate my
fellow reporters and might even sway the judge.
</P>
<P>
   To preserve the integrity of the justice system, I have stayed
silent. Today, the silence ends.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, it just seems like an excellent day for a courtroom
visit. The morning papers announce that America Online is close to
striking a deal to purchase Netscape for $4 billion and to form an
alliance with Sun Microsystems.
</P>
<P>
   This merger is bad for Microsoft as a business, but since
anything that's bad for Microsoft as a business should be good for
Microsoft as an antitrust defendant, the news seems to have put a
spring in the step of the Microsofties at the courthouse.
</P>
<P>
   The news of the merger intrudes on the courtroom, though not
till late in the morning. The day's business is the
cross-examination of government witness Frederick Warren-Boulton,
an economist testifying to Microsoft's monopoly status. The
interaction between Warren-Boulton and Microsoft lawyer Michael
Lacovara is painful. Warren-Boulton is petulant and
passive-aggressive: Every word must be dragged out of him. ``Yes''
has three syllables. Lacovara, young and hair-gelled, counters with
as much condescension as seems humanly possible (though my seatmate
assures me that Lacovara is by far the politest of the Microsoft
lawyers).

   Warren-Boulton is defending a chart that shows Microsoft's share
of the browser market rising to 70 percent of homes and 60 percent
of businesses by 2001. Lacovara asks him if he read the newspaper
this morning. Warren-Boulton replies that he did. AOL currently
uses Microsoft's Internet Explorer as its default browser.
</P>
<P>
   Lacovara pushes the witness to concede that 1) the merger makes
it likely that AOL will drop Internet Explorer and adopt Netscape
Navigator and 2) that switch will cut Microsoft's browser share.
The intention of the questioning seems to be to show that AOL holds
the power and Microsoft is the supplicant.
</P>
<P>
   But it is during these questions that it becomes clear that
Microsoft is not going to win this spin battle after all.
Warren-Boulton rejects the notion that AOL will drop Internet
Explorer for Netscape's browser. And when Lacovara tries to get him
to admit that the AOL-Netscape merger proves that the software
industry is competitive, Warren-Boulton responds, ``It is
unfortunate to see the disappearance of Netscape, one of the
brightest stars (in the industry). I regret that this has come to
pass, that Netscape has been forced to the wall.''
</P>
<P>
   He didn't say two words at the end of that answer, and he didn't
need to. Everyone knew they were there: ``by Microsoft''--''forced
to the wall by Microsoft.''
</P>
<P>
   At the lunch break, which should be known as the midday spin,
lead DOJ lawyer David Boies tells reporters that according to
today's Washington Post, AOL will probably keep Internet Explorer
as its default browser. ``If AOL feels compelled to use Internet
Explorer, even after it owns Netscape Navigator, that is an
indication of Microsoft's power.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft wanted the day's message to be: Microsoft is
weak--look at the mighty AOL-Netscape-Sun triumvirate. Instead,
Warren-Boulton and Boies have made Microsoft look powerful: the
bully who keeps control of AOL's browser.
</P>
<P>
   The afternoon session, after all this spinning, is a comedown.
Lacovara spends most of it trying to show that Warren-Boulton is 1)
a technical ignoramus and 2) hence unqualified to make intelligent
judgments about the economics of the software industry.
</P>
<P>
   By the time I split at 4 p.m., Lacovara has--in three-plus days
of examination--covered only 11 pages of Warren-Boulton's 89 pages
of written testimony. Microsoft's lawyers, who want to make sure
the record is as thorough as possible for an appeal, are
cross-examining their witnesses line by excruciating line. Judge
Thomas Penfield Jackson, though he looks like he'd rather be
anywhere else, must sit there and (pretend to?) listen to this. No
one else has to, not even most of the reporters. By midafternoon,
the courtroom press section is emptying out. My colleagues, I
surmise, are ducking out to report the AOL story.

THE SEMI-CONDUCTOR 
</HEADLINE>
  By JACOB WEISBERG 
 (www.slate.com) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In many fields, growing old means cutting back on your
professional responsibilities. But for orchestra conductors,
figures of mythic virility and longevity, advancing age seems only
to entail taking on more obligations.
</P>
<P>
   Consider Kurt Masur, the 71-year-old music director of the New
York Philharmonic. Last week, it was announced that, beginning in
2000, Masur would become the principal conductor of the London
Philharmonic. In London, The Guardian reported that the German
maestro would, naturally, be resigning his New York position, which
pays him $1.3 million a year. But the paper was forced to print a
correction: Masur is not leaving New York. He will be conducting in
both cities until at least 2002, when his New York contract
expires.
</P>
<P>
   With just two big jobs, Masur is far from the busiest of the big
guns. The title probably belongs to Placido Domingo, the
globetrotting tenor. In 1996, he was appointed artistic director of
the Washington Opera. Nov. 1 it was announced that he would also be
replacing the retiring director of the Los Angeles Opera. Domingo
intends to run both institutions without cutting back on his
performance schedule at the Metropolitan Opera and elsewhere, his
``Three Tenors'' concerts with Luciano Pavarotti and Jos Carreras,
his recording calendar, or his bookings as a guest symphony
conductor.
</P>
<P>
   Domingo's helicopter-to-rehearsal lifestyle is now the model for
conductors whose salaries often match those of star athletes and
CEOs. Norman Lebrecht of the London Daily Telegraph, perhaps the
only music critic with much of an instinct for sleuthing, has
unearthed some of the closely guarded salaries. In 1996, the
conductor Lorin Maazel earned $4.5 million, including $1 million as
the chief conductor of the Pittsburgh Symphony and an additional
$2.7 million from the Bavarian State Radio Orchestra. The
pianist-conductor Daniel Barenboim earns $3 million or more as
music director in Chicago, artistic director and general music
director of the Deutsche Staatsoper Berlin, and as a touring
conductor with both the Berlin and the Vienna philharmonics.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most amazing is Charles Dutoit, who serves as artistic
director of the Montreal Symphony Orchestra, musical director of
the Orchestra National de France, and the artistic director and
principal conductor of the Philadelphia Orchestra's summer season
in Saratoga. In his spare time, Dutoit likes to ... guest conduct.
</P>
<P>
   The great American orchestras were built by conductors who by
today's standards would be hopeless homebodies.
</P>
<P>
   The Boston Symphony was honed and polished by the Russian exile
Serge Koussevitsky, who conducted 100 concerts a year for 25 years
until 1949 and was midwife to the creation of great works by
Stravinsky, Schoenberg and Copland.
</P>
<P>
   The Philadelphia Orchestra was led by Leopold Stokowski, who
reigned supreme for 26 years until 1938, when Eugene Ormandy
succeeded him--and stayed for 42. George Szell had a similar role
in shaping Cleveland into a great musical city, as did Fritz Reiner
in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   These men might travel to Europe for the summer festival season,
but they lived in the cities in which they played. They auditioned
musicians personally and knew them well. If a guest conductor
visited Philadelphia, you would probably find Ormandy backstage or
in the audience.
</P>
<P>
   Today, by contrast, conductors tend to have a much more tenuous
relationship with their home cities. Rather than live in some
backwater, they jet in and out for rehearsals and conduct 30
performances a year there instead of 100. For nine months at a
stretch, they are somewhere else.
</P>
<P>
   There are a few honorable exceptions to the orchestra-collecting
trend. Perhaps the most admirable is Simon Rattle, who took the
insignificant Birmingham Symphony Orchestra and, over a period of
16 years, developed it into a distinguished ensemble. Despite many
lucrative offers, Rattle has been loath to even spend much time
visiting elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Rattle has now stepped down from the podium at Birmingham and is
weighing offers. It is expected that he will again choose to work
with one orchestra rather than several.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Tilson Thomas, who in 1995 became the music director of
the San Francisco Symphony Orchestra, draws praise for doing more
than hanging his hat there. Finland-born Esa-Pekka Salonen gets
high marks for his commitment to the Los Angeles Philharmonic, as
does Leonard Slatkin at Washington's National Symphony.
</P>
<P>
   Why would an orchestra prefer an overpaid, absentee landlord
like Muti or Abbado to a dedicated resident, especially given that
the latter is likely to come much cheaper? Partly, it's the battle
for prestige. A provincial orchestra with an off-brand conductor
seems doubly provincial.
</P>
<P>
   But the bigger issue is finance. Orchestra boards believe that a
star like Muti sells tickets, even to the majority of concerts he
doesn't conduct. And even the occasional presence of a musical
superstar makes it much easier to raise money. At a recent
fund-raiser, the Washington Opera took in an extraordinary $2.6
million, thanks to the charming presence of Domingo.
</P>
<P>
   There are many more orchestras than there used to be and
arguably fewer great conductors. The result has been a bidding war
for top talent and an opportunity to make money that few can
resist. The recent transformation of the conductor's career
parallels what has happened elsewhere in the economy. As the income
of top performers of all kinds has risen exponentially, the old
patterns of indenture have fallen away. The ability of a Zubin
Mehta ($6 million plus per year) or a Charles Barkley ($4.6
million) to make really big money has led to a system of free
agency.
</P>
<P>
   In basketball, where teams are constituted by the season, each
player looking out for his own career doesn't appear to harm the
overall quality of the game. But in symphonic music, where great
achievement comes from teamwork over a much longer time frame, the
moonlighting maestro is playing too fast.

 MAURICE, OR THE FISHER'S COT
<TEXT>
<P>
   By Mary Shelley.
</P>

 &UR; HAPPILY EVER AFTER? &QL; 
 &UR; By MARINA WARNER &QL; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   After Rousseau decreed in ``Emile'' that fantasy and fairy tales
were dangerous, pedagogic reformers and children's publishers tried
to provide, instead of ``bloods'' and ``romances,'' rational
instruction in history, nature and geography. Mary Shelley's
father, William Godwin, pioneered this gentling of traditional
material with his Juvenile Library, and her 1820 story, ``Maurice,
or The Fisher's Cot,'' resembles his progressive nursery fare: it's
a classic fairy tale about a foundling restored to family and high
social status. But in Godwinian mode, Shelley updates it to
contemporary England, adding reformist social color and improving
touches.
</P>
<P>
   Maurice hasn't been stolen from his cradle by fairies but has
been snatched from his nanny by a desperate woman whose husband
beat her for her childlessness. When Maurice, a beautiful, delicate
child in the image of the young Percy Bysshe Shelley, grows up
sickly and frail, he too falls victim to his usurping stepfather's
violence. No maltreatment damages his radiant nature, however. He
leaves home and is taken in by an upstanding, poverty-stricken
fisherman and his wife. The couple embody rustic virtue; she
teaches children to read from the Bible and refuses payment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maurice'' was written for Laurette, a girl of 10, and the
story's way of telling reveals that Mary Shelley was aware that her
reader was an English child who had never been ``home'' and whose
natal tongue was Italian: it's plainly written, and contains scenes
of the southern English coast and customs and the kinds of lichen,
moss and damp-loving plants that grow there. But the success story
lacks energy, its impact dulled by the melancholy that, as Claire
Tomalin observes in her introduction, undoes its Panglossian
optimism. It opens with the fisherman's funeral and ``finishes with
the crumbling away'' of his seaside cottage (the ``cot''). In a
Wordsworthian mood, Shelley seems to be lamenting that this kind of
probity will not be seen in modern times again.
</P>
<P>
   Though ``Maurice'' echoes Godwin's own genial pedantry, he
turned it down, writing that it was too short. This was probably
diplomatic on his part. Although interest in Mary Shelley warrants
publication, it's clear that when news came of a lost manuscript,
stored in the Tuscan house of direct descendants of a family with
close links to the Shelleys, something rather more was hoped for.
``Maurice'' is a slight piece; it contains little of the seething
originality, moral complexity or sinister Gothic speculativeness of
``Frankenstein,'' written only four years before, and Tomalin, as
if in tacit acknowledgment of the story's shortcomings, digs deep
into the social background, where many fascinating specters gather.
</P>
<P>
   Laurette was the illegitimate daughter of Margaret, Countess
Mountcashell, and an Anglo-Irish gentleman-adventurer, George
Tighe. This household of adulterous expatriates presented in many
ways a mirror image of the Shelleys: after the poet's first wife,
Harriet, killed herself, he was denied access to their two
children; Lady Mountcashell had also been parted from her eight
previous, legitimate offspring. Meanwhile, three of Mary's infants
had died. Against this terrible background of severance and loss,
Mary Shelley's optimistic story becomes much more than a family
romance; when she imagines a boy who resists illness, cruelty and
poverty so well that he actually succeeds in growing up, she may be
uttering a wistful charm against the fate that dogged her.
</P>
<P>
   Claire Tomalin, whose main interest here lies in the biographies
of the tangled background cast, has unearthed much new material
about Laurette, her sister, Nerina, and their mother, whose lives
offer a rich and unfamiliar tapestry of women's troubles and
achievements in the turbulence of 19th-century Italy. But she can't
quite conceal her disappointment that Laurette, later a
professional, much-published author, never wrote anything worth
reading.
</P>
<P>
   When she was 10, Mary Shelley had adapted a jaunty vaudeville
song into a children's rhyme, ``Mounseer Nongtongpaw,'' which makes
spirited fun of English bigotry and greed. Godwin published it, the
first work of his prodigious child. The patient, gloomy ``Maurice''
confirms that the visionary writer of ``Frankenstein,'' the
brilliant daughter and wife of notorious firebrands, dreamed of a
quiet and simple existence. Maurice's mysterious benefactor, who
turns out to be his long-lost father, holds out ``the pleasure of
living in the country, of seeing the pretty flowers grow in the
hedges . . . and in the evening to read entertaining books.'' Like
the monster who looks in the window of the blind man's cottage at
the ideal scene round a peaceful hearth, Mary Shelley in
``Maurice'' communicates how much she hankered after an ordinary
life in England, how her elopement sentenced her to a perpetual
homesickness.

 &UR; TANKS AND PLANES. CHEAP. BARELY USED. &QL; 
 &UR; By JAMES B. STEWART &QL; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   This book doesn't read like a polemic, but the sheer weight of
its facts makes it one: we are spending $250 billion a year on
defense, we don't know why and it's not enough. It is the kind of
book that leaves a reader agitated and indignant, and should by all
rights ignite an urgent national debate. Why, to cite one recent
example, did Congress have a knockdown battle over $1 billion in
Federal funding for more teachers, yet add more than $9 billion in
``emergency'' defense spending with hardly a peep of public
discussion?
</P>
<P>
   William Greider, best known as the journalist to whom David A.
Stockman, the first Reagan Administration's budget director, bared
his soul, and the author of books on the Federal Reserve and global
capitalism, begins ``Fortress America'' by wondering what happened
to the ``peace dividend'' -- capital freed from military spending
by the collapse of the Soviet threat. After touring our military
establishment, he concludes not only that there hasn't been one,
but that our ``vast arsenal will become increasingly incoherent and
hollow -- mismatched against the new global realities.''
</P>
<P>
   That seems, if anything, an understatement. Take the B-1 bomber,
designed for intercontinental nuclear strikes deep inside the
Soviet Union; the United States spent hundreds of billions to build
100 of them. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, the bombers
were outfitted for conventional weapons, at unspecified additional
cost. Yet none were deployed in the Persian Gulf war. They are so
expensive to maintain and operate that 27 of them have been
mothballed, and the others perform what the Air Force describes as
``global power missions,'' apparently a public relations function.
Has this sorry experience killed off the new B-2 bomber, another
financial black hole? Even when the B-2's will make the B-1 fleet
redundant? When they cost $2 billion each? And when five studies
concluded that the Air Force doesn't need them? No.
</P>
<P>
   Greider describes the headlong development of sophisticated new
weaponry designed for a nonexistent enemy as a form of cannibalism:
new weapons not only cost a fortune to develop, build and,
especially, maintain; they render existing, generally
state-of-the-art weaponry obsolete. We sell the old weapons for
pennies on the dollar, if that, to ``friendly'' countries that we
hope won't let them fall into the hands of guerrillas based in
places like Afghanistan, where we may have to send in our newer
high-tech weapons and destroy them. Or, in the case of hundreds of
old tanks, we sink them in the ocean to create reefs that, we hope,
will attract tropical fish.
</P>
<P>
   And what vital interest is all of this supposed to protect? It's
all too clear that it was and still is meant to contain the old
Soviet Union. Sounding almost nostalgic, Col. Bill Rake of the Air
Force tells Greider: ``We knew it was the bear, and we had a
purpose. We did the training for the bear. Now the bear might not
be there. But somebody might just jump up from behind the door.
Iran, Iraq? We don't know.'' This seems insane, yet is weirdly
logical in a military establishment where no one, including the
President and Commander in Chief, articulates a comprehensive
strategy. ``The juggernaut,'' Greider concludes, ``lumbers on,
doing what it knows how to do best. It is unwilling to rethink its
future, unable to let go of the past. Like the shark, it must keep
feeding, only now it is feeding on itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Why this would be so leads Greider to the old
military-industrial complex, which he prefers to call the ``iron
triangle,'' of the defense industry, the military and Congress.
What's new here is the swift consolidation of the defense industry
since the end of the cold war into what amounts to three large
behemoths. What's not new is the complex's interest in promoting
jobs and revenues in the home districts of powerful legislators.
But in the wake of the industry mergers, defense jobs in the
private sector have dropped from 3.6 million to about 2 million,
and in a trade-off of jobs for profit, the companies are operating
at higher efficiencies and with lower costs. Greider argues that
the ``Clinton Administration did indeed bless the process and
encourage it'' even though the Government hasn't realized much in
savings.
</P>
<P>
   Greider seems to concede that the problem lies not so much with
private industry, which is simply and predictably exploiting a
policy vacuum to maximize profits for shareholders. The problem is
a failure to confront the implications of the end of the cold war.
It is accepted doctrine, for example, that we should be prepared to
fight two simultaneous full-scale wars. But why? Why two and not
three or one? No one seems to know. What about those pesky
peacekeeping missions -- Somalia, Bosnia? How many of those should
we be prepared for, and under what circumstances should we
intervene?
</P>
<P>
   That the United States, as the only superpower, needs to provide
global military leadership seems irrefutable, yet we have failed to
articulate any principled basis for doing so. The result is what
appears to others as ad hoc exercises of our power that, Greider
argues, will inevitably lead to perceptions of American empire
building, resentment and, as with the British in the 19th century,
hubris and erosion of our strength.
</P>
<P>
   While Greider's case seems persuasive, his prescriptions seem
fuzzy; he readily acknowledges that he lacks (as do I) ``the
expertise to be able to describe the correct size and design of the
force structure.'' He argues that the ``armed forces ought to be
realigned in purpose and greatly reduced in size,'' but this kind
of vagueness led us into the morass he describes. He finds the
armaments industry even more irrational then the military itself,
but proposes no alternatives. And he will lose conservatives -- who
probably most need to digest the implications of this book -- with
his hand wringing over alleged American imperialism, his
digressions into environmentalism and his selective use of polling
data to proclaim what the American people want.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it's clear that what Greider wants is to prompt a
vigorous debate. Surely someone in the next Presidential campaign
will return national defense and military spending to center stage,
and if this book helps him (or her) do it, Greider will have
rendered an immense public service.

   A Biography of Oona O'Neill Chaplin.

   By Jane Scovell.

 &UR; THE LADY AND THE TRAMP &QL; 
 &UR; By JAMES SPADA &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Nearly a century after Lytton Strachey's ``Eminent Victorians''
redefined the art of telling lives, the biographer's lot is not a
happy one. Since the 1970s there has been such a tidal wave of
biographies and memoirs that there is nary a celebrated life left
unrecorded. Worried authors have begun to seek out less well-known
but interesting subjects whose lives, once brought to print, might
capture the public's imagination.
</P>
<P>
   Jane Scovell has chosen Oona O'Neill Chaplin, and indeed, the
daughter of Eugene O'Neill and child bride of Charlie Chaplin would
seem to be the ideal biographical second-stringer. Born in Bermuda
in 1925, she was a beautiful, vivacious, intelligent girl who
palled around New York with Gloria Vanderbilt, dated J. D. Salinger
and Orson Welles, and was named debutante of the year. She was
given a Hollywood screen test but gave up the promise of movie
stardom at the age of 18 to become the fourth wife of Chaplin, who
was 36 years her senior. She bore him eight children and remained
married to him until his death 34 years later.
</P>
<P>
   Her story, one will have surmised by now, is memorable mainly
because of its two male leads. Her father deserted her mother, the
writer Agnes Boulton, when Oona was 2. She rarely saw O'Neill after
that; six years once elapsed between strained, awkward visits. The
little girl kept a scrapbook of pictures of him clipped from
newspapers so she would know what he looked like.
</P>
<P>
   By the age of 17, Oona was a Manhattan prep school student and a
young lady about town, making the social columns on the arms of
older squires, who escorted her to sophisticated watering holes
like the Stork Club. She told The Daily News that ``a girl ought to
earn her own living,'' and so she planned to forgo a Vassar
education to become an actress. Aghast, her father promptly
disinherited her, put the word out to his theater associates that
she was not to be given work and called his daughter, whom he
scarcely knew, ``a spoiled, lazy, vain little brat.''
</P>
<P>
   Is it any wonder that she fell into the fatherly arms of
Chaplin, a man who hadn't always waited for his earlier paramours
to turn 18 before he married them? Observers questioned her motives
as much as his, and most gave the marriage six months at best.
Salinger, a spurned beau, was so upset with Oona, Scovell tells us,
that he wrote her ``a scathing, scatological letter describing in
disgusting detail his version of the Chaplins' wedding night.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the psychological forces that drove them, and despite
the astronomical odds against the success of their marriage, Oona
and Charlie Chaplin found lasting happiness. He made her feel
worthwhile, and she provided him with the unwavering attention and
adoration his overweening ego demanded. The actress Joan Collins
observed that Oona ``catered to him with an almost geishalike
deference,'' but it is also clear that Chaplin greatly valued her
opinion. On the sets of his later, largely unsuccessful films, he
would look to Oona, sitting off to the side, for a nod of approval
after every take.
</P>
<P>
   They spent the bulk of their marriage living in a manor in
Vevey, Switzerland, where they moved after Chaplin's leftist
leanings made him a target of the House Un-American Activities
Committee. Oona cared for him like a duty nurse until his death, at
88, on Christmas morning, 1977.
</P>
<P>
   The widowed Lady Chaplin was only 52, a wealthy and famous
woman. She might have been expected to blossom, to write the book
several publishers had sought from her or at least to found a
philanthropic organization and give a star-studded fund-raising
event every year.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, she grieved ceaselessly for Chaplin, and -- like her
parents, brother and uncle before her -- declined into alcoholism.
When she failed to appear at a party she gave in her Manhattan
penthouse years after her husband's death, a friend went into her
bedroom, found her lying in total darkness and asked what was
wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is how it must be where Charlie is,'' she replied. She
died from pancreatic cancer in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Scovell tells this story gracefully and with intelligence, but
her subject ultimately defeats her. No members of the O'Neill or
Chaplin families agreed to interviews, and again and again we read
of Eugene and Charlie and Oona destroying personal papers in order
to thwart an effort like this one. Based almost entirely on
secondary sources, ``Oona'' reads like a college thesis on Eugene
O'Neill and Charlie Chaplin. The reader longs for more details
about Oona's activities, Oona's thoughts, Oona's reactions.
</P>
<P>
   To make compelling a subject whose life was ``lived in the
shadows'' of two geniuses, an author must draw the reader so deeply
into her mind and the details of her life that she becomes as vivid
as a fictional heroine and thus takes on -- at least within the
pages of the book -- a stature equal to those casting the shadows.
Scovell was not able to do this with Oona O'Neill Chaplin, mainly
because the woman herself preferred to remain a mystery. Her
success at doing so despite Scovell's admirable effort is our loss,
because a biography that does not reveal its subject, like a
mystery that does not reveal its solution, makes for a frustrating
and unsatisfying book.

 WHERE THE VOICE CAME FROM 
 By JAMES OLNEY 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``It was the strangest experience,'' Eudora Welty told Anne
Tyler after reading back over her short stories in preparation for
their collected publication in 1980. ``It was like watching a
negative develop, slowly coming clear before your eyes. It was like
recovering a memory.
</P>
<P>
   With the appearance of the two Welty volumes in the Library of
America series -- comprising not only the short fiction but also a
handful of acute essays, the superb ``One Writer's Beginnings'' and
five books designated ``novels'' (``The Robber Bridegroom,''
``Delta Wedding,'' ``The Ponder Heart,'' ``Losing Battles'' and
``The Optimist's Daughter'') -- Welty's admirers have the
opportunity to watch with her as the body of her work gradually
emerges, indeed like a developing photographic image, a richly
varied yet single living entity, something always there, always
coming into being but wholly perceptible only now, when it can be
viewed through the lens of memory. I specify admirers (and who is
not one? her popularity no doubt accounts in part for Welty being
the first living author included in the Library of America) for, as
she describes the process, it requires a previous knowledge of the
work and a double doubling back. Memory is a first-stage recovery
of the past; recovering a memory is akin to remembering
remembering. Welty has always been prodigious in her remarks on
memory: ``Of course the greatest confluence of all is that which
makes up the individual human memory,'' she says in ``One Writer's
Beginnings.'' ``My own is the treasure most dearly regarded by me,
in my life and in my work as a writer. Here time, also, is subject
to confluence. The memory is a living thing -- it too is in
transit. But during its moment, all that is remembered joins, and
lives -- the old and the young, the past and the present, the
living and the dead.'' Joined and living, too, one might add, in
our reading are Welty's past achievement and our present
recollection, savoring, reconstruction and re-creation of it.
</P>
<P>
   What is at issue both for Welty and for the reader of ``Eudora
Welty: Complete Novels'' and ``Eudora Welty: Stories, Essays, &AMP;
Memoir,'' edited and annotated unobtrusively but meticulously by
Richard Ford and Michael Kreyling, is a memory of things written,
of things made, which locates the life of greatest interest firmly
and first and last in the writing. Focusing there, one shares
Welty's sense of wonder yet of inevitability at how it's all come
about: no one could have predicted it would be so, but in
retrospect it could not have been otherwise. Asked in 1989 how she
would describe the vision that has sustained and impelled her
throughout a career of more than 50 years, Welty responded that
such a vision ``lies only in the work. . . . It's what the work
shows, comprises altogether.'' What she desires, she continued, is
for ``the work to exist as the thing that answers every question
about its doing.''
</P>
<P>
   If the body of her work, in its parts and its entirety, contains
the story of its writing, then this renders a biography of the
``writer's life'' (in the phrase that supplies the subtitle to Ann
Waldron's biography, ``Eudora'') not only nugatory but an
impertinence. The word impertinence is intended in the double sense
of irrelevance and of rudeness (which one can find most tellingly
in Waldron's aggrieved tone at not being allowed every confidence
of Welty's private life and in her frantic search for explanations
of the fiction in what Waldron takes to be Welty's sexual
frustration and her despair at having had no dates -- no dates at
all! -- in high school).
</P>
<P>
   To ``explain'' the fiction, as Waldron does, as compensation or
sublimation, with unfounded speculation and reckless surmise as her
principal tools -- Welty seems to have been depressed at this time,
which was likely caused by (what else?) an unhappy love attachment,
and the depression (which Waldron takes for an established fact) is
the cause of such and such a scene in ``The Robber Bridegroom'' or
a character in ``June Recital'' -- consigns Welty's work to a
presumed starting point in the ``foul rag-and-bone shop of the
heart.'' It shackles her imagination to the detritus of a life when
the desire of that life has been to create a new world not on the
basis of day-to-day grievances but in the likeness of the visible
and audible phantasmagoria surrounding her and her readers.
Everything one needs to know biographically about Welty can be
gleaned from the Library of America chronology. Her autobiography
-- the story of a writer -- is written across the whole body of her
work.
</P>
<P>
   That story, as against the one retailed in Waldron's book, is of
a pervasive and inexplicable mystery at the heart of human
existence and relationships. It is also an account, by way of the
writing, of techniques for rendering that mystery a living presence
in fiction. The tale begins with the imaginative explosion of ``A
Curtain of Green,'' a collection of 17 stories that seem
individually like so many experiments in voice, perspective,
texture.
</P>
<P>
   The volume's tonal variety is astonishing: from the somber
``Death of a Traveling Salesman'' to the hallucinatory ``Flowers
for Marjorie,'' from the wonderment at the variety of human faces
of ``Clytie'' to the foreboding near-violence of the title piece,
from the jazzy ``Powerhouse'' to the satiric ``Petrified Man,''
from the wildly comic ``Why I Live at the P.O.'' to the dignified
``A Worn Path'' (the ``grave, persistent, meditative'' sound of old
Phoenix Jackson's cane tapping the frozen earth establishes the
tone at the outset).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-NYTBOOK-WELTY-2NDTAKE-NYTSF &QL; 
 &UR; UNDATED: the outset).) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In ``A Curtain of Green,'' with marvelous success, Welty tests
voice after voice, as if the lesson learned in one story were to be
put aside, perhaps for future use, while another lesson is worked
through. ``The source of the short story is usually lyrical,'' she
says in ``Writing and Analyzing a Story.'' But she immediately goes
on to assert that, however much the lyrical impetus, and therefore
the tone and mood, may change from story to story, each story
carries the author's ``signature because of the one impulse
characteristic of his own gift -- to praise, to love, to call up
into view.'' Welty seems to offer these impulses as separate, but I
should say that to call up into view, to praise, to love -- taken
in whatever order -- are ultimately a single desire driving her
work from the first published story (``Death of a Traveling
Salesman'') right through ``One Writer's Beginnings.''
</P>
<P>
   The short story is the medium in which Welty has always shown to
greatest advantage, and this is true both of the relatively brief
pieces of ``A Curtain of Green'' (1941) and of the more expansive,
slower-paced stories of ``The Wide Net and Other Stories'' (1943),
``The Golden Apples'' (1949) and ``The Bride of Innisfallen and
Other Stories'' (1955). When she moved on to the novel, as she was
urged -- against her instincts -- to do by publishers, Welty
recognized that she was taking on a form markedly different in its
demands and capabilities. Few enough writers have been brilliantly
successful at both modes, and though Welty's novels have much to
recommend them, the truth is that she never quite divested herself
of the ways of seeing and saying most appropriate to the writing of
short fiction. The novel can be and has been many things, but one
doubts it has ever been quite what we get in ``The Robber
Bridegroom'' (1942): a gallimaufry thrown together out of frontier
brags, Yeatsian folk fantasy and shape-changers, fairy-tale love
and adventure, the mock heroic and heroic mockery and high spirits,
blended with comic undercutting at every turn. There are a thousand
events in the book, but of plot hardly a hint. Much the same could
be said of plot in ``Delta Wedding'' (1946) and ``Losing Battles''
(1970) -- that there is not much more of it in those novels than in
``A Visit of Charity'' or ``Keela, the Outcast Indian Maiden'' or
``The Wide Net,'' wonderful stories all.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Optimist's Daughter'' (1972) shows a fairly conventional
plot, but this is unique in Welty and achieved at the cost of being
drawn in large measure from details of her biography. And then
there is ``The Ponder Heart'' (1954), really a short story spun out
to something between novella and novel length, a pure exercise in
voice, nothing more, but a virtuoso performance and great triumph
as such (and very funny). Welty opens ``One Writer's Beginnings''
with a chapter called ``Listening'' and concludes with ``Finding a
Voice''; ``The Ponder Heart'' could be a textbook illustration --
but full of life and humor -- of how to listen to Edna Earl's voice
and reproduce it on the page.
</P>
<P>
   Edna Earl's is but one of Welty's hundreds of voices, all
different but all issuing from the artistry of one listener. In
this regard they are like the faces Clytie studies in the story
that bears her name. There were not more than 150 people in Farr's
Ginn, but ``the number of faces seemed to Clytie almost infinite. .
. . When she began to look at people's actual countenances there
was no more familiarity in the world for her. The most profound,
the most moving sight in the whole world must be a face. Was it
possible to comprehend the eyes and the mouths of other people,
which concealed she knew not what, and secretly asked for still
another unknown thing?'' That Clytie's maker shares an abiding
fascination with the infinite variety of nature, human and other,
is clear on every page of her work.
</P>
<P>
   The need to capture the otherness and the sameness in a voice,
in a face, is what accounts for the proliferation of similes and
metaphors in Welty. Such figures of speech are a reaching out to
bring that which is not us, yet is also us, within the ambit of our
emotional capacities. They are a way of bringing home the world's
mysteries without depriving them of any jot of their strangeness.
The words mystery and mysterious echo like mantras in Welty's
fiction, essays and memoir, referring to the endless oddity of the
world and of relationship (``relationship is a pervading and
changing mystery''). When, in ``Place in Fiction,'' Welty declares:
``Life is strange. Stories hardly make it more so; with all they
are able to tell and surmise, they make it more believably, more
inevitably so,'' we are reminded that there is an archaic meaning
for mystery, which is craft or trade. There has been in our time no
more assiduous practitioner of fiction than Eudora Welty, and for
the mystery that pervades her work and is her artistry there can be
no explanation (a la Waldron), only gratitude.

   &UR; FREEDOM TO DIE
</P>
<P>
   People, Politics and
</P>
<P>
   the Right-to-Die Movement.
</P>
<P>
   By Derek Humphry and Mary Clement.
</P>
<P>
   St. Martin's, $24.95. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   A few months ago, my friend Lynne chose to die. She was losing
her battle with Lou Gehrig's disease and did not want to spend what
was left of her life hooked up to a respirator. She told her family
and her doctors: ``I would rather have a gentle, dignified death
than this unbearable, humiliating life. I want you to help me
die.'' According to Derek Humphry, co-author with Mary Clement of
``Freedom to Die,'' polls show that 63 percent to 78 percent of
Americans share Lynne's sentiments -- that people who are
terminally ill, and experiencing unbearable pain and suffering,
should be permitted to end their lives with the help of their
physicians. However, physician-assisted suicide and voluntary
euthanasia are issues that force uneasy confrontation with
religious beliefs, ethics, economic realities and medical
responsibility. ``Freedom to Die'' chronicles the right-to-die
movement from the first, unsuccessful euthanasia bill drafted in
Ohio in 1906 to the first two people who received their physicians'
help to die in 1998 as a result of the Oregon Death With Dignity
Act. To their credit, the authors -- Humphry is the founder of the
Hemlock Society; Clement is president of something called Gentle
Closure, ``an organization that assists people in addressing all
end-of-life concerns'' -- reach for balance. They demonstrate
effectively, albeit with frustrating repetition, what happens when
the sentiments of the public collide with religious, medical or
governmental institutions. They present trenchant arguments on both
sides of the debate and examine the influence of Dr. Jack
Kevorkian, the pivotal role of Karen Ann Quinlan, the impact of
high-tech miracles of science that keep people alive but
nonfunctional and the fear that family members will not give their
dying relatives a ``duty-to-die'' message. This book challenges our
thinking about a subject that is far more complex than simply
granting someone his ``ultimate civil liberty.'' _ GLORIA HOCHMAN

   &UR; THE AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR.
</P>
<P>
   Edited by Clayborne Carson.
</P>
<P>
   Warner, $25. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   One of the tragedies of Martin Luther King Jr.'s life is that he
did not live to write an autobiography. That sad truth diminishes
the value of ``The Autobiography of Martin Luther King, Jr.,''
Clayborne Carson's mistitled but otherwise worthy compilation of
King's autobiographical writings and statements. Carson has done a
good job of selecting letters, news interviews, an ``Autobiography
of Religious Development'' in manuscript and other documents
scattered in various archives and in the 14 volumes of the Martin
Luther King Jr. Papers Project, which Carson directs. For example,
a chapter on King's arrest at an Atlanta lunch counter
demonstration during the 1960 Presidential campaign combines King's
taped interview for the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library with
his statement to a judge rejecting release on bail, a letter to his
wife, Coretta, describing his incarceration at Georgia's Reidsville
Prison and a three-paragraph box ``On Richard Nixon'' from a letter
written in 1958. Each chapter includes a helpful chronology of the
events covered, and an opening sentence or two of King's that
defines the principle or significance of what follows. What is
missing, of course, is the cohesive narrative and balanced
perspective of a true autobiography. But this book is a valuable
reminder that on those subjects and occasions when he could not
have borrowed his words, King was consistently eloquent and
polished, a master of word and effect, possessed of a voice that
was unmistakable and true. _ DAVID WALTON

<P>
   Edited by Rodger Streitmatter.
</P>
<P>
   Free Press, $25. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Historians began debating Eleanor Roosevelt's sexual orientation
in 1978, 16 years after her death, when her husband's Presidential
library opened the correspondence deeded it by Lorena Hickok, Mrs.
Roosevelt's unofficial adviser, vacation companion and ``first
friend.'' The two women became close in 1932 when Hickok, a
reporter for The Associated Press, began covering Franklin D.
Roosevelt's Presidential campaign. Soon thereafter, the new First
Lady procured her a job as chief investigator of the nation's
relief programs. It was then, while Hickok traveled for months at a
time, that the women engaged in an intense correspondence that
continued for 29 years. In ``Empty Without You,'' Rodger
Streitmatter, a journalism professor at American University,
presents the first collection of that correspondence, reproducing
more than 300 of the 3,500 letters that were preserved. While many
of the selections describe each woman's physical and emotional
longing for the other, the reader expecting a titillating chronicle
of a forbidden lesbian love affair will be disappointed; what
evidence there is that one took place is relatively restrained in
tone. Streitmatter's frequent editorial comments are hit-or-miss:
those that highlight Hickok's critical role in encouraging the
reluctant Eleanor Roosevelt to use the press to advance her own
social and political agenda are well placed, while those that
merely highlight the sensual passages add little that cannot be
gleaned from the text. Although this collection does not
definitively answer the question of whether Roosevelt and Hickok
had an affair, it does document the American landscape as seen by
two intelligent, influential women who loved their country, and
each other, with a passion that is rare. _ JOHANNA BERKMAN

   Michael Jordan, the ultimate corporate sports star, has taken a
page from Dennis Rodman, the ultimate renegade sports star. In his
lavish picture-book autobiography, Jordan borrows the visual tics
Rodman employed in his books: garish graphics, disconnected text
with POINTLESS CAPITALIZATIONS, narcissistic self-absorption
(though Jordan lacks Rodman's saving sense of self-mockery). In
``For the Love of the Game,'' Jordan settles scores with former
teammates, coaches and franchise officials of the Chicago Bulls,
and explains why the most transcendent presence ever to grace a
basketball court happened to have the initials M.J. His legions of
fans will doubtless be grateful for this chance to share in
Jordan's early Christmas present to himself. _ MICHAEL ANDERSON

   &UR; EROTIC LIVES OF WOMEN
</P>
<P>
   By Linda Troeller and Marion Schneider
</P>
<P>
   Scalo, $45 &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Female sexual passion is often portrayed as sophomoric romance
or as the ecstasy following a high-end shopping spree. The Erotic
Lives of Women is different, and should be honored as one of the
most gutsy and imaginative erotic books of the decade. Linda
Troeller, an American photographer, and Marion Schneider, a German
writer, photographed and interviewed 30 women from the Americas,
Europe, the Middle East and Northern Africa. They include a
Brazilian singer, a Japanese-American flower designer, a black
American legal secretary, Islamic housewives and Moroccan belly
dancers. None of these women are model look-alikes, but each is
irrefutably seductive in her story and image. The honesty in the
interviews is extraordinary. The kinds of excuses, politically
correct slogans and gauzy fuzz that frequently suffocate erotic
candor are simply not here. The women tell their stories straight
out, and leave it to you to be aroused, disturbed or enlightened.
The photographs and the interviews were done at the same time, to
create a match between image and text, and the experiment proves to
be unexpected and moving. One woman, Nadia, a 36-year-old cigarette
vendor in Morocco, answered: ``Living by myself, earning my own
money, that is most erotic for me. . . . Being able to smoke
cigarettes wherever I like to and to smoke hashish when I feel like
it gives me such a strong feeling.'' She is depicted spreading
apart her djellaba like a pair of wings. _ SUSIE BRIGHT

   &UR; TOWARD THE SUN
</P>
<P>
   By Kent Nelson.
</P>
<P>
   Breakaway, $20. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   When Kent Nelson writes about sports, that's really the last
thing on his mind. In this collection of stories, each pegged to a
particular sport, Nelson is writing about struggles that take place
not so much on courts, playing fields, ice rinks or ski trails as
in the mind. And he makes us recall that even team sports can be
lonely endeavors, with each participant competing against himself
as well as opponents -- and occasionally taking time out to clarify
just who and what that self is. This is a central concern in the
story called ``The Actress,'' when Andrea Sykes, a paralegal on a
ski vacation, is introduced by her mysterious host to fellow guests
as an actress. A similar exercise in reinvention takes place in ``A
False Encounter,'' in which a son, taught how to box by his father
(himself a collegiate pugilist), seeks to solve the mystery of why
his father committed suicide -- and, along the way, is able to
discover principles that will give his own life direction. These
stories are also about the obstacles inherent in relationships
between men and women. In ``Every Day a Promise,'' Nelson describes
the warm-up routine of a high jumper who is finding it difficult to
commit himself to a deeper relationship with the young single
mother he's been dating: ``He stayed apart from the others, checked
and rechecked his steps. He felt loose, as strong as he had ever
felt. But he knew he was in his own world, the fate of everyone who
tried to realize dreams.'' And these words by Renner, an unorthodox
college professor, to Solomon, the star quarterback who's been
having problems not only on the field but in class, sum up the
dominant theme that runs through all these stories: ``What we seek
is our true selves, uncorrupted by images, unmeasured by numbers.
We seek the invisible within us. That's what we've been trying to
get at.'' _ CHARLES SALZBERG

<P>
   By Walter Keady.

   MacMurry &AMP; Beck, $24. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   You have to love the title character of Walter Keady's second
novel, who suffuses the whole book with her graceful charm and
feisty humor. It is 1950 and Sister Mary Thomas' father has died;
after leaving the convent to settle his affairs, she decides not to
return -- and in the remote Irish village of Kildawree such an
abandonment of her vows creates a scandal. But that's not the half
of it: very soon, Mary becomes pregnant and refuses to reveal the
name of the man who is responsible. Of course, the nosier villagers
pay careful attention to Mary's most regular visitors, creating a
kind of paternal whodunit. Is the father an old pre-convent flame,
rakish Kevin Kelly? Or the solid schoolmaster, Tom Tarragh, newly
married to troublesome Kitty Malone? Shy Jack Banaghan is a
possibility, and then there's Mick Burke, off to England -- a sure
sign of trouble. Some parishioners are even suspicious of their
good and gentle priest, John Mulroe. Keady, who grew up on a farm
in the west of Ireland, clearly knows the territory. Both his plot
and his prose are as down-to-earth as the parish he creates. _

   &UR; PURPLE DOTS
</P>
<P>
   By Jim Lehrer.
</P>
<P>
   Random House, $23.95. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Jim Lehrer's 11th novel, ``Purple Dots,'' is less a gripping
thriller than a high-spirited Washington Beltway romp, kept light
by insider gossip, very fine dinners and a good deal of picturesque
rural scenery. Whether this novel does for the West Virginia
panhandle what, say, Peter Mayle's equally frothy suspense novels
have done for Provence remains to be seen, but ``Purple Dots''
certainly provides comic relief in a turbulent political season. It
also probes deftly, if not too deeply, into such abiding issues of
governance as the corruption of idealists and the triumph of
hypocrisy. At the same time, Lehrer lets his wily heroes -- a band
of semi-retired CIA spooks scheming to outwit some shady
Congressional attempts to derail a friend's nomination as the
agency's new director -- have a very merry time. In fact, the old
goats dance rings around the self-important young lawyer who serves
as chief minority counsel of the Senate Intelligence Committee.
Part of the fun is wondering whether Lehrer, the veteran PBS
journalist, is telling tales out of school. Do wounded CIA agents
actually receive ``blue hearts''? Do the anecdotes about missions
gone horribly wrong lie somewhere near historical truth? Presumably
our spymasters do not manufacture a truth serum from fish oil, but
who knows? In the end, we learn that a flawed human being will be
confirmed in his post. We also learn how to behave on C-Span and
how to get unexpected political mileage out of a tuxedo. But the
title may be Lehrer's wittiest gibe -- suggesting that the supreme
perk of power in Washington is a purple dot that permits the owner
unlimited free parking. _ CHARLES FLOWERS

   &UR; CEREUS BLOOMS AT NIGHT
</P>
<P>
   By Shani Mootoo.
</P>
<P>
   Grove, $23. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Shani Mootoo's impressive first novel mixes elements of magic
realism and Gothic horror in a style that is by turns lyrical and
lurid. The town of Paradise, on the imaginary Caribbean island of
Lantanacamara, provides a lushly landscaped backdrop for the
troubled and finally tragic history of Mala Ramchandin and her
family. As a boy, Mala's impoverished father, Chandin, was
considered fortunate when he was adopted by a white Christian
missionary, Mr. Thoroughly. It becomes apparent that his luck is
also his misfortune when Mr. Thoroughly rejects him as a suitor for
his daughter, Lavinia, leading Chandin to the bitter realization
that he is valued only for his usefulness in converting other
islanders. In reaction, Chandin impetuously marries Lavinia's best
friend, Sarah, an islander who feels as displaced as Chandin by her
education at the missionary school. The marriage results in two
daughters, Mala and Asha, and sparks an explosive chain of events,
ranging from adultery and incest to madness and murder. Mala's sad
tale is gradually revealed to Tyler, the only male nurse in the
Paradise poorhouse and the sole employee willing to minister to a
patient the others fear as a violent old loon. Their kinship is
based on the shared knowledge of what it means to live as someone
stigmatized for being different: Tyler by virtue of his sexual
orientation and his penchant for cross-dressing, and Mala as a
result of her history of abandonment, abuse and madness.
Ultimately, these two outcasts are shown to be truer to themselves
-- and more accepting of nature's seeming misfits -- than
conformists who, in their eagerness to appear normal, deny the
individual characteristics that define each of us as human. Mootoo,
who grew up in Trinidad and now lives in Canada and New York City,
has an impeccable ear and gives Tyler, the novel's narrator, a
mellifluous voice. At times her writing tends to be overly
elaborate, and the plot takes a few too many twists and turns. But
the plea for tolerance that lies at the heart of this novel is both
authentic and powerful. _ DIANE COLE

   &UR; RUBY
</P>
<P>
   By Ann Hood
</P>
<P>
   Picador USA, $22 &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Over the course of a few giddy months, Olivia Bertolucci, a
stylish 37-year-old milliner living in Manhattan's East Village,
falls in love with and marries a charming industrial designer,
David Henderson. ``A person doesn't have a right to so much
happiness,'' Olivia tells herself one day while they're talking
about buying a beachfront vacation cottage in Rhode Island.
Naturally, soon after they take up residence, David goes out
jogging and is killed by a reckless driver. At first, ``Ruby''
resembles one of those stories in which a tragedy-beset heroine is
portrayed as bravely picking up the pieces. But Ann Hood's sly,
incisive novel soon breaks free from this familiar ground, deftly
exploring the strange rhythms of mourning, the unpredictable and
unavoidable demands of sorrow. Months after David's funeral, a
grief-numbed Olivia returns to the beach house, intending to tidy
the place up before selling it -- only to discover that a pregnant
teen-age runaway has taken up residence. Clever and voluble, Ruby
quickly explains that she has been shunned both by her mother and
stepfather and by the baby's frat-boy father. Olivia formulates a
plan that feels to her like fate: She will take Ruby in, care for
her and pay her medical bills -- if Ruby will let Olivia adopt the
baby. While lies, betrayals and manipulations give the plot its
undeniable page-turning pull, Hood's caustic wit, brightly detailed
prose and thoughtful delineations of two women struggling with
private, powerful regrets supply ``Ruby'' with rich and surprising
emotional depths. _ MEGAN HARLAN

 THE UNKNOWN MATISSE
<TEXT>
<P>
   A Life of Henri Matisse: The Early Years, 1869-1908.

 &UR; A LOVE AFFAIR WITH COLOR &QL; 
 &UR; By JULIAN BARNES &QL; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   The French rather despise biography: for them it is a low form,
the roundup of such factoids and gossip as the law permits. The
British, on the other hand, treat it as a major literary genre:
monumental in Victorian times, svelte and waspish in Strachey's
reinvention, and now, post-Holroyd, getting vast again. This
difference is partly a matter of temperament. The French are more
bourgeois, more liable to circle the wagons round the memory of a
great French man or woman. The British are more prurient and more
afflicted by tall-poppy syndrome (Larkin was a wanker, Durrell may
have committed incest, Koestler was a rapist -- that's cut them
down to size). But there is also a divergence of intellectual
tradition. The French treat a work of art as a prompt to wider,
more abstract reflection; the British as a segment of coded life,
whether give-away self-expression or unconvincing cover-up. The
French tend to be centripetal; the British reductive.
</P>
<P>
   So setting a British biographer on to the life of a great
Frenchman is a deft piece of cross-casting. ``The Unknown Matisse''
is a work of deep research and intense concentration, full of
archive-sweat, legwork and looking. Securing the trust of the
Matisse family was central to Hilary Spurling's enterprise, but her
tenacity in hunting down obscure documentation and forgotten
dramatis personae is most impressive. Camille Joblaud, Matisse's
early mistress and model, died at Concarneau in 1954; Spurling
tracked down the nun who nursed her on her deathbed. Her sense of
time, place and social texture is admirable. Above and beyond this
there is her attitude to Matisse and his genius. ``When you write
the biography of a friend,'' Flaubert told Ernest Feydeau (at a
time when Matisse was 3), ``you must do it as if you were taking
revenge for him.'' Spurling is such a biographer, and such a
friend.
</P>
<P>
   The first half of a famous life is usually more interesting, and
more tantalizing, then the second. Once the artist has become
celebrated, there tends to be only one of two plots: artist carries
on hacking it, or artist loses it. Moreover, the account of a life
that has become successful somehow assumes that it could not have
been otherwise: that the obstacles overcome were always bound to
have been overcome. Whereas the first part of a life is full of
implicit narrative risk. Logically, we know that our hero is going
to make it; but at the same time rival possibilities -- which seem
like probabilities to our hero -- loiter like footpads.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Unknown Matisse'' is haunted at various points by the
presence of such parallel, unfulfilled lives. When the 21-year-old
painter first reached Paris in 1891, he was accompanied by two
other young artistic renegades from French Flanders, two other
versions of himself: Louis van Cutsem and Jules Petit. The first
dropped out after a few years and became a sugar broker; the second
stuck to his dreams and was broken. Disillusioned and ill, Petit
died at the age of 26. Why them and not him, we wonder. Later in
the decade, Matisse formed part of another artistic -- and again
northern -- trio, with two other Henris: Evenepoel and Huklenbrok.
Of the three, Huklenbrok was the most successful, and Evenepoel at
least as promising as Matisse. Evenepoel died of typhoid fever in
1899, just as he was about to paint Clemenceau; Huklenbrok had a
breakdown, and though he lived on until 1942, his family destroyed
all his work ``for fear of seeing their name dishonored.'' The
three Henris had seemed to have equal shares of northern
determination, family disapproval, indifferent health (Matisse was
dogged by insomnia, nervous tension and intestinal troubles) -- and
talent. Again, why them and not him?
</P>
<P>
   Matisse has the good luck to keep serious (as opposed to
temporarily incapacitating) ill health at bay; the greater luck to
find in his wife, Amelie, a support system to replace that of his
grudging family; and the mysterious something -- beyond luck,
beyond hard work -- that turns talent into genius. Again and again,
the reader fears for Matisse, as in a good novel: how will he get
out of this hole, who will buy this work, what if he gives up?
Spurling is at her most skillful in evoking the French art scene of
those changing years: the old teachers, the Young Turks, the
controlling authorities, the free spirits, the rivalrous
camaraderie of student and debutant, neo-Impressionist and Fauve.
And she is also centrally attentive to what matters most: the man
before the canvas, and the fretful, intimate, public transaction
that took place as Matisse worked his way toward what we now,
still, call Modernism.
</P>
<P>
   One of the pauses on that path has been labeled by some critics
Matisse's ``dark period'': a two-year stretch, starting in 1902,
when he retrenched as an artist, drawing back from experimentalism
and explosive color. The ``dark'' has previously referred only to
pigment: Spurling now relates it to a wider gloom. It was in 1902
that the Humbert Affair broke -- a typically French, decades-long
financial swindle beginning with an invented inheritance and ending
with murder, suicide and corruption at the heart of the Republican
establishment. The parents of Matisse's wife were close associates
of the principals in the case, and endured much vilification before
being cleared. Matisse (whose studio was searched by police when
the scandal broke) became involved, and the strain led to one of
his periodic nervous collapses.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-NYTBOOK-MATISSE-2NDTAKE-NYTSF &QL; 
 &UR; UNDATED: nervous collapses.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Humbert Affair is familiar to historians; but the Matisse
connection had not previously been noticed by art critics. At first
Spurling merely lays out the scandal in lush detail, with not much
more than an implicit Q.E.D. A hundred pages later, in one of those
moments of biographical sleight of hand, she behaves as if her case
were proved, referring to ``the fiercely experimental phase cut
short by the Humbert scandal.'' There is, however, a certain
problem of evidence. No one in the painter's wide circle ever
mentioned the affair in print (or, presumably, in subsequently
reported conversation); while Matisse's only reference to it -- or
the only one Spurling quotes -- is a lighthearted aside. Seeing his
parents-in-law give evidence in court for three days was, he
quipped, ``a waste of time'' compared to a session with his
favorite model. Not much sign of anguish there.
</P>
<P>
   The only real evidence is that of the paintings themselves, of
Matisse's previous career and his known artistic priorities.
Spurling's excitement over her discovery is understandable, but
ironically the strongest argument against her theory lies in her
own earlier characterization of the painter. If Flaubert was
l'homme-plume, the pen-man, then Matisse was the brush-man,
austerely committed to finding his way regardless of sales (the
``dark'' pictures in any case went as unsold as the pre-dark ones);
he was an artist for whom having nothing to lose was actually a
spur to creativity, and a man who told his future wife that much as
he loved her, he would always love painting more. Does this sound
like someone who would lose his nerve and paint safe because of his
in-laws' embarrassment? Isn't the reason for the ``dark period''
always more likely to be painterly rather than biographical?
</P>
<P>
   This is an untypical outburst of reductivism on Hilary
Spurling's part. There are also moments of uncertainty in her
translation from the French; and this must be the only biography of
the last 30 years to have nothing to say about its subject's sex
life. But it is still a splendid work. Near its end, Spurling
quotes a story of two young American women applying to study under
Matisse and giving their reason as such: ``We want your color.''
Matisse replied, ``If you haven't brought your own color, you will
never get mine.'' Hilary Spurling is a doughty transmitter and
fierce defender of that color, and of all that it represents. Her
second volume cannot arrive too soon.

   Vintage Contemporaries, $13. &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In detailing the narcissistic foibles of a hippie family in the
1970s, this novel strives to capture the era's hypersincerity and
inflated sense of destiny. The result is ``a satirical elegy for
the age of dime-store Zen,'' Walter Kirn said here last year. ``The
book is as light and swirly and eccentric as its Marin County
setting.''

   Judging from this lively journal undertaken at the age of 80,
the versatile and idiosyncratic actor still has plenty to say. He
holds forth in charming and humorous fashion on everything from the
English weather to politics to his warm friendships with pets and
humans, not to mention the performances of other actors. Through it
all, ``Guinness remains pungently human, warts and all,'' John
Simon wrote in the Book Review in 1997. ``Sir Alec is an
accomplished writer, both in extended passages and in finely
etched, memory-hugging one-liners.''

   This novel focuses on the effects of compulsive gambling on a
family that wagers its comfortable life style on a chance to escape
the banality of middle-class existence. ``It is Barthelme's
peculiar post-modern gift to be able to invert the easy ironies of
contemporary life and reveal the truths beneath them,'' A. O. Scott

   A journalist punctures the postwar myth of a single-minded Japan
Inc., content with conformity and dependency on the West, and
instead finds a troubled society struggling to reinvent itself in
the absence of any meaningful democracy. Last year our reviewer,
Frank Gibney, called this ``a stimulating, provocative book.''
 &UR; GEISHA, by Liza Crihfield Dalby (University of California,
$17.95) &LR; , tells of an American doctoral candidate who traveled to
Japan in the mid-1970s to study the female entertainers known as
geisha and wound up working as one. Her account, which has been
reissued with a new preface, is marked by ``delicate observation
and subtle common sense,'' Donald Rich wrote here in 1984.

   These three novellas cover a lot of ground -- from Canada to
Mississippi -- but they share a precise observation of nature that
is both unsentimental and ecstatic. ``Reading this book has made me
glad . . . that there are still writers who can bring the
wilderness back alive and pin it to the page,'' Michael Gorra said
here last year.

   This large, philosophically complex Hungarian novel transposes
two elaborately linked Proustian narratives of consciousness to the
universe of Communist East Berlin and Budapest. ``The terrain of
Eastern European experience . . . gains an amplitude and an
illumination from the painstaking attentiveness, the penetration
with which it is imagined and contemplated,'' Eva Hoffman wrote
here last year.  &UR; THE LAND OF GREEN PLUMS, by Herta Muller,
translated from the German by Michael Hofmann (Hydra
Books/Northwestern University, $14.95) &LR; , is a grim novel about a
group of young Romanians persecuted as dissidents during the
dictatorship of Nicolae Ceausescu. ``Muller's vision . . . reads
like a kind of fairy tale on the mingled evils of gluttony,
stupidity and brutality,'' Larry Wolff wrote here in 1996.

   A Biography.
</P>
<P>
   By William McBrien.
</P>
<P>
   Illustrated. 459 pp. New York: Alfred A. Knopf. $30.
 &UR; ------- &QL; 
 &UR; DE-LIGHTFUL, DE-LICIOUS, DE-CEITFUL &QL; 
 &UR; By ALEXANDER CHANCELLOR &QL; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   As the biographer of a famous wit, prankster and social
butterfly, and of a supreme master of light verse, William McBrien,
a professor of English at Hofstra University, is disappointingly
plodding. The writer and his subject don't seem like kindred
spirits at all, more like inhabitants of different planets.
Nonetheless, McBrien's achievement is substantial. No previous
biography of Cole Porter has been so painstakingly researched, and
this one may well survive as the definitive account of his life, at
least for the wealth of information it provides.
</P>
<P>
   Porter was possibly the greatest popular song writer of the 20th
century. Of the more than 800 songs he produced during his life,
dozens have become standards and are still constantly being
rerecorded today. Shortly before his death, McBrien says in ``Cole
Porter: A Biography,'' he told a friend, ``I don't know how I did
it,'' and, for once, he was telling the truth.
</P>
<P>
   Many of his songs are so full of references to passing fads and
forgotten celebrities that they seem almost to have been designed
to go out of fashion. But one of these, ``You're the Top,'' is
hardly less popular now than when it was written in 1934, even
though it includes rhymes like this: ``You're the boy who dares /
Challenge Mrs. Baer's son Max, / You're a Russian ballet, / You're
Rudy Vallee, / You're Phenolax!''
</P>
<P>
   John Updike has written that each time we hear the words of
``You're the Top,'' ``something tender, solemn, nonsensical and
absolute seems to be being said,'' and he is right. While Cole
Porter's life was riddled with hypocrisy and deceit, his songs have
the ring of truth about them. According to McBrien, Porter once
said that he couldn't analyze his own work but that he could
characterize others': ``The word for Dick Rodgers's melodies, I
think, is holy. For Jerome Kern, sentimental. For Irving Berlin,
simplicity. For my own, I don't know.'' But we know. For all his
breezy cosmopolitanism, insistent name-dropping and devilishly
clever rhymes, his songs come from the heart.
</P>
<P>
   In 1943, Irving Berlin proposed to Jack Warner that a film
should be made of Porter's life, arguing that his heroism after
both his legs were crushed in a riding accident in 1937 would be an
inspiration to wounded American servicemen. But the various
screenwriters commissioned to produce a script complained about the
lack of ``struggle'' in his life. ``What will they use for a
climax?'' Orson Welles wondered. ``The only suspense is -- will he
or won't he accumulate $10 million?''
</P>
<P>
   It was the case that Porter's life had produced little drama
except in his obsessive romances with other men. But his
homosexuality was obviously a taboo subject. When he approved the
final script, Porter said contentedly, ``None of it's true.'' The
beautiful Linda Lee Porter, with whom he shared an affectionate
marriage of convenience for 35 years, was no doubt pleased that the
script was misleading, for she had always been desperately keen
that his homosexuality remain hidden.
</P>
<P>
   The film ``Night and Day,'' starring Alexis Smith as Linda and
(absurdly) Cary Grant as Cole, was completed in November 1945; and,
as the reviewers did not hesitate to point out, it was
exceptionally false even by ``biopic'' standards. But it reflected
a trait that its real-life heroes had in common -- an urge to
subordinate truth to their joint purpose of presenting a smooth and
glossy front to the world.
</P>
<P>
   Cole had already started playing around with the truth when, at
the age of 14, he went from his home in Peru, Ind., to boarding
school at Worcester Academy in Massachusetts. With the connivance
of his mother, Katie Cole Porter, he registered himself as two
years younger than he actually was. He had shown musical talent as
a child -- on the piano and the violin and at composing tunes --
and his mother, who was very ambitious for him, probably wanted him
to be thought a prodigy. On three of his passports in later life he
gave different years of birth -- 1891, 1892 and 1893 (1891 being
the correct one).
</P>
<P>
   He went east against the express wishes of his maternal
grandfather, J. O. Cole, who had amassed a great fortune in
California during the gold rush and planned for his grandson to
stay in Indiana and train to take over his various businesses. The
old tyrant was so angry with his daughter, Katie, for sending Cole
to Worcester that he didn't speak to her for two years. As for
Cole's father, Sam Porter, he was a remarkably passive man who ran
a successful drugstore in Peru and seems to have played no part in
the argument at all. Cole was later to dismiss him snobbishly as
``a parvenu druggist.''
</P>
<P>
   At Yale, where he owed his social success largely to his gift
for writing and performing amusing songs, Cole was sometimes
regarded as a bit of a parvenu himself. A friend there, Gerald
Murphy, heir to the Mark Cross fortune, later described him as ``a
little boy from Peru, Ind., in a checkered suit and a salmon tie,
with his hair parted in the middle and slicked down, looking just
like a Westerner dressed up for the East.''
</P>
<P>
   After Yale and a subsequent unsuccessful spell at Harvard Law
School, where he shared a residence with Dean Acheson, he abandoned
all other ambitions to become a songwriter. In 1915, with his Yale
friend T. Lawrason Riggs, he wrote his first professional musical,
``See America First,'' which opened in New York in March 1916 to
rotten notices and closed after 15 performances. It was patriotic
in a slightly mocking way and included a song advising against
travel to ``European lands effete.''
</P>
<P>
   Mortified by the show's failure, Porter left the following year
for Paris, claiming later to have joined the French Foreign Legion
there, though the precise nature of his war service remains
mysterious. But he was to stay in ``European lands effete'' for
many years, enthusiastically assimilating their effeteness. In
1919, he married Linda Lee Thomas, a wealthy Southern belle and
divorcee who was 15 years older than he. Together in Paris, Venice
and the French Riviera, they shone in smart expatriate society,
until he moved to New York in the 1930s and finally achieved the
recognition he deserved.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-NYTBOOK-COLE-2NDTAKE-NYTSF &QL; 
 &UR; UNDATED: he deserved.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   McBrien fails to find a merry way of describing the Porters'
hectic but repetitious social life, and one can take only so many
accounts of glittering openings and after-theater parties; but he
is good at conveying Porter's underlying gloom -- his fear of
boredom and his cultivation of aristocratic languor as a cover for
frustrated ambition. It was largely Porter's fault that he was
always being described as ``sophisticated,'' but he hated it all
the same.
</P>
<P>
   The real feeling in so many Porter songs is too often overlooked
because of his efforts always to appear urbane. The last major
biography of Porter, by Charles Schwartz, which was published 21
years ago, portrayed him as a man with a ferocious sexual appetite
that he sought to satisfy purely in casual encounters with sailors,
truck drivers and male prostitutes. But McBrien reveals him as
having also formed passionate, enduring attachments that inspired
some of his most poignant songs about the fragility of love.
``You'd Be So Nice to Come Home To,'' which so touched Americans in
the war that it knocked Irving Berlin's ``White Christmas'' off the
hit parade in 1942, was referred to by the choreographer Nelson
Barclift as ``our song.''
</P>
<P>
   Porter once claimed to Richard Rodgers that his most successful
songs, with their constant shifting from the major to the minor
key, were ``Jewish tunes.'' Rodgers agreed, and wrote in his
autobiography that the melodies of ``Night and Day,'' ``Begin the
Beguine'' and ``Love for Sale,'' among others, were all ``Jewish.''
He added, ``It is surely one of the ironies of the musical theater
that despite the abundance of Jewish composers, the one who has
written the most enduring 'Jewish' music should be an Episcopalian
millionaire who was born on a farm in Peru, Ind.''
</P>
<P>
   Porter's end was terrible. Following the deaths of the two most
important people in his life, his mother and his wife, and the
amputation in 1958 of his right leg, all within the space of a few
years, he stopped writing songs completely and died in California
in October 1964, a morose and lonely millionaire of 73, beset by
irrational worries about money. The head of the local mortuary
telephoned his counterpart in Peru, Ind., with the words: ``We
congratulate you. You are receiving the body of Cole Porter.''

   Martha Grimes doesn't write them fast enough for me, so you'll
excuse me while I savor for a minute the quirky charms of her new
Richard Jury mystery, THE STARGAZEY (Holt, $25). There's the
authentic English pub, of course, that gives the novel its title
and a hint of its mood. This time, it's a spiffy neighborhood
hangout in Fulham, a once seedy area newly gentrified by ``the
chattering classes'' where Jury first catches sight of an elegant
blond woman in a sable coat who disappears (perhaps to be murdered)
on the grounds of Fulham Palace. Then there are the wondrously
eccentric characters, including one grand old dame (the former
owner of the sable coat) and a supremely self-centered little girl
named Pansy. Finally, there are all the witty particulars that
surface at the oddest times. ``Most people don't notice little
things like this,'' a barmaid says to Jury about a curious postcard
of a fish pie. ``You miss a lot in life if you don't notice little
things.''
</P>
<P>
   Given all this, you want a plot, too? This one is strange beyond
belief, strained in the telling (Assassins! Aristocrats!
Doppelgangers! Nonsense!) and garbled in its conclusion. But if the
big picture is absurd, the details are divine.
</P>
<P>
   Haunted since childhood by his eyewitness memory of his sister's
murder, Paul Graves has the kind of nightmares that would send most
of us screaming to a shrink. But instead of exorcising his demons,
the protagonist of Thomas H. Cook's eerie suspense story
INSTRUMENTS OF NIGHT (Bantam, $23.95) endlessly recycles the trauma
in the bleak stories he writes about a police detective and a
sadistic master criminal who battle it out in turn-of-the-century
New York. Although his novels earn Graves a living, they don't do
much for his mental health, and after 15 books, the author is no
better off than his hero, whose ``view of life had turned so
intensely grim that his character seemed poised on the brink of an
absolute despair.'' Salvation (or is it damnation?) presents itself
when the wealthy patron of a writers' colony in New York's Hudson
Valley asks Graves to train his morbid imagination on the
50-year-old mystery of her best friend's murder. He doesn't have to
solve the case, she tells him -- just dream up something credible
enough to soften the pain and banish the ghosts.
</P>
<P>
   Cook does a lot better than that in this psychological horror
story. With his fondness for a twisted narrative line and his
appreciation of the nuances of terror, he devises a plot that
harnesses Graves's gloomy fantasies to a greater evil that should
shock him out of his obsessive brooding -- or shove him off his
mental cliff. Although it's easy to miss the very real clues that
Cook drops so artfully into the story, there's no ignoring his
savage imagery, or escaping the airless chambers of his disturbing
imagination.
</P>
<P>
   You're not a real New Yorker if you don't want to kill somebody,
sometime: the umpire who blows a call; the crazy guy at the deli;
your swine of a husband; even the mayor when he's on some dumb
rant. Mike McAlary, who regularly sounds off in a column for The
Daily News, gives raucous voice to that invigorating rage in his
first novel, SORE LOSER (Morrow, $24), which he aims and points
like a loaded gun at some of our favorite public targets.
</P>
<P>
   A ladylike tennis pro named Ginny Glade gets to go first, when
she takes a tire iron to the umpire whose lousy line call costs her
a shot at being seeded at the United States Open. ``Murder was
empowering,'' Ginny discovers. ``Murder, like winning, was
thrilling stuff.'' And when that thrill wears off, there's more
excitement to be had running around with Mickey Donovan, an
attractive, if preposterously idealized, supercop who travels in
the highest (and lowest) circles of power -- although always within
bellowing range of the egomaniacal mayor, a hilarious caricature of
Rudy Giuliani in all his volatile glory.
</P>
<P>
   In manic overdrive, the hyperkinetic style eventually sends the
story swerving off into total fantasy. But even then, McAlary is
fun to read. The cops are cute, everybody is a screamer and the
energy is pure New York.
</P>
<P>
   Crime marches on, even in wartime, and in the series of
melancholy police procedurals that J. Robert Janes sets in occupied
France, it falls to Inspector Jean-Louis St.-Cyr of the Surete
Nationale and Hermann Kohler, his softhearted Gestapo colleague, to
protect ordinary citizens from themselves. But, ``as always these
days,'' Janes reminds us in MANNEQUIN (Soho, $22), ``crime had to
be viewed through the occupation's prism, warped though that was.''
In the disjointed Parisian society of 1942, every local crime --
from a daring robbery of the Credit Lyonnais bank to the grisly
murders of a dozen or more would-be fashion models -- seems rooted
in the deeper moral chaos of these convulsive times. For all their
efforts to focus the search for a missing girl from St.-Cyr's
neighborhood, the detectives keep turning up sad or sinister
associations between the army of occupation and a conquered people
desperate to survive. Janes devises a shocking solution to the
brutal crimes at hand, but his larger point about the complexities
of human guilt isn't so easy to close the book on.
</P>
<P>
   Life in Toronto in 1895 was no glide across the ice, according
to Maureen Jennings in her horridly graphic period mystery UNDER
THE DRAGON'S TAIL (Thomas Dunne/St. Martin's, $21.95). Even the
high and mighty were plagued by syphilis, birth defects and
loathsome skin conditions, and the lower classes were also
malnourished and crawling with worms, while any woman, rich or
poor, who needed an abortion or had to give up a child for adoption
was at the mercy of her midwife. When Dolly Merishaw, an unsavory
specimen of the profession, is smothered on her own hearth, the
police dispatch William Murdoch to determine which of Dolly's
shameful deeds drove one of her clients to murder. Despite certain
plot transparencies, the grim story is told in forthright detail
and put in a social context that elicits real sympathy for
characters bound by class and biology.

 AMERICAN BEACH
<TEXT>
<P>
   A Saga of Race, Wealth, and Memory.
</P>
<P>
   By Russ Rymer.
</P>
<P>
   Illustrated. 337 pp. New York: HarperCollins Publishers. $25. &QL; 
 &UR; ------- &QL; 
 &UR; DISINTEGRATION &QL; 
 &UR; By EDDY L. HARRIS &QL; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly, the day I picked up ``American Beach,'' I was
stopped by a policeman who had no better reason than the few miles
an hour -- I think six -- by which I was exceeding Rhode Island's
highway speed limit. He was within his rights of course to stop me,
but he also wanted to search my car for drugs, and when I refused
him permission to look inside my trunk, he threatened to detain me
at the side of the road for a couple of hours while he sent for the
drug-sniffing dogs. It was, after all, as he made clear, his
highway and he could do anything he damn well pleased.
</P>
<P>
   And if I'd had a chip on my shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   And if I had reacted with a misunderstood gesture instead of
with words.
</P>
<P>
   Or if I had tried to drive away.
</P>
<P>
   These things happen, and in his new book, ``American Beach,''
Russ Rymer tells the story -- among other stories involving race
and power and politics -- of just such an incident.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Wilson, on the eve of his 33rd birthday, was stopped by
the police not far from American Beach, a resort town in northern
Florida. He had not been speeding. He had been driving slowly and
had pulled off the road in order to let the police car that had
been following him pass. A little later on, he caught up with that
same police car, which now had pulled over to let him pass. The
policemen followed Wilson, waited for him to make a turn, then
switched on the blue lights of the police cruiser and nabbed him
because the left turn had not been textbook proper.
</P>
<P>
   The police dispatcher told one of the officers that there was a
warrant out for Wilson on a charge of resisting arrest with
violence, a felony. In fact, Wilson had answered a warrant a week
earlier -- for resisting arrest without violence -- but a clerk had
incorrectly entered the information into the police computer.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson had had problems with local authorities before; he had an
arrest record, and he was known even to his friends as
``hair-triggered.'' He had once been beaten severely by police
officers, and had won a lawsuit against them, earning a reputation
in the county as an agitator. And this was a county not known for
its kind treatment of blacks. He may have smelled a setup, and he
started to drive away.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson was unarmed, and he had not acted in a threatening
manner, but he bumped one of the policemen with his fender as he
pulled away and he refused to stop the car. The two officers fired
several shots as he fled. A man riding in Wilson's car was wounded.
Wilson was killed.
</P>
<P>
   When you enter Russ Rymer's ``American Beach,'' almost
immediately you fall into a world crackling with similar
experiences, a world where these things have happened and continue
to happen, a world that many if not most black people in America
inhabit, where they are mostly voiceless and mostly powerless and
almost always under suspicion. In the case of too many people like
Dennis Wilson, who lived in a small house just up the road from
American Beach, that suspicion leads very often to inexcusable
violence and needless death at the hands of uniformed authority.
</P>
<P>
   But Rymer is also concerned with another kind of powerlessness
-- the kind that wears the face of cultural erosion, political
impotence and disappearing historical landmarks. In ``American
Beach'' he tells three basic stories -- about Dennis Wilson and the
circumstances surrounding his death, about MaVynee Betsch, the
great-granddaughter of the founder of American Beach, and about
Eatonville, Fla., the oldest black incorporated town in the United
States, threatened by a highway project that would divide the town
in two.
</P>
<P>
   In each of these places, issues that are larger than life are
brought down to human scale by centering our attention on a few
lives and a few stories, rendering personal the tragedy that is
American racial history. These stories strike at the core of who we
are as a nation, caught as we are in the vise grip of race, and
between development and progress and our traditions and past.
</P>
<P>
   American Beach is so small and seemingly insignificant that it
doesn't even warrant a dot on most maps. But during the long
nightmare of Jim Crow, it was one of the only black beach resorts
in the country. Money and ownership of the culture stayed within
the community. MaVynee Betsch, speaking of how self-contained the
black community was, says, ``You could go from sunup to sundown and
never bother with white people.''
</P>
<P>
   But with the end of segregation came the end of that kind of
self-sufficiency. Black communities dispersed as the restrictions
on housing at least nominally ended, and a kind of decay set in and
with it a new kind of isolation. To a woman like Betsch, who had
witnessed at first hand the vague fluctuations of fortune and
history, it was more than distressing. Her great-grandfather, A. L.
Lewis, had founded Florida's first life insurance company and was
one of Florida's first black millionaires. She had seen the history
unfold, and that history was suddenly hard to fathom.
</P>
<P>
   ``Russ,'' she asks the author, ``what went wrong?'' But Rymer
tells us, ``From her tone of aching lament I knew she was speaking
to herself.''
</P>
<P>
   Russ Rymer is a seasoned journalist, precise, attentive,
thought-provoking. (His first book, ``Genie: A Scientific
Tragedy,'' was a nominee for the National Book Critics Circle
Award.) At the same time -- and this is not a complaint -- he gives
the lie to the myth of journalistic objectivity. He has a feeling
for the people he meets and tells about and for the lives they have
lived, and he nudges his reader to care for them too and to arrive
at his intended conclusions, which he does with great skill.
</P>
<P>
   All is not perfect, of course. The book drags in places and
could be shorter, as almost all books could be. There are numerous
places where Rymer repeats himself, sometimes idea for idea,
sometimes almost word for word -- though some of that fault lies
with his editors, and ought not to detract from the overall
sensation that this is a book well worth the time.
</P>
<P>
   Except for the individual stories that illuminate ``American
Beach,'' there is nothing here that hasn't been told again and
again. Rymer is clearly aware of this, and of the fact that it is
necessary that these stories and this history be told until we all
understand more than we do, until we all come to realize what
continues to go on in the shadowy reaches of this country where so
many are so badly perceived and treated, until we can honestly
attempt to answer MaVynee's lamenting question: What went wrong?

<P>
   Essays and Criticism From a Lifelong Love Affair With the
Movies.
</P>
<P>
   By Phillip Lopate.
</P>
<P>
   384 pp. New York: Anchor Books/Doubleday. Paper, $12.95.
 &UR; ------- &QL; 
 &UR; WAITING FOR GODARD &QL; 
 &UR; By DIANE JACOBS &QL; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   FALLING in love with movies has proved a fruitful occupation for
intellectuals who might feel silly going wild over paintings or
books. ``John Wayne rode through my childhood,'' Joan Didion
rhapsodized in her memorable ``John Wayne: A Love Song''; David
Thomson announced that he could not be objective about anything to
do with Angie Dickinson. Now Phillip Lopate entitles a collection
of his writing on cinema ``Totally, Tenderly, Tragically'' and
starts off by confessing, ``All my life I have been movie-mad.''
Lopate, who takes Montaigne as his mentor, is known for bold,
cosmopolitan, complaint-driven (but never whiny) essays gathered in
impressive collections like ``Bachelorhood'' (1981) and,
especially, ``Against Joie de Vivre'' (1989). ``Totally, Tenderly,
Tragically'' is something of a departure. For where topics in the
earlier books ranged widely, from the machinations of a Manhattan
dinner party to an examination of Lopate's own body, here he rivets
his attention on the screen.
</P>
<P>
   Lopate considers himself ``both an outsider and an insider'' in
the movie world, since he never held a regular film beat or
professorship, but has spent four terms selecting entries for the
New York Film Festival, written lots of articles and ``put in my
50,000 hours in the dark.'' What's more, he was a precocious child
with plenty to escape from.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike most movie-mad youngsters, Lopate discovered film through
literature (``I bought Arthur Knight's survey, 'The Liveliest Art,'
and went about in my thorough, solemn way trying to see every movie
listed in the index'') and merely endured genre directors like
Hawks and Hitchcock while embracing the masters of high art, like
Murnau, Kurosawa and Bresson. In his teens, Lopate pursued cinema
across the bridge from his working-class Brooklyn family -- in the
wobbly seats of the Thalia, at makeshift screenings in Chelsea
church basements and finally in college at Columbia, where he
discovered Andrew Sarris and the auteur theory and formed a movie
club of his own. In ``Anticipation of 'La Notte' '' (an essay also
included in ``Against Joie de Vivre''), we meet Lopate's fellow
film buffs -- the temperate humanist James Stoller, a lover of
Satyajit Ray and Jean Renoir, and the ``mischievous'' Nicholas
Zill, a psychology major, who relishes the beggars' orgy in
``Viridiana'' and cutting up rats in the lab. Both men greatly
influence Lopate, who -- ``unable to break through to women'' --
spends his free time browsing through movie magazines, savoring ``a
mood of sweet latency'' and dreaming of the films he will see.
</P>
<P>
   It was the early 1960's, a high point for the French New Wave.
``Our man was Godard,'' Lopate recalls, and proceeds to interweave
his highly charged reactions to films like ``Breathless'' with
cursory remarks about his virginity and other aspects of college
life off screen. Discussing his suicidal depression, for instance,
Lopate nonchalantly observes, ``Between screenings of Vigo's
'L'Atalante' and 'Zero de Conduite' at West 106th Street, I told my
older brother that I was thinking of killing myself.'' And two
weeks after he has vomited up the 20 sleeping pills he swallowed:
``My brother met me at the hospital and we went straight downtown
to see a double bill at the Bleecker Street Cinema.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Totally, Tenderly, Tragically'' comprises 27 essays divided
into three sections: ``Memories,'' ``Films and Filmmakers'' and
``Can Movies Think?'' Roughly chronological, it jumps from short
reviews to leisurely career studies, film festival reports, close
considerations of individual movies (memorably, Bresson's ``Trial
of Joan of Arc'') and interviews with the likes of the critic
Pauline Kael. These pieces are culled from a variety of
publications; and while Lopate makes an effort to link them by
tacking on explanatory notes at the end of most articles, they
never do cohere. ``The First New York Film Festival -- 1963,''
written for The Columbia Daily Spectator, is predictably solemn and
erudite, while ``The Gallant Andrew Sarris,'' contributed to a book
honoring Sarris's 70th birthday, is chatty and wry. Still, Lopate's
language is consistently engaging, and the high points include a
deftly argued defense of Jerry Lewis's ``Three on a Couch,'' a
trenchant interview with the Iranian director Abbas Kiarostami and
a brief but moving rumination on Chris Marker's magisterial oeuvre.
</P>
<P>
   Notable too are Lopate's profile of Luchino Visconti and his
long, informative homage to the Japanese director Mikio Naruse.
Less successful are the more ambitious, convoluted essays.
``Fassbinder's 'Despair,' '' for instance, sets out to merge
analysis of a failed movie with the story of Lopate's own botched
infatuation, but it does not build interest about either. And
Lopate's musings on the possibility of an essay in film (``In
Search of the Centaur: The Essay-Film'') prove pedantic, even
plodding at times, though he clearly intends to delight.

   ``I have no faith that my discriminations in taste are anything
but the picky awareness of what will keep me stimulated, based on
the peculiar family and class circumstances that formed me. The
knowledge that my discriminations are skewed and not always
universally desirable doesn't stop me in the least from making
them,'' Lopate announced in ``Against Joie de Vivre.'' And a
swaggering individualism informs his film judgments, too. This can
be satisfying, as when Lopate nails ``Letter to Jane'' as ``a
closely reasoned, if nasty, provocation by two male-bonded
ingrates, Godard and Jean-Pierre Gorin, against the female movie
star who so generously collaborated with them on their otherwise
unbudgetable feature, 'Tout Va Bien.' '' At other times Lopate's
thrusts seem merely peevish -- when, during the 60's, for instance,
he deplores Ingmar Bergman as ``the darling of the suburbs,'' or in
the 90's damns Woody Allen's (sad and hilarious) ``Bullets Over
Broadway'' as ``impersonal,'' ``anti-intellectual'' and ``glib.''
</P>
<P>
   But if ``Totally, Tenderly, Tragically'' is an uneven volume,
never as fluent or strikingly original as ``Against Joie de
Vivre,'' it is always and unwaveringly intelligent. Fortunately,
its tendentious moments are outweighed by a wealth of thoughtful
analysis conveyed in lively, often eloquent prose. ``I approach
moviegoing seriously,'' Lopate announces in his introduction. And
serious he is. But he is also curious, wise and frequently amusing,
a sharp observer of his own quest for ``sublimity on screen.''

 THE RUM DIARY:

 &UR; FEAR AND LOATHING IN SAN JUAN &QL; 
 &UR; By DAVID KELLY &QL; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Drugs must have done wonders for Hunter S. Thompson, if we can
go by his first novel, ``The Rum Diary.'' There are no narcotics in
this early work, and there is also none of the maniacal wit and
deranged exuberance that roared through the ``Fear and Loathing''
books. The publisher says the novel, which is set mainly in Puerto
Rico in the late 1950s, was begun in 1959, when the future Dr. Duke
was only 22 years old, but doesn't say when Thompson put the
finishing touches on this piece of juvenilia (perhaps last month?).
</P>
<P>
   His narrator, Paul Kemp, leaves New York and the White Horse
Tavern behind for a job with The San Juan Daily News, an
English-language publication modeled on one that Thompson himself
worked for. The fictional paper is known for its colorful
journalists, who ``ran the whole gamut from genuine talents and
honest men to degenerates and hopeless losers who could barely
write a postcard.'' The editor is an ex-Communist from Florida
named Lotterman, who says things like ``You're damn tootin''' and
at other times sounds as if he were auditioning for ``The
McLaughlin Group'':
</P>
<P>
   ``'We have a responsibility! A free press is vital! If a pack of
deadbeats get hold of this newspaper it's the beginning of the end.
First they'll get this one, then they'll get a few more, and one
day they'll get The Times -- can you imagine it?'
</P>
<P>
   ``I said I couldn't.
</P>
<P>
   '' 'They'll get us all!'''
</P>
<P>
   For someone who gets to drink rum all day and have sex on the
beach (the real thing, not the cocktail) all night, Kemp is pretty
morose. At 30, he finds himself caught between ``a restless
idealism on one hand and a sense of impending doom on the other.''
Part of his problem is San Juan itself, which yanqui carpetbaggers
have now discovered and which Thompson evokes with some flair:
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a strange and unreal air about the whole world I'd
come into. It was amusing and vaguely depressing at the same time.
Here I was, living in a luxury hotel, racing around a half-Latin
city in a toy car that looked like a cockroach and sounded like a
jet fighter, sneaking down alleys and . . . scavenging for food in
shark-infested waters, hounded by mobs yelling in a foreign tongue
-- and the whole thing was taking place in quaint old Spanish
Puerto Rico, where everybody spent American dollars and drove
American cars and sat around roulette wheels pretending they were
in Casablanca. One part of the city looked like Tampa and the other
part looked like a medieval asylum.''
</P>
<P>
   For a while, not a lot happens in the novel. But trouble looms.
First, Kemp and two colleagues, Yeamon and Sala, are beaten up by
the cops. Then real disaster strikes on St. Thomas, where a
carnival has lured Kemp, Yeamon and Yeamon's sexy blond girlfriend,
Chenault, whom our hero has lusted after since Chapter 1. On the
island, the signs are ominous: people are looting a liquor store
and chanting ``Busha boomba, balla wa! Busha boomba, balla wa!''
Before long, Chenault is dancing suggestively for the locals;
nothing good can come of that. She disappears, or is disappeared.
Will the hard-bitten reporters leave her behind? Will she find her
way back to Puerto Rico? Will she and Kemp finally play house?
You're damn tootin'.
</P>
<P>
   ``A week in Vegas,'' Hunter Thompson once wrote, ``is like
stumbling into a Time Warp, a regression to the late 50's.'' The
same goes for ``The Rum Diary.'' If you're looking for the
birthplace of gonzo, you won't find it here.

 &UR; BOTH FOX AND HEDGEHOG &QL; 
 &UR; By STEVEN MARCUS &QL; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   When Isaiah Berlin died last year, obituary notices on both
sides of the Atlantic were long, appreciative and respectful. Not
all of them, however. Snipings from the ideological left and right
made it clear that this philosopher and historian of ideas, who was
also the chief voice of liberalism in the second half of the 20th
century, would not depart unscathed. They were a reminder, too,
that the middle ground on which classical modern liberalism stands
is narrower now than most of us suppose, that it has shrunk as it
has been contested, and that liberalism is indeed an embattled
perspective.
</P>
<P>
   Such an observation would have come as no surprise to Berlin. As
he conceived of it, this view of the world included philosophical
doctrines, political convictions and social theories about what
constituted being human. He also referred to it as pluralism, and
he never tired of setting it forth. In essay after essay, he
delineated it as a minority view, standing outside of, and
resisting and confronting, the mainstream of the Western tradition
of philosophical beliefs. That tradition was, according to Berlin's
spirited accounts and summaries, formed in two heroic episodes: the
first embodied by Plato and the classical Greeks; the second, the
grand modern resumptions of the mathematical and scientific
revolutions of the 17th century, played through in the
philosophical and social theories of the Enlightenment. A number of
interconnected presuppositions are organized into this mighty
intellectual fabric. First, as in the natural sciences, ``all
genuine questions must have one true answer''; in Berlin's amiable
formulation, the answers must be true for everyone, everywhere, all
the time. Second, a reproducible path toward the discovery of these
truths must be in principle accessible to everyone. Third, ``the
true answers, when found, must necessarily be compatible with one
another and form a single whole.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, opinions differed dramatically on how to find the
right way: some found it in churches, others in laboratories; some
trusted in intuition, others in experiment; some invested in
visions, others in mathematics. All shared the fundamental belief
that there is a system that weaves everything together. As Berlin
remarked in a characteristic passage of galloping hyperbole: ``The
answers must be known to someone: perhaps Adam in Paradise knew;
perhaps we shall only reach them at the end of days; if men cannot
know them, perhaps the angels know; and if not the angels, then God
knows. These timeless truths must in principle be knowable.''
Ultimately the grand narrative of culture and history would
progress to the best of all possible worlds.
</P>
<P>
   Berlin himself was trained in one prominent configuration of
this perennial philosophy. At Oxford, he internalized the British
empirical tradition and at first associated himself with the early
formation of modern analytic and linguistic philosophy. A. J. Ayer,
J. L. Austin and Stuart Hampshire were among colleagues and
friends. But even before then, his cultural identity prepared him
for the radical liberation that Enlightenment thought has regularly
effected. Born in Riga, Latvia, in 1909 to a Jewish bourgeois
family that moved first to St. Petersburg and then in 1921 to
London, where it had business interests, this champion of
philosophical minorities and oddballs knew the tradition intimately
from the inside.
</P>
<P>
   Berlin's life as we read it in ``Isaiah Berlin,'' Michael
Ignatieff's authorized biography, was an uninterrupted story of
success. It was furnished not only with a happy ending; it was
happy all the way through, from Riga to Oxford (the scholarship
winner to Corpus Christi became the first Jew to be elected to a
fellowship at All Souls) and points west. Although he considered
the present era ``the most terrible century in Western history,''
he suffered no personal hardships and led a charmed life. The three
strands of his existence -- Jewish, Russian and British -- were
braided richly together, and he gave full expression to each in his
Zionism, in his career as a spokeman for intellectual integrity and
moral decency and in his adherence to clarity, empirical reality
and liberal democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Other circumstances contributed to Berlin's deviation from the
principal genealogy of rationalistic methods and doctrines. When it
came to technical matters of logic and language, he discovered, he
was not in the same class as his Oxford analytic colleagues nor,
sensibly, did his more urgent interests lie in formal inquiry. His
first book was an introduction to Marx for the general reader,
which entailed intensive study of Hegel and other 19th-century
thinkers. From them Berlin learned that there might be ``no
timeless truths. . . . Human horizons altered with each new step in
the evolutionary ladder; history was a drama with many acts; it was
moved by conflicts of forces in the realms of both ideas and
reality.'' And from here his reading took him back to figures like
Machiavelli, Vico and Herder, each of whom represents a departure
from the main rationalist tradition. He emerged with a position, or
rather a counterposition: ``Not all the supreme values pursued by
mankind now and in the past were necessarily compatible.''
Individuals and entire cultures both pursued and were shaped by
``values, not means to ends but ultimate ends'' that can and do
differ and are not ``combinable in any final synthesis.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-NYTBOOK-BERLIN-2NDTAKE-NYTSF &QL; 
 &UR; UNDATED: final synthesis.'') &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This view, he stoutly affirmed, was not relativism but
pluralism: fundamental values can intractably clash, and yet ``it
does not follow that, if they do, some must be true and others
false.'' Liberty and equality, freedom and order, justice and mercy
will not be commensurable with one another. The desirable ends that
we pursue are not one but many. These ``collisions of values are of
the essence of what they are and what we are. . . . The notion of
the perfect whole, the ultimate solution, in which all good things
coexist, seems to me to be not merely unattainable -- that is a
truism -- but conceptually incoherent. . . . We are doomed to
choose, and every choice may entail an irreparable loss.'' Berlin's
liberal pluralism contained this indwelling bitter and stoic, if
not tragic, element. It was formed reactively, as a mediated,
reflexive response both to the enormous force of monistic
rationalism in philosophical and social thinking and to the
monstrous excesses committed in the name of rational plans in our
time. John Stuart Mill, Berlin's greatest predecessor among
philosophical liberals, modified the sovereign rationalist
principles that he inherited from his father and Jeremy Bentham
with what he learned from Coleridge and Continental romantic
thinkers. Berlin repaired to similar sources in his efforts to undo
the fallacies entailed in the projects for realizing, both
intellectually and in society, ``ultimate harmony.'' Such celestial
music was for angels, not men.
</P>
<P>
   His memorable essays from the three decades of 1950 to 1980 all
tend to focus on this cluster of considerations. In ``Historical
Inevitability'' he mounted a telling assault on positivism in both
new and old forms, along with the whole range of doctrines that are
grouped around belief that all human experience is determined. In
the famous ``Two Concepts of Liberty'' he set forth his notions of
negative liberty, which the individual must be allowed to enjoy
without interference, and positive liberty, which is an expression
of some idea of what is good for both oneself and others. And in
his dramatic expositions of the thinking of Hamann and Herder, of
Vico and Herzen, de Maistre and Mill, Montesquieu and Sorel, in
``The Pursuit of the Ideal'' and ``The Sense of Reality'' and in
his essays on nationalism he worked up, worked out and reworked
again his leading conceptions. He did not scruple to repeat
himself. Starting out as a fox, he became a monumental hedgehog.
The one big thing that, like the hedgehog, he knew was that the
human world answered to the nature of foxes -- that one must know
many things even if all that one knows is that this is what one has
to know.
</P>
<P>
   Berlin was a legendary talker, as a rule in continuous full
spate. Words, phrases, sentences, paragraphs came pouring forth at
phenomenal speed, an unintermitting flood, often impossible to
follow, but nonetheless coherent, sequential, compelling,
illuminated with drama and humor. This astonishing gift brought him
wide notice as an undergraduate. It was instrumental to his
acceptance in and privileged place among the upper echelons in the
social and cultural hierarchies of Britain and America, a series of
worlds that he spent most of his life exploring and enjoying.
</P>
<P>
   His immense powers of spoken expression seem to have been
connected with the difficulties in writing that he claimed always
to have suffered, and with his apparently indifferent estimation of
his own written work. Much of the substance of his published
writings remained scattered about in periodicals and ephemera until
a faithful editor, Henry Hardy, gathered together important volumes
of his essays; Berlin's delivery from this dismembered condition
secured his final singular status as a late 20th-century Victorian
sage. Since his talk and conversation were manifestly touched with
genius, his friends persuaded him, during his retirement, to allow
himself to be taped. In 1987, Michael Ignatieff, whose latest
previous book is ``The Warrior's Honor: Ethnic War and the Modern
Conscience,'' began interviewing him. After several years, a
biography was agreed upon.
</P>
<P>
   The result is a touching portrait and a labor of love. It is
gracefully written, moves along at a comfortable pace and is not
without its shortcomings. It is a compact undertaking, with almost
two-thirds devoted to the years before Berlin composed his major
works. Too much space is allocated, at least for my sense of
proportion, to Berlin's hobnobbing among the influential and the
celebrated. To be sure, Berlin socialized to the point of addiction
and was a tremendous charmer, a nonstop conversational act that was
hard to follow and a marvelous gossip. Still, there is something
dubious about allotting two short paragraphs to Berlin's book about
Marx while going on at length with an amusing story about how
Winston Churchill mistook all through lunch a bewildered Irving
Berlin for Isaiah B. The biography also takes Berlin at his word
and is written on the same level of analysis as his own reflections
about himself. That is to say, as in many authorized biographies,
what we mostly get is the subject's version of both himself and his
personal world. Hence there are, in singular contrast to Berlin's
written views and convictions, no tragic conflicts, no insuperable
difficulties or irreclaimable losses, no troubling inner
contradictions, no neurosis, no incoherence, self-delusion,
shameful episodes or lifelong regrets. Berlin habitually quoted
Bishop Butler to the effect that ``things and actions are what they
are''; such matter-of-factness may be the rule for certain
philosophical idioms. But it is not the rule for biographies, for
narratives of lives in which things regularly turn out to be what
they are not, or at least fail to be what they were once purported
to be.
</P>
<P>
   More regrettable is the fact that very little is made of deeper
connections between the life and the work. Part of the inner
meaning of important writings is to be traced in how they emerge
obliquely from ostensibly distant or remote personal experiences.
There is a similar avoidance of the contemporary biographical
assumption that our understanding of the structure of even an
abstruse argument can be augmented by an informed sense of personal
urgings, impulses that are bound up through indirect and often
unacknowledged means to larger events in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, ``Isaiah Berlin'' is an undertaking of
considerable merit. It gives us a rounded view of an
extraordinarily distinguished mind and prepares the ground for
future studies of Berlin's work and the place of his life and
experience in it. In this uncertain universe there are few matters
that one can count on with assurance; one of them is the continuing
salience, vitality and interest of the writings of Isaiah Berlin.

   Plain Tales From New York and New Delhi.
</P>
<P>
   By Ruth Prawer Jhabvala.
</P>
<P>
   314 pp. Washington: Counterpoint. $25.
 &UR; ------- &QL; 
 &UR; PASSAGE TO AMERICA &QL; 
 &UR; By DEBORAH MASON &QL; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   ``Should one want to try to become something other than what one
is?'' This is the question Ruth Prawer Jhabvala asked in the
introduction to her previous story collection, ``Out of India,'' in
which she reveals a deeply ambivalent love for her adopted country.
There she lives each day in the thick of its languid communality,
``a central European with an English education and a deplorable
tendency to constant self-analysis'' who is fated to feel like an
eternally displaced person.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it is precisely this sense of dislocation that has provided
Jhabvala with the cross-cultural eye to create, over the past 40
years, the sumptuous emotional geography of her short stories, her
screenplays for Merchant-Ivory Productions and her dozen novels,
including the Booker Prize-winning ``Heat and Dust.'' Jhabvala is a
connoisseur of divided souls, conceiving characters whose inner
longings are at odds with their outer protective coloration --
Indians who covet and achieve more tidy, ``modernized'' existences,
then feel as if someone had stolen their life force; esterners who
eagerly hand themselves over to India's chaotic bliss, then find it
too rigorous to endure.
</P>
<P>
   In her most recent works, Jhabvala's rich depictions of New York
City's extinguished lives -- melancholy German intellectuals
arguing in dusty West Side apartments, madmen pawing through trash
cans on Broadway -- have come to rival her signature descriptions
of India's intricate seductions. This new collection of stories,
``East Into Upper East: Plain Tales From New York and New Delhi,''
written over the last 20 years, reaffirms her as a spellbinding
urban fabulist.
</P>
<P>
   Set, for the most part, in the gilded co-ops of New York's Upper
East Side and the expensive villas of the ``new New Delhi,''
Jhabvala's stories lay open the rootless, chameleon existences that
thrive in habitats requiring no firm commitments, just a bundle of
money and a great address. Much further adrift than the dislocated
souls of her previous works, many of these characters have passed
over into permanent spiritual exile. Choked off from religious
moorings and family origins, they find their hungers resurfacing in
a desperate voraciousness. Sensuality is reduced to clownish sexual
preening, family loyalties to the language of real estate parcels
and advantageous marriages. These people can be unexpectedly
amusing -- or terrifying in their dumb soullessness. From time to
time, they manage to find salvation through the work of spiritual
shamans who may or may not be charlatans -- not that it matters.
Both the louts and the potentially redeemable are portrayed with
wry, bristling irony.
</P>
<P>
   Each story reveals Jhabvala's mastery of the form: the sleek
economy of words, free of heavy symbolism or easy judgments, that
allows her to home in on small, telling details. Often, a story
starts as if she were simply picking up a conversation in
midstream. ``Farid couldn't believe what he heard about Farida,''
one story begins. ``She was his wife, and he would have thought
that no one had known her more deeply, in every way, than he had.''
Jhabvala's plots unfold just as crisply, delivering sly humor and
sudden, startling turns into tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   In the New York stories, her characters routinely seal
themselves up in willed, anonymous isolation, as if warding off the
messy truths of the city might help them avoid unsettling changes
in their own lives. Behind their double-bolted doors, many are
locked into crushing emotional dependencies.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Fidelity,'' a middle-aged woman named Sophie spends most of
her time in her dark Park Avenue apartment, hiding behind her
family money and the constantly drawn drapes that prevent the sun
from fading her grandparents' Biedermeier furniture. Sophie's
ravenous wheeler-dealer husband, Dave, has left her yet again --
this time to live around the corner with a new young girlfriend who
``wasn't worth, he said, to kiss Sophie's shoe.''
</P>
<P>
   He still visits his wife regularly and just as regularly bursts
into tears over his infidelities, both romantic and financial --
tears so cleansing that they give him fresh strength to walk out on
her once again. ``Dave's relation to his wife was an affair of the
utmost delicacy to him,'' Jhabvala writes. ``He considered his love
for her as the only pure and selfless part of him, which he was
reluctant to tarnish with a request for money to keep him out of
jail.'' Sophie's accession to Dave turns out to be far more tragic:
she is so grateful for his visits that she will not interrupt his
monologues to tell him she is dying.
</P>
<P>
   Jhabvala's New Yorkers can be fiendish or funny, and they can
also can be pitiable -- like Pauline, the lonely real estate agent
in ``Great Expectations,'' who hands over her apartment and her
life to a parasitic family she has just met. The Indians in
Jhabvala's stories, on the other hand, seem somewhat wiser, less
cut off from their ancestral culture. But although they live in
daily intimacy with India's fervent spirituality, only a few
partake of it genuinely. The most haunting of these is Prakash in
``Husband and Son,'' a once amorous, Cambridge-educated Cabinet
minister who is now a toothless old holy man living on the roof of
his Delhi house, singing Vedic hymns to greet each dawn. Otherwise,
there are few saints among the Indian characters -- far from it.
</P>
<P>
   Farid and Farida, in the story of the same name, are a chic
young Delhi couple who move to London to hustle India's full line
of enchantments, from handcrafts to cocktail delicacies. When their
schemes collapse, so does their marriage. Twenty years later,
Farid, his waistline and his drinking problem increasing, tracks
down his wife to the Himalayas, only to find her sitting under a
banyan tree with her own fleet of handmaidens and a line of
pilgrims waiting to touch her feet: she has transformed herself
into an even more marketable product, a holy woman. ``Her skin was
clear,'' Farid notes, ``and shone with a radiance that could only
be the result of the best cosmetics, applied, he knew, with
consummate skill.'' He has arrived just in time to see her lose
what little remains of her soul.
</P>
<P>

 &UR; UNDATED: her soul.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Other Indian characters engage in the same social climbing and
power playing as the New Yorkers. Harry (born Hari), the
disaffected husband in ``Independence,'' amuses himself with
English detective novels, Urdu poetry and vodka. Meanwhile, his
wife, Sumitra, the Pamela Harriman of post-independence New Delhi,
is out every night ministering to the newly elected politicos
streaming in from the provinces -- teaching them to use the right
fork at the French Ambassador's dinner and sometimes romancing them
afterward. As Sumitra's career ascends, Harry reverts to wearing
Indian clothes and staging embarrassing scenes at his wife's
soirees. Gradually, he drinks himself into darkness, becoming a sad
relic of the graceful, old, outworn India.
</P>
<P>
   It is Ma in ``The Temptress,'' an ``ordinary Indian housewife
with extraordinary powers,'' who is the cheeky queen of this
collection. A fat, chatty sorceress in her 60's, Ma is imported to
New York by a wealthy collector of gurus, one of the many young
people in these stories starved for the spiritual grounding their
parents have discarded. But after sharing Ma with her friends, the
woman abruptly abandons her. Ma doesn't mind: she is a specialist
in self-renovation, having retooled herself into a glittering woman
of the world who shifts cities, countries, even New York apartments
with playful ease. Besides, ``Ma wasn't ready to go home. She felt
she was still needed here, also that she hadn't yet had her fill of
shopping and nice restaurants and all the lights coming on in the
theater district and the advertisements flashing and the many
different cable channels and flavors of ice cream.''
</P>
<P>
   Ma is also busy coaxing out of hiding the city's vast,
suppressed spiritual yearnings. Her tony neighbors unlatch their
doors and pour out their hearts to her; salesgirls from the local
discount store consult her between customers. Even doormen, that
most hardened of urban breeds, walk away from their jobs to join
her chanting, lentil-cooking commune. There Ma soothes them by
dealing ``with everyone in the manner of one used to hearing
strange and even terrible things without letting herself be
overwhelmed by them.''
</P>
<P>
   Ma comes the closest to sainthood of anyone in the book. She may
even be Jhabvala's earthy, late 90's incarnation of the Indian
Mother Goddess herself, who changes her own form at will, while
urging humankind to embrace -- not hide from -- the chaos,
contradiction and changeability of existence. Reconciling East and
West with one jingle of her bangle bracelets, Ma shows how a
benevolent acceptance of our frailties and longings can bind
disparate cultures -- and even a few divided souls.

 THE CRISIS OF GLOBAL CAPITALISM
<TEXT>
<P>
   Open Society Endangered.
</P>
<P>
   By George Soros.

 &UR; BE AFRAID! &QL; 
 &UR; By FLOYD NORRIS &QL; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   The world's economy has seldom seemed as imperiled -- at least
in the past half-century -- as it did this summer in the aftermath
of Russia's default on its debt. ``The Crisis of Global
Capitalism'' was rushed into print by one of the best money
managers, and most generous philanthropists, to come along this
half-century. Its financial analysis is brilliant and persuasive,
its remedies less so. And its extraordinary pessimism may prove to
be overdone.
</P>
<P>
   George Soros has been known on Wall Street for decades, but it
was not until 1992 that he became an international celebrity. That
was when the hedge funds he managed bet huge amounts that Britain
would not be able to maintain the value of the pound against other
European currencies. His funds made billions, and he felt a little
guilty. ``The Bank of England was on the other side of my
transactions and I was taking money out of the pockets of British
taxpayers,'' he writes. He doesn't think that should have deterred
him -- somebody else would have made the money anyway, he figures
-- but it does provide an argument for better international
regulation of markets.
</P>
<P>
   Soros thinks that argument is more valid today than ever. He
traces the way Thailand's financial collapse in 1997 led to
problems in other Asian countries, and then to Russia, and finally
to Latin America. It is a process he thinks will continue, arguing
that we are in the early stages of a global bear market.
``Eventually the markets should go much lower, leading to a global
recession,'' he forecasts. ``The disintegration of the global
capitalist system will prevent a recovery, turning the recession
into a depression.''
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of his argument are two beliefs: First, that the
financial markets have grown so large and powerful that they can
destroy countries, and second, that those same markets have now
become so frightened that they will withdraw capital from most
countries in the world.
</P>
<P>
   It is certainly true that some players in the markets, Soros
among them, have amassed huge amounts of money for investment, and
that those resources can, at times, overwhelm the forces against
them. That is particularly true when countries are seeking to
defend overvalued currencies. Soros's funds were among the first
speculators to bet against Asian currencies last year, although he
denies that he caused the meltdown of those currencies.
</P>
<P>
   One reason those currencies grew to be overvalued was a huge,
and in retrospect irrational, flood of capital into emerging Asian
economies. Asia was seen as a region of extraordinary growth, and,
as Soros notes, experiences like the Mexican bailout had dulled
investor fears about risk. Indeed, the Asian bailouts of 1997
tended to do a better job of protecting international investors
than they did of aiding the economies involved.
</P>
<P>
   It was in that atmosphere that the Russian economic collapse
came as such a shock. The Russian Government was in desperate shape
last spring, and everyone knew it. It was running a huge budget
deficit, not because it was spending so much money but because so
little was coming in. Few paid taxes, and some of the taxes that
were paid stayed with regional authorities. The Government was
determined to protect the international value of the ruble, since
stabilizing it had brought down inflation and was one of the few
economic successes to which the Government could point. So it was
unwilling simply to print rubles, and had to borrow money to pay
its bills.
</P>
<P>
   But who would lend money to such a basket case of a government?
Russians who owned rubles were reluctant to do so, demanding
interest rates of more than 50 percent. Even at those rates, the
Government could not borrow enough rubles. So it borrowed dollars
instead. In June, Goldman Sachs managed to sell $1.25 billion of
bonds denominated in dollars. Russia was to pay more than 12
percent interest, or more than double what the United States
Treasury was then paying, and many investors thought they had a
sure thing. After all, the Western world would surely not let
Russia, with all those nuclear weapons, default.
</P>
<P>
   But it did. Soros was a player in that crisis, talking to
Russian and American officials and, when the Aug. 17 collapse was
near, proposing his own solution, which would have involved further
international aid and a fairly modest devaluation of the ruble. The
major Western nations were unwilling, and international investors
lost billions. Soros's funds were among the losers.
</P>
<P>
   That collapse shocked international investors, and in the
aftermath many of them fled from risky investments. It was not only
doubtful foreign countries that were affected, but also European
and American companies whose credit was less than top notch. Soros
is furious that more was not done to salvage Russia. He thinks the
continued decline of financial markets is inevitable, albeit with a
rally or two along the way, and is harshly critical of the lack of
effective international action to ease the financial problems.
</P>
<P>
   Since this book went to press, however, there have been efforts
to arrange coordinated international action to fight financial
decay, and Congress has at long last provided the $18 billion in
American money needed to expand the International Monetary Fund.
Markets have rebounded, reflecting optimism that the fixes will
work.
</P>
<P>
   Soros wants more international regulation of markets. He would
love to see an international central bank, or at least an agency to
guarantee some international loans. It is unfair to dismiss those
ideas, as some have, as being ill-disguised plans to bail out
investors like Soros, since he wants to force investors to take
hits when things go wrong. But he is not persuasive in arguing that
such changes could be made to work.
</P>
<P>
   This book is sometimes hard sledding, particularly in the first
section, where Soros explains his theory of reflexivity, which
essentially argues that reality affects perceptions and in turn is
affected by those perceptions. It is an idea that seems obvious,
and readers may be tempted to skip over much of that. But when
Soros gets down to financial market business, and explains how we
got to where we are now, he does an excellent job. ``The Crisis of
Global Capitalism'' will be worth reading even if its dire
forecasts prove to be wrong.

 MASTER GEORGIE
<TEXT>
<P>
   By Beryl Bainbridge.

</P>
<P>
   Carroll &AMP; Graf Publishers. $21.
 &UR; ------- &QL; 
 &UR; EXPIRATION DATES &QL; 
 &UR; By FRANCINE PROSE &QL; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   BERYL BAINBRIDGE'S novels are like elegant teacups that contain
a strong, dark, possibly sinister but remarkable brew. Models of
compression, they show us how much (character, plot, subplot,
psychology, wit and depth) can be poured into a thin, deceptively
delicate vessel. For over 30 years, her best books -- from
``Harriet Said'' and ``The Bottle Factory Outing'' to ``An Awfully
Big Adventure'' -- have resisted the tide that has caused so much
modern fiction to bobble, inflated and bloated, in increasingly
murky waters. Indeed, Bainbridge's writing is so unlike anyone
else's that it may be more instructive to find analogues in the
visual arts. Her fiction is reminiscent of medieval woodcuts --
their spare, authoritative line deployed to render some grisly
scene (martyrs burning at the stake, victims felled by a plague)
with antic, animated high spirits. Or perhaps the art it most
nearly evokes is Hogarth's engravings, those richly detailed
snapshots of mass depravity and mayhem.
</P>
<P>
   A number of her books are set in the past. ``Young Adolf''
deals, nervily, with an imaginary sojourn in England by the
youthful Hitler; ``The Birthday Boys'' considers the ill-fated
Scott expedition to Antarctica; ``Watson's Apology'' exhumes a
Victorian murder. Yet these are not the sort of historical fictions
that serve up warmed-over ``Masterpiece Theater'' plots, larded
with period costumes, periwigs and bared bosoms. Rather,
Bainbridge's concerns -- the heartbreaking, nuanced transactions
between the strong and the weak, the perceptual differences
dividing men and women, the roles of chance and character in
determining our fates, the eager glee with which Nemesis undoes our
careful plans, the influence that social class exerts on sexual
morality -- remind us of how much about human behavior and destiny
is timeless and universal.
</P>
<P>
   Bainbridge's new novel, ``Master Georgie,'' is organized,
thematically and structurally, around a succession of upsetting
photographs; several of them, as was not uncommon in the 19th
century, picture the newly deceased. At the novel's center is
George Hardy, an amateur photographer and (more or less)
professional physician, whom we first glimpse (as always, from a
distance) in 1846, racing through the streets of Liverpool toward
the brothel in which his father has suddenly and inconveniently
died. By the time the elder Mr. Hardy has been brought home and his
body arranged to create the impression that he has expired in his
own bed, a large and varied cast of characters has been efficiently
assembled. In addition to the bisexual, seductive and mysterious
George, there are (among others) Dr. Potter, the libidinous
geologist who marries George's sister, Beatrice; Pompey Jones, the
wily street urchin who becomes George's assistant and lover; and,
most important, Myrtle, a foundling whose blindly obsessive passion
for the man she calls Master Georgie is the luminous thread that
holds the novel together. Narrated by the simultaneously
starry-eyed and down-to-earth orphan, the vertiginous first chapter
begins and ends with George photographing her beside his dead
father, a grimly comic event that the enamored Myrtle experiences
as an occasion of romantic transcendence:
</P>
<P>
   ``I fixed my gaze on the dead man and told myself God would
strike me blind if my eyelids quivered. So intense was my
concentration, it was only Master Georgie who breathed in that
sun-dappled room. Outside, the birds continued to twitter. All my
life, I thought, I will stand at your side; and then I did blink,
for the grandness of such a notion welled up tears in my eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of the novel's drama -- marriages, births, miscarriages and
deaths -- takes place during such blinks, in the months or years
that elapse between chapters. The book has a rare, rather
flattering faith in the reader's ability to extrapolate crucial
information from what is -- or, more frequently, what is not --
said. This characteristic spareness, dryness and pared-down
intensity can, I suppose, be confused with a certain surface chill
and may explain why Bainbridge's novels have failed to achieve in
this country the popularity earned by some of her windier
countrymen.
</P>
<P>
   When George volunteers to serve as an army medical officer and
the others follow to be near him, the action moves to
Constantinople and on to the cholera-infested camps and gory
battlefields of the Crimean War. Throughout, the characters take
turns telling their harrowing stories and offering their
conflicting versions of reality -- interpretations shaped by how
much they can (or can bear to) comprehend about their situation and
one another.
</P>
<P>
   EVERYTHING is refracted and refocused, as if by a series of
lenses, as Myrtle, Pompey Jones and Dr. Potter alternately assume
the task of advancing the plot. Myrtle's adoring view of Georgie
(``Of average height, stout of build, he walked with his feet
turned out and back straight as a ramrod. I watched the way he
swung his arms. How strange it is that even a mode of walking can
inspire love'') refuses to recognize his polymorphous sexuality and
so bears little resemblance to that of Pompey Jones, who sees his
master and lover as a privileged, petulant drunk. Likewise, our
sense of the minor characters is subject to major revision. Mr.
Hardy, whose embarrassing death has set events in motion, is
remembered by Myrtle as ``cheerful and lacking in malice,'' fond of
entertaining party guests with bellowed renditions of maudlin
ditties; in contrast, Dr. Potter recalls him as ``a bully and a
fraud.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps what's most striking about the book -- and about Beryl
Bainbridge's work as a whole -- is its companionable alliance
between wry, deadpan humor and nightmarish horror. Everywhere the
characters look, there's something grotesque to see -- if only
they're willing or able to see it. Meanwhile, the cumulative effect
of such an abundance of disconcerting incidents, described so
dispassionately and flatly and with such understatement, is that
they begin to seem at once awful and oddly funny.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-NYTBOOK-GEORGIE-2NDTAKE-NYTSF &QL; 
 &UR; UNDATED: oddly funny.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Myrtle's life has got off to an unpromising start (``I'd been
found . . . in a cellar in Seel Street, sat beside the body of a
woman whose throat had been nibbled by rats''), and though the
plucky, unshockable and sympathetic girl is educated and ``made
into a lady,'' she never sheds her intimacy with hideous
misadventure. In the Crimea, a brief pleasure excursion with an
officer's garrulous mistress involves an ominous encounter with a
three-legged black dog, an invitation to accept a farmer's
hospitality that ends with a goat messily giving birth in the
middle of a table and, finally, the sight of a dead soldier,
propped against a tree: ``The pink had quite gone from his cheeks
and his skin was mottled, like meat lain too long on the slab. . .
. Flies crawled along his fingers and buzzed at his mouth.''
</P>
<P>
   Scattered throughout the novel are many similarly horrific
moments, so that the narrative comes to resemble a cord stretched
tightly, connecting these glittery dark jewels. One of Pompey
Jones's photographic assignments is to assist Georgie in
documenting cataract surgery on a captive ape. An evening of opera
erupts in an outburst of jealousy and aggression. A child's puppy
is torn apart by feral dogs. When a Punch-and-Judy show is
interrupted by a collision between a horse and a van, the accident
is explained with Bainbridge's typically dry, ironic, goofy logic:
</P>
<P>
   ``A vegetable cart had spilled cabbages on the road, all of
which, save one, had been recovered or run off with. The
gentleman's horse, who had seen service with a cavalry regiment,
mistaking it for a puff adder, had reared up and crashed down
sideways, striking the van with its flank. The animal had recently
returned from Africa, where puff adders were quite common. They
hadn't any teeth but if they bit you their tongues imparted a
poison that could turn your blood to treacle.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the level of violence and chaos escalates as the book
nears its conclusion, and the sort of disaster that we anticipate
and dread in all of Bainbridge's fiction inevitably occurs. A final
photograph is taken, and the book ends with a searing image of
grief and loss.
</P>
<P>
   Beryl Bainbridge's novels are not exactly testaments to their
author's faith in redemption; she places little stock in the
ability of good intentions and common sense to dampen our natural
appetite for duplicity, cruelty and violence, or to defeat the
threatening, ``disruptive force of haphazard actions.'' For these
reasons, ``Master Georgie'' is hardly a feel-good book -- unless
you're a reader whose spirits are lifted by the prospect of a
writer so original and so firmly in control of her art.

 THURGOOD MARSHALL: AMERICAN REVOLUTIONARY.

 &UR; THE MARSHALL PLAN &QL; 
 &UR; By DAVID K. SHIPLER &QL; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Reading a biography of the great civil rights lawyer Thurgood
Marshall (1908-93) is good treatment for the disease of complacency
about race relations. Progress does not look inevitable when you
watch the powerful resistance that confronted Marshall's every step
to gain rights for blacks. Nor do all the advances seem
irreversible when you witness the backsliding that embittered his
later years as the first black Justice on the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his towering victories, he retired from the Court in
1991 not in a victorious spirit but in anguish over a task that
remained woefully incomplete. As an NAACP Legal Defense and
Educational Fund attorney, he had won landmark Supreme Court
decisions overturning segregation and discrimination in elections,
housing, transportation and education. Yet as a justice he saw his
influence wane as the Court swung to the right, leaving him
isolated and angry -- and unappreciated by a generation of blacks
no longer enamored of integration and too young to remember the
struggles he had waged since the 1930's. Some regard him as having
been a better lawyer than judge.
</P>
<P>
   The story of his extraordinary life contains a measure of our
history, so his exhilaration and melancholy reflect more than a
man's moods. They represent our national experience, which takes us
to the heights of decency one moment and to the depths of bigotry
the next. That larger landscape, illuminated as Marshall passes
through, is deftly sketched by Juan Williams in ``Thurgood
Marshall: American Revolutionary.''
</P>
<P>
   The term ``revolutionary'' might seem exaggerated for a man who
worked wholly within the judicial system, albeit using the
Constitution as a weapon of liberation. But on the first page
Williams labels Marshall ``one of America's leading radicals,''
places him in a triumvirate with Malcolm X and Martin Luther King
Jr. and argues that it was Thurgood Marshall who ``stood as the one
with the biggest impact on American race relations.'' The ranking
is debatable, but it would surely have pleased Marshall, who
detested the separatism of Malcolm X; ``I think we called each
other sons of bitches'' at a chance meeting on a Harlem street,
Marshall told Williams. In private, Marshall also disparaged King
and opposed most demonstrations -- even the Montgomery bus boycott
and the lunch counter sit-ins -- as senseless invitations to
violence. He initially resisted defending black students arrested
at a sit-in, because he thought they had violated private property
rights at a Woolworth's in Greensboro, N.C. He gives no sign, in
Williams's portrait, of recognizing how King's movement mobilized
the conscience of the country, creating the climate in which
courtroom triumphs could be enforced.
</P>
<P>
   Williams is an accomplished reporter with The Washington Post
who wrote ``Eyes on the Prize: America's Civil Rights Years,
1954-1965,'' the companion volume to the public television series.
His skills at digging out facts have been tested here, for although
he did a dozen interviews with Justice Marshall over six months in
1989, he was unable to gain access to the Legal Defense Fund's
files, and Marshall's children and second wife, Cissy, declined to
cooperate. Still, Williams interviewed widely, assembled accounts
of debates and maneuvers within the National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People and obtained documents revealing
Marshall's sporadic cooperation with J. Edgar Hoover. The book is a
strong piece of journalism crammed with fascinating detail, done in
an unassuming style driven by the factual narrative.
</P>
<P>
   It portrays Marshall as a curious mixture of stubbornness and
accommodation, a gruff wit who chased women and drank heavily and a
dedicated lawyer who repeatedly ventured into the dangers of the
South to defend blacks being railroaded on murder, rape and other
charges. In 1946, he was nearly lynched with the help of the local
police in Columbia, Tenn., after he got an all-white jury to acquit
23 of 25 blacks charged in riots started by whites. ``One local
paper said the trial was packed with spectators who came to town to
see 'those niggers up there wearing coats and ties and talking back
to the judge just like they were white men,' '' Williams writes.
</P>
<P>
   A native of Baltimore, Marshall knew how to avoid provoking
whites' resentment over an ``uppity'' black, and so he adopted a
charming deference in his arguments before the Supreme Court. ``His
light humor made the young black lawyer a fast favorite among the
older white justices,'' Williams observes. ``Marshall always took a
moment to thank the justices, whisper some confidence and make each
of them feel as if he were relying on their superior knowledge to
help him through the maze of laws.'' Near the end of his Court
career 45 years later, though, he issued rare public criticisms of
his conservative colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   As a reporter's book and not a legal history, this biography
offers little from Marshall's briefs, opinions and dissents --
perhaps a reasonable choice, since these documents are available
elsewhere. But we never quite see Marshall's legal mind at work.
Williams tells of his powerful orations, but rarely shows us more
than fragmentary quotations, even as Marshall argues the famous
school desegregation case, Brown v. Board of Education, before the
Supreme Court. A more serious flaw
</P>
<P>
   lies in Williams's uncritical use of McCarthy-era innuendo to
describe certain civil rights activists as ``Communist-backed'' or
having ``Communist ties.'' As a pre-emptive defense of the
N.A.A.C.P., Marshall exchanged information on such people and
groups with Hoover, who was obsessed by Communists, both actual and
phantom. But Williams treats the paranoia unquestioningly. His
reporting stops far short of defining the boundary between reality
and fantasy, leaving his readers unsure about Marshall's role in
this other crucial test of American democracy, which raised issues
of free speech and free association. It is the book's largest
defect.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-NYTBOOK-MARSHALL-2NDTAKE-NYTSF &QL; 
 &UR; UNDATED: largest defect.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the book offers a valuable picture of the odd
Marshall-Hoover liaison. The F.B.I. Director placed Marshall under
surveillance and resented his complaints that F.B.I. agents were
covering up for white sheriffs' departments sympathetic to mob
violence against blacks. But when the two met in 1947, Marshall
``won Hoover over with his charming, good-ol'-boy, 'I'm a little
ol' Baltimore lawyer' persona,'' Williams writes. The Director
offered a collaborative relationship, and Marshall suggested that
the N.A.A.C.P. could defuse accusations of racism in the F.B.I. if
the F.B.I. would investigate attacks on blacks. Both men got a
little of what they wanted.
</P>
<P>
   This volume captures the sweep of Marshall's impact beyond the
civil rights movement, for as lawyer and judge and justice, he
expanded the rights of all Americans. Williams shows him
influencing fellow justices in rulings that recognized the right to
abortions, indigent defendants' right to state-paid psychiatrists,
protections against double jeopardy in state courts and the right
of defendants not to have jurors excluded on racial grounds. He
helped shape the narrow decision to abolish the death penalty in
1972, but saw it reinstated by the Court several years later.
</P>
<P>
   The power of his presence was formidable. ``Marshall could be a
persuasive force by just sitting there,'' the conservative Justice
Antonin Scalia told Williams. ``Anyone who spoke in conference on
one of these race issues had to be looking at Thurgood. . . . He
wouldn't have had to open his mouth to affect the nature of the
conference and how seriously the conference would take matters of
race.'' The vacuum now is enormous.

the fact that she was born as the ultimate reason for thanksgiving,
no matter whether the anniversary came on some day in the week
besides Thursday. She would have hooted at the idea. She certainly
didn't think she was anything to celebrate. In fact, she was more
aware of her limitations than anybody we knew. (Sibley, Atlanta

 &HT;    COLUMN: I still spend holidays in kitchen with Mom
 &HT;    By Richard L. Eldredge
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Thanksgiving morning 1997. As the Barney balloon terrorized
bundled-up small fry in Manhattan during the Macy's parade on
television, my father and I were having an equally ... animated
chat on the phone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know she wrote it down, Pop, it's in her cookbook,'' I said
impatiently as my father shifted papers on the other end. ``I'm not
seeing it in any of the pockets of her recipe book,'' he said. Then
I remembered my mother's filing system. ``You know all those loose
recipes tossed inside the front cover of the church cookbook? Check
there.'' Mission accomplished.
</P>
<P>
   The ``mission,'' in particular, was to locate and to accurately
re-create my mother's famed Thanksgiving coleslaw dressing recipe
originated by my great-grandmother. It had become the final
culinary hurdle to clear before the end of the first-year grieving
cycle for our family. Or as I began referring to it: the coleslaw
coup de grace.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after delivering my mother's eulogy in early December
1996 (in which I noted her 25-plus years spent teaching Sunday
school to 3- and 4-year-olds, her genetic predisposition toward
marriage and motherhood and her impressive, seemingly effortless
repertoire of recipes for special _ and ordinary _ occasions), I
felt a nagging need to continue her work. Preserving family rituals
had always been a priority: The week before her death, she put out
a lavish Thanksgiving spread for 14.
</P>
<P>
   And since I haven't acquired her patience for skillfully
separating Play-Doh from the knees of Toughskins while spinning
yarns detailing Noah's savvy flood insurance provisions, I chose to
throw down the gauntlet and pick up her whisk.
</P>
<P>
   I'd logged a lot of holiday hours in the kitchen with Mom over
the years and had already achieved ``two spoons up!'' approval on
her Christmas cookie recipes, her baked macaroni and cheese dish
(my sister's favorite food, not counting mayonnaise) and her potato
salad recipe (the secret weapon, published here for the first time
_ a splash of apple cider vinegar!).
</P>
<P>
   During the year after her death, as I prepared her dishes for
family gatherings, conversations with my mother went something like
this: ``Ma, it's 2 a.m. What do you mean sift all ingredients and
mix in the four eggs one at a time?!''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, as the first anniversary of her passing loomed, I
invited family and friends to a remembrance dinner. It featured,
among other things, Mom's Missouri casserole and Jewish apple cakes
(one particular fan of this recipe would anxiously wait every year,
checkbook in hand, for Mom to arrive at the church bazaar with an
armload of these).
</P>
<P>
   Dad had boxed up my mother's entire recipe drawer and asked me
to organize it. It was a year before I was ready.
</P>
<P>
   Rooting through the contents was like an archaeological dig
through 40 years of American life. There's an incredible comfort in
seeing index card after food-splotched index card of my mother's
neat penmanship in blue ballpoint ink. (Family favorites from her
many cookbooks also carry remnants of flour, sugar and chocolate.)
</P>
<P>
   A particular treasure is her 1956 edition of ``Betty Crocker's
Revised and Enlarged Picture Cook Book,'' a wedding gift from my
grandmother. One of my favorite ``helpful hints'' features an
aproned wife serving a tray of appetizers and drinks to a suited
husband, lounging in an easy chair. The caption: ``The clever wife
has a simple appetizing cocktail (cold in summer, hot in winter)
ready for her weary husband when he comes home at night.'' Not
surprisingly, there are no splotches of food on that page.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Reader's Digest Guide to Healthful Eating'' (published
sometime in the 1970s), which contained a recipe for Swedish
meatballs with sour cream sauce, was equally entertaining. I was
even able to locate an age-old molasses cookie recipe presumed lost
at sea after a family flood.
</P>
<P>
   This year, as I prepare holiday favorites a la Mom, I'm sure my
thoughts will drift back to last Christmas, when I decided to
continue my mother's culinary legacy into the foreseeable future.
That day, it meant bringing the requested pineapple cheesecake to
dinner at my cousin's home.
</P>
<P>
   And just for a moment, as I lingered with my mug of coffee,
staring into the nearly empty cheesecake dish after dessert, I
could have sworn I felt my mother sitting across the room in her
favorite chair.

   SIBLEY-COLUMN _ My family always regarded Thanksgiving week as
my mother Muv's birthday. Sometimes the holiday fell on her
birthday, sometimes it didn't. We didn't tell her, but we regarded
the fact that she was born as the ultimate reason for thanksgiving,
no matter whether the anniversary came on some day in the week
besides Thursday. She would have hooted at the idea. She certainly
didn't think she was anything to celebrate. In fact, she was more
aware of her limitations than anybody we knew. (Sibley, Atlanta

WISH YOUR DAUGHTER A BON VOYAGE
</HEADLINE>
  By DR. JOY BROWNE 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   QUESTION: My daughter is a college freshman and wants to go to
Europe this summer. She's saved her own money, but it's so
dangerous these days. Is there any way to convince her terrorists
are dangerous, not romantic? _ Portland, Ore.
</P>
<P>
   DR. JOY: My dear, I doubt very much that your daughter thinks
terrorists are romantic. More likely she's having a difficult time
dealing with your fears. Isn't there a tiny part of you that is
proud of her gumption, independence and sense of adventure? How
'bout setting up a collect-call schedule _ and make it weekly, not
daily _ or ask her to write every week.
</P>
<P>
   Sounds like you've got a cool, self-sufficient, responsible,
independent kid here. You've done a good job. Stock her up on lots
of wash-and-wear undies, wish her a lovely summer and a bon voyage,
dry her tears and swallow your fears. Mom, you're growing up.
</P>
<P>
   QUESTION: I dated a 33-year-old woman for 10 months before she
moved in with me two months ago. I'm 44 and neither of us has been
married before. She agreed to pay $350 a month as her share of the
rent, but I haven't seen any of it. And when we go out, it's always
me who pays for everything. She never offered to pay for anything
when we were dating either. I'm getting the idea she doesn't want
to part with her money. What do I say to her? _ Los Angeles
</P>
<P>
   DR. JOY: Try saying, ``How about some money for the rent?'' Your
job is not to collect what you think she owes you, but to be honest
in communicating your understanding of your ``contract'' with each
other. Maybe she thought you were kidding about the money, maybe
she's a little short this month, or testing you or working on some
sort of old-fashioned idea of how men and women SHOULD be. Or maybe
she is signaling she isn't sure she wants to be in this
relationship.
</P>
<P>
   QUESTION: At the college I attend, I had a boyfriend for a year
and a best friend for three years. My friend knew I was still
suffering six months after the breakup, but then she had casual sex
with him, not once but twice in one week.
</P>
<P>
   I suspected something because she was avoiding me that week, but
then she came right out and told me. She said she wanted to be
honest. She doesn't care about him; he doesn't care about her. But
they both hurt me.
</P>
<P>
   It's a small campus, so I can't avoid her. She swears she's
still my friend, but even if I can forgive her, how can I ever
trust her again? _ Buffalo, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   DR. JOY: In a small college if everyone is expected not to date
people their friends have dated, you're all going to be sitting at
home a lot on Saturday night. Her mistake was not in having casual
sex with him _ although I'm not a fan of casual sex _ but in
telling you about it. That's really the question: Why did she tell
you? She's going to say she's just being honest, but don't buy it.
She knew that it wasn't a nice thing to do or she wouldn't have
confessed it to you. At this moment I'd back off the friendship a
bit, but I'd rethink your rules on your friends dating your
ex-boyfriends or you're going to be more miserable than absolutely
necessary.
</P>
<P>
   QUESTION: I'm seeing a woman who is divorced with a 9-year-old
son who is learning-disabled. I adore this woman, and am strongly
considering proposing to her. I get on very well with her boy, but
I'm a bit concerned about my ability to cope with his problem over
the long term. What would you do in this situation?
</P>
<P>
   DR. JOY: All God's children got problems. The real challenge
won't be his learning disability but his adolescence! If you decide
to marry his mother, you don't have to be this boy's dad. As a
potential stepparent, your role is to be a good friend and a good
host _ a relatively pleasurable combination of roles.

<P>
   Here is a list of selected computer-related stories from the
past week from  &UR; The N.Y. Times News Service &LR;  and its partners.
</P>
<P>
   These stories are being repeated with a distinguishing ``CPT''
in the slugline and an ``a'' general news category code.
</P>
<P>
   Similar stories planned for Thursday's New York Times will be
listed on  &UR; BC-CIRCUITS-BUDGET-NYT &LR; , moving later this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   LIBRARY-NET-FILTER-NYT (Undated) _ A ruling by a federal judge
Monday that barred public libraries in Loudoun County from limiting
how patrons use the Internet is binding only in southern Virginia,
but it seemed sure to have national implications as librarians
across the country began to review their own Internet policies in
the wake of the decision in the closely watched case. By Amy
Harmon.
</P>
<P>
   AOL-E-COMMERCE-NYT (Undated) _ America Online built itself into
the most potent force in cyberspace largely by appealing to
families with chatty teen-agers who want to flirt online and adults
looking for an easy way to send electronic mail while checking the
weather and sports scores. Now, the company has to get serious if
it is to win the hearts and minds of corporate executives in
pin-stripe suits. By Saul Haskell.
</P>
<P>
   TECHTOOLS-COX (Undated) _ The new editions of electronic
encyclopedias range from excellence to garbage.
</P>
<P>
   CYBERSCENE-COX (Atlanta) _ With the help of a map, most of us
can get very confused. But there are times when a map actually
helps. You'll find maps on the Web that will plot your route across
town or across the country. But the many sites on the Net that
offer maps offer a lot more than that. By Bill Husted.
</P>
<P>
   TECHNOBUDDY-COX (Atlanta) _ Getting back to the good old days of
building things as a kid. By Bill Husted.
</P>
<P>
   TECH-MEDIA-COX (Atlanta) _ A preview of the holiday season's
offerings on CD-ROM, and online outlets.
</P>
<P>
   NETWATCH-COX (Undated) _ Discussing Internet communities.
</P>
<P>
   TECH-REPORT-COX (Atlanta) _ So far, most computer games have
been devoted to digitizing what we do, paying taxes, playing
football, flying planes and hunting deer. Now, companies are coming
out with games for your PC that make fun of what we do.
</P>
<P>
   KTEL-INVESTOR-INTEREST-NYT (Undated ) _ Even for
Internet-related stocks, the tale of K-Tel is an extreme one. Until
April, K-Tel was an obscure company selling music compilations like
``Heart Throbs of the '70s.'' But when the company announced that
month that it would open an Internet record store, its shares
jumped to nearly $40 from about $4, adjusted for a subsequent
split. By Andrew Pollack.
</P>
<P>
   COMPUTER-COLUMN-HNS (Las Vegas) _ The hot new product at the
Comdex computer trade show is ``home networking,'' allowing a
family with multiple computers to link them. Officials are calling
home networking the next big trend in personal computing. By Dwight
Silverman.
</P>
<P>
   AOL-NETSCAPE-CLASH-NYT (Undated) _ When Marc Andreessen and his
fellow whiz kids from the University of Illinois arrived in Silicon
Valley in 1994 to found Netscape Communications Corp., the brash
new darling of the digerati was the antithesis of America Online,
which was widely perceived as a shelter for technical ``newbies''
unprepared for the brave new world of the Net. That the two are now
on the brink of merging is a measure of how much the divide between
Internet sophisticates and mere computer-using mortals has
narrowed. By Amy Harmon.
</P>
<P>
   AOL-BROWSERWAR-COX (Atlanta) _ The proposed America
Online/Netscape deal has the potential to permanently change the
face of the Internet industry and create a company uniquely suited
to compete against Microsoft. By Frances Katz.
</P>
<P>
   AOL-HUSTED-COX (Atlanta) _ America Online was way too simple for
me, right from the start. If you're a longtime reader of my column,
maybe you remember my predicting the demise of AOL about four years
ago. Predicting the future has always been easy for me because I'm
almost never right. By Bill Husted.
</P>
<P>
   COMPUTINGQ&AMP;A-SFCHRON (Undated) _ A Low-Tech Use for Free CDs. By
David Einstein.
</P>
<P>
   COMPUTERS-BOMBAY-COLUMN-TEX (Undated) _ Talk to me, baby, with a
microphone.
</P>
<P>
   ONLINE-COUNTRY-NYT (Cambridge) _ Last week, 100 youngsters from
10 to 16 years old from around the world attended a global forum at
the Media Laboratory at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
The forum, called the Junior Summit, is to the quaint old Mock
United Nations what a personal computer is to an abacus. Connected
online for months before they arrived for the summit, equipped with
pagers with e-mail functions and Power Point presentation skills,
the participants in the summit did not jabber about treaties and
points of order. They simply plotted to change the world, using
technology.

</P>
<P>
   OOD-CYBERSPICE-COX (Undated) _ Got turkey trauma? Help's just a
click away. By Betty Parham.
</P>

has spread from the political arena to the new frontiers of
cyberspace. As it rages, it is spinning off perplexing and
intriguing questions about freedom of speech. By Patti Hartigan.

</P>
<P>
   IMMIGRANT-FEAST (San Francisco) _ The first day of school is

first Thanksgiving feast. By ANNIE NAKAO.
</P>
<P>
   HOLIDAY-DIET (Undated) _ It's easier to put the weight on than
take it off during the busy holiday season. But food experts agree
that now is the wrong time to start a diet. Instead, they suggest
trying to keep ahead of those extra pounds with some healthy tips _
exercise and moderation _ that work year-round. By SYLVIA WOOD.
</P>
<P>
   WILD-TURKEYS (San Francisco) _ While the carcasses of their
dimwitted domestic cousins repose on millions of American tables as
the centerpiece of Thanksgiving dinner, wily and wary wild turkeys
are flourishing throughout the California foothills. Theirs is one
of the great environmental success stories of the 20th century _ a
species rescued from the brink of extinction. By ERIC BRAZIL.
</P>
<P>
   HISPANIC-LITERATURE (Houston) _ Arte Publico, a Houston-based
small press specializing in Hispanic literature, is discovering and
nuturing Hispanic writers. Arte Publico first made a name for

catching on with the general public, including a number of
non-Hispanics. By JEANNIE KEAVER. (Art available on NYT service.)
</P>
<P>
   SKY-SLEUTH (San Marcos, Texas) _ Professor Donald Olson of
Southwest Texas State University uses astronomy to solve puzzles
involving historical events and artistic works, to fix dates and
locations, to explain why the inexplicable happened. From a

Canterbury Tales,'' Olson is always working. His latest project:
the Battle of Quebec. By TODD ACKERMAN. (Art available on NYT photo
service.)
</P>
<P>
   CHRISTMAS-TREES (Altamont, N.Y.) _ The product development cycle
is long and the profit margins are slim, but the finished products
sure smell good. Consumers can start catching a whiff this weekend,
when Christmas tree growers ship trees to retailers. Yes, tree
farmers say, a fresh tree you buy this weekend will easily last
through Christmas if properly cared for. By JO-ANN JOHNSTON
</P>
<P>
   BUSINESS-FINANCE (``f'' category)
</P>
<P>
   AOL-NETSCAPE-Q&AMP;A (Undated) _ While Wall Street analysts chewed
over the $4.2 billion AOL-Netscape-Sun Microsystems merger,
computer users were asking what was in it for them. The San
Francisco Examiner posed some user questions to AOL's chief
executive officer, Steve Case, at AOL headquarters in Dulles, Va.

</P>

</P>
<P>
   HOLIDAY-RETAIL (San Francisco) _ Predicting holiday retail sales
blends a curious mix of pessimistic analysts and relentlessly

</P>
<P>
   FILM-BABE-REVIEW (Undated) _ ``Babe: Pig in the City,'' which is

that is fascinating but also disturbing. By LOUIS B. PARKS.
</P>
<P>
   TEXAS-SONGWRITERS (San Antonio) _ The fodder for Texas
songwriters is pretty straightforward: Somebody's going get shot.
Failing that, they're going to get shot at; or hold up a
convenience store; or steal a car; or fall in love with the wrong
person, the wrong train, or, God forbid, the wrong pickup truck. A
new album takes a look the writing talent in the Lone Star state.
By JIM BEAL Jr.
</P>
<P>
   BOOK-THRILLERS (Undated) _ ``The Pied Piper,'' Ridley Pearson's

age 82. His last years had been arduous because his wife was gone
and his body was betraying him. But on Thanksgiving, his daughter
will reflect on his life and her own gratitude for two little dogs
who'd loved her father so deeply and made his last years worth
living. By DAN LYNCH.

   WONG-COLUMN (Oakland, Calif.) _ Foo Tooey Moo was one of the
last, if not the last, old Chinese women of pre-World War II
Oakland Chinatown. She died earlier this month at age 92 and her
passing punctuates the passing of an era, almost ineffably. It was
just this past summer that another Oakland Chinatown icon, George
Catambay, a barber of Filipino descent, died at the age of 93. By

   A ruling by a federal judge Monday that barred public libraries
in Loudoun County from limiting how patrons use the Internet is
binding only in southern Virginia, but it seemed sure to have
national implications as librarians across the country began to
review their own Internet policies in the wake of the decision in
the closely watched case.
</P>
<P>
   The judge, Leonie Brinkema of U.S. District Court in Alexandria,
Va., is a former librarian herself and wrote that the county
library's decision to install computer programs that seek to block
sexually explicit material on the Internet ``offends the guarantee
of free speech in the First Amendment.''
</P>
<P>
   Such ``filter'' programs have been widely criticized by civil
libertarians as ineffective because they fail to screen out all
material that might be harmful to minors and in the process block a
wide spectrum of material that is not inappropriate.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs in the Loudoun case, represented by the American
Civil Liberties Union, included the proprietors of sites on the
World Wide Web about safe sex, banned books and gay and lesbian
teen-agers. All claimed to have been blocked by the software.
</P>
<P>
   In striking down the Loudoun County Library board's policy,
which required that all library computers connected to the Internet
be equipped with a filtering program, Judge Brinkema cited Reno vs.
ACLU, the 1997 Supreme Court decision that upheld a ruling that
overturned a federal law that sought to prohibit the distribution
of indecent material to minors over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has long been a matter of settled law that restricting what
adults may read to a level appropriate for minors is a violation of
the free speech guaranteed by the First Amendment,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling comes as a federal judge in Philadelphia last
Thursday issued a temporary restraining order on a new federal law
intended to protect children from Internet pornography. And several
congressional attempts to require schools to install filter
programs failed to pass in the last session.
</P>
<P>
   But particularly because public libraries provide free access to
the Internet to those who may not have any other means of using it,
they have been seen as a crucial site of the struggle over how the
medium will be regulated. In the absence of any precedent,
librarians and patrons have cobbled together various compromises in
an attempt to strike a balance between providing access to the vast
array of information on the Internet and protecting children from
portions of it that may be harmful.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, several librarians in communities where the decision to
use filters has been particularly controversial said they were
carefully reviewing the Loudoun decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will be helpful for decisions in the future,'' said Mike
Harris, interim director of the Medina County District Library in
Ohio, where last year community members organized an unsuccessful
campaign to cut the library's funding unless it installed filters.
``We've been flying a little bit blind here and this gives us a
good referral point.''
</P>
<P>
   Brenda Branch, director of the Austin Public Library, where the
decision to install filters has endured sustained protest from
civil libertarians over the last year, said she had asked the city
attorneys to review the Virginia court's decision.
</P>
<P>
   Dorothy Field, director of the Orange County Library system in
Orlando, Fla., said she would not consider removing the filtering
system there. ``We have exercised our role as librarians to choose
the material for our selection,'' she said. ``What happens in
Loudoun County is not going to change anything here.''
</P>
<P>
   The Virginia decision raised the possibility that less
restrictive methods, such as using privacy screens or installing
filters on terminals that are set aside for children, might be
acceptable under the First Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very pleased with the decision, and we are hopeful that
the library board will now put a constitutional policy in place and
that this will be the end of the issue,'' said Jeri McGiverin, a
retired schoolteacher who helped organize the group of Loudoun
residents who initially filed the complaint.
</P>
<P>
   Librarians in Loudoun cut off the Internet connections on
Tuesday pending a library board meeting next week where a decision
will be made on whether or not to appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would expect to win on appeal,'' said John Nicholas, the
former chairman of the library board who helped install the old
policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an issue of the library following its historical
mandate, which is to select material which is appropriate to the
community at hand.''
</P>
<P>
   But Nicholas said the composition of the board had changed since
the policy was instituted, and he did not expect a vote to appeal
to pass.

AMERICA ONLINE SETS ITS SIGHTS ON E-COMMERCE

 By SAUL HANSELL   c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   America Online built itself into the most potent force in
cyberspace largely by appealing to families with chatty teen-agers
who want to flirt online and adults looking for an easy way to send
electronic mail while checking the weather and sports scores.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the company has to get serious if it is to win the hearts
and minds of corporate executives in pin-stripe suits.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly lost in the complexity of America Online's deal to buy
Netscape Communication Corp. is America Online's announcement that
it will enter an entirely new market: working behind the computer
screen to help companies open and operate online stores.
</P>
<P>
   Netscape already has created software that made it a player in
providing support for what is already known as electronic commerce.
But America Online now says it has ambitions to offer a much wider
array of software, consulting and services for online merchants.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most companies that sell to consumers realize that they need
to get into the e-commerce space,'' said America Online president
Robert Pittman in a news conference Tuesday. ``We see a major
business in offering them an end-to-end solution.''
</P>
<P>
   The market is big and growing bigger by the day. Forrester
Research estimates that $325 million will be spent this year on
electronic commerce software and another $5.3 billion on services
that range from graphic design to the turn-key operation of entire
online stores. By 2002, Forrester estimates, the combined market
for electronic commerce services and software should top $35
billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``E-commerce services are the silver bullet that will enable
companies to be able to take advantage of the true business
opportunities on the Web,'' said Traci Gere, an analyst at
International Data Corp. ``The market is growing very rapidly, but
it is very fragmented.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say the leader today in e-commerce services is IBM,
which has a full line of offerings from sophisticated software
products to hand-holding consulting.
</P>
<P>
   Other competitors include well-known information technology
consulting companies such as Andersen Consulting, the spin-off from
the Arthur Andersen accounting firm; Electronic Data Systems, which
runs computer systems for big companies, and
PricewaterhouseCoopers, which offers accounting and consulting
separately but under one umbrella. Software companies like
Microsoft and Netscape sell packaged programs, typically with
little or no consulting to help customers use them.
</P>
<P>
   There are also plenty of new companies that have sprouted up to
provide electronic commerce services. Some, like Agency.Com and
Organic Online, started basically as advertising and design firms.
Others, including U S Web and Viant, have emphasized programming
and consulting. In fact, those two strains are blurring together,
as exemplified by U S Web's pending merger with CKS Group.
</P>
<P>
   America Online argues that its advantage in this increasingly
crowded bazaar is its ability to combine a broad subscriber base of
about 15 million customers with Netscape software, plus hardware
from Sun Microsystems, which has joined in America Online's venture
into electronic commerce engineering.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first time anyone has put a true end-to-end
solution that starts with the silicon and ends with the audience,''
said Barry Schuler, America Online's president for interactive
services. ``We start with Sun's line of servers, then the commerce
tools to build a store, the support services to process orders and
then a deal for online real estate that can drive the traffic.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the advantages Netscape and Sun bring, analysts say that
America Online faces a variety of problems in its new quest.
</P>
<P>
   Chief among them is whether it can appear to have the
consistency, focus and follow-through that corporate customers
demand.
</P>
<P>
   ``AOL is not the first company that comes to my mind when it
comes to business-quality software,'' said Robert Chatham, a senior
analyst with Forrester Research.
</P>
<P>
   Its decision to keep Netscape as a separate unit and offer
electronic commerce services in partnership with Sun will not
enhance its credibility, Chatham said. ``America Online doesn't
look like a homogenous vendor,'' he added. ``It looks like
customers will have to tangle with a menage a trois of AOL,
Netscape and Sun.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor have Internet service providers and other
telecommunications-oriented companies shown much evidence, Ms. Gere
of International Data said, that they are capable of offering the
highly specific customized services that big corporate clients
demand.
</P>
<P>
   ``Telecommunications companies that try to do things efficiently
for a large number of customers have not been able to offer
customized one-to-one relationships,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Pittman said that America Online had been driven to the
e-commerce business because companies that approached it wanting to
sell their goods needed more help than simply advertising online.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are finding people who are expert in running
bricks-and-mortar stores are limited by their infrastructure,'' he
said. ``They have an online store, but their square footage is too
small.''
</P>
<P>
   Even before the Netscape deal, America Online was moving to
provide some electronic commerce software and services. It has been
rewriting the software that lets companies open online stores to be
based on universally accepted Internet standards rather than the
specific computer language used only on America Online. This new
software, which now will be combined with Netscape's online store
services, will be available for companies to use both on America
Online and on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, it has developed a service that lets users create a
file with their credit card numbers and shipping address so they
can make online purchases without retyping all that information
each time. America Online is working to offer it _ for a fee _ to
stores on the broader Internet.
</P>
<P>
   There is a wide range of services that are incorporated in
electronic commerce. These include high-end strategy consulting to
help companies decide whether and how to sell online without
hurting their traditional sale in stores. There are all sorts of
computer systems to be developed, ranging from the online stores
themselves to connecting those sites to a company's existing
inventory and accounting systems.

A WAR OF WORDS IN CYBERSPACE 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PATTI HARTIGAN   c.1998 The Boston Globe  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The battle over civil rights has spread from the political arena
to the new frontiers of cyberspace. As it rages, it is spinning off
perplexing and intriguing questions about freedom of speech.
</P>
<P>
   For several years, groups that advocate intolerance _ hate
groups, as they are known _ have used the Internet to spread their
message. For the most part, their cyber-efforts have received less
attention than, say, pornography sites _ although that changed
briefly with the recent murder of a New York state doctor who had
been targeted on line by abortion foes.
</P>
<P>
   But as hate groups' cyber-campaigns have heated up, so have the
efforts to counter them, resulting in a full-scale _ and
increasingly sophisticated _ war of words on the Net.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, for instance, the Anti-Defamation League
introduced HateFilter, a noncommercial software package that blocks
specific hate sites and redirects browsers to the ADL's education
site.
</P>
<P>
   Filtering tools have been controversial since they first came on
the market a few years ago; one of the first packages was so
primitive it unintentionally blocked the site for the National
Organization for Women, alarming First Amendment activists. But ADL
officials contend they are not advocating outright censorship of
certain sites but simply providing parents with a choice on how
their children receive information.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, civil rights groups are getting increasingly
savvy in cyberspace. A typical search for the Ku Klux Klan will
direct users to a site where it's possible to purchase a Klan robe,
complete with blood-drop shoulder patch, for a mere $85, but the
search results will also lead browsers to Klanwatch, a civil rights
site operated by the Southern Poverty Law Center.
</P>
<P>
   The implication is clear: The same technology that provides a
forum for extremists enables civil rights groups and individuals to
mobilize a response in unprecedented ways.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC;  Hate on the Net is only a mouse click away. Some examples:
</P>
<P>
   _A Web site called Aryan Female Homestead lambastes
intermarriage and preaches racial purity.
</P>
<P>
   _The Web page for the World Church of the Creator declares a
``racial holy war'' against its ``mortal racial enemies.''
</P>
<P>
   _Another site known for its vicious attacks against gays and
lesbians features a letter condemning the parents of Matthew
Shepard, the young gay man who was tortured and murdered in Wyoming
last month.
</P>
<P>
   _And an infamous Web page called the Nuremberg Files declares
that ``legalized abortion is war'' and lists the names, addresses,
and telephone numbers of doctors who provide abortion services.
</P>
<P>
   Lining up in opposition are such people as David Goldman, a
35-year-old law librarian who runs a site called HateWatch.org out
of a modest office in Cambridge, Mass. With a small budget and a
tiny staff augmented by volunteers all over the world, Goldman
offers the most extensive on-line resource available to monitor
hate on the Internet. It ferrets outsites that advocate violence or
``unreasonable hostility'' toward groups or individuals based on
race, religion, national origin, sexual orientation, gender, or
disability.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you give a fool enough rope, he'll hang himself,'' said
Goldman, who started the site a few years ago when he was a
reference assistant at the Harvard University Law Library. ``I have
no fear that a rational, thinking person is going to be swept up by
these hate sites. I always say, `Don't believe me. Don't believe
HateWatch. Don't believe the ADL. Go in, take a look at the
information and judge for yourself.' I don't fear bigots. I fear
apathy.''
</P>
<P>
   Sites similar to HateWatch are emerging all the time:
Anti-Semitic sites are countered by the Nizkor Project, an
exhaustive on-line resource center that challenges Holocaust
denial. And while users can easily download white power computer
games for free, they can also play an on-line interactive game
about hate on the Internet sponsored by the Canadian Human Rights
Organization.
</P>
<P>
   While some groups are lobbying Congress to pass blanket
legislation that would censor the Internet (primarily to block out
pornography), other groups are urging Internet service providers to
subscribe to a voluntary code of conduct that prohibits hate sites.
</P>
<P>
   Some providers, including America Online and Bell Atlantic,
include such provisions in their service agreements. But Rick
Eaton, senior researcher at the Simon Weisenthal Center in Los
Angeles, said that when his organization sent out a voluntary code
of ethics to hundreds of service providers two years ago, he
received only a handful of responses.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet, after all, is in its infancy, both in terms of
ethics codes and criminal justice. There is almost no legal
precedent that specifically addresses free speech on the Internet,
and existing First Amendment statutes concerning other media have
yet to be tested in cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   There are two principles that distinguish protected speech from
speech that incites violence, according to Nadine Strossen,
president of the American Civil Liberties Union. First, the speech
must be proved to be a ``true threat'' that goes beyond political
rhetoric and hyperbole. Second, it must be deemed to constitute an
intentional incitement to imminent violence.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of the Nuremberg Files, legal experts and FBI
officials alike contend that it is impossible to prove that its
founder, Neal Horsley, actually incited the killer of Dr. Barnett
Slepian, who performed abortions, to pull the trigger.
</P>
<P>
   Horsley, a self-taught computer consultant and a graduate of the
Westminister Theological Seminary in Pennsylvania who runs the site
out of Carrollton, Ga., is unrepentant. ``Until the babies stop
getting killed, more and more people are going to get shot or
bombed,'' Horsley warned in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   The recent publicity resulting from Slepian's murder in his home
near Buffalo, N.Y., has only increased the Nuremberg Files site's
notoriety: In October, it received more than 400,000 hits, double
its usual count.
</P>
<P>
   Horsley said he has been visited by officials from the FBI and
the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms. Bill Carter, an FBI
spokesman in Washington, would not comment on whether Horsley had
been investigated. But he said, ``No matter how abhorrent a
particular person's beliefs might be, we still live in a free
country, and free speech is a constitutional right.''
</P>
<P>
   To date, the Justice Department has only prosecuted two cases
concerning threatening speech on line. A few years ago, a Federal
District Court judge in Michigan dismissed charges against a
student indicted for threatening other students by violent,
pornographic fantasies via e-mail. In February, a former college
student in California was convicted of a felony for e-mailing
racist death threats to 59 Asian students and staffers at the
University of California at Irvine.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Pennsylvania attorney general Michael Fisher sued a
Web site operator named Ryan Wilson, along with his service
providers, for allegedly threatening two civil rights activists who
are members of the Reading-Berks Human Relations Council and the
Pennsylvania Human Relations Commission. The site, which was called
ALPHA HQ and has since been shut down, included a photograph of one
of the employees and a message saying, ``Traitors like this ...
will be hung from the nearest tree or lamp post.'' The site also
featured an image of an office building blowing up.
</P>
<P>
   That suit is being watched closely in on-line circles,
particularly since it also names the primary service provider and
the secondary service provider, a man named Don Black who operates
a white supremacist site called Stormfront out of West Palm Beach,
Fla. ``It's a precedent-setting case for sites such as mine, but
also for all ISPs (Internet service providers),'' Black said of the
Pennsylvania case. ``It makes them liable for content of sites that
they don't even host.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Internet service providers would blanch at that connection,
for it was Black who posted the first white supremacist site back
in March 1995. At the time, the World Wide Web was just emerging,
and Black, an ex-Grand Dragon of the Alabama KKK who learned
computer science while he was incarcerated for conspiring to
overthrow the government of a Caribbean island, inaugurated the use
of the Internet as a tool for extremist groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are able to reach millions of people that we never had
access to in the past,'' he said in a telephone interview. ``The
Internet is becoming an alternative news media for those who have
an alternative point of view.''
</P>
<P>
   Black defines what he calls white nationalism as ``the idea that
whites may need to create a separate nation as a means of defending
themselves.'' In addition to providing links to the Aryan Nation,
KKK groups, and Holocaust denial sites, Stormfront includes a
library, an on-line chat room, and a white-singles dating service.
His site has inspired many others like it, including a site
operated by David Duke, the former KKK leader and occasional
political candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people who have ruled the information media have been
people with fantastic amounts of power and money, and finally, the
Internet makes it possible for different points of view to be
heard,'' said Duke, whose slick, multimedia site features the
manifesto ``The Coming White Revolution _ Born on the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   But while many lament that such views are available on the Net,
activists like Goldman contend that bringing hate into the on-line
mainstream may actually defuse its potential power. ``They can spew
all the filth they want, but as long as they're spewing it, someone
like HateWatch is going to be out there watching what they do and
educating the public about what they can do about it,'' Goldman
said. ``We'll be there, shining the light on the cockroaches.''

STARTUP'S SHAREHOLDERS HOLD MEETING ONLINE  
 FOR YEAR 2000 GNATS, A SCENTED `BUG' SPRAY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  
 (ATTN: Calif.)  (Eds: Bylines follow individual items.) 
(lb) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the age of the Internet, the proxies and mahogany-lined
boardrooms typical of important company meetings might give way to
quirkier variations. Such was the case with Travelzoo.com, a budget
travel company that held its first company meeting online on
Friday. No jacket was required; shareholders just logged on,
entered their passwords and cast their electronic ballots for the
board.
</P>
<P>
   A month ago, the start-up company's 700,000 ``owners'' _ each of
whom qualified for three shares of stock simply by showing up at
Travelzoo's site on the World Wide Web this spring _ were asked by
e-mail who among them cared to run for the seven nonpaying
directors' seats.
</P>
<P>
   Ralph Bartel, the founder of Travelzoo.com, said he was
surprised at how many shareholders submitted their biographies for
consideration _ 400 in all.
</P>
<P>
   They ranged from the author of a book on Maryland wines to an
executive with McDonald's to a second-year medical student in
Ponce, Puerto Rico, named Greg Kohanski, whose biography sounded
like a campaign promise for student office: ``I am extremely
organized, very responsible and will take my position very
seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   Jason Jennings, a financial manager from Gaithersburg, Md.,
bolstered his candidacy by proclaiming, ``I am interested in
Travelzoo.com because I like to travel, especially to places with
tennis courts.''
</P>
<P>
   And Barbara Crane, a 28-year-old social worker who did not list
her residency, defied the notion that a board member has to be
steely and impersonal: ``My personal interests include my husband,
baby (German shepherd), family, friends, church, theater, hiking
and movies. I love to travel. I feel for mental health it is
important to vacation and explore other cultures and lifestyles.''
</P>
<P>
   The results of the election will be posted on the company's site
by Tuesday, said Bartel _ who, as founder, retained 30 percent of
the company stock, no doubt ensuring his election to one of the
seats.
</P>
<P>
   He was quick to note the company's third-quarter profit of
$34,749, on revenues of $103,282, which he attributed to
advertising sales and commissions on sales of plane tickets from a
new booking feature on the site.
</P>
<P>
   His big-name competitors, he said, are not profitable, because
they pay millions of dollars ``to become exclusive travel agents or
spend millions on advertising.''
</P>
<P>
   Bartel started the business with no capital and no corporate
alliances, hoping to rely on word of mouth and what he called a
``power of the people'' business strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Naysayers laughed at his strategy at first, saying the chance of
the company's paying dividends was nil, but on the Internet,
suspension of disbelief appears to be part of the business plan.
</P>
<P>
   _ LISA NAPOLI
</P>
<P>
   For Year 2000 Gnats, a Scented `Bug' Spray
</P>
<P>
   It was only a matter of time. With all the anxiety among those
trying to head off computer chaos when the year 2000 arrives, some
computer-savvy entrepreneur was bound to come up with a less solemn
approach. And now, sure enough, a ``Y2K Bug Spray'' has appeared.
</P>
<P>
   The spray bottle is the brainchild of Dan Dyce, a claims
adjuster and Web-page builder from El Dorado Hills, Calif., who
teamed up with a buddy, Dale Miller, to create this ``Solution for
Your Year 2000 Problems.''
</P>
<P>
   The ingredients are almost entirely (99.746 percent, to be
exact) either ``Y2KBS'' or water, depending on which part of the
label you believe. And Dyce hopes it becomes the stocking stuffer
of choice for overstressed Cobol programmers everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   The two got their gag into distribution via www.isgnet.com/y2k
for less than $1,000. Their local Mail Boxes Etc. store receives
the orders and handles the shipping.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did the trademark work, found our raw materials, found a
manufacturer, all via the Internet, all during evening hours, all
without ever leaving our home,'' Dyce said.
</P>
<P>
   At $4.95 a bottle, plus shipping, Y2K Bug Spray is being used as
an icebreaker at technical meetings and as a humorous advertising
tool by Steven Schroeder, an accountant in Rancho Cordova, Calif.,
whose clients include insurance adjusters likely to run into year
2000 claims.
</P>
<P>
   What if the red and yellow spray bottle fails to stop irate
calls from chief executives or deliver the other suggested
benefits? Never fear. This pine-scented liquid comes with a
guarantee _ an ironclad promise that it will still be a
``solution'' if used by Jan. 1, 2000.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Everybody remembers their first time. The first time you're
eyeball to gullet with a turkey that is bigger than some of the
kids you know and it's your singular responsibility to have it
camera-ready (just like in the magazines) to say nothing of
mouthwateringly delicious for a table full of out-of-town
Thanksgiving guests. At best, it's a bit intimidating. (How can all
the instructions to cook this thing be on that little sticker?) At
worst, the insecurity, the anxiety, the downright panic that can
ensue can shred the confidence of any novice cook facing their
first turkey.
</P>
<P>
   The oven could conk out. The dog could make waste of it. You
could drop it or you could hear on CNN that there was a last-minute
recall of all turkeys sold by your supermarket.
</P>
<P>
   But take heart. First of all, even experienced chefs sometimes
seek help to deal with a recalcitrant turkey, and secondly, the
Internet is so chock-full of advice, Q&AMP;As, tips and general
information that you just need to log on and relax.

   Marinate First
</P>
<P>
   Marinades are seasoned liquids in which meats are soaked both to
absorb flavor and to tenderize. Most marinades contain an acid such
as vinegar, citrus juice or wine, and herbs or spices. One of the
easiest ways to marinate a turkey is by using a needle-like
injector. Injectors can be purchased at kitchen supply stores and
range in price from $10 to $15.
</P>
<P>
   To marinate a turkey without an injector, simply use a fork to
make random holes over the entire bird. Place the turkey in a
large, plastic cooking bag or clean plastic trash bag, pour in the
marinade, close the bag securely and let it marinate overnight.
</P>
<P>
   Turkey should always be marinated in the refrigerator. Before
cooking, be sure to scrape off excess marinade and discard. Do not
re-use marinade to baste the turkey. Then Cook!
</P>
<P>

FANNING FLAMES IN HEATED POLL DEBATE
</HEADLINE>
 
(Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TOM HOFFARTH  c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News   To really take
this Bowl Championship Series formula to the next level, someone
back at mission control should factor in the results from the
Internet's top two weekly fan polls on ESPN.com and CBS SportsLine.
<TEXT>
<P>
   They've got to be as legit as anything else.
</P>
<P>
   In order to preserve the integrity of its poll by using software
that eliminates duplicate votes _ thus preventing ballot-stuffing _
voting on the ESPN.com poll
(http://ESPN.SportsZone.com/interact/chat/fanpollrank.html) runs
Sunday night to Tuesday morning, and the results are posted by
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Going into last Saturday's games,Kansas State had replaced
Tennessee as the new No. 1 in this cyber survey with 4,602
first-place votes
(http://ESPN.SportsZone.com/interact/polls/ncffanpoll.html). UCLA
checked in at No. 3.
</P>
<P>
   The CBS SportsLine poll accepts Shockwave, Java or HTML ballots
between Saturday night and Thursday morning (http://
ww1.sportsline.com/u/football/ college/polls/fanpoll.htm), with the
results available Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Last week's poll (http:// ww3.sportsline.com/u/contests/
entries/fanpoll.htm) closer resembled the BCA poll, as Tennessee
had a 447-point lead at No. 1 over UCLA, with Kansas State third.
</P>
<P>
   For a comparative chuckle, check out the poll at the USA Today
site (http://survey.usatoday.com/survey/fanvot.html), which permits
just one vote for No. 1 (instead of the full 25 slots) plus
requires giving up an e-mail address (no doubt for future spam)
before the ballot counts. Updated every minute, the poll had UCLA
10th as of Sunday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, gussied-up versions of the Associated Press' writers'
poll (http://www.aptop25.com) and the USA Today/ESPN coaches' poll
(http://www.usatoday.com/sports/football/sfc/sfcpusa.htm) are
around for reference. Or debate.
</P>
<P>
   And then there's Mike DeSimone of Clarksboro, N.J., who uses
mathematical algorithms to figure out his No. 1-to-112 poll at his
site (http://www.algorithms.com/users/desimone/top25.htm). His top
pick?
</P>
<P>
   Hey, you do the math.

YOUTHS AIM TO CREATE ONLINE COUNTRY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  (mk) 
 By CAREY GOLDBERG c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ Never has the good old Model United Nations,
popular for so long among the earnest high school set, seemed so
pallid, so retro, so (to be read with teen-age disdain) 20th
century.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, 100 youngsters from 10 to 16 years old from around
the world attended a global forum at the Media Laboratory at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The forum, called the Junior
Summit, is to the quaint old Mock United Nations what a personal
computer is to an abacus.
</P>
<P>
   Connected online for months before they arrived for the summit,
equipped with pagers with e-mail functions and Power Point
presentation skills, the participants in the summit did not jabber
about treaties and points of order. They simply plotted to change
the world, using technology.
</P>
<P>
   They planned to create an online country, to be known as
Nation1, where anyone under 19 could automatically become a
citizen. Adults would need a visa, or special permission, to enter.
They hashed out the idea for Kidz Bank, an online bank for
children's savings that could lend them money for worthwhile
projects, and how to develop a digital currency. And they founded
an online global newspaper for children.
</P>
<P>
   They did not shoot low.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the year 2000, our global network shall comprise around 2
million people,'' Steven James Sutton, a 15-year-old from New
Zealand, announced in ringing Churchillian tones on Friday as he
rehearsed for a presentation before a gathering of diplomats, World
Bank officials, corporate sponsors and assorted dignitaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will have a network of school groups all across the
world,'' Sutton declared. ``We will have international events. We
will have everyone planting trees on Earth Day.''
</P>
<P>
   Adults tempted to shake their heads in amusement and joke about
the days when 30 years was the cut-off point for people who could
be trusted, instead of 19, might do well to note: These children
are backed by almost unlimited computer power from MIT, as well as
millions of dollars from a Japanese magnate.
</P>
<P>
   Isao Okawa, chairman of CSK Corp., which makes business
software, and Sega Enterprises Ltd., the game-maker, has agreed to
contribute $27 million to build a ``Center for Future Children''
next door to the current Media Lab building.
</P>
<P>
   The donation, MIT said, is one of the largest the university has
received and is believed to be the biggest ever made by a Japanese
individual to a foreign institution.
</P>
<P>
   It means a major expansion for the Media Lab, already known for
its success in winning corporate sponsors.
</P>
<P>
   The lab's projects tend to focus on the intersection between
technology and people, and range from wearable computers to
electronic books.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Okawa was attending a meeting of the Group of Seven
industrialized countries when it struck him that though children
have the biggest stake in the future, they have almost no say in
determining it, said Mitchel Resnick, the Media Lab professor who
is overseeing development of the center's programs.
</P>
<P>
   The center will try ``to rethink how children live, learn and
play,'' Resnick said.
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``We want to rethink technology to make it worthy of
children of the future. The kids you see here today could do so
much more technologically if we gave them the right tools.''
</P>
<P>
   And with those tools, the thinking goes, childhood itself would
change, as children became ever more able to take on new roles. For
example, becoming founders of banks and newspapers _ and nations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know whether it's a pipe-dream or not, but I think
we're going to do this,'' said John Perry Barlow, co-founder of the
Electronic Frontier Foundation, which advocates freedom on the
Internet, and adviser to the group of youths working on the Nation1
project. ``I've never started a nation before, especially in three
days.''
</P>
<P>
   But the children have begun to show, he said, ``how they can
start assembling, marshaling and deploying resources in a way that
I think will scare the hell out of adults.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, most of the youngsters' plans would gladden adults'
hearts: reducing child labor, improving the environment, helping
disabled children and simplifying computing. Now, will adults
listen?
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be those who say, `That's cute, nice to hear your
voice,' and go back to what they're doing,'' said Terah DeJong, 15,
of India. But some at the global forum formed fast friendships, he
said, ``and we expect to continue on for years.''

SOME WORRY ABOUT GOVERNMENT'S POLICY-MAKING ROLE IN CYBERSPACE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SIMSON GARFINKLE   c.1998 The Boston Globe  
<TEXT>
<P>
   An altogether perplexing mix technologists, business folk,
engineers, lobbyists, and lawyers gathered Saturday in Cambridge,
Mass. to discuss the future of the Internet. The occasion was the
first public meeting of the Internet Corp. for Assigned Names and
Numbers, or ICANN _ the new nonprofit California corporation that
will probably be granted ultimate authority by the US government
over all technical aspects of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ICANN was created last month by Jon Postel. The research
scientist at University of California's Information Sciences
Institute is regarded by many as one of the inventors of the 'Net.
For more than 20 years Postel had presided over the Internet's most
technical decisions, recording decisions that were made by rough
consensus and helping to resolve conflicts when they arose.
</P>
<P>
   Postel also decided who would run the Internet's
``nameservers,'' which connect users to the sites they are looking
for, and how 'Net addresses would be apportioned to governments,
companies, universities, organizations, and even individuals.
Postel walked into this job, friends say, because he was better at
recording facts and figures than the other Internet pioneers of the
day.
</P>
<P>
   But with the rapid commercialization of the Internet in recent
years, many people felt that it was inappropriate for the
Internet's ultimate arbiter to be a single individual. Some people
wanted to see this function performed by some kind of elected body.
Others, reasoning that governments can't be trusted, thought the
Internet's ultimate authority should rest in the hands of private
industry.
</P>
<P>
   For more than a year the federal National Telecommunications and
Information Administration has wrestled with this question. NTIA
put out two papers requesting proposals. Over the summer it
received three responses, one from Postel, one from an organization
called the Boston Working Group, and one from the Open Root Server
Confederation. There was a lot of conflict among the proposals, and
many of the participants were looking forward to a hashing out the
details in a public form.
</P>
<P>
   Then the unthinkable happened: Jon Postel died on Oct. 16 from a
burst aorta.
</P>
<P>
   Since Postel's death things have moved quickly. On Oct. 20, the
Commerce Department wrote a letter to ISI, Postel's home
institution, saying the United States intends to move carefully but
expeditiously to private management of the Internet address system
and essentially gave ISI the green light to set up ICANN. Shortly
thereafter a Washington attorney named Jon Sims telephoned 10
individuals, telling them that they had been chosen by Postel to be
ICANN's interim board. Nine agreed. On Oct. 26, the board met in
secret and appointed Esther Dyson, a former journalist who now runs
Edventure Holdings, an venture capital firm, as its interim
chairman. Postel's stature all but guarants his proposal would
ultimately be approved by the government, and his untimely death
has done much to silence public criticism.
</P>
<P>
   The Nov. 14 meeting was supposed to be ICANN's first public
meeting, but no business of any substance was conducted. Instead,
the meeting became a forum in which many people attacked ICANN's
proposed procedures, its mandate, and its very legitimacy.
Attendees demanded to know how ICANN's interim board had been
chosen. Others demanded to know how ICANN would raise money to
conduct business. Still others demanded to know how the
organization would be held accountable for its decisions. And then
there was the question that was on everybody's minds: what gave the
government the power to decide the Internet's future. Shouldn't
that be done democratically by the Internet's users?
</P>
<P>
   ``If we had created an electorate to elect us, the question
would have been by what authority are you creating that
electorate?'' said Dyson, shortly after the meeting was called to
order.
</P>
<P>
   It was somewhat frightening to see Dyson brush aside the
democratic desires of the people attending her meeting. Many people
attending thought that the Internet created the possibility for a
new kind of world-wide direct democracy. But instead, the board's
initial actions made it look like it would just be a reformation of
20th century power structures.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, government of the United States, reportedly the
greatest democracy on earth, seems to think that policy decisions
in cyberspace are best decided by private corporations that are
appointed by government regulators.
</P>
<P>
   ``The board's bylaws prohibit the public from attending
meetings, permit secret votes, and provide no way for the public to
appeal ICANN's decisions,'' wrote commentator Declan McCullagh in
an article that appeared in Wired News.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of people who didn't bother to attend the meeting largely
regard the controversy surrounding ICANN's creation as a tempest in
a teapot. After all, they say, the real control of the Internet is
already in the hands of companies like MCI, Sprint, and AT&AMP;T _ the
companies that actually operate the Internet's long-distance links.
</P>
<P>
   But control over directories and protocols is real power, as the
world is just beginning to learn.
</P>
<P>
   ``You guys will have a choke-hold on the economy of the US and
the world,'' said Dan Parisi, who runs the pornographic Web site
Whitehouse.com.
</P>
<P>
   Parisi has learned first-hand just how much control an
organization like ICANN will potentially wield. His Web site,
easily mistaken for a site operated by the US government, has long
been a thorn in the side of anti-pornography advocates and the feds
alike. And indeed, Whitehouse.coms makes frequent reference to the
first couple, going so far as to put their faces on the
pornographic photographs of sex models. But the US government has
never been able to shut down the site, largely because it does not
have a trademark on the word Whitehouse.
</P>
<P>
   Last October, Parisi noticed something odd: the number of
visitors coming to his site dropped by 90 percent. Parisi's
technical staff said that something was wrong with the Internet's
nameservers --- a new problem that was only affecting his
particular Web site. But the Internet's operators at Network
Solutions blamed Parisi's crew. The problem kept up for two weeks,
costing Parasi more than $50,000. Then, just as quietly as it had
started, the problem ended and the situation returned to normal.
Was this truly a technical glitch, or a warning? There is no way to
tell for sure.

TALK TO ME, BABY _ WITH A MICROPHONE

<TEXT>
<P>
   Dear Dr. Bombay: Is it possible to use your telephone receiver
as a microphone, since it's connected to the modem? _ Just Curious
</P>
<P>
   Dear Just: Just drive by the nearest fire station and see if you
can borrow the Jaws of Life for a few minutes. Then maybe you can
pry your wallet open long enough to extract five lousy bucks for a
stinking microphone.
</P>
<P>
   Haven't you ever picked up the phone while you were online? You
get knocked off immediately, right? That's because only one device
can be using the line at a time, unless you have some fancy digital
doodads. You can't just pick up the phone, murmur ``What are you
wearing, baby?'' into it and have it broadcast all over the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The modem has nothing to do with transmitting your voice. All
that stuff is handled by your sound card, which records what you
mumble into the mike, then funnels it into your video- or
audio-conferencing software. From there, it gets turned into tiny
little bundles of data and passed on to the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Your modem takes all those digital signals _ all those little
ones and zeroes _ and translates them into a horrid screeching
sound that can be sent over a regular phone line. Modems on the
other end reverse the process.
</P>
<P>
   Dear Dr. Bombay: On a CD-ROM drive, the tray slides out, and you
just place the CD on it. Once the CD is inside, what makes it spin?
On a CD player with a flip-up lid, the CD goes on a spindle, but on
the slide-out kind? No spindle, just a little hole. _ The Hole
Truth
</P>
<P>
   Dear Truth: It's been a closely guarded industry secret until
now, but there are thousands of tiny little invisible fairies who
live in your computer. It takes a specially trained army of about
70,000 of them to surround the CD, lift it ever so gently from the
tray, then run around in a circle as fast as they can until they
get so dizzy they throw up. That dust you see collecting in the CD
tray? Fairy puke.
</P>
<P>
   Look, there really is a spindle, and it's inside the drive with
the rest of the guts. When the tray retracts, the spindle grabs the
CD. No fairies are injured in the process.
</P>
<P>
   Dear Dr. Bombay: Bruce Williams has his picture in our paper.
Jane Bryant Quinn has her picture in our paper. Even The Motley
Fool has a picture in our paper. Why not you? _ A Real Fan
</P>
<P>
   Dear A: The statute of limitations hasn't run out in your state.
Anyway, that whole unfortunate incident at the liquor store was a
simple misunderstanding. It was all Bruce's idea.
</P>
<P>
   Dear Dr. Bombay: An objectionable picture has lodged itself on
my wallpaper as well as the wallpaper menu. How do I delete it so
my kids will not see it? _ Whoops
</P>
<P>
   Dear Whoops: Well, I guess that'll teach you to get twitchy with
your mouse hand. Most browsers let you capture Web images as
Windows wallpaper with a click or two. Of course, that means you
have to have been looking at the image in the first place. Nice
example for the kids.
</P>
<P>
   Wallpaper images usually can be found in the Windows folder with
a .BMP extension. If it's not there, use Find (on the Start menu)
to locate it, then go delete it. Or better yet, send it to me for
safekeeping.
</P>

<P>
   I'm not an attorney _ although I do play one when I sit in front
of my computer monitor.
</P>
<P>
   There are several computer programs that allow users to print
out legal documents with the blanks filled in for buyers and
sellers, landlords and tenants, plaintiffs and defendants.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Bar Association has mounted a legal challenge against
them because Texas law prohibiting the practice of law without a
license also applies to publishing companies as well as
individuals.
</P>
<P>
   But that should be of little concern to home users, particularly
those in other states. Simple legal documents are available in
office supply stores, and courts have held they're protected as a
freedom of speech issue.
</P>
<P>
   The main concern users should have is that legal documents are
sometimes challenged in court. Make sure you have the confidence
that the documents produced by the software are capable of
withstanding such a test. For everyday situations, the end product
will work fine.
</P>
<P>
   Quicken Business Law Partner 4.0 from Parsons Technology is the
newest release in an ever-growing field of legal software. It
contains more than 100 customized documents for small business,
including worksheets, forms and letters covering a variety of
situations: employment, consumer issues, credit, real estate and
other matters.
</P>
<P>
   It also contains a dozen new government forms, an interview
process to determine what forms are needed, password protection for
documents, and a spellchecker.

   Forbes' guide for buyers
</P>
<P>
   Looking to purchase a computer? Forbes' Small-Business
Home-Office Technology Buyers' Guide for the fall offers glimpses
and advice on desktops, notebooks, monitors, modems, printers,
copiers, scanners, multifunction scanners, fax machines and
networking.
</P>
<P>
   It discusses operating systems and office suites. The magazine,
a supplement to Forbes' regular publication, is aimed mainly at
small business, but it does contain some advice for the home user
trying to decide between a Windows/Intel based computer and Apple's
Macintosh.
</P>
<P>
   The brief article notes that Apple has made a comeback recently
under the re-established leadership of company founder Steve Jobs,
and it says that ``if everyone else at your company or in your line
of work is still using a Mac, it probably still makes sense for you
to own one, too.''
</P>
<P>
   But that's about as good as the article gets for the case of
buying an Apple. It goes on to point out that for general
customers, ``the picture is more mixed. Some home users may still
find Apple's vaulted ease of use attractive, but this advantage is
more than outweighed by the fact that fewer and fewer software
programs are being written for the Mac. This could change following
the launch of Apple's next-generation Mac operating system late
next year. In the meantime, however, most consumers should opt for
the safer, if more conventional, PC.''

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Wallets full, consciences clear
 &HT;    (EDS: This is the column that normally moves on Thursdays,
moving today because of the holiday.)
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   I have very good news for you. All those companies and trade
associations and cats fat beyond measure who have been off-loading
multimillions in ``soft money'' to the Democratic and Republican
parties don't want a darn thing back and can't buy a penny's worth
of influence no matter how much they shell out.
</P>
<P>
   We have no less than officials of the GOP to thank for this
welcome reassurance, uttered in recent testimony to the Federal
Elections Commission.
</P>
<P>
   With campaign-funding reform left in a bloody heap on the
barroom floor after the recent Congress quit town, the FEC
commissioners are considering whether they should _ in fact,
whether lawfully they can _ adopt reforms on their own. The answers
are almost surely that they won't and couldn't anyway, but the
exercise is not without its merits even so.
</P>
<P>
   There is not otherwise much mirth in Washington these days, but
there was Craig Engle, general counsel for the National Republican
Senatorial Committee, explaining that in the unlikely event any of
the big political sugar daddies should be found trying to cop a
grope for his diamonds and flowers, ``There are bribery statutes.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed there are, but there's the niggling problem of trying to
prove a cause-and-effect connection when everybody involved in the
transaction is tutored in the etiquette of silence and shocked
denial.
</P>
<P>
   So we are left to conclude that in the last Congress, it was
just coincidence that Wall Street contributors, who shelled out
$23.2 million, wound up getting a delay in regulations for swaps
and derivatives and won helpful new standards for securities
class-action lawsuits. The Center for Responsive Politics noticed
that and dozens more such coincidences.
</P>
<P>
   Telephone and TV companies got between $12 billion and $70
billion in free broadcast frequencies, a boon in which, happily,
their $14.4 million in political contributions had absolutely no
role. Tobacco's $6.1 million had nothing to do with the defeat of
legislation to limit tobacco advertising and cut youth smoking.
</P>
<P>
   It was just a pesky accident, and no doubt embarrassing as such
to the parties, that $6.9 million in contributions from accountants
coincided with the Treasury Department backing away from rules to
close a tax loophole that lets some multinationals cut tax payments
abroad and duck payments to the U.S. government on overseas
operations.
</P>
<P>
   Soft money is the money contributors give to the parties to get
around limits on how much can be contributed directly to
candidates. The parties then broadcast ``issue'' ads that, as
chance would have it, boost, say, Sen. Hy Faluten (it's almost
always an incumbent) by helpfully pointing out his opponent
strangles small, cuddly animals for fun.
</P>
<P>
   By mid-October this year, Democrats had pocketed $78.8 million
in soft money, an 84 percent increase over the last
non-presidential cycle (1993-94). Republicans had hauled in $94.7
million, a 144 percent increase.
</P>
<P>
   I can almost feel your relief that all those givers brought to
the table only a pristine commitment to the electoral process. Can
you feel my relief?

SMALL PRESS, GRANDE INFLUENCE: ARTE PUBLICO A LEADING FORCE IN
HISPANIC LITERATURE

By JEANNIE KEVER 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Graciela Limon believed in her first book, ``In Search
of Bernabe,'' but it seemed no one else did.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many, many, numerous rejections, without explanation,'' she
says to sum up her experiences with the publishing world.
</P>
<P>
   Unwilling to give up, she entered a literary competition at the
University of California-Irvine. The first-place winner was
guaranteed a publishing contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Search of Bernabe'' placed third.
</P>
<P>
   Discouraged, Limon nonetheless agreed to read from her work at a
reception for the award winners. And there she found another true
believer.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in the audience was a representative of Arte Publico
Press.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Search of Bernabe'' was published in 1993, going on to win
an American Book Award, among other accolades.
</P>
<P>
   When Limon's fourth novel is published next spring, Arte Publico
will again be at the helm, evidence of the author's faith that a
Houston-based small press specializing in Hispanic literature can
treat her work more carefully than a more-prestigious New York
publishing company.
</P>
<P>
   Discovering and nurturing Hispanic writers _ knowing how to
market their works, from advertising on Spanish-language radio to
selling in Hispanic neighborhood supermarkets _ is a cornerstone of
the way Arte Publico has grown since its founding 19 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The press originally flourished in educational publishing,
providing materials for the then-new fields of Hispanic studies and
women's studies. When public schools, increasingly filled with
Hispanic students, began looking for more relevant books, Arte
Publico bolstered its children's line by starting a separate
children's division in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   As Hispanic and other ethnic literature has edged into the
mainstream, Arte Publico has ridden the wave; it now estimates that
about 40 percent of its business comes from the general book-buying
public, and about 30 percent of its readers are non-Hispanic.
</P>
<P>
   It also is guiding an ambitious academic project to recover
Hispanic works _ from newspapers to novels _ that were published
and then vanished between 1808 and 1960. A conference on that
project will be Dec. 4-5 at Rice University.
</P>
<P>
   Arte Publico has published about 350 books since its founding,
now averaging between 30 and 35 books a year, most of them in
English.
</P>
<P>
   It all grew from one man's sense that something was wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Nicholas Kanellos had been active in the Chicano movement of the
1960s and '70s, teaching Hispanic literature at Indiana University
Northwest and, surrounded by many of the important Chicano writers
of the day, troubled by the paucity of places that would publish
their work.
</P>
<P>
   He started a small literary magazine in 1973 and, six years
later, expanded it into a full publishing company, which he named
Arte Publico Press.
</P>
<P>
   When the University of Houston offered him a teaching job the
following year, Kanellos and his fledgling venture moved south.
Timing worked in their favor.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were involved from the ground up in (helping to develop
curriculums for) ethnic studies, bilingual education, women's
education,'' said Kanellos, who teaches a graduate course in
Hispanic literature at UH in addition to running Arte Publico.
``That was where the strength of Hispanic literature was, and still
is.
</P>
<P>
   ``It lives at the university (level).''
</P>
<P>
   Changing demographics also played a role in the company's growth
_ it now is the largest nonprofit publisher of literature in the
United States _ as public schools and libraries began looking for
books to better reflect the lives of their increasingly Hispanic
student populations.
</P>
<P>
   That's especially true in Texas, California and other areas of
the Southwest with large Hispanic populations, said Christine Lind
Hage, a librarian from suburban Detroit who is president of the
national Public Library Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is growing support in public libraries for providing
literature and services to the entire community,'' she said. ``It
certainly is a collection that many libraries are developing.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't always that way. Kanellos still remembers the sting of
growing up Puerto Rican in New York, dismissively lumped together
with all other Hispanics as ``Spanish,'' finding nothing in his
school books that resembled his life at home.
</P>
<P>
   Limon, chair of the Chicano studies department at Loyola
Marymount University in Los Angeles, credits Kanellos with helping
to change that for today's Hispanic students.
</P>
<P>
   ``Up to 10 years ago, to teach a decent course in Hispanic
literature, you couldn't find good publications,'' she said. ``Arte
Publico jumped in to come up with fine publications in fiction and
nonfiction. ... In the world of U.S. Hispanic literature, I think
Dr. Kanellos has been an absolute pioneer.''
</P>
<P>
   Arte Publico was the first, but other small presses followed.
Marilyn Ross, executive director of the Small Publishers
Association of North America, said the movement gained momentum
several years ago, well after Arte Publico entered the field.
``They really were the trend-setters,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   As demand grows, Ross predicts that mainstream publishing
companies will increasingly go after Hispanic authors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything small presses do and do early and do well,
eventually the big presses say, `This is a bandwagon we need to
climb on,''' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Kanellos is more skeptical. Large publishing houses do publish
more Hispanic writing, he admitted, including Sandra Cisneros and
Ana Castillo, both of whom got their start at Arte Publico.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's only infinitesimally more,'' Kanellos said. ``You'd
be hard-pressed to count more than 10.''
</P>
<P>
   Competing with publishing's heavyweights _ companies including
Random House, Dutton and Putnam _ is difficult, especially as
mega-bookstores overtake the independent retailers who once made up
most of the nation's booksellers. The big publishing companies have
money to promote their books; Arte Publico doesn't.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Arte Publico has had its moments. Its big break came with
``Rain of Gold,'' the 1991 best-selling family saga by Victor
Villasenor.
</P>
<P>
   Villasenor had a contract and a $75,000 advance from a New York
publishing company, an enviable position by most standards. But the
publisher wanted changes that he couldn't accept, including
renaming the book and marketing it as fiction.
</P>
<P>
   Villasenor said no, and he bought back his contract. The book
became the first hardback published by Arte Publico, which had
previously worked exclusively in paperback because of the lower
production costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rain of Gold'' was a hit, and Arte Publico suddenly gained
notice.
</P>
<P>
   ``It meant we had a national presence in the national book
industry,'' Kanellos said, as well as giving them experience in
publishing a hardback book, marketing paperback rights and other
spin-off benefits.
</P>
<P>
   But writers also leave for larger publishers.
</P>
<P>
   Kanellos isn't worried about finding other talented writers, but
losing writers whom he has nurtured isn't easy.
</P>
<P>
   ``But that's the way it goes,'' he said. ``We really can't
compete with the commercial houses. They can afford a very large
advance, which we can't.''
</P>
<P>
   Limon insists that, despite her success _ awards, favorable
reviews, respectable sales _ she isn't tempted to leave.
</P>
<P>
   ``What attracts some writers to the larger houses is a big fat
advance,'' she said. ``But that's all it is, an advance. ... If the
books don't sell, a larger publishing house will just yank your
book and say, `See you later.'''
</P>
<P>
   Careful promotion can result in higher sales, allowing writers
to make more money in the long run, she said.
</P>
<P>
   She prefers to think long-term.
</P>
<P>
   So does Kanellos, who predicts that Hispanic literature will
gain readership in coming years. The trend actually started in the
1980s, as colleges began shifting Hispanic and other ethnic
literature into the core curriculum, making it required reading for
all students. Many books are also widely reviewed in general
readership newspapers, giving them broader exposure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expect we're going to have our Toni Morrisons,'' Kanellos
said, ``and Hispanic literature will be a staple, just like Jewish
literature became after the Second World War.''

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Who's burning out whom?
 &HT;    For release Nov. 29, 1998.
 &HT;    By Howard Kleinberg
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   News item: The University of Michigan's Institute for Social
Research has come to the conclusion that we are burning out our
children well before their time. The heavy schedules we impose upon
them, the study of 3,586 children under the age of 12 says, has
taken the fun out of being a kid.
</P>
<P>
   I'll go along with that. I'd also go along with a study that
showed the demands placed by those same kids on their parents are
burning out Mommy and Daddy well before their time as well. It
takes the fun out of being an adult.
</P>
<P>
   Bottom line: I think we're all to blame, Mom, Dad and Junior
alike.
</P>
<P>
   When I was an under-12 child (World War II era) there wasn't
much of a schedule. Go to school, come home. On Friday nights, go
over to Grandma's for one of those rubber chicken dinners. On
Saturdays, I played baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Not for any of the above engagements did either parent have to
escort me. Everything, of course, was in walking distance. No, I
didn't live in the country; yes, I did live in the city. So I
walked.
</P>
<P>
   As with the chicken and the egg, I do not know what started the
contemporary marathon-like lifestyles of kids and their parents.
Likely it was the post-war exodus to suburbia for so many of us.
Things got too far away.
</P>
<P>
   It is a fact that the nation's highways now are clogged with
minivans and SUVs driven mostly by weary mothers taking kids to and
from school, to and from dancing lessons, to and from baseball
practice, to and from Sunday school, to karate lessons and from
karate lessons, to and from Cub Scout meetings, to and from Brownie
meetings, to the store, from the store, and on and on.
</P>
<P>
   Seemingly, my fortyish daughter spends her entire weekday life
in that red minivan schlepping two young sons to appointments, many
of which the kids want to meet, some of which they do not.
</P>
<P>
   We did it all to ourselves. We did it to our kids, insisting
they do this and that. Our kids did it to us, insisting that they
want to do other this and that.
</P>
<P>
   For many of the kids of today, a game of baseball no longer is a
bunch of kids drifting together, choosing up sides and playing
until it gets dark. Now, it's an organized endeavor that requires
you to have to be at a specific park, on a specific team, at a
specific time (usually dinner time) and at a specific distance from
your house _ like a couple of miles. You can't walk it; mom usually
drives, plops down on a lawn chair, and waits out all the hits and
errors until such time as she has to commute again back to the
house, or perhaps the Scout meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, beginning with my generation, we did put pressure on our
kids to play ball, dance, stick with religious school, and even
take on dozens of other tasks that we did not have to do as a
child.
</P>
<P>
   But to say that we're burning them out before they are 12? What
about all those stories of the generations before, of kids having
to walk five miles in the snow to get to school, to walk down to
the grocer each and every day to pick up fresh butter and milk for
Mom, of working after school in the candy store, or getting up at 5
a.m. to deliver the morning paper _ not to mention those child
sweat shops?
</P>
<P>
   Didn't that burn out those kids? Well, apparently not. Our
parents survived, so did we.
</P>
<P>
   The pressures of 1990s lifestyles on children and adults alike
are rigorous, but so, in other ways, were those of our parents and
grandparents. The main difference between today and yesterday is
that today people are making studies of it.

 A Low-Tech Use for Free CDs By David Einstein 
c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle  &HT;     
<TEXT>
 &UR; Question: &LR;  Over the past couple of years, I've accumulated a lot of
free CDs that either arrived in the mail or came with PC magazines
_ you know, demo software, AOL connection software, stuff like
that. Rather than throw them out, I've taken to using them as cup
covers to keep my coffee hot. Now, though, I'm starting to think
that there may be chemicals in the CDs that could hurt me. Is there
anything hazardous about them?
<P>
   &UR; Answer: &LR;  CDs, both the music and software kind, start out as
piece of plastic coated with a thin, reflective layer of aluminum.
After a disc is replicated from a master disc, it's given a coat of
protective lacquer that's hardened using ultraviolet light. So, no,
there's no hazardous material involved, and you can continue to use
your novel cup covers.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks for the tip on what to do with unwanted CDs. By the way,
have you ever thought of using them as coasters? That way you could
have one below the cup and one on top.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you know if Syquest is ever coming back? They have a Sparq
One unit of mine that was to be replaced. I can't get a phone
number to call and their Web site is down. I certainly hope they
come back. I need that unit. Can you help me contact them?
</P>
<P>
   A: For readers who don't know, Syquest is a maker of removable
disk drives that has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. It's also in
the process of selling itself to an unnamed buyer. That means it
could make a comeback under new management. In the meantime, it's
offering limited technical support, which you can reach at (510)
226-5400. It seems to me like getting a defective drive replaced
would fall into the category of limited support. Especially if the
drive was under warranty. And they must certainly have products to
spare, since they couldn't sell enough of them to stay in business.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Every once in a while my computer will freeze up and tell me
that it's suffered a ``general protection fault.'' What is this, in
language I can understand, and is there anything I can do to
prevent it from happening?
</P>
<P>
   A: Windows uses general protection faults (GPFs) as a protective
measure to prevent programs from overlapping each other within the
main system memory (aka RAM). When an application you're running
tries to allocate space in memory that's unavailable, the result is
a GPF, halting the offending application in its tracks. Sometimes,
the application can be closed and then restarted, but sometimes
your entire system must be restarted.
</P>
<P>
   Everybody gets GPFs occasionally, so I wouldn't worry. If you
find that a particular application causes them, you might want to
remove and reinstall it. Also, you can reduce the risk of GPFs in
general by not having lots of applications open simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I use the Microsoft Office Shortcut Bar quite a bit to switch
between programs. The trouble is, I have to load it manually every
time I start Windows. Is there a way to have this toolbar
automatically loaded onto the desktop every time I boot up?
</P>
<P>
   A: Indeed there is. After loading the shortcut bar, click on the
left-most icon, then choose Exit from the menu that appears. This
will close the shortcut bar, but before that happens, you'll see a
dialog box giving you the option to have the shortcut start
automatically every time you start Windows.
</P>
<P>
   Q: My 78-year-old father is losing control of his hands and it's
difficult for him to type. Is speech-recognition software advanced
enough for this feature to really help him? He doesn't want to mess
around with spelling, punctuation, etc. Also, like most of us, he
is impatient and wants to be able to dictate normally, not one ...
word ... at ... a ... time. Could you recommend any solutions and
also let me know what, if any, upgrades I'd need for my computer to
make the software work?
</P>
<P>
   A: Until 1997, commercially available speech recognition
software used what was called ``discreet'' technology _ which
required users to pause between words. Now, however, several
affordable programs are available that use ``continuous speech''
recognition, letting you talk to the computer just as you would to
a person.
</P>
<P>
   The three leaders in the field are Naturally Speaking from
Dragon Systems, ViaVoice from IBM and VoiceXpress from Lernout &AMP;
Hauspie. These programs come in different versions aimed at
different kinds of users, from individuals at home to professionals
in corporations. A program that meets the needs of dad should cost
you less than $100.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to offering hands-free dictation, the newest
programs let you use voice commands to fix spelling and punctuation
errors, and generally do anything to the text that would normally
require a keyboard.

SKY SLEUTH: PROFESSOR RELIES ON CELESTIAL CLUES TO SOLVE MYSTERIES
OF ART, HISTORY 

</HEADLINE>

By TODD ACKERMAN 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN MARCOS, Texas _ In astronomy professor Donald Olson's
office, reproductions of van Gogh paintings and portraits of
military battles occupy more wall space than observatory posters or
solar system charts.
</P>
<P>
   The bookshelves are filled with collections of Ansel Adams
photographs, histories of the Civil War and World War II,
biographies of Abraham Lincoln, and the works of Shakespeare,
Chaucer and Dante.
</P>
<P>
   ``The contents of my office inspire me,'' says Olson, of
Southwest Texas State University. ``They put me in a mood conducive
to the kind of creative thinking I need for the research I do.''
</P>
<P>
   Olson is an academic sleuth, a Renaissance man who uses
astronomy to solve puzzles involving historical events and artistic
works, to fix dates and locations, to explain why the inexplicable
happened or how a genius operated.
</P>
<P>
   He determined that Lincoln did not fabricate evidence in a
celebrated murder trial, that Spanish explorer Cabeza de Vaca took
a route through Mexico rather than Central Texas, and where and
when Adams took his famous ``Moon and Half Dome'' photograph.
</P>
<P>
   Most recently, Olson was in the news for his theory that a
particular star mentioned in the opening scene of ``Hamlet'' was a
supernova that appeared in the constellation Cassiopeia in 1572.
</P>
<P>
   The supernova, a dramatic exploding star that burned for 16
months before fading from sight, was a source of profound
uneasiness among the general populace, which saw it as a sign of
things going wrong, a recurring theme of ``Hamlet.''
</P>
<P>
   Olson is working on research involving the Battle of Quebec,
regarded by some historians as Canada's Gettysburg. He and a few
students recently returned from a trip to the St. Lawrence River,
where they showed what little understanding historians have had of
the use that British Gen. James Wolfe made of moonlight and tides
in defeating the French.
</P>
<P>
   Olson's student assistance comes from undergraduates in his
``Astronomy in Art, History and Literature'' class, an honors
course usually composed of mostly liberal-arts and fine-arts
majors, not science majors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the experience those students get is invaluable,''
says Ron Brown, a Southwest Texas State dean, who suggested that
Olson teach the course. ``Where else can nonscientists conduct
on-site research and employ the scientific method?''
</P>
<P>
   Olson's interest in historical and artistic research dates back
to liberal-arts parties he attended in the late 1980s with his
wife, an English professor. At one, an expert on Chaucer questioned
Olson about some of the astronomical references in ``The Canterbury
Tales.'' At another, a history professor suggested he look into the
mysterious tide that led to the U.S. Marines' disastrous WWII
invasion of the Japanese-held Pacific atoll of Tarawa.
</P>
<P>
   Olson says at the time he ``had not a clue'' how to investigate
such matters. But through extensive historical research and
state-of-the-art astronomical computer programs that can re-create
constellations from before the time of Christ, he became good at
it.
</P>
<P>
   And Olson, always an eclectic, became particularly sensitive to
potential astronomical matters in photos, paintings, literature and
history. A decade later, he has published more than 60 academic
papers using astronomy to unearth new information about history and
art.
</P>
<P>
   The papers have made an impact. National newspapers, magazines
and television shows have carried stories on them. Recently,
authoritative books on Tarawa, Lincoln, Paul Revere and Ansel Adams
have referred to them. When Olson and his students pinpointed a
time when the moon would be in the same place above Yosemite's Half
Dome as it was in Adams' photo, Adams' daughter-in-law and more
than 40 photographers showed up.
</P>
<P>
   Olson says the research is also valuable because it shows
students that astronomy isn't just an ivory-tower pursuit.
</P>
<P>
   ``It shows the interconnectedness of knowledge,'' Olson says.
``And it helps me teach them that the universe contains beautiful
things, that it's comprehensible and that you can have a great time
studying it.''
</P>
<P>
   Olson considers Tarawa his most significant discovery. Olson
found that the reason the tide didn't rise as expected, causing the
landing craft to not clear a barrier reef and 1,000 Marines to be
killed as they waded ashore in chest-deep water, was an unforeseen
and rare lunar phase that stops tides from rising or falling
significantly. Such phases occurred only twice that year, and the
Marine landing had the misfortune to be staged on one of them.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the students' assignments have been tackled by Olson and
his research partner, Russell Doescher, a Southwest Texas State
physics professor. The students don't read the professors' results
until after they have reached their own conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   One such assignment involves Lincoln's defense of a man accused
of murder, a defense made famous by a Norman Rockwell painting of
Lincoln holding an almanac. The almanac showed that the moon was
setting and near the horizon at the time of the crime, discrediting
a witness who said he saw the murder by the light of a bright, full
moon high in the sky.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, questions have been raised about the
authenticity of the almanac because townspeople testified they
recalled seeing the moon high in the sky shortly before the murder.
But as Olson discovered _ and his students learn _ because of a
phenomenon that happens once every 19 years, the moon rose and set
much quicker than normal that night, making the townspeople's
recollections consistent with the almanac's notation and clearing
Lincoln of charges of dishonesty.
</P>
<P>
   Other assignments involved Vincent van Gogh's painting ``Moon
with Cypress and Star,'' in which students figure out that the
``stars'' were actually Mercury and Venus; and Paul Revere's ride,
which was preceded by Revere sneaking past a British warship in a
rowboat thanks to an unusually low, full moon that didn't
illuminate him.
</P>
<P>
   Each class, some students take part in one original research
project. In 1996, for instance, Olson and four students traveled to
northern Mexico and found pion nut trees that Cabeza de Vaca
described in his diary. Previous histories said the trees didn't
exist in Mexico and as a result accepted an alternate route through
Central Texas that the explorer's descriptions of the moon also
indicated.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Olson and students floated down the St. Lawrence
River to test their theories about the successful British attack on
French forces located on steep cliffs above the river. The
research, conducted in the middle of a night in conditions that
were exactly the same as the battle's June 1759 night, showed Wolfe
picked a date and time when the direction of the moonlight and the
turning of the tide allowed him to sneak past the French
undetected.
</P>
<P>
   Previously, historians disagreed on whether there was even a
moon that night.
</P>
<P>
   The students who made the trips say they won't forget them. They
also say Olson's class achieved its goal: It gave them a new
appreciation of the beauty of nature, of the power of the universe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you take the class, you stop seeing references to the
moon or stars in the same way,'' says Sandra Smith, who made the
trip to Mexico. ``You see them as part of a larger story.''

   ATLANTA _ Forget G.I. Joe.
</P>
<P>
   If it doesn't send cars roaring down the streets of Los Angeles
at speeds exceeding 200 miles an hour or help Crash Bandicoot
collect crystals to save the world, then it probably won't make
Alexander Diaz's Christmas list.
</P>
<P>
   ``He probably has 20 CD-ROMs at home for his computer,'' said
Alexander's dad, Rene Diaz, owner of Atlanta-based Diaz Wholesale &AMP;
Manufacturing Co. ``He's very in tune with what's cool. Nowadays,
almost everything is high tech, and he likes interactive toys.''
</P>
<P>
   For many kids like 6-year-old Alexander, what's cool is whatever
is hot in the latest video games and high-tech toys, which include
everything from Mattel's $99.99 My Interactive Pooh that can be
programmed to say a child's name and ``remember'' her birthday, to
Playmates' Amazing Amy, a wonder doll that can tell which clothes
she should have on based on the time of day and the foods she wants
to eat. (Please don't try to feed her a banana when she said she
was thirsty, and don't try to give her breakfast at dinner time.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Today's kids live in a time when Dad has a beeper and Mom has
a cellular phone,'' said Christopher Byrne, a toy industry expert
and contributing editor of Playthings Marketwatch. ``Technology is
part of their universe. Technology represents the first major
innovation in the toy industry since World War II.''
</P>
<P>
   The demand for technologically advanced toys is sweeping the
$22.6 billion toy industry _ so much so that once-popular offerings
like board games are experiencing a downturn. For the first six
months of 1998, sales of board games were down 15 percent from the
same period a year earlier, according to NPD Group, a research
firm. The pressure not to be defeated by a microchip is so intense
that toy makers even have CD-ROM versions of ``Candy Land,'' ``The
Game of Life'' and ``Monopoly,'' which also has a hand-held
version.
</P>
<P>
   Amazing Amy, for instance, has touch and resistance sensors and
a microprocessor that tells her when to use more than 10,000
phrases. She also has about 500k of computer memory.
</P>
<P>
   One of the hottest toys this season is the gremlin-like Furby, a
$29.99 virtual pet that responds to touch, light, other Furbies
and, best of all, has a regular sleep pattern.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Hampton, Furby's inventor, said he got the idea after
viewing digital versions of virtual pets.
</P>
<P>
   His virtual pet, created for Tiger Electronics, is soft, furry,
and speaks ``Furbish'' and English.
</P>
<P>
   Furby interacts with his environment through some simple rules
of programming Hampton calls ``emergent behavior.'' Furby's toy
technology is possible because the creature features internal
processing power just a bit above the old Apple II, Hampton said.
``Compared to a Pentium 333 it isn't very fast, but for a toy
selling for about $30 that's not bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Even that old staple Legos has gone high tech.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the company expects its $200 Mindstorms robotics
building system, which is sold in toy and electronic stores, to be
among the season's most popular offerings.
</P>
<P>
   Mindstorms (which has its own Web site at http://www
</P>
<P>
   .legomindstorms.com) was developed with cooperation from the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology and targets kids ages 11 and
up. Youngsters build robots using a microcomputer and Lego pieces.
The creations can move and carry objects.
</P>
<P>
   Other high-tech offerings this season include:
</P>
<P>
   _ Barbie Photo Designer Digital Camera (Mattel, $69.99). Girls
can use a digital camera to take photos and see them instantly on
their computers. Away from the computer, the camera stores up to
six photos at a time.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Totally Twister'' (Hasbro, $24.99). A new take on the old
``Twister'' game. Players can use this hand-held electronic game
that has a ``cool'' voice and soundtrack to twist, turn and touch
colored buttons.

`BABE' SEQUEL DARK BUT IMPRESSIVE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By LOUIS B. PARKS 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Halfway through the new sequel to ``Babe,'' our little pink hero
is being pursued through city streets by a vicious bull terrier
with murder in its eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Gathering all his will, the sheepherding pig suddenly turns on
his pursuer and asks a question: ``Why?''
</P>
<P>
   The question should be aimed at the makers of ``Babe: Pig in the
City.''
</P>
<P>
   Why? What were you thinking when you put so much love and
imagination and care into such a dark movie?
</P>
<P>
   The original ``Babe: The Gallant Pig'' left viewers charmed,
amused and delighted. ``Babe: Pig in the City'' may leave many
bedazzled but also depressed and befuddled.
</P>
<P>
   For grown-ups and older kids, this movie is quite impressive and
often fun, but it's also a downer for about half its length because
of the constant threat of death to the animals.
</P>
<P>
   Technically, ``Pig in the City'' far surpasses the original
``Babe.'' It is a breathtaking visual-effects triumph. The effects
are so good at making the absurdly impossible look casually natural
that most viewers may not even be impressed.
</P>
<P>
   In sheer imagination, ``Pig in the City'' is also good,
constantly surprising us with wonderful images and unexpected
events.
</P>
<P>
   But what starts out as charming and bright soon turns into a
surrealistic nightmare fantasy that is fascinating but also
disturbing.
</P>
<P>
   How this movie ever got a G rating is a mystery to me. There is
no sex, serious violence, bad language or drugs, but the atmosphere
and tone, something that should count with the ratings board, is
sometimes too oppressive for sensitive young children.
</P>
<P>
   The movie is like a Grimm's fairy tale before Disney took out
the grim. Such impressions are highly subjective of course, and you
_ or your children _ may not feel that way at all.
</P>
<P>
   The film may be a miscalculation, but it is beautifully done. It
begins with a storybook opening in which we learn that Babe, after
coming home a hero (from the first movie) accidentally causes great
injury to Farmer Hoggett (again played by James Cromwell, though
the role is much smaller this time).
</P>
<P>
   Bills begin to pile up, and in order to save the farm, Esme
Hoggett (Magda Szubanski), the farmer's wife, decides she must take
Babe to a big city where he can earn money performing at a fair.
Babe does not want to go, but the other animals tell him he must.
</P>
<P>
   Babe and Esme arrive in the big city (no country or city is
designated, though it looks a lot like Manhattan from the air.)
They immediately run into a series of mishaps, some of them
amusing. Broke and without a job, they finally end up in a
European-looking midcity hotel that secretly caters to animals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is he house-trained,'' the proprietor asks about Babe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, just like you and me,'' Esme says.
</P>
<P>
   Babe looks out the hotel window on the magnificent city and sees
the Eiffel Tower, the Sydney Opera House, the Statue of Liberty,
the Hollywood sign and other familiar landmarks. It's truly a
cosmopolitan metropolis.
</P>
<P>
   Babe and Esme are soon separated _ she's thrown in jail _ and
Babe finds himself and all the other animals of the house,
including different types of apes, dogs, cats and fish _ chased and
then captured by animal control. It is up to Babe to rescue one and
all from danger, which, be assured, he does.
</P>
<P>
   It is necessary to say that there ``is'' a happy ending, because
at times in this film we begin to doubt it, so borderline grim does
the movie become.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the following.
</P>
<P>
   A dog falls off a bridge and is left hanging by his back paw,
head in the water. He struggles and struggles. As the other animals
watch him drowning, one says ``don't look'' and turns away.
Finally, Babe comes to the rescue, but only after a long, painful
scene in which it seems the dog has drowned.
</P>
<P>
   In another scene, a handicapped dog with a wheelchair under his
hind legs is pulled by a truck through dangerous traffic, then
flies off and crashes, lying crumpled in a heap. He goes off into a
near-death experience _ a clever idea _ in which he has four
working legs. He survives, but only after we have been dragged
through an intensely sad moment.
</P>
<P>
   In yet another, a goldfish must struggle out of water, gasping
for life. Babe is stolen by a scary clown. And so on.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, ``Pig in the City's'' imaginative settings
and special effects aren't to be missed. There are times when the
images bring to mind such dark fantasies as Terry Gilliam's
``Brazil'' or the French ``The City of Lost Children,'' both
brilliantly designed films.
</P>
<P>
   What the animals say and do is sometimes wonderfully comic and
endearing. The Hoggett farm, seen all too briefly, is even more of
a pastoral fantasy than before.
</P>
<P>
   While many kids will have no problem with the movie, parents may
need to reassure small, sensitive children that everything will
work out fine, eventually. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   When Marc Andreessen and his fellow whiz kids from the
University of Illinois arrived in Silicon Valley in 1994 to found
Netscape Communications Corp., the brash new darling of the
digerati was the antithesis of America Online, which was widely
perceived as a shelter for technical ``newbies'' unprepared for the
brave new world of the Net.
</P>
<P>
   That the two are now on the brink of merging is a measure of how
much the divide between Internet sophisticates and mere
computer-using mortals has narrowed. This month's scheduled release
of the movie ``You've Got Mail,'' a romantic comedy starring Meg
Ryan, Tom Hanks and America Online, serves as final proof, if any
were needed, that cyberspace has gone mainstream.
</P>
<P>
   But however sound the business sense of such a combination might
be, the vestiges of the culture clash were reflected Monday in
currents of dark humor circulating through the Internet. And the
results could be anything but funny. It is a clash, say industry
analysts, that could color the future of the two companies if their
merger is completed as expected this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think AOL still has all the stigma that it always had, as
far as image goes,'' Jamie Zawinski, a Netscape founder who now
oversees part of the company's browser development, wrote in an
e-mail message to a reporter Monday afternoon. Alluding to his own
e-mail address, he wrote, ``My friends keep saying `jwz(AT)aol.com'
and then laughing uncontrollably.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the jibes making the electronic rounds were spoof lyrics
meant to be sung to the tune ``The Night They Drove Old Dixie
Down'': ``The lesson is you can't live long/ Unless you market to
the clueless throng/The night they sold old Netscape down/And all
the browsers went corporate ...''
</P>
<P>
   For their part, America Online partisans did not waste time
crowing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The battle is over. AOL wins,'' announced a posting to one
Internet news group. Such juvenile exchanges may be more of a
throwback to the elitist sparring of times past than a harbinger of
the future.
</P>
<P>
   But the very numbers that make the merger appealing also
underscore the extent to which the two most potent icons of the
Internet appeal to different audiences. According to the tracking
firm NetRatings, the users of the two companies' Web sites only
overlap by about 23 percent
</P>
<P>
   Still, the more pressing question for many who would like to see
Netscape's Navigator browser survive as a viable alternative to
Microsoft's competing Internet Explorer is what America Online will
do with the company's technology-development arm.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Netscape released the source code to its
browser, allowing anyone to submit changes and new features. While
the company had little to lose in the move, since it was also
announcing free distribution of its Navigator browser, the gesture
was greeted as a sign that Netscape's values were in the
traditional open spirit of the Internet, which the geek elite
believe is the best strategy for developing bug-free technology.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft Corp., in contrast, epitomizes the closed, proprietary
model of software development.
</P>
<P>
   James Love, director of the Washington-based Consumer Project on
Technology, a group affiliated with Ralph Nader, said his
organization would oppose the acquisition.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are interested in finding out how AOL will deal with
Netscape's plans for support of its browser as an open-source
product that can be freely distributed,'' Love said. ``This is a
deceptively deep issue from a policy point of view.''
</P>
<P>
   But America Online, based in Dulles, Va., perhaps most famous
for its ubiquitous disks that pop up in everything from computer
magazines to cereal boxes, has based its success on marketing
prowess, not cutting-edge technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``AOL has been a driven and focused consumer marketing
company,'' said Gene DeRose, president of Jupiter Communications, a
New York-based consulting company. ``But they've had an uneasy
relationship with technology. Steve Case has always said, `I don't
care where the technology is; we just have to be where the action
is.'''
</P>
<P>
   To those for whom Netscape continues to symbolize an alternative
to Microsoft, the merger will probably never be quite palatable.
</P>
<P>
   Said David Cassell, an America Online critic who runs the
AOLwatch mailing list: ``They're both huge corporations. Now it's
going to be like watching Godzilla fight Mothra and not being sure
who you're rooting for.''

 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   &HT;    Netscape, AOL deal could revolutionize InternetBy Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The proposed America Online/Netscape deal has the
potential to permanently change the face of the Internet industry
and create a company uniquely suited to compete against Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   AOL, the nation's largest online service, said it is negotiating
to buy Internet browser maker Netscape for about $4 billion in
stock to create a more powerful competitor with great reach across
the Internet industry. As part of the deal, AOL also is talking to
Sun Microsystems about a marketing and development agreement with
Netscape's electronic commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Netscape said AOL would exchange 0.45 share for each Netscape
share, valuing Netscape at $38.19, a 40 percent premium to its Nov.
13 close. Both stocks rose in Monday's trading signaling the
market's favorable outlook on the proposed deal. AOL traded most of
Monday in the high-$80s, making the deal worth between $3.8 billion
and $4 billion.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the deal, AOL also is talking to Sun Microsystems
Inc. about a marketing and development agreement involving Netscape
for electronic commerce and Internet devices.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say if the deal goes through, AOL becomes a direct
competitor with Microsoft's internet business. Microsoft's lawyers
in the U.S. Justice Department's antitrust lawsuit against the
software giant said the proposed undermines the government's case
because it vividly demonstrates competition is present in the
industry. But the government's lawyers and some experts disagree.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the AOL and Netscape combination were to reduce
Microsoft's market share of Internet browsing, ``(Microsoft still
has) the operating system,'' which is on 85 percent of all personal
computers said John Gardner, a policy analyst for Charles Schwab &AMP;
Co.'s Washington Research Group.
</P>
<P>
   If AOL, Netscape and Sun Microsystems Inc. produce a successful
operating system based on the Java programming language, Gardner
said, ``looking way forward . . . that would be real competition.''
Sun and Netscape have been trying to exploit Sun's Java ``computer
language'' technology to compete effectively with Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   With 14 million subscribers and 20 million users, AOL is the
only online service that still continues to grow. AOL has always
been far ahead of its competition when it comes to online contents,
chat and shopping. Microsoft's online service has about 1.85
million users, according to Jupiter Communications.
</P>
<P>
   However AOL has never spent much time refining its Internet
gateway. Unlike the rest of the service, it's internet area has
always been clunky and clumsy, a far cry from its hallmark
intuitive interface.
</P>
<P>
   AOL now uses Microsoft's Internet Explorer browser. As part of a
deal struck with Microsoft to use its browser, the blue and white
AOL icon pops up on the Microsoft desk when users launch the
Windows operating system. Users also have the option to download
the Netscape browser by using the key word Netscape.
</P>
<P>
   While portal wars have heated up around it, AOL has never
appeared to be interested becoming a ``portal player'' even though
the Web site AOL.com is considered a portal by Web measurement firm
Media Metrix. AOL frequently turns up at the top of Media Metrix's
list of most viewed Web sites along with Yahoo. In figures released
by Media Metrix Monday, Yahoo, AOL and Microsoft ranked as the top
three sites on the Web. Netscape's portal, Netcenter, was fifth. A
portal is a Website that provides a variety of services including
Web searching, news, white and yellow pages directories, free
e-mail, and links to other sites.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Levy, founder of Atlanta-based Web measurement firm
Relevant Knowledge, now vice chairman of Media Metrix confirms that
the Web reach of an AOL/Netscape merger would be incredible.
``Seventy per cent of people online go to at AOL or Netscape at
least once in the course of a month, and that's a huge number.'' He
says a combined AOL/Netscape portal site would ``be by far the
largest consolidated domain on the Internet in our rankings. It
would push them ahead of Yahoo and make them the clear number
one.''
</P>
<P>
   Chris Charron of Forrester Research says both AOL and Netscape
would benefit from the merger. ``AOL gets additional traffic,
advertising dollars and they get a browser,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Charron says AOL is essentially buying Netscape for its browser
and the Netcenter portal site, and its e-commerce software.
</P>
<P>
   In its current incarnation, AOL is both an access provider as
well as a media company. ``They've been the only ones to create a
company that has both access and content,'' Charron says. The
acquisition of Netscape will bring in additional advertising
eyeballs (some 35 million people have Netcenter, Netscape's start
page as their default homepage) as well as additional transaction
revenue.
</P>
<P>
   The Netscape deal will also accelerate AOL's evolution into a
content player rather than an access provider. It would gradually
rely less on its subscription base as its main source of revenue.
</P>
<P>
   As for Netscape, Charron says the potential deal offers its
portal site, Netcenter, a strong media partner and an international
presence.
</P>
<P>
   ``This may be a graceful exit strategy for Netscape,'' Charron
says. ``They were in two businesses, software and media. They are
very different and can be difficult to succeed in for any one
company. Netscape was torn a little bit between both of those
business. This this gives them the opportunity to join with AOL, a
very strong media partner with very deep pockets. ''
</P>
<P>
   Through the deal Sun Microsystems Inc. would take control of
Netscape's business-level ``server'' software and, in return, AOL
would buy Sun's powerful workstation computers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sun is dying to get into the software business, so owning
Netscape's software business would increase their ability to get
into that market,'' said Stan Dohlberg, a consultant at Forrester
Research Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Sun Microsystems would also gain a platform to foster the
implementation of its Java software which works on any computer.
</P>
<P>
   Industry observers say the potential deal is a pre-emptive
strike against the Microsoft Network which is planning its fourth
relaunch. AOL founder Steve Case is likely hoping the Netscape deal
will help build defenses against expected onslaughts from the
retooled Microsoft Network.
</P>
<P>
   A concern that is well placed, says Mark Mooradian, senior
analyst at Jupiter Communications. `` You always have to be worried
with Microsoft. Anybody with that much cash trying to get into your
space is cause for concern. You've got to be worried.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is at least the fourth go-round for MSN at launching a
commercial online service and they are continuing to get better at
it. Is (the AOL/Netscape deal) a play against that? Yes. Is AOL
worried about that? Yes. I think that kind of thing is at the
forefront of their minds.''
</P>
<P>
   MSN's new model competes more with Yahoo and AOL's Web site than
with the online service, Mooradian says but adds that the move to
buy Netcenter is an effort to capture more of the Web audience.''
</P>
<P>
   Forrester's Charron says that should the deal go through it
would be a good move for both companies. `` It really will pose a
threat to Microsoft and Yahoo,'' he says. ``MSN is not yet a
portal, they are in the process of becoming a portal, but they have
too many assets to ignore. MSN will be a formidable competitor in
the portal wars, and Yahoo is left without a browser or a browser
partner,'' Charron says. ``But their position is that they probably
don't need one. I think the deal would strengthen AOL and is
further evidence of the consolidation we are going to see in this
space. ``

 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   &HT;    Column: Simplicity AOL's key to success
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   America Online was way too simple for me, right from the start.
</P>
<P>
   After all, I knew all sorts of esoteric computer commands back
in those wonderful days of DOS when real geeks knew that the
computer mouse was a passing fancy.
</P>
<P>
   And to me, AOL was also a flash in the pan, just like the mouse,
soon to be replaced by the Internet. At best it served as training
wheels for those new to the online world _ a way of easing their
toes into the waters of cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   If you're a longtime reader of my column, maybe you remember my
predicting the demise of AOL about four years ago. Predicting the
future has always been easy for me because I'm almost never right.
</P>
<P>
   The lesson here is that the only sure-fire predictions about
technology are that the experts are usually wrong. Instead of going
away, AOL has become the world's most popular way of logging onto
the Internet. Instead of becoming a footnote in the history of
cyberspace, it is rapidly becoming an important part of the future.
</P>
<P>
   I can't blame my cloudy crystal ball on lack of knowledge. Way
back in the early days of America Online it was a tiny and crude
bulletin board system for Macintosh computer users. I helped beta
test the software that opened it up to users of IBM-compatible
computers.
</P>
<P>
   The irony in my predictions that AOL was headed for the junk
heap is that the very thing that bugged me about it proved to be a
magnificent virtue, not a fatal flaw. The simplicity of the
service, the point and click methods of navigating, the ease with
which new users could send e-mail and exchange messages in forums,
was the magic bullet that AOL would use to grow into the world's
most popular way of accessing the Internet. And now, like most
experts, my hindsight is 20-20 and I can explain why AOL succeeded.
</P>
<P>
   The best way to understand the importance of the simplicity of
AOL is to take a look at one of the most complicated networking
systems in your home. I'm talking about the telephone network. Long
before there was an Internet, or even the predecessor to the Net _
ARPANET _ the telephone network was routinely able to connect
humans from Des Moines to Hamburg to Rio.
</P>
<P>
   Go find the instruction manual for your telephone. Of course, it
doesn't exist. And yet you can simply push a few buttons and
navigate a network much bigger and more complex than the Internet.
That's the virtue of the telephone that sits on your desk. It's the
way you navigate this network _ no instructions needed. It makes a
complex technology easy to use and accessible.
</P>
<P>
   You'll hear a bunch of explanations for why AOL survived where
others failed and the reasons for its ability to grow from a tiny
service for Macintosh computers into a company big enough to
challenge Microsoft and to dicker in the billions to buy Netscape.
</P>
<P>
   But to me, none of them is as important or meaningful as the
fact that AOL was and has been way too simple for us computer geeks
to use. Instead, it was aimed at the ordinary person who wanted to
use technology without being a technologist.

TIPS ON BUYING A COMPUTER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID HOYE   c.1998 The Arizona Republic   UNDATED - Ready or
not, here come the holidays!
<TEXT>
<P>
   For many people, this year's holiday season will involve buying
a new desktop computer for home use.
</P>
<P>
   If you ask me, there's never been a better time to take the
computing plunge. Today's models offer an exciting array of
features, whether you're in the market for a sub-$1,000 machine or
a top-of-the-line, bleeding-edge technology screamer!
</P>
<P>
   Trouble is, buying a new home computer can be tricky. And nobody
wants to mess up when $1,000 or more is on the line.
</P>
<P>
   So, here are some tips, suggestions and rules of thumb you might
want to review before heading out to spend your hard-earned money:
</P>
<P>
   - Think about how you would use a computer. Surfing the Internet
doesn't require a powerful machine, but graphics work or playing
the latest 3D games need all the power you can afford. Talk with
friends who have computers. Check software stores for titles you
might want to use, and look for the ``minimum requirements'' listed
on the box.
</P>
<P>
   - PC or Macintosh? This is something you'll need to decide for
yourself. Most of the world uses PCs running Windows 95 or Windows
98. But many students, artists and others swear by the ease of use
offered by the Macintosh. Go with your gut on this one.
</P>
<P>
   - Set yourself a budget. This will help keep you from being
talked into buying something you don't need. A good beginning
system shouldn't cost more than $1,250, including monitor. In fact,
many decent systems cost hundreds of dollars less. (See the
following tip.) Midrange systems cost between $1,250 and $2,000.
The best systems run from $2,000 to $3,000.
</P>
<P>
   - Looking to buy the cheapest computer you can find? OK, but
make sure you know what you're getting. I've seen some systems
advertised for less than $400, but they don't come with monitors,
CD-ROMs, modems or even operating systems! Here's something to look
for: IBM has just announced the Aptiva D1N, a system with a
suggested retail price of $599. It doesn't come with a monitor, but
it sounds like a decent beginning computer. Learn more at
www.pc.ibm.com/us/aptiva /aptivad1n.html (that's an underscore in
front of `d1n').
</P>
<P>
   - Educate yourself. I'm not suggesting you take a college
course. But you'd be surprised how much you can pick up by spending
a couple weeks reading through some computer magazines or talking
with people who use computers.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, start scanning computer ads. Soon, the lingo won't
sound so weird, and you'll get an idea of the things most computers
contain and how much similar systems cost.
</P>
<P>
   Ask friends, relatives and co-workers what kinds of computers
they have at home. Ask them where they bought their machines, what
brand they own and whether they'd do anything differently the next
time.
</P>
<P>
   Visit a couple of computer stores just to try out their
computers on display. This will give you an idea of how the models
vary, what different keyboards feel like and whether you can do
without that expensive 17-inch monitor.
</P>
<P>
   Don't expect to get your education from the salesman on duty.
They won't have the time to answer your questions, and, if they do,
they probably won't give you the best answers.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, if you don't have time to educate yourself, at least
find a computer-savvy friend who can help you choose the right
computer.
</P>
<P>
   - Be brave. No matter where you end up buying, chances are you
will encounter at least one condescending salesman. I don't know
why. But you should expect it.
</P>
<P>
   This person will try hard to make you feel stupid and probably
will act as though he or she doesn't have time for you unless
you're ready to plunk down your Visa card, buy a computer and
quickly leave the store.
</P>
<P>
   Remain calm. Know that this happens to everybody, regardless of
how much _ or how little _ they know about computers. Be prepared
to turn around and walk out (or hang up the phone) if a salesman
refuses to treat you properly.
</P>
<P>
   - Use common sense. Don't expect a department store that sells
sofas and washing machines to offer a wide variety of computers or
have a sales staff that knows much about them. The best sources of
computers and software are always those places that do nothing else
but sell computers and software.
</P>
<P>
   - Computers are like houses _ you should buy the biggest you can
afford. Believe me, you will grow into every nook and cranny your
computer offers. It's better to have a little extra to begin with
than to wish you had a better computer just six months down the
road.
</P>
<P>
   - If you ask me, beginners do best buying a name-brand computer
from a major retail store, such as CompUSA, or from a major
mail-order outlet, such as Gateway or Dell.
</P>
<P>
   - Technical support, service and reliability are everything,
because chances are something will go wrong. Make sure you can get
help seven days a week, 24-hours a day. The November issue of ``PC
World'' magazine rated Dell, IBM, Micron, Quantex, CyberMax and
Sony as tops. Compaq, Gateway, Hewlett-Packard and NEC were
average. AST and Packard Bell were rated poor. Acer was dubbed
`unacceptable.'
</P>
<P>
   - Call me short-sighted, but I don't think DVD drives and
television tuner cards are worth the money. I just don't see a big
need for such capability _ at least not yet. If you buy a $3,000
computer to watch DVD movies, you have way too much disposable
income. Most buyers would be better off putting the money into a
bigger monitor or a good printer or scanner.
</P>
<P>
   - Speaking of which: No home system is worth much without a good
printer. And if you have kids or you plan any kind of graphics
work, you should invest in a good flatbed scanner. These days, you
should be able to find a quality color inkjet printer for $300 or
less. A decent scanner will cost about $125.
</P>
<P>
   - Make sure that computer you are buying is NEW! This sounds
obvious, but some retail outlets have been known to repackage used
equipment and resell it as new. They are very good with the
shrink-wrap machine, so it's not always easy to spot used stuff. If
it's refurbished, it should be marked as such, and should not cost
as much as new.
</P>
<P>
   - Fourteen-inch monitors are long gone, leaving 15-inchers the
standard size with preconfigured systems. But if you can afford it,
get yourself a 17-inch monitor. You will enjoy computing more,
because you'll be able to see more at once, use larger fonts (if
you need to) and many other things. The 17-inchers are everywhere
these days, and for good reason.
</P>
<P>
   - Do what you want, but if it was up to me, you'd never buy one
of those extended warranties. They are pure profit for the
retailer. Most brand-name machines come with their own warranties,
which last from one to three years. Some even come with on-site
repair service. If it ain't broke after three years, it'll be
outdated. So tell the salesman ``NO'' when the subject of an
extended warranty comes up.
</P>
<P>
   - Be polite, but refuse when your brother or his friend or the
guy down the street offers to build you a new system ``real
cheap.'' So he saves you money? Will he be around every time you
have a question? Will he guarantee his work? What software will he
provide? And if serious problems arise you'll want to demand
immediate service, not worry that you'll offend some relative or
damage a friendship.
</P>
<P>
   - If you buy a new computer and it goes south within the first
30 days, TAKE IT BACK. Demand a full refund or a new system. If you
let them start fiddling with bits and pieces of a faulty system,
you are asking for trouble. And some companies will even force you
to accept refurbished equipment to complete the repairs. Don't even
go there!

FORMER PENAL COLONY SHEDS DEADLY REPUTATION TO BECOME TOURIST
HAUNT 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN OTIS 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEVIL'S ISLANDS, French Guiana _ Henri Charriere, better-known
as Papillon, spent many of his days at the notorious penal colony
here pacing back and forth in his solitary-confinement cell,
swallowing cockroaches to survive and dreaming of escape.
</P>
<P>
   The way Charriere tells it, he eventually floated to freedom
through shark-infested waters on a raft made of coconut shells.
</P>
<P>
   Today, visitors to the Devil's Islands _ three palm-lined
volcanic keys seven miles off the Atlantic coast of French Guiana
in South America _ have it a lot easier.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, forced labor is out. Tourists can wander freely
through the guard quarters, solitary-confinement cells and
graveyards of the old prison camp. The only permanent inhabitants
are pigs, roosters, squirrel monkeys and palm rats that wander
among the mango and guava trees.
</P>
<P>
   Meager prisoner's rations have given way to fine French cuisine
served in the former warden's hall. The bar, once decorated with
frescoes painted by inmates, serves ``convict's punch'' at happy
hour. Accommodations are in the remodeled guards' bungalows.
</P>
<P>
   And escape no longer requires a homemade raft, just a ticket for
the passenger ferry back to the mainland.
</P>
<P>
   A sort of tropical Alcatraz, the Devil's Islands are both
fascinating and horrifying. The penal colony inspired such
Hollywood films as ``Papillon, Passage to Marseille'' and
``Condemned to Devil's Island.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The objective was not to exterminate the prisoners, but many
of them died from neglect or due to the incompetence (of prison
officials),'' said Alexander Miles, who has written a book about
the Devil's Islands. ``It was nothing to be proud of.''
</P>
<P>
   From the mainland of French Guiana, getting to the islands
requires a 90-minute ferry ride from the coastal town of Kourou.
Royal Island, larger and better maintained than St. Joseph's Island
and Devil's Island, is the first stop. A small, whitewashed museum
with an array of enlarged black-and-white photographs and drawings
outlines the islands' history.
</P>
<P>
   Despite their sinister reputation, the Devil's Islands were a
lifeline for newly arrived settlers in French Guiana in the 1700s.
Cooled by trade winds, they provided safe haven and a healthier
climate at a time when malaria and other tropical diseases were
spreading on the mainland. Their original name was Les les du Salut
_ the Salvation Islands. (Some guidebooks, including Lonely
Planet's comprehensive ``South America'' reference, still use this
designation.)
</P>
<P>
   When the colonial economy collapsed after the abolition of
slavery in 1848, France opted to develop and people French Guiana
with convicts ready to pay their debt to society through work. The
inspiration came from England, which had colonized Australia with
prisoners at the end of the 18th century.
</P>
<P>
   Thus a series of work camps were built on the Devil's Islands
and on the mainland. But as a development project, the penal colony
failed miserably.
</P>
<P>
   During one 20-year stretch, for example, convict road-building
crews managed to construct just 15 miles of highway.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't all their fault. Prisoners were ravaged by epidemics
and weakened by the workload, the equatorial heat, malnutrition and
poor hygiene. Of the 8,000 prisoners sent to French Guiana between
1852 and 1856, just 3,600 survived.
</P>
<P>
   The worst conditions were on St. Joseph's Island, site of the
solitary-confinement cells. Although the iron bars are rusty and
the cells are infested with vines and moss, they remain a chilling
sight. Barred ceilings allowed guards to keep a constant watch on
the prisoners, who were forbidden to make the slightest sound.
</P>
<P>
   Anthelme Girier, ringleader of an inmate uprising in 1894, began
a hunger strike to protest.
</P>
<P>
   ``To escape from your torture, I resolved to starve to death,''
Girier wrote. ``This will give you an idea of how much we have had
to suffer. ... I beg you to remove my chains and let me die in
peace next to my bread rations.''
</P>
<P>
   Those with sentences of more than eight years were required to
live in exile in French Guiana for a period equal to their
sentences, a cruel system known as ``doublage.'' The policy kept
such unwanteds from returning to the mother country and helped to
maintain the population of French Guiana, which is now an overseas
department of France.
</P>
<P>
   More than anything, the islands were a convenient, far-off place
for France to stash troublesome political prisoners, people
suffering from leprosy and other undesirables.
</P>
<P>
   The most famous was Alfred Dreyfus, a French Army colonel who
was accused of selling military secrets to the Germans and sent to
Devil's Island, the smallest of the three keys, in 1895.
</P>
<P>
   His deportation ignited a polemic debate in Paris. French
authorities were so concerned about a possible escape or rescue
attempt that they built a watchtower and a 9-foot-high wall around
his hut. Dreyfus was released in 1899 after the publication of a
Emile Zola's ``J'accuse,'' a lengthy essay defending Dreyfus.
</P>
<P>
   Dreyfus' bench, a rock formation where he meditated, still sits
on the north end of the island. But because of treacherous ocean
currents and the lack of a suitable landing site for boats, the
French government has banned travel to this island.
</P>
<P>
   From all three islands, escape was nearly impossible. Those who
tried are thought to have drowned or been eaten by sharks. And
despite Charriere's dramatic getaway story in ``Papillon,'' some
historians claim that he actually fled from a prison camp in the
capital city of Cayenne on the mainland _ a much easier task.
</P>
<P>
   The only documented escape was pulled off by Charles de Rudio,
who was dispatched to the islands for his part in an assassination
attempt against Emperor Napoleon III. De Rudio eventually made his
way to the United States, where he enlisted in the Army and was one
of the few survivors of the Battle of the Little Bighorn.
</P>
<P>
   More than 67,000 prisoners were sent to the penal colony before
it was closed in 1946 in response to international protests over
the harsh conditions. But its legacy lives on. Many freed
prisoners, with nowhere to go, found jobs on the mainland as
servants, carpenters, gardeners and bricklayers.
</P>
<P>
   They weren't always welcome. Pierre Servini, a historian who
lives in Cayenne, says that as a boy he used to shoot his slingshot
at vagabond ex-cons sleeping in the streets. ``They were like
dogs,'' Servini said.
</P>
<P>
   Gradually the freed prisoners blended into society. Today a
number of residents are relatives of ex-cons, including the mayor
of St.-Laurent-du-Maroni, a colonial town on the border with
Suriname where prisoners just off the boat from France were
registered.
</P>
<P>
   ``Times have changed,'' said Robert Rivial, who runs a hotel in
St.-Laurent-du-Maroni. ``Now people are proud of their heritage.
They boast about it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Many were employed as farm help or else they got married,''
said Lithaw Flore, a retired accountant and town council member.
</P>
<P>
   The penal-colony ruins are especially well-preserved in
St.-Laurent-du-Maroni, and visitors can lie down on the cement bed
in Cell 47, Charriere's initial way station before he was sent to
the islands. In an abandoned shed under a plastic tarp lies a
disassembled guillotine that was used to execute prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   The town also is home to the last survivor of the penal colony,
98-year-old Mauhamed Bachir.
</P>
<P>
   A Moroccan who served a 20-year sentence resulting from a
``family dispute'' that he doesn't want to explain, Bachir did his
time, then opened a small grocery store. He is partially deaf,
nearly blind, wears thick glasses and has just one tooth, making
conversation nearly impossible.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mauhamed was a very generous person. He had his corner store.
If you ever needed something, he would give you four or five
cigarettes. He was a good man,'' says one of Bachir's relatives,
who wouldn't give his name.
</P>
<P>
   For all the horrors of the penal colony, many people in French
Guiana look back with fondness. ``During the time of the penal
colony, St.-Laurent was alive. But when it closed, everyone shut
their shops and left,'' Flore said. ``It was the end.''
</P>
<P>
   But on the Devil's Islands, the penal colony has given way to
tourism and technology.
</P>
<P>
   Royal Island houses a cinetheodolite for infrared tracking of
satellite-laden rockets that are launched every month from the
European Space Agency complex near Kourou. And every day, hundreds
of visitors descend on the islands to explore the old prison and
pay homage to Papillon.

 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   &HT;    Online shopping this holiday season is projected to double from
1997, and the sky's the limit.
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Let your fingers do the walking this holiday season. Why not
join the millions of shoppers doing their holiday shopping online?
Remember, in cyberspace there are no crowds, no lines, you can shop
at 4 in the morning or 11 at night, and you never have to worry
about finding a place to park.
</P>
<P>
   Electronic commerce _ known to most consumers as online shopping
_ is rapidly becoming a booming business. Whether you're looking
for books, blue jeans, CDs or chocolates, there's a retailer online
to take your order, ring up the purchase and drop the goods at your
door.
</P>
<P>
   And you'll never have to pick up the telephone or see the inside
of a mall.
</P>
<P>
   In the past few years, online shopping has grown to meet the
needs of Web surfers who increasingly see the Internet as a
utility. The same users who turn to the Web for quick doses of
breaking news or financial information have come to see it as a
place to shop quickly. Purchasing a book on a site like Amazon.com
takes about 10 minutes or less for returning shoppers.
</P>
<P>
   Some Web sites offer ``one click ordering'' that lets you buy an
item, pay for it and log off in a matter of minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Maria Latour Kadison, a senior online research analyst with
Forrester Research who tracks online retailing trends, says a
handful of savvy retailers were responsible for moving Web shopping
into the mainstream. ``It took the minds of people like Jeff Bezos
at Amazon (http://
</P>
<P>
   www.amazon.com), Michael Dell at Dell Computer
(http://www.dell.com) and the two guys who started CDnow
(http://www.cdnow.com) (brothers Jason and Matthew Olim) to see the
Web is much more than just an information conduit.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the latest report from Jupiter Communications,
shoppers are expected to spend $2.3 billion online during the 1998
holiday shopping season, more than double the $1.1 billion spent in
1997. However, Jupiter also points out only 16 percent of online
purchases during this period are gift-related, leaving a largely
untapped revenue stream.
</P>
<P>
   ``Online retailing got off to a very slow start because it was
these anonymous retailers (online-only stores unfamiliar to
consumers) trying to create a market. But when traditional
marketers like Tower Records (http://www.towerrecords.com), J. Crew
(http://www.jcrew.com) and Barnes &AMP; Noble (http://www
</P>
<P>
   .barnesandnoble.com) saw the value and the volume that could be
generated from online sales, it gave the industry a huge boost
forward,'' says Kadison.
</P>
<P>
   ``Amazon was the leader,'' she says, ``and still is in terms of
online market share. But as access explodes in the next several
years and as all these newbies come online, they are going to look
for brands they know in their offline world.''
</P>
<P>
   Kadison predicts Amazon, CDnow/N2K and other Web-only retailers
will have to work twice as hard to establish their brands offline
as traditional names set up shop on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Kadison says Web retailing has introduced a need for increased
speed and convenience. Surfers no longer want to wait for long
downloads or fumble through badly designed Web sites. They expect
slick, easy-to-use sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``The utility that consumers are finding is convenience,'' she
says. ``That's the most important factor to online consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   Nicole Vanderbilt, group director of Jupiter's digital commerce
group, says as the online shopping market matures, retailers will
shift their strategy from acquiring shoppers to building online
loyalties.
</P>
<P>
   She says the gift-giving season is an excellent time to foster
loyalty.
</P>
<P>
   ``Online retailers have been successful in capturing dollars
consumers spend on themselves,'' she says. ``But they have been
unsuccessful in getting those same customers to spend gift dollars
online.'' She thinks services such as gift registries and other
holiday services such as gift wrapping might do the trick.
</P>
<P>
   ``The winners from the losers online will be separated by
excellent technology backing up your brand strategy,'' Kadison
says. ``The top three things shoppers want are convenience, ease of
research and competitive prices. As more and more familiar
retailers such as Land's End and Nordstrom come online, it becomes
more convenient for users, and the security fears go down because
of the reputations of these established brands.''
</P>
<P>
   But even though the Web is a way to do almost anything quickly
and efficiently, it's still a lot of fun.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the Web is fun and utilitarian,'' says Kadison. ``You
can do your grocery shopping online and log off right away. But you
can also play games and do other things. It's absolutely both.
That's why the Internet is going to become such a huge part of our
lives in the next century, because it serves such a variety of
needs.

 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   &HT;    E-shopping's easy, can be fun
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   So you've seen the packed parking lots at the mall, you're sick
of staring at the piles of catalogs cluttering your kitchen table
and you've decided that electronic shopping is the only way to go.
Trouble is, you've never shopped online before. Fear not first-time
shoppers: If e-shopping was hard or scary, nobody would do it and
you wouldn't be able to order Gap sweat shirts online.
</P>
<P>
   You don't need much to hop on the e-shopping bandwagon, besides
a computer, a modem and an Internet browser.
</P>
<P>
   It's always smart to do a little Web comparison shopping to make
sure you're getting the best value for your money. Sites such as
Junglee (http://www.junglee.com) and BottomDollar
(http://www.bottomdollar.com) will be able to tell you which Web
shops are selling the object of your desire at the lowest price.
Many portal sites such as HotBot (http://www.hotbot.com) or Yahoo
(http://www.yahoo.com) and Snap (http://www.snap.com) also offer
bargain finders for various products. Also be on the lookout for
free shipping, gift wrapping and other incentives to give your
business to one site instead of another. For example, music store
CDNow (http://www.cdnow.com) recently had an online trivia contest
with $10 off any purchase as a prize. Also be sure to check
carefully the shipping time the Web site promises. While experience
shows that most ship dates are realistic, many sites may have
cutoff dates for holiday deliveries, so as the saying goes, shop
early and often.
</P>
<P>
   Most shopping Web sites, such as Amazon.com have made the
purchasing process fairly intuitive. There might be something to
click along the lines of ``Add to my shopping cart'' or more
bluntly ``buy this now.'' Don't panic if you change your mind,
you'll have several chances to take items out of your virtual
shopping basket. You can also cancel your order at any time in the
ordering process, but once you click ``submit'' you've placed your
order, so make sure you really want something before sending
anything off into cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   Once you've ordered your items, remember to keep copies of all
correspondence. Most of it will be via e-mail, so keep copies or
print out the information and store it in a safe place. This will
give you confirmation numbers and will also let you know when to
expect your item.
</P>
<P>
   Most online shopping sites will stay in close contact with you
via e-mail, letting you know they've received your order and
letting you know when it's shipped. They also let you know how to
contact them if you have a problem. However, if you shop wisely,
you'll see online shopping is not only easy, but fun.

 &HT;    
 By MIKE McMANUS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    
 &HT;    In a thoughtful pastoral letter published by his diocesan
newspaper, Catholic Bishop Raymond Lucker of New Ulm, Minn., has
called for a change in the church law of priestly celibacy, which
would create ''the option of married clergy.''
 &HT;    ''Nothing causes me greater concern than the shortage of
priests,'' he writes. In his largely rural diocese, there were 71
priests in 1988. That number fell to 53 by 1997 to serve 83
parishes. Some priests were asked to serve two or three parishes.
 &HT;    Bishop Lucker pioneered another answer by appointing 20 pastoral
administrators, mostly nuns. But they can not celebrate Mass, hear
confessions, etc.
 &HT;    Many lay people have asked Lucker, ''Why can't we have married
priests?'' His response: ''The law of celibacy is a church law
which can be changed. It is not something that came to us from the
revelation of God or from the command of Jesus.
 &HT;    ``Celibacy has been a universal rule in the Western church only
since the 11th century,'' Lucker points out. ``As we all know,
Peter, the head of the Apostles and leader of the Church of Rome,
was married. The Catholic Church has married priests in the Eastern
Rite,'' such as the Ukrainian Catholic Church.
 &HT;    Also, 200 former Episcopalian priests have converted to
Catholicism, and brought their wives and children.
 &HT;    ''In view of the pressing shortage of the clergy ... would it
not be better to change the law of celibacy? I believe that we
ought to change the law and have the option of married clergy,''
Lucker wrote. ''But no individual bishop can change the law. There
would have to be a modification of the law of the universal
church.''
 &HT;    Under Pope John Paul II, that will not happen. He has made it
clear that the subject is closed, and he has told bishops they are
not to speak about the possibility of change, though a few have
done so, such as Milwaukee Archbishop Rembert Weakland.
 &HT;    However, the pressure for change is growing. In Austria last
month, a national assembly of lay leaders appointed by the bishops
debated church policies and then put them to a vote -- the first
such assembly in the world.
 &HT;    More than 75 percent of delegates endorsed ordination for
married men, freedom for couples to choose which method of birth
control to use, allowing divorced and remarried Catholics the right
to receive the sacraments, the right of parish councils to make
decisions without the priest's blessing, and a greater local role
in selecting bishops.
 &HT;    The Austrian bishops were pressured to take this step by a lay
movement called ''We Are Church,'' which garnered a half million
signatures demanding such reforms.
 &HT;    The closest parallel in America is a group, ''Call to Action,''
19,000 lay Catholic who have called for similar reforms. Its
president, Linda Pieczynski, said, ''We are very supportive of
Bishop Lucker's call for an end to mandatory celibacy, which we
have called for since 1991.'' However, Call to Action has not even
considered organizing something like Austria's national assembly.
 &HT;    Lucker's courageous stand has received some press coverage. Last
week, when he attended the National Catholic Conference of Bishops,
he had dinner with 15 bishops, all of whom were in favor of
allowing priests to marry. Every bishop who spoke to him was
supportive, he said.
 &HT;    But when I asked some bishops for their reactions, they were
either noncommittal or were supportive, but did not want me to use
their name. The pope has intimidated them.
 &HT;    There is a darker side of this picture. A careful study of 1,500
priests by A.W. Richard Sipe, who was ordained as a Catholic priest
but later left to marry and to become a psychotherapist, came to a
shocking conclusion: ''At any one time no better than 50 percent of
priests are practicing celibacy. About 25 percent are
heterosexually active, 20 percent are homosexually active and 6
percent are sexually involved with minors.''
 &HT;    Details of his study can be found in Sipe's books, such as
''Sex, Priests and Power: Anatomy of a Crisis.''
 &HT;    Those numbers may seem impossibly high. But 23,000 priests have
left the priesthood to marry. And more than 1,000 priests have
confessed that they have molested children, including at least one
sitting bishop. The church has had to pay hundreds of millions of
dollars in damages.
 &HT;    The scandal of priests who are not practicing celibacy combined
with the acute shortage of priests and their exhaustion in trying
to serve 10 times as many parishioners as an average Protestant
pastor demands an end to mandatory celibacy.
 &HT;    When will the National Conference of Catholic Bishops put this
issue on its agenda?

 &HT;    In a thoughtful pastoral letter published by his diocesan
newspaper, Catholic Bishop Raymond Lucker of New Ulm, Minn., has
called for a change in the church law of priestly celibacy, which
would create ''the option of married clergy.''
 &HT;    ''Nothing causes me greater concern than the shortage of
priests,'' he writes. In his largely rural diocese, there were 71
priests in 1988. That number fell to 53 by 1997 to serve 83
parishes. Some priests were asked to serve two or three parishes.
 &HT;    Bishop Lucker pioneered another answer by appointing 20 pastoral
administrators, mostly nuns. But they can not celebrate Mass, hear
confessions, etc.
 &HT;    Many lay people have asked Lucker, ''Why can't we have married
priests?'' His response: ''The law of celibacy is a church law
which can be changed. It is not something that came to us from the
revelation of God or from the command of Jesus.
 &HT;    ``Celibacy has been a universal rule in the Western church only
since the 11th century,'' Lucker points out. ``As we all know,
Peter, the head of the Apostles and leader of the Church of Rome,
was married. The Catholic Church has married priests in the Eastern
Rite,'' such as the Ukrainian Catholic Church.
 &HT;    Also, 200 former Episcopalian priests have converted to
Catholicism, and brought their wives and children.
 &HT;    ''In view of the pressing shortage of the clergy ... would it
not be better to change the law of celibacy? I believe that we
ought to change the law and have the option of married clergy,''
Lucker wrote. ''But no individual bishop can change the law. There
would have to be a modification of the law of the universal
church.''
 &HT;    Under Pope John Paul II, that will not happen. He has made it
clear that the subject is closed, and he has told bishops they are
not to speak about the possibility of change, though a few have
done so, such as Milwaukee Archbishop Rembert Weakland.
 &HT;    However, the pressure for change is growing. In Austria last
month, a national assembly of lay leaders appointed by the bishops
debated church policies and then put them to a vote -- the first
such assembly in the world.
 &HT;    More than 75 percent of delegates endorsed ordination for
married men, freedom for couples to choose which method of birth
control to use, allowing divorced and remarried Catholics the right
to receive the sacraments, the right of parish councils to make
decisions without the priest's blessing, and a greater local role
in selecting bishops.
 &HT;    The Austrian bishops were pressured to take this step by a lay
movement called ''We Are Church,'' which garnered a half million
signatures demanding such reforms.
 &HT;    The closest parallel in America is a group, ''Call to Action,''
19,000 lay Catholic who have called for similar reforms. Its
president, Linda Pieczynski, said, ''We are very supportive of
Bishop Lucker's call for an end to mandatory celibacy, which we
have called for since 1991.'' However, Call to Action has not even
considered organizing something like Austria's national assembly.
 &HT;    Lucker's courageous stand has received some press coverage. Last
week, when he attended the National Catholic Conference of Bishops,
he had dinner with 15 bishops, all of whom were in favor of
allowing priests to marry. Every bishop who spoke to him was
supportive, he said.
 &HT;    But when I asked some bishops for their reactions, they were
either noncommittal or were supportive, but did not want me to use
their name. The pope has intimidated them.
 &HT;    There is a darker side of this picture. A careful study of 1,500
priests by A.W. Richard Sipe, who was ordained as a Catholic priest
but later left to marry and to become a psychotherapist, came to a
shocking conclusion: ''At any one time no better than 50 percent of
priests are practicing celibacy. About 25 percent are
heterosexually active, 20 percent are homosexually active and 6
percent are sexually involved with minors.''
 &HT;    Details of his study can be found in Sipe's books, such as
''Sex, Priests and Power: Anatomy of a Crisis.''
 &HT;    Those numbers may seem impossibly high. But 23,000 priests have
left the priesthood to marry. And more than 1,000 priests have
confessed that they have molested children, including at least one
sitting bishop. The church has had to pay hundreds of millions of
dollars in damages.
 &HT;    The scandal of priests who are not practicing celibacy combined
with the acute shortage of priests and their exhaustion in trying
to serve 10 times as many parishioners as an average Protestant
pastor demands an end to mandatory celibacy.
 &HT;    When will the National Conference of Catholic Bishops put this
issue on its agenda?

 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   &HT;    `Deer Avenger' targets humor
 &HT;    By Mark Clothier
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ So far, most computer games have been devoted to
digitizing what we do, paying taxes, playing football, flying
planes and hunting deer.
</P>
<P>
   Now, companies are coming out with games for your PC that make
fun of what we do. ``Deer Avenger,'' a CD-ROM by Simon &AMP; Schuster
Interactive, is expected out by Thanksgiving, still in time for
deer hunting season in most states. The game is a parody of the
popular ``Deer Hunter'' series. It is written by Brian McCann, a
writer for ``Late Night with Conan O'Brien.''
</P>
<P>
   The CD can be installed or played off your CD-ROM drive. The
game gives you the option of hunting in Connecticut, Minnesota or
West Virginia. ``Come for the hunting, stay for the wacky, dancing,
banjo-playing in-bred freaks.''
</P>
<P>
   After choosing your hunting locale, you pick a weapon: bazooka,
rifle or slingshot. Then you look for hunters; telltale signs
include stacks of magazines, tree markings and a roll of toilet
paper. Once you've chosen an area in which to focus your hunt, you
can click the ``Call'' icon to ferret out your hunter. Calls
include, ``Free tickets to a Molly Hatchet reunion concert.''
</P>
<P>
   Once a hunter is out in the open, you click on the ``aim'' icon
and shoot. Which is not as easy as it sounds. Your mouse controls
the sights and you click to fire, but the game makes your mouse
very sensitive. Missed shots elicit trash talk from the CD-ROM,
including, ``I've seen better shots in the WNBA.''
</P>
<P>
   The CD-ROM has a suggested retail of $19.95.
</P>
<P>
   Starting from the get-go
</P>
<P>
   So, you finally give in to the crush and drop your $1,500 on
your first PC. Then it doesn't work. According to a survey in the
October issue of Windows magazine, you're not alone.
</P>
<P>
   Some 13 percent of all new computers either fail to start on
their first boot or they ship with bad parts.
</P>
<P>
   Dell, Hewlett-Packard and Gateway were evaluated the strongest:
92 percent of Hewlett-Packard users had computers that worked fine
from the jump; 91 percent of Dell and Gateway's customers also had
bug-free start-ups. The industry average was 87 percent. NEC and
Packard Bell were among the companies rated ``poor.''
</P>
<P>
   The survey asked 6,000 of the magazine's readers, 2,925 of whom
responded. People were asked to comment on their computer's
performance and the technical support provided by the manufacturer.
Most of the machines, 73 percent, were less than 2 years old.
</P>
<P>
   The issue is probably off newsstands, but it can be read online
at http://www

<P>
   Surfing with the Gray Wave
</P>
<P>
   The Internet's Gray Wave is the focus of the November/December
issue of Modern Maturity magazine.
</P>
<P>
   The feature looks at how seniors can get the system that best
suits them. It looks at the technology needs of four different
types of people _ high-end users, average users, low-average users
and low-end users.
</P>
<P>
   A separate section breaks down the essential technology
questions, like ``Mac or PC?'' Also included is a glossary of 13
words to help take the ``techno'' out of ``technospeak.''
</P>
<P>
   Four famous people _ Ed Bradley, Francis Ford Coppola, Newt
Gingrich and Martha Stewart _ tell what computers add to their
lives. Gingrich uses a Compaq and tells of writing his third book
by e-mailing chapters to his editor.

<P>
   A site for smart kids
</P>
<P>
   A new online site devoted to education products for kids was
unveiled recently.
</P>
<P>
   http://www.smarterkids.com sells software, books, games, toys
and services geared for kids preschool through ninth grade.
</P>
<P>
   Products can be chosen based on a child's educational goals,
learning style, ratings and educational approach. User registration
is via e-mail or phone contact with consultants.
</P>
<P>
   Correct address
</P>
<P>
   The Web site address for Whole World Theatre's broadcast of
``Last Hour Live,'' was listed incorrectly last week. The correct
address is http://www.ibtv.net.

 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   &HT;    Compton's on CD-ROM varies widely in quality
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ We'll begin looking at the new editions of electronic
encyclopedias with Compton's two-disc Encyclopedia Deluxe for 1999,
which overflows with multimedia productions.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, it also provides more nonsense than any
dependable encyclopedia ought to have. It is perhaps the most
uneven CD-ROM encyclopedia I've seen, ranging from excellence to
garbage.
</P>
<P>
   The interface is quite glitzy and easy to use, and has the same
kind of slide-down menu lists that Microsoft introduced with its
encyclopedia, Encarta, several years ago. There are all the usual
facets _ World Wide Web links, various research aids, an atlas, a
historical time line and so forth.
</P>
<P>
   I ran my more or less standard tests, searching for obscure
subjects in which I have a special interest.
</P>
<P>
   Under flamenco, Compton's provides five responses. The first is
a one-sentence description of the term that is partially incorrect
and entirely useless. The second comes under the heading of
Dance-Spain, and the second of its two paragraphs provides an
absurd description of flamenco.
</P>
<P>
   Within this window, however, there is a link to ``Music _
Spanish Flamenco,'' which brings us a silly photograph, a snatch of
guitar playing and a brief but reasonably cogent description of the
art.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the links lead to a pair of passing references to
castanets, which are not really flamenco at all, and the longest
text block of all _ a biography of Carlos Montoya, a guitarist of
no real significance whose fame rested entirely in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Searching for ``Australia'' points up the preposterous indexing
this encyclopedia uses. The list of references brought up is
interminable. There are, for instance, a few articles on the more
significant snakes to be found on the continent. But there is an
index entry for every last serpent's son of them, and most of them
merely take you to the bibliography.
</P>
<P>
   There is an extensive and very nice selection of short video and
historic film clips, and not the more hackneyed ones. The only
problem here is the narration, which is occasionally silly and
sometimes dead wrong. I seriously doubt, for instance, that even
the most adroit grizzly bears have ever caught a fish by ``grabbing
it with their paw.''
</P>
<P>
   The selection of sounds, while very large, is perhaps the most
bizarre thing about this strange encyclopedia. As with every entry
in it, there is no source, so it is left up to one's ear and
imagination as to exactly what is producing the sounds, most
particularly the music.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly the Mozart selections I listened to were produced
properly; ``Eiene Kleine Nachtmusik'' by full orchestra, the
``Rondo alla Turca'' by a grand piano. However, Schubert's ``Octet
for Winds'' appears to be played, if one can call it that, by toy
piano and hurdy-gurdy.
</P>
<P>
   The stranger the musical reproduction, the lower the volume with
which it is reproduced, one hopes due to embarrassment. At any
rate, after trying to figure out what was desecrating Handel, the
mating gurgle of the prairie chicken nearly blew me out of my
chair.
</P>
<P>
   There is a lot to like about this encyclopedia. However, the
overenthusiastic indexing will enrage any reasonably patient adult,
let alone a child, and there is just too much misinformation,
sloppy scholarship and plain silliness for it to merit a
recommendation.

 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   &HT;    It's that time of year for `best of' lists
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ You can always tell the holiday season is around the
corner when computer magazines start running the ``best of'' lists.
The first out of the gate this year is PC World, which features the
best computer CDs and DVDs in its December issue. The magazine's
top 10 titles include Microsoft's Encarta Reference Suite 99, an
electronic encyclopedia that retails for $100. Other picks include
Access Software's golf game ``Links LS 1999,'' Blizzard
Entertainment's ``StarCraft'' and National Geographic Maps from
Mindscape.
</P>
<P>
   In the same issue of PC World, the magazine's editors decided to
test a boast by Apple's Steve Jobs that his new iMac was faster
than the quickest Pentium II PC. They pitted the iMac against the
most expensive Pentium and a system that was $300 less than the
iMac, which retails for $1,299. The iMac finished last in every
test against both of these PCs. The magazine concluded Jobs' boast
was ``pure hype.'' It did find, though, the iMac is indeed the
easiest computer to set up and get going on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   On CD-ROM
</P>
<P>
   If rock musicians can do it, how about the star of a 1980s video
game? Hasbro Interactive is hoping so in its re-release of
``Centipede'' in the form of a computer CD. ``Centipede'' made its
debut as an Atari video game. Now Hasbro has souped it up with 3-D
graphics and new game play. Now you don't just blow away the evil
Centipedes but must also rescue the Wee People threatened by them.
Available only for PCs with operating systems Windows 95 or newer,
``Centipede'' retails for about $40.
</P>
<P>
   These days, it seems you're never too young for your first
computer game. For the holiday season, Fisher-Price has released a
new game for children as young as three. It's called the ``Little
People Christmas Activity Center.'' The game is a two-computer CD
set that lets kids make holiday cards, gift tags and wrapping
paper. There also are printing activities and other games. The game
works with both PCs and Macs and retails for $9.99 if you buy
another Fisher-Price title.
</P>
<P>
   Online
</P>
<P>
   It's the dawn of the holiday season but not everyone is happy.
Just check out the Web. Sadly, it has become a breeding ground for
hate groups. Now you can keep up with what sites to avoid and steer
your children clear of. The site is called Hatewatch. You'll find
it at http://www.hatewatch.org.

 &HT;    However, the pressure for change is growing. In Austria last
month, a national assembly of lay leaders appointed by the bishops
debated church policies and then put them to a vote -- the first
such assembly in the world.
 &HT;    More than 75 percent of delegates endorsed ordination for
married men, freedom for couples to choose which method of birth
control to use, allowing divorced and remarried Catholics the right
to receive the sacraments, the right of parish councils to make
decisions without the priest's blessing, and a greater local role
in selecting bishops.
 &HT;    The Austrian bishops were pressured to take this step by a lay
movement called ''We Are Church,'' which garnered a half million
signatures demanding such reforms.
 &HT;    The closest parallel in America is a group, ''Call to Action,''
19,000 lay Catholic who have called for similar reforms. Its
president, Linda Pieczynski, said, ''We are very supportive of
Bishop Lucker's call for an end to mandatory celibacy, which we
have called for since 1991.'' However, Call to Action has not even
considered organizing something like Austria's national assembly.
 &HT;    Lucker's courageous stand has received some press coverage. Last
week, when he attended the National Catholic Conference of Bishops,
he had dinner with 15 bishops, all of whom were in favor of
allowing priests to marry. Every bishop who spoke to him was
supportive, he said.
 &HT;    But when I asked some bishops for their reactions, they were
either noncommittal or were supportive, but did not want me to use
their name. The pope has intimidated them.
 &HT;    There is a darker side of this picture. A careful study of 1,500
priests by A.W. Richard Sipe, who was ordained as a Catholic priest
but later left to marry and to become a psychotherapist, came to a
shocking conclusion: ''At any one time no better than 50 percent of
priests are practicing celibacy. About 25 percent are
heterosexually active, 20 percent are homosexually active and 6
percent are sexually involved with minors.''
 &HT;    Details of his study can be found in Sipe's books, such as
''Sex, Priests and Power: Anatomy of a Crisis.''
 &HT;    Those numbers may seem impossibly high. But 23,000 priests have
left the priesthood to marry. And more than 1,000 priests have
confessed that they have molested children, including at least one
sitting bishop. The church has had to pay hundreds of millions of
dollars in damages.
 &HT;    The scandal of priests who are not practicing celibacy combined
with the acute shortage of priests and their exhaustion in trying
to serve 10 times as many parishioners as an average Protestant
pastor demands an end to mandatory celibacy.
 &HT;    When will the National Conference of Catholic Bishops put this
issue on its agenda?

 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   &HT;    Some communities are more orderly than others
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ ``Community'' is a word that gets tossed around on the
Web almost as much as ``portal,'' ``commerce'' and ``IPO.''
However, if you ask three Web pundits what community is, you're
likely to get three different answers.
</P>
<P>
   TheGlobe.com (http://www.theglobe.com), GeoCities
(http://www.geocities.com), Tripod (http://www.tripod
</P>
<P>
   .com) and local sites such as AccessAtlanta
(http://www.accessatlanta.com) each invite users to build
special-interest home pages, add chat rooms and build a presence on
the Web. But while community has become the buzzword du jour, even
the folks at the Mining Company (http://www.miningco
</P>
<P>
   .com), which pioneered the notion of a networked collection of
special-interest Web sites, have trouble defining community.
</P>
<P>
   ``Community is a much misunderstood concept,'' says Amanda Hass,
who works on program and community development for the Mining
Company. ``There's a lot of buzz about community, but if there
isn't a responsible guide in charge, that's not community, that's
anarchy.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mining Company aims for a more professional look and feel to
its sites and encourages its guides to build out their sites with
incentives. So far, the results have been good: Media Metrix ranks
the Mining Company the eighth most popular site on the Web in the
information/entertainment/news category.
</P>
<P>
   The Mining Company believes hiring experienced guides to develop
and maintain special-interest sites is the answer to the anarchy of
random personal pages with no clear voice directing the information
on the site. The company recruits guides expert in areas ranging
from pregnancy and politics to rock music and rodeos, puts them
through a three-week online training period, then helps them set up
sites that provide users with chat, links, articles and even an
e-mailed newsletter.
</P>
<P>
   At last count, there were 642 guides with sites on the Mining
Company site. A recent peek at a site devoted to the impeachment
hearings assembled by guide Tim Hosfeldt is one of the most
complete collections of information and background on the Starr
investigation on the Web. Sites devoted to Canadian news and the
Beatles are equally comprehensive. If you need information, you'll
probably be able to find something you can use from a Mining
Company site.
</P>
<P>
   The people who run the Mining Company's sites do it because they
love their subject matter, but there's also monetary compensation.
Guides get 40 percent of advertising revenue and transactions made
via partnerships with companies like online bookseller Amazon.com.
</P>
<P>
   If you define online community as a group of people who may or
may not know each other drawn together by an interest in a
particular subject, then the Mining Company is certainly a
community. However, as Hass points out, ``We were revolutionary
when we launched, but now more and more people are moving toward
our model.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, she says she sees no immediate threats from any community
sites or wannabes. ``We pioneered the model that made (the other
sites) possible. The problem is getting users to find you and love
you.''

 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   &HT;    Map sites on Web make charting your life easier
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ With the help of a map, most of us can get very
confused.
</P>
<P>
   But there are times when a map actually helps. You'll find maps
on the Web that will plot your route across town or across the
country. But the many sites on the Net that offer maps offer a lot
more than that. Many of the maps can be copied and then pasted into
homework assignments for geography and others offer you a chance to
better understand news stories that happen half a world away.
</P>
<P>
   Let's start our trip through the maps of the Web at a couple of
sites that offer help driving to a new location. One of the best is
MapQuest at http://www.mapquest.com. You can use the site without
joining, but you'll get additional services once you're a member.
Since membership is free, go ahead and enroll.
</P>
<P>
   One of the best features of the page is its ability to plot a
turn-by-turn course to a destination anywhere in the country.
Besides the map, you'll get a text description of the turns to
take. In fact, since the maps are relatively small and don't show
much detail (you can zoom in for more detail but sometimes end up
with a map that doesn't cover a large enough area to be helpful),
you'll find that the text is the best way to use the navigational
information.
</P>
<P>
   The routes plotted seem to be accurate and do a good job of
following a logical route. However, if you are familiar with an
area, you probably know a better way. However, if you're familiar
with an area, you probably don't need the map in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   Another service that offers much the same service is AltaVista
Maps, run by the search engine company of the same name, at
http://maps.altavista.com/cgi-bin/mapcgi. Even though you probably
won't find much difference between the routes provided by these two
sites, it's handy to bookmark both. These are high traffic sites
and you may want an option if one site is particularly slow because
of online traffic.
</P>
<P>
   The next site _ called Create A Map at http://www.aquarius
</P>
<P>
   .geomar.de/omc/ _ may not be as useful in day-to-day life but is
enormous fun. You can build your own maps using this excellent
German site (most of the text here is in English as well as German
so you shouldn't have any trouble using the site) and manipulate
the way the map is displayed.
</P>
<P>
   You can, for instance, enter coordinates in latitude and
longitude and then select the map you want, including a
topographical map that shows ridges and features of the Earth. You
can also tell the site to include city names or to leave them out.
It's my guess that you'll spend a lot of time practicing map-making
here. And if you have children, this is a great way to teach them
geography.
</P>
<P>
   If you've ever searched the Web for online maps, you know that
the place is the world's greatest repository of maps. So the ones
we've mentioned just scratch the surface of what's available.
That's why the next Web site is an enormous help for anyone
interested in maps.
</P>
<P>
   It's called Online Map Resources, and it is located at
http://www.geog.ukans.edu/map.htm. You'll find a plain-vanilla page
here that is filled with links to various places on the Web where
you'll find maps. You can, for instance, at the click of a mouse go
to the excellent University of Texas map site at
http://www.lib.utexas.edu/Libs/PCL/Mapcollection/Map
</P>
<P>
   collection.html. There also are links to the Harvard University
map site at http://icg.harvard.edu/(tilde)maps/ and dozens of
others.
</P>
<P>
   Maps, you'll find, are a pleasant way to lose yourself for
hours.

 IN THE TELEVISION'S BEGINNING, THERE WAS RISK-TAKING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Nov. 29)  
(rl) 
 By JEFF KISSELOFF   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The tube in my hand would have earned an F in glass-blowing
class. It was thick and ungainly with stubby limbs extending at odd
angles and was painted a kind of mustard yellow.
</P>
<P>
   I thought it was beautiful. What Elma ``Pem'' Farnsworth had
just dropped into my sweaty palms represented the dreams of her
husband, Philo, in 1926, when he was 19 years old. It was his first
attempt at a picture tube after being told by experts in the
growing television field that his plan to create an all-electronic
system was impossible on his limited budget, not to mention that
this was a boy without a college degree.
</P>
<P>
   And at first they were right: The tube didn't work. But the
experts underestimated Farnsworth's genius. While they were still
toying with their mechanical systems, which used spinning disks to
scan pictures, Farnsworth and his plucky team produced the first
all-electronic television picture on Sept. 7, 1927.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, that was some day,'' recalled Mrs. Farnsworth with a gleam
in her eye in the living room of her modest Salt Lake City home.
``I was just so excited. Afterward, we sent a telegram to the
backers.'' It just said that the thing worked.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Farnsworth's continued devotion to her husband, who died in
1971, and his legacy had her audienc _ an interviewer and a
two-person camera crew _ wiping their eyes. We were videotaping her
for the Academy of Television Arts and Sciences' Archive of
American Television.
</P>
<P>
   Since April 1996, the archive has been sending video crews
around the country in a race against the actuarial clock to
interview the dwindling stock of television pioneers. Eventually
the videotapes will go into a library, which will be open to the
public, in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The list includes not only the Berles and the Caesar-Cocas but
also the technical geniuses like Farnsworth and the unrecognized
heroes of television's early years. Charlie Andrews, for example,
inspired the influential Chicago School of Television, which
brought Studs Terkel, Dave Garroway and Hugh Downs to national
prominence. Terkel's show, ``Studs's Place,'' was truly remarkable.
It was a live, ad-libbed comedy-drama set in a bar. Back then, that
kind of risk taking was typical.
</P>
<P>
   That's what makes the stories so important to preserve. They
recount a time when creativity, intelligence and the ability to
think by the seat of one's pants was paramount. Out of that came
the golden age of television. It was all about risk taking and
freedom. At a time when the television industry seems as desperate
for good programming as viewers are, these veterans have something
important to say.
</P>
<P>
   Like Mrs. Farnsworth, the earliest pioneers vividly recall the
thrill of exploration, of building something from nothing, to
please not some corporate sponsor but themselves. Nobody knew what
television was or would be, so there were no molds to fit into.
Mostly, they proceeded on curiosity and raw intelligence and a
willingness to experiment in an atmosphere that not only tolerated
resourceful thinking but depended on it.
</P>
<P>
   It is this thread that runs through nearly all the interviews
for the archive: the enormous dividends that are accrued by
allowing creative people to create under conditions in which there
is no margin for error.
</P>
<P>
   You heard this repeatedly. Because no spare parts were
available, Arch Brolly used a pickle jar to complete his
transmitter and keep WBKB, Chicago's most important station, on the
air during World War II. When Brolly's boss, the redoubtable
Captain Bill Eddy, needed a camera base that could be raised and
lowered, he created one from a barber chair. When Eddy desperately
needed a show to fill his schedule, he called a staff meeting.
While puffing on his pipe (which doubled as a hearing aid), Eddy
recalled a young puppeteer he worked with at the 1939 World's Fair,
and ``Kukla, Fran and Ollie'' was born.
</P>
<P>
   Eddy was a master at this. He created the first microwave
network because it was the only way to bring Notre Dame football to
Chicago. Lighting was a major hurdle in television's earliest days.
Cameras were so insensitive that tons of light had to be poured on
the subject to get a picture. Eddy wrote the book on television
lighting.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew we had enough light when the model's hair began to
smoke,'' he later joked.
</P>
<P>
   Eddy, who is virtually unknown today, was also one of the first
to regularly televise wrestling. And it was the popularity of
Gorgeous George and his crowd, not Milton Berle or Ed Sullivan,
that sold television to the American public.
</P>
<P>
   Noel Jordan worked with Eddy at RCA before the war. He recalls
the excitement of just being there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody worked 60 to 80 hours a week,'' said Mr. Jordan.
``We slept in a first-aid room where they had a couple of cots. We
felt pretty cocky about being in the forefront of something new.''
</P>
<P>
   (MORE) &QL; 
</P>
<P>
   Farnsworth literally worked while he slept, his wife said. She
told the archive interviewer how her husband had trained himself to
dwell on a problem in his sleep so he would have it solved by the
time he woke up.
</P>
<P>
   But then Farnsworth, who was mulling over the limitations of
mechanical television while still in his teens, was always
thinking. One day while out plowing on the family farm, he noticed
the lines in the field that his harrow had just made.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said to himself, `I can just magnetically deflect those
electrons across the screen in the same way you plow a field, line
after line,' '' said Pem Farnsworth. ``That's the way he did it,
and that's the way it's done today.'' He was 14 at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Seventy years later, she still reveled in the romance of it all.
Philo had told his first serious girlfriend about television, and
she promptly dumped him, so he was a little apprehensive when it
came time to let Pem in on his secret. He took her for a horseback
ride to Bridal Veil Falls in a nearby town. It was there that he
nervously told her his dreams. She told him that not only did she
believe he could do it but that she would help him any way she
could. She did, by keeping his patent books and doing other work in
the lab.
</P>
<P>
   Long after Farnsworth got his patents, the medium remained a
forum for experimentation. Well into the 1950s, the DuMont network
was an exercise in bargain-basement programming.
</P>
<P>
   Bishop Sheen went up against Milton Berle (Tuesday nights at 8)
with just a blackboard for a set. The DuMont studios were located
in Wanamaker's department store in Greenwich Village, so when the
producers of ``Captain Video'' needed a ray gun, Charles Polachek,
the director, grabbed a spark plug, muffler, rearview mirror and
ashtray from the automotive department, glued them together himself
and called it the opticom scillometer.
</P>
<P>
   When they did chase scenes for ``Rocky King, Inside Detective,''
cameramen focused on the actors' feet. Otherwise, viewers would see
they were running through Wanamaker's piano department.
</P>
<P>
   Dick Smith, NBC's legendary makeup man, found that his job
called for constant problem solving. On a live show set around a
boxing match, he had to figure out how to make bruises suddenly
appear on the fighter's face.
</P>
<P>
   ``I dressed up as a corner man. In between rounds I got in the
ring,'' Mr. Smith recalled in one of the archive's first
interviews. ``While I pretended to be mopping the guy off, I was
really making him up to look bruised.''
</P>
<P>
   The rewards from that kind of thinking may be the archive's most
valuable legacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hollywood has become a pretty joyless corporate affair,'' says
Dean Valentine, president of UPN, who was instrumental in setting
up the television archives, ``and the art and the joy seem to have
disappeared. But for them it hadn't. That's what keeps coming
through again and again in a lot of the interviews. I think the
lesson is to bring some of that back.''
</P>
<P>
   Gutsy behavior extended beyond the technical achievements.
Joseph Wershba, who as a young reporter located Milo Radulovich,
the dismissed Air Force lieutenant whose story became a symbol of
rampant McCarthyism, recalled the evening of March 9, 1954, when
``See It Now'' devoted an entire broadcast to Joseph McCarthy at
the height of the senator's power.
</P>
<P>
   That night, CBS threatened to dismiss the program's production
manager, Palmer Williams, because they had learned that his ex-wife
was a member of the Communist Party. But Edward R. Murrow and his
producer, Fred Friendly, would have none of it. Still, tension ran
high. Opinions differed as to whether the program should go on,
considering the risks it posed to everyone involved. The feeling
was that CBS probably wouldn't back them in the event that McCarthy
counterattacked.
</P>
<P>
   Recounting that evening, Mr. Wershba gave the archive some of
its most vivid moments. ``Ed said: `The terror is right here in
this room. No one man can terrorize a whole nation unless we are
all his accomplices.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Needless to say, they went ahead. Creativity wasn't the only
kind of freedom at stake.

   TRUCK-EMISSIONS-TEX (Undated) _ They are as Texan as Justin
Boots, Wrangler Jeans and long-neck beer bottles. Nowhere in the
country does Detroit sell more pickups and sport utility vehicles
than in Texas, a market so important to the Motor City that makers
have for years considered ways to put hat racks in every model. But
federal officials are expected to adopt new emissions regulations
next month that would mess with the trucks that Texans love to
drive, pushing up sticker prices [ up]anywhere from $300 to $1,500
per truck nationwide. Texas officials support the action. By
Michael D. Towle.
</P>
<P>
   SHARP-DRIVING (Atlanta) _ Minimizing holiday traffic hazards.
</P>
<P>
   ABOUT-CARS-BMW (Undated) _ The bandages are off now, and two
sedans, the first of the next-generation 3-Series, are on sale.
Enthusiasts' worries were unfounded; the operation was a success.
The '99 is more refined, and it intentionally mimics the bigger
5-Series in its features, its interior design, even its appearance.
BMW has made top-to-bottom changes, including a new body and a
couple of updated engines, but it has left the car's character _
serious but fun, solid but spritely _ essentially intact. The
3-Series has grown up, and if it has lost some adolescent spunk, it
has gained a measure of maturity. By James G. Cobb. Photo.
</P>
<P>
   ONLINE-CARS-AD-COLUMN (Undated) _ In another demonstration of
the blurring of the lines between the online and off-line
advertising and media realms, a leading Internet marketer is naming
one of the world's biggest agencies to handle duties ranging from
global brand-building to creating campaigns for television,
magazines and newspapers. By Stuart Elliott.
</P>
<P>
   AUTO-REVIEW-BOS (Undated) _ There are two primary reasons for
the apparent me-too-ism in autoland. The first is the wind tunnel.
The second is the focus group. By John R. White.
</P>
<P>
   AUTO-REVIEW-AZR (Undated) _ Macho truck guys adore the mighty
Ford F-250 Super Duty. Its hulking appearance, its brawny V-10
engine, its broad interior: This is a big rig among pickup trucks.
By Bob Golfen.
</P>
<P>
   CARS-SAFETY-NYT (Undated) _ The Transportation Department plans
to announce a rule in a few days that will require standard
hardware in cars and child seats to make the two fit together
better, with the aim of lowering the annual death toll of about 600
children under age 5. But seats not secured to the car is the
smaller part of the problem, safety experts say; a bigger one is
children not secured to the seat. About 60 percent of the children
killed in car crashes were not buckled in, although there was often
a child seat in the car. By Matthew L. Wald.

second acts. What is new is that so many Americans are now having
third and fourth and fifth acts, they are having them later in life
and numerous trends may be making them unavoidable. By Peter
Applebome.
</P>
<P>
   INTERFAITH-MARRIAGES (West Palm Beach, Fla.) _ Susann Ferarra
was not happy to learn that the rabbinical powers that be have
decreed her unfit to hold her job as executive director of Temple
Beth David in Palm Beach Gardens. She is, after all, a committed
Jew. She has dedicated her professional life to the Jewish

she married a Catholic. And as far as the highest rabbinical
assembly in the Conservative movement is concerned, that means she

</P>
<P>
   RELIGION-COLUMN-NYT (Undated) _ When leaders of major religious
organizations believe their flocks to be facing a matter of
overarching importance, they may decide guidance is best given
through a formal pastoral statement, a nuanced and reflective
document sent to all congregations under their care. At least two
such messages were published this week, one by the nation's Roman
Catholic bishops, the other by the president of a Protestant
denomination. Each, in its own quite separate way, addressed the
question of how Christians should act in the larger society. By

   STARR-PEPPERDINE (Malibu, Calif.) _ Pepperdine University's
public courtship of Kenneth Starr as dean has brought unusual

incorporate the values of Jesus Christ into the law. A visit to the
law school provided a glimpse of the origins of Starr's attitudes
about morality and the law. By William Glaberson. Photo.

 &HT;    SHORTTAKES: Didn't cook my goose
 &HT;    By Arnold Rosenfeld
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Our traditional Thanksgiving bird is smoked goose. Actually, I
only did it last year, but I was hoping to establish a family
tradition.
</P>
<P>
   I have one of those clay smokers that won't let you goof up. I
follow instructions. Charcoal. Temperature. Time. All precise. I
think I have a lech for Martha Stewart.
</P>
<P>
   I thought it came off pretty well. Until recently, when my
daughter asked, ``Dad, are you going to smoke a goose again for
Thanksgiving?'' Sure, I said, I thought it came off pretty well
last year. Two weeks later, she said, ``Dad, you're not going to
smoke another goose for Thanksgiving.'' ``Are you'' had become
``you're not.''
</P>
<P>
   Her views are a little suspect. She's a vegetarian and eats tofu
the shape of a meatloaf for Thanksgiving. ``Bill liked it,'' I
said. Bill is my oldest son. ``Bill doesn't want to hurt your
feelings,'' she said. I tried again. ``Debbie liked it.'' Deb is
Bill's wife. ``Debbie would never say she didn't like it. The goose
WAS TOO GREASY, DAD. `` Greasy? Greasy? What grease?
</P>
<P>
   So that was why I canceled my goose order at the supermarket
this year, and we had turkey. Went over pretty well, too. Martha
would have been proud.

FOREIGN STUDENTS DISCOVER AN AMERICAN THANKSGIVING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MICHAEL LOPEZ  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TROY, N.Y. _ It is easy to see why the Siebels family and
Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute graduate students Itty Matthew and
Anurag Jain have become friends.
</P>
<P>
   Carl and Kath Siebels relate to the two students, both from
India, in an easygoing yet somewhat parental way, and invite them
to their rural Rensselaer County home for casual spur-of-the-moment
pizza, for instance, and, now, for Thanksgiving.
</P>
<P>
   Matthew and Jain are excellent cooks, and the Siebels look
forward to Indian cuisine every couple of months.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the Siebels family and the two students will spend
their second Thanksgiving together, sitting down for a dinner of
turkey, dressing, and pumpkin and apple pies.
</P>
<P>
   Matthew, 25, from Madras, and Jain, 23, from Delhi, have quickly
absorbed the uniquely American holiday of Thanksgiving. The
straightforward concepts, of spending time with family, and of
thankfulness, are not lost on either.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very unique, because, in my opinion, almost all of the
U.S. comes to a stop, to spend time with family. You don't see that
happen very often,'' Matthew said.
</P>
<P>
   The Indian holiday most likely similar to Thanksgiving is Onam,
an August harvest festival, but not one celebrated universally.
</P>
<P>
   The two are part of a year-round volunteer program that seeks to
broaden the American experience of international students. While
these American hosts and students may go camping or cross-country
skiing throughout the year, Thanksgiving is one of the more popular
and natural holidays for their get-togethers.
</P>
<P>
   The Siebels' Thanksgiving could not sound more typical or
comforting: attending the Turkey Trot road race with their three
daughters, Erika, 20, Talia, 19 and Elke, 15, then catching part of
the televised Macy's parade. Dinner is always at 1 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   For Jain, studying chemical engineering and electronics at
Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute for more than two years, this is
the only traditional Thanksgiving he has known.
</P>
<P>
   Matthew has been in the United States longer, studying at the
University of Delaware before transferring to Rensselaer about two
years ago. He is earning a doctorate in material science, a field
that explores how, in the computer age, materials are tailored to
different uses.
</P>
<P>
   In his four years in the United States, Matthew has had a chance
to taste Thanksgiving alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the Thanksgivings, I remember being the lone person,
working in a building that normally houses 500 people,'' Matthew
said of his time attending the University of Delaware. That day, he
wrote a term paper, and visited the soda machine a couple of times.
``I think even the 7-Eleven was closed that day.''
</P>
<P>
   He was determined not to spend another Thanksgiving that way, so
he visited a cousin in Connecticut one year, and, last year, hosted
an out-of-town friend for Thanksgiving, Indian style, with lots of
spicy lamb.
</P>
<P>
   Horizons International, the volunteer effort that introduced the
Siebels and the doctoral students, is designed to ward off the
isolation Matthew experienced on that early Thanksgiving.
</P>
<P>
   Matthew and Jain are among about 120 students at Rensselaer
Polytechnic Institute and the nearby state University of New York
at Albany who are matched with American families through the
volunteer group. Horizons aims to cultivate friendships between
Americans and adult international students, from dozens of
different countries.
</P>
<P>
   Although Horizons has grown from the involvement of 20 or 30
churches, the program is secular.
</P>
<P>
   ``International students come here and they're relatively
isolated within the campus community,'' said Mark Harkness, a
graduate of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and a General Electric
Co. engineer who helped expand the program a decade ago. Typically,
these students may return home after several years without ever
having an American's name in their address book, Harkness said.
</P>
<P>
   Both Matthew and Jain guess that their contact with everyday
Americans would be rare, if they had not purposely done something
about it. To reinforce the point, Matthew mimics the ``forced
smile.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People are very polite and friendly as long as it's within the
small domain of 8 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. at work,'' said Matthew, a
teaching assistant. ``After that, it's like everybody goes back to
their own black hole.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Kath Siebels calls her friendship with Jain and Matthew ``a real
relationship.'' It wouldn't be unusual to sometimes find the young
men flopped in the living room, rested and full, after dinner. The
two were the first to send flowers last year when the Siebels
celebrated their 25th wedding anniversary. And, Matthew makes a
small but telling point when he mentions how much he looks forward
to Kath's cheesecake, served on Thanksgiving.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, they'll sit down to Thanksgiving dinner, and won't
lack for conversation.
</P>
<P>
   ``All human beings go through the same struggles and have the
same wants and needs, across civilization, across time,'' Matthew
said.

DECK THE HALLS BUT HOLD THE CALORIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SYLVIA WOOD  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   'Tis the season for overindulgence.
</P>
<P>
   The average American gains five to 10 pounds at this time of
year, according to Tammy Baker, a spokeswoman for the American
Dietetic Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot more high-calorie food around,'' she said.
``It's difficult to resist.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, as most of us know, it's easier to put the weight
on than take it off. The goal shouldn't be to lose weight. Food
experts agree that now is the wrong time to start a diet. Instead,
they suggest trying to keep ahead of those extra pounds with some
healthy tips that work year-round.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of pressure to eat this time of year,'' said
Nancie Segel of Food Management, a service near Albany, N.Y., that
uses a behavior-modification approach to eating less. ``Some people
don't even realize they're doing it. They'll be at a cocktail party
and shoving food in their mouth and not even notice it.''
</P>
<P>
   Here are some helpful hints for managing weight during the
holiday season:
</P>
<P>
   _ Enjoy the conversation, not the food.
</P>
<P>
   That's one low-calorie suggestion to make it through the
numerous social engagements and family reunions this time of year
without regrets next year.
</P>
<P>
   Another is to be especially careful to cut down on high-fat
appetizers and snacks.
</P>
<P>
   Sandra McNeil, the clinical nutrition manager at Glens Falls
Hospital in Glenn Falls, N.Y., also suggests eating a healthful
snack, like high-fiber crackers or fruit, and drinking plenty of
water, before heading out to a party.
</P>
<P>
   With something already in your stomach, you're less likely to
overeat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Typically it takes 20 minutes for your stomach to signal that
it's full,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   _ Scale down on alcoholic beverages and watch your portions.
</P>
<P>
   That's easier said than done, especially when generous hostesses
are more than happy to fill up dinner plates with seconds. Resist
the pressure, tell your hostess you want to save room for dessert
and then insist on only a sliver of pie or cake. If you're
confronted with a buffet, be selective and choose only the foods
you really want to eat.
</P>
<P>
   _ Forget the all-or-nothing mindset.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the holidays only come once a year and it's no fun to feel
guilty about enjoying special foods.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tradition is a big part of it,'' Segel said. ``We've been
socialized to socialize with food.''
</P>
<P>
   With that in mind, Segel tells her clients to set some rules,
like a three-cookie limit at a party. The key is moderation. Don't
skip a meal with the hope of making it up with sweets. That
strategy rarely works because cake and cookies are never as filling
and satisfying as other foods.
</P>
<P>
   ``They end up taking in many more calories to fill their tummy
up,'' Segel said.
</P>
<P>
   _ Exercise.
</P>
<P>
   This time of year, many people tend to scale back on their
workouts to make extra time for shopping and socializing. There are
ways to do both. If you're at the mall, Segel suggests parking as
far as possible from the entrance or doing a lap or two inside
before hitting the stores.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is we're allowed to eat a certain number of
calories a day,'' she said. Here's how those calories can add up:
Eat 500 extra calories a day and you'll gain a pound in a week.

TEXAS TEMPO IS ALL ABOUT TALK, GUNS AND LOVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JIM BEAL Jr.  
 c.1998 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ The fodder for Texas songwriters is pretty
straightforward: Somebody's going get shot. Failing that, they're
going to get shot at; or hold up a convenience store; or steal a
car; or fall in love with the wrong person, the wrong train, or,
God forbid, the wrong pickup truck.
</P>
<P>
   When a songwriter from elsewhere _ say, Connecticut _ writes
about love gone wrong, listeners are apt to have to sit through a
litany of soul-searching and self-flagellation.
</P>
<P>
   When a songwriter from Texas writes about love gone wrong, blood
isn't always shed, but welts are often raised. And it usually takes
a while for the writer to explain exactly how wrong that love went.
</P>
<P>
   For proof, listen to Lyle Lovett's ``Step Inside This House,'' a
double-album tribute to some of the Texas-bred or, in some cases,
Texas-tempered, wordsmiths whose works influenced his career.
</P>
<P>
   The writers Lovett covers include Steve Fromholz, Townes Van
Zandt, Guy Clark, Eric Taylor, David Rodriguez, Walter Hyatt,
Michael Murphey, Vince Bell, Willis Alan Ramsey and Robert Earl
Keen.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Earle is one of Texas' highest-profile singing
songwriters. At the moment, he's ensconced near Galway Bay in
Ireland, where he is working on a book.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Earle, whose work also bears the mark of some of Lovett's
influences, notably Clark and Van Zandt, will readily take time out
to communicate about what sets songwriters from Texas apart from
songwriters in other parts of the universe.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the first place, Texans in general speak in analogies. If a
Texan begins with `It's like ...,' you're going to be there for a
while,'' he wrote. ``If a Texan becomes a songwriter he is
proportionately long-winded, so `moon/June/spoon' are simply out of
the question.''
</P>
<P>
   Fromholz, a generation ahead of Earle, tends to agree. His
``Bears'' opens ``Step Inside this House,'' and his opus ``Texas
Trilogy'' sets the pace for the second disc of the album.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't shut us up. You can't get my guitar away from me and
you can't shut me up. I've been doing this for 33 years,'' he said.
``No one has gotten me to quit yet. I don't think they could.
Texans are definitely storytellers, raconteurs. And most of the
songs we write we write for ourselves, for our wives, for our
girlfriends and for our friends. We're all proud of being Texans.''
</P>
<P>
   The storytelling aspect of Texas songwriters knows no
boundaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's the corrida tradition in our neck of the woods,''
Earle said. ``When Fred Gomez Carrasco made his break from the
Walls Unit in Huntsville, Spanish-speaking radio in San Antonio was
playing three different corridas about his death before the body
was released to the family.''
</P>
<P>
   Fromholz has his own take on the gunfire quotient in Texas
music.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we're afraid of contention,'' he said with a
laugh. ``It doesn't frighten me to play in a joint that has chicken
wire in front of the stage, as long as I'm inside the chicken
wire.''
</P>
<P>
   And what does a songwriter from Connecticut think?
</P>
<P>
   Eric Von Schmidt didn't invent the East Coast school of folk
music, but he certainly helped a number of singing songwriters hone
their craft.
</P>
<P>
   Von Schmidt was influenced by people such as Huddie
``Leadbelly'' Ledbetter. In turn, the singing songwriter and noted
painter influenced Bob Dylan, Joan Baez, Chris Smither, Tom Rush
and others.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a more expansive, a tougher and more illustrative
line, almost like painting pictures instead of writing songs, that
Texas songwriters are so good at,'' Von Schmidt said in a telephone
interview. ``There's also more humor and less introspection in the
songs of a lot of Texas writers. The introspective thing has really
gotten out of hand in the East. There's so much political
correctness. The Texas school of writing has always been a breath
of fresh air.''
</P>
<P>
   Fromholz figures Texas history has rubbed off on its
songwriters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe it all goes back to being Texan, which means being
independent,'' he said. ``Texas was once an independent nation and
we believe in that. It's like if you don't like what we're doing,
to hell with you. And we all care about each other. We learn from
each other.''
</P>
<P>
   A lot of what Texas writers do is go out and work the road. More
than a few Lone Star songwriters might prefer playing songs to
attentive audiences in listening clubs, but most won't shy away
from fronting a band in a honky-tonk.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody from the Northeast or from Canada came up to me at
one of the festivals and said she could dance to every song,'' said
Rod Kennedy, the founder and director of the Kerrville Folk
Festival and a man who has probably listened to more varied
songwriters than anyone else on the planet.
</P>
<P>
   ``So much of our tradition here in Texas has been inspired by
Western swing, Mexican music and country music, all of which is
dance music.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the subject matter that Texas songwriters deal with
is a holdover from the frontier spirit. They have it in Canada,
too,'' Kennedy added. ``Part of it is the romantic myth of the Old
West. Our guys have a mixture of rural and urban in their songs.''

 By DAVE MURPHY  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Paul DiGiammarino thought he was doing a great
job, until he received a negative performance review _ from his
son.
</P>
<P>
   After all, DiGiammarino had founded the financial services unit
of American Management Systems and was the co-leader of the $100
million unit. He loved his job, but it was demanding too much.
</P>
<P>
   He remembers what his son, then 12 or 13, told him: ``You always
say that things are going to change and you're going to be able to
spend more time with us. But it never happens.''
</P>
<P>
   It finally did.
</P>
<P>
   In a keynote speech at the American Management Association
conference in San Francisco this month, DiGiammarino cited a story
from Stephen R. Covey, author of ``The 7 Habits of Highly Effective
People'': A man on his deathbed described how he always analyzed
decisions before he made them, and generally made good decisions,
but he still didn't end up accomplishing what he wanted to in his
life.
</P>
<P>
   That's what can happen when your life is out of balance,
DiGiammarino said. His job was taking up most of his time and he
was making the right decisions in it, but he was ignoring his
family, his friends and his favorite recreational activity, golf.
</P>
<P>
   So he took a step back to sort things out. ``During this period,
I played a lot of golf and I didn't work very hard,'' DiGiammarino
recalled. ``But I wasn't happy, either.''
</P>
<P>
   So he listed the things that were important in his life, and
what he wanted to accomplish in each of those areas. ``Defining
what my goal was in each one was extremely important.''
</P>
<P>
   DiGiammarino ended up drawing what looked like a spider web,
with six spokes _ one each for work, family, community, health,
spirituality and golf. The spokes weren't symmetrical; the length
of each depended on how important he felt that aspect of his life
should be.
</P>
<P>
   Then he drew a second web, this time making each spoke represent
how much time he actually spent on each of his six important
aspects.
</P>
<P>
   The two webs weren't exactly a close match.
</P>
<P>
   In the course of aligning his webs, DiGiammarino downshifted to
a role as vice president with American Management Systems, a
company that was eventually named as one of the best places to work
in America by Working Mother, Fortune and Computer World magazines.
Then he changed companies, becoming senior vice president for
global financial services at Sapient Corp. in Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   He also took two steps that he urges all workers to consider: He
developed a personal mission statement and determined how well his
goals aligned themselves with the company's mission. DiGiammarino
also urged companies to do the same thing in reverse, considering
whether they can attract top employees if they expect people to
devote too much of their lives to work.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can no longer just blindly go out there and say, `This is
our corporate mission statement and people have to get in line with
it.'''
</P>
<P>
   If you decide that your life is out of balance, DiGiammarino
suggests that you think about which things you want to start doing
and which things you will have to stop to make room for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's extremely difficult to move anything off the plate,'' he
warned.
</P>
<P>
   To help simplify his work life, DiGiammarino followed another of
Covey's suggestions and divided his work tasks into four
categories: urgent and important, the most crucial aspects of the
job; not urgent but important, such as developing people's skills
and recharging your batteries; urgent but not important, such as
answering e-mail and voicemail messages; and neither urgent nor
important.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe we spend way too much time in the `urgent, not
important,''' DiGiammarino said, adding that he often felt
compelled to respond to messages, even though it took a lot of
time. ``I was letting other people tell me what to do with my
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Once he stepped back, though, he found that his family members
weren't the only ones who benefited. Other people he worked with
also gained because they took on more responsibilities, giving them
chances for career growth that weren't there before.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt bad when I didn't respond to somebody's e-mail,''
DiGiammarino recalled. ``But you know what? I felt worse when my
kid told me I wasn't spending enough time with him.''

JANE HORROCKS: 'LITTLE VOICE,' BIG TALENT 
</HEADLINE>
  World rights except Great Britain and Australia 
 Color slides and black and white photos of Jane Horrocks in
``Little Voice.'' 
 By IVOR DAVIS 
 Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    It was such a plum role that the ultra-hot Gwyneth Paltrow had
her eye on it. But British actress Jane Horrocks _ a virtual
unknown in Hollywood _ beat her to the punch.
 &HT;    As a result Horrocks has become a dark-horse Best Actress Oscar
contender for ``Little Voice,'' a British-made fable in which the
spotlight falls directly on the 34-year-old actress, best known for
her role as the ditzy Bubble in TV's U.K. comedy import
``Absolutely Fabulous.''
 &HT;    ``They were going to switch the film from England to America
with Gwyneth Paltrow, but it didn't work out,'' Horrocks said, her
voice brimming with happiness, in a telephone interview from New
York. ``So suddenly the part came back to me.''
 &HT;    In ``Little Voice,'' (opening Dec. 4 in New York, San Francisco
and Los Angeles, and on Christmas Day elsewhere) Horrocks is the
shy daughter of Brenda Blethyn (nominated for an Oscar for
``Secrets and Lies''), fearful of leaving the safety of her room
and her precious record collection. They call her Little Voice but
the girl packs a big talent. She can belt out a song and sound
exactly like Judy Garland, Marilyn Monroe, Shirley Bassey or
Marlene Dietrich _ to name a few.
 &HT;    It's a miraculous feat: Before your eyes Miss Meek is
transformed into a series of charismatic nightclub singers.
 &HT;    ``They had other people in mind for the lead,'' says Horrocks,
``but Jim Cartwright, who wrote the play, insisted he wanted me.''
In fact, she notes, Cartwright penned the play from which the movie
is drawn with her in mind.
 &HT;    ``I was in another play by him and we became friends,'' she
recalls. ``We were in my back garden one day and the subject of
impersonations came up. So I did a few for him. He said he would
write a play around me _ and two years later he did. I was
horrified and frightened to death to do the voices on stage. At the
time I hoped some disaster would come and take it away. But I did
the play for eight months, first at the National Theater then in
the West End.''
 &HT;    In the movie, Little Voice has to contend with her crude, rude
and hard-drinking mother (Blethyn), and with Michael Caine as the
sleazy agent who wants to exploit her talent. Ewan McGregor plays
her telephone repairman boyfriend.
 &HT;    What will astonish moviegoers is that Horrocks actually sings in
the voices of the legendary ladies; no tricks or miming are used.
``It was important to me and Mark Herman (the
screenwriter-director) that I actually sang because if the audience
thinks for a moment that the character is miming then you've lost
them.''
 &HT;    While she was impressive as an anorexic teenager in Mike Leigh's
``Life Is Sweet'' (1991) and has had roles in ``Memphis Belle''
(1990), ``The Witches'' and a slew of TV including her own British
comedy show ``Never Mind the Horrocks,'' the tiny Jane first caught
everyone's attention as the flaky PR girl in ``Ab-Fab.''
 &HT;    She auditioned first for the role of one of the character's
daughter but because she was too old for that part they hired her
to play Bubble. The show featuring the addled antics of a pair of
dipsomaniacs, quickly became a cult hit, and when it came to the
end of its run its devoted fans mourned. Of its future Jane says,
``Maybe they'll do a one-off special,'' using the British term for
a one-time TV presentation. ``The shows work well for 30 minutes
but I think they'd die in a two-hour movie.''
 &HT;    Her part as the dumb Bubble has had a considerable impact on her
career. ``It's made me more of a semi-household name, and given me
a lot of attention. But I'm not massively famous in the U.K. People
sometimes come up to me in the street and say, 'Oh, you're
So-and-so.' But it's not out of control. It's at a very nice
level.''
 &HT;    Unlike Bubble, Jane is no airhead. She lives in suburban London
with writer Nick Vivian and is expecting their second child. She's
not in favor of marriage, explaining: ``It doesn't appeal to me.
I'm happy as I am and feel if it ain't broke why fix it.''
 &HT;    She seems astonishingly natural on- and off-screen, but it
doesn't come as easily as all that. ``Like my character in the film
I'm a sort of reticent performer,'' she says. ``I don't feel
comfortable doing it. I don't consider myself an impersonator. I'm
an actress really. I began doing impersonations when I was about 9.
My parents had all these Shirley Bassey and Cilla Black records and
I was able to imitate them. Friends thought it was amazing so I
became this little party act. Garland and Monroe and Dietrich came
much later. ''
 &HT;    Now almost five months pregnant, (Dylan, her son with Vivian is
l8 months old) she says: ``I don't enjoy working as much as I used
to. I'd like to have more time for the momhood than the work. I'm
very fortunate because at home I've been able to do supermarket TV
commercials which doesn't take me away from home and pays the
bills. I'd love to retire.''
 &HT;    She says that however much she's been praised for her
impersonation, her son Dylan is often less than impressed. ``When I
did a Judy Garland for him he screamed his head off. He much
prefers my Julie Andrews.''

CAPITALIST CASTS BREAD ON THE WATERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRED KAPLAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Chuck Stetson seems an unlikely figure to lead a
national religious movement. He lives on the stiff upper lip of
Manhattan's East Side, and runs an equity fund that manages over
$100 million for venture capitalists _ none of which quite fits the
image of someone shouting the gospel from rooftops.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Stetson, 53, is the main organizing force behind the
National Bible Association, a group that sponsors National Bible
Week, which started Saturday, and promotes reading the Bible as a
path to personal and social salvation.
</P>
<P>
   This is not your typical bunch of evangelists, though. ``There
are no thumpers on our board,'' Stetson emphasized, sitting in the
townhouse where he works and lives with his wife and three
daughters. ``I was attracted to it by the fact that it is not a
fundamentalist organization. What attracted me was that this is a
group of business people in New York.''
</P>
<P>
   He is well aware of the biblical passage that declares it easier
for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for a rich man
to pass into heaven. And Stetson is a rich man who makes his money
by making others even richer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think about that,'' he said of the apparent contradiction.
``But I think Andrew Carnegie answered that in an essay he wrote. I
was just looking at it again the other day. In his day, he made
$350 million, which is the equivalent of $40 or $50 billion today.
... And he gave it away in his lifetime. That's his message.''
</P>
<P>
   Carnegie gave a lot of his money to libraries. Stetson gives a
lot of his to pushing the Bible. ``I wouldn't be successful doing
straight venture capital without balancing it here,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The National Bible Association was founded in 1940 by business
leaders who saw war on the horizon, felt the nation needed moral
strengthening to survive it, and concluded the Bible could be a
source.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in a similar period today,'' Stetson reflected. ``People
are searching for spiritual reality. They've gone through New Age,
it's been hollow, they're looking for the real thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite its nearly 60 years of operations, the Bible association
has not exactly penetrated popular culture. This is where Stetson
feels he can make his mark.
</P>
<P>
   ``My challenge as a venture capitalist is to find where capital
can be really effective,'' he said. He sees Bible promotion the
same way. ``I treat this as a venture-capital investment, and the
potential return is infinite. The number of lives you touch, you
never know.''
</P>
<P>
   He started a Web site, which receives 20,000 hits a day. He
negotiated with America Online Inc. to make the association its
official Bible contact group. Although the group stays away from
particular denominations, he worked a deal with the Episcopal and
United Methodist churches _ ``because they have TV downlinks'' _ to
produce national Bible-reading teleconferences.
</P>
<P>
   On a low-tech level, he put together a ``starter kit,''
suggesting how to organize Bible-reading groups. He outlined, then
hired an author to write, a pocket Bible guide, now published by
Doubleday.
</P>
<P>
   Stetson has been doing this sort of thing on a smaller scale for
17 years. He holds a Bible-reading group with fellow businessmen.
At St. Bartholomew's, one of the city's blue-blood Episcopal
churches, he heads the Alpha Program, teaching a course on
Christianity.
</P>
<P>
   His came into this realm from a spiritual crisis. ``In
1979-80,'' he recalled, ``I was a little bit lost. There was
something lacking in my life. I was in investment banking, moving
from one job to the next. Things that had once come easy to me were
all of a sudden difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   His mother gave him a book on Corinthians I 13, a biblical
chapter about love or charity. ``It got me so intrigued, I wanted
to read more,'' he said. ``I was ready for it.'' Soon, he figured
others were ready for it, too, and wanted to make them realize it.
</P>
<P>
   Some are leery of his campaign. Last week, the American Civil
Liberties Union sued the mayor of Gilbert, Ariz., and the state's
governor, who had been selected this year by the association to
issue the official proclamation of Bible Week. The ACLU argued the
act violated the First Amendment's separation of church and state.
A judge filed an injunction against the proclamation, pending a
hearing next month.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas May, the National Bible Association's president, is
puzzled. ``The proclamation just encourages people to read the
Bible as a source of wisdom and ethics,'' he said. ``It doesn't
encourage you to do some religious activity.''
</P>
<P>
   Laurence Tribe, professor at Harvard University Law School, who
had the proclamation read to him over the phone, agreed most of it
was ``unobjectionable, like celebrating a tradition.'' However, he
said its first paragraph _ which mentions ``the Judeo-Christian
principles upon which our nation was conceived'' _ does cross the
line.
</P>
<P>
   Stetson, a graduate of Yale University and Columbia Business
School, takes the constitutional issues seriously, and plans to
consult specialists on how to alter the language.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, Stetson wants to turn Bible Week into a ceremony as
grand as the Fourth of July. ``I was in Philadelphia around
Independence Day,'' he recalled, ``and they had 196 events going
on. I'd like to see something like that.''

A DAY OF THANKSGIVING FOR A FOUR-LEGGED FRIEND 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN LYNCH  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ He had been born Carroll E. Van Ginkel, an Iowa
farm boy, but when he entered the Marines he figured he'd knock out
a few letters. So, his first name became Carol.
</P>
<P>
   For decades thereafter, people would see the name, and they
would assume this was a woman. But he was really a large, powerful
man _ 6-feet-4-inches and 200 pounds _ who made his living in law
enforcement as a member of the U.S. Marshals Service, the Border
Patrol and the Customs Service.
</P>
<P>
   When he retired, he settled in Hanover, Pa. That's where he was
living when his wife, Dorothy, died seven years ago. Shortly
thereafter, he came to live with his daughter, Carolyn Horton, in
the Albany suburb of Delanson.
</P>
<P>
   That's when Van Ginkel fell in love again. Twice, he fell in
love, in fact.
</P>
<P>
   The objects of that affection were two small, mixed-breed dogs
named Pookie and Mollie. From the moment Van Ginkel moved in with
his daughter and her husband, Jerry, their two little dogs latched
on to him.
</P>
<P>
   They would fuss over him, follow him around. He was an old man
in failing health, deprived of the companionship of the woman with
whom he'd shared life for 55 years. But Van Ginkel still had love
to give. Somehow, these two small creatures sensed that and
responded in kind.
</P>
<P>
   Dogs are like that. Anybody who has shared quarters with one for
any length of time knows what stunningly empathic qualities they
can exhibit. There are those who find dogs annoying, and those who
believe that keeping a pet of any kind is somehow akin to slave
ownership. But there also are those who understand that the bond
between a person and a non-human companion can be every bit as
compelling and emotionally fulfilling as any link with another
human being.
</P>
<P>
   Van Ginkel was 75 when he moved to Delanson. His heart was
failing, and they soon found cancer in his lung. They removed the
lung, but it took two operations. The ordeal left him drained and
weak.
</P>
<P>
   ``He always said the reason he recovered was those two little
dogs,'' Carolyn Horton said. ``They sat in his lap every day,
comforting him and making him feel good.
</P>
<P>
   ``But as he was recovering, one of the dogs, Pookie, jumped up
on the bed one night and died.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father was a typical old Dutchman,'' Carolyn said. ``He was
very undemonstrative and stoic. But when Pookie died, he sat at the
kitchen table and cried and cried. He didn't cry any near as much
at my mother's death, even though they'd loved each other very
much. He wouldn't allow himself to do that then.
</P>
<P>
   ``He really started to deteriorate about six weeks ago. He told
me he was having trouble breathing. He was standing by the
bookcase, and he passed out.''
</P>
<P>
   Carol Van Ginkel was in and out of the hospital for the next few
weeks, fighting for breath and growing progressively weaker.
Finally, earlier this month, he entered the hospital for what he
knew would be the last time.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me that we have to talk,'' Carolyn said. ``He knew he
was dying, and we went over his will. And he cried just one more
time _ because he knew that he'd never see Mollie again. And we
cried, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Carol Van Ginkel died on Nov. 16. He was 82. His last years had
been arduous because his wife was gone and his body was betraying
him. But Thursday, on Thanksgiving, his daughter will reflect on
those years and on her own gratitude for Pookie and Mollie, the
little dogs who'd loved her father so deeply.
</P>
<P>
   And made his last years worth living.

JOHN KERRY AND A WRITER'S BIG MISTAKE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX BEAM  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I spent $50 of my publisher's money Monday night to attend a
John Kerry fund-raiser. It was a pleasant affair, with singers
Shawn Colvin and James Taylor, and comedian Robin Williams arguing,
with varying degrees of conviction, that John Forbes Kerry was a
great gift to mankind. As the evening drew to a close, Kerry
delivered a brief comedy routine of his own, ogling the assembled
$1,000-a-head fat cats and Big Labor grandees, while blathering
about the ``grass-roots'' politics that have buoyed his successive
candidacies.
</P>
<P>
   What is it about John Kerry that makes people cringe? Is it the
plastic surgery to his lantern jaw, which he claims was medically
necessary? The Super-8 movies he filmed of himself in action in
Vietnam? The ``JFK'' monogram he wore on his oxford shirts at St.
Paul's prep school? His shallow, manipulative demagoguery over the
``missing'' POWs? Or his belated admission that the medals he
jettisoned in a famous 1971 antiwar protest were not his own?
</P>
<P>
   Kerry has said that he will decide whether to run for president
within a few weeks. There is plenty of logic to a Kerry campaign.
He stood on the sidelines six years ago, and watched a little-known
governor from a rural state buck the odds and capture the White
House. Nominal front-runner Al Gore has all the charisma of ... of
a John Kerry! And our junior senator, who whinges constantly about
money, has a bank in the back room: His second wife,
heiress/philanthropist Teresa Heinz, is worth an estimated $800
million.
</P>
<P>
   Curiously, the Kerry 2000 bandwagon seems to be stuck in first
gear. Approached by a Boston Herald reporter at a Kerry function
last month, Heinz called her husband's presidential ambitions
``ridiculous.'' In the key primary state of New Hampshire, Kerry is
about as popular as the income tax. Queried about backing a Kerry
presidential run, esteemed colleagues like Ted Kennedy and Barney
Frank have adopted a wait-and-see posture.
</P>
<P>
   With friends like these, who needs hostile columnists?
</P>
<P>
   Kerry is someone who seems to make a vice of his virtues. As a
Yale undergraduate, he was a star athlete and a member of the elite
secret society Skull and Bones. ``But,'' according to Globe
reporter Charles Sennott's definitive 1996 profile of the senator,
``despite his achievements, Kerry generally was not well liked.''
(That reminds me of the phrase that dogged Texas senator Phil Gramm
during his 1996 presidential run: ``Even his friends can't stand
him.'')
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, the Globe ran an amusing account of the just-divorced
Kerry's numerous liaisons, dubbing him ``The Senate's New Romeo.''
Not for the first time, we reported that Kerry had been keeping
company with actresses Morgan Fairchild and his fellow St. Paul's
alum, Catherine Oxenberg, described by the late Globe columnist
John Robinson as ``virtually without talent in her chosen field.''
Kerry said his characterization as a rake was ``unfair,'' and then
told an editor here we should feel ``ashamed'' to have printed the
article. And we did, we did.
</P>
<P>
   Several years ago, I committed the Columnist's Big Mistake. I
flew down to Washington and had dinner with John Kerry. At the time
he was mired in his principled but quixotic pursuit of the shadowy
Bank of Credit and Commerce (remember Robert Altman, Mr. Wonder
Woman?). Guess what? He's intelligent, well mannered, whiny _ yes _
but all in all a thoughtful, decent guy. This is why writers should
never confront the targets of their scorn; we are all Will Rogers
at heart. I never met a man I thought I didn't like, whom I didn't
end up liking, a little.
</P>
<P>
   One detail of our meeting stands out clearly. George Bush's Gulf
War was still fresh in people's memories, and Bill Clinton was
suffering the quadrennial media mauling in the run-up to the New
Hampshire primary. But John Kerry bet me that the Democrats would
win the White House in 1992, which of course they did. Is it
possible that the tall, arrogant elitist John Kerry knows more
about running for president than the average-statured, arrogant
elitist Alex Beam?
</P>
<P>
   My, that would be a revelation.

DIAZ IS A BRIGHT SPOT IN `BAD THINGS' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RENEE GRAHAM  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
VERY BAD THINGS 
Written and directed by: Peter Berg 
Starring: Christian Slater, Cameron Diaz, Daniel Stern, Jon
Favreau, Jeremy Piven, Jeanne Tripplehorn, Leland Orser 
Running time: 100 minutes 
Rated: R (a graphic sex scene, profanity, oodles of bloody
violence) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Very Bad Things'' is not a very bad movie, just a relentlessly
tiring one. It's a ``Road Runner'' cartoon filtered through Quentin
Tarantino's kill-'em-with-a-weapon then kill-'em-with-laughter
approach to filmmaking. It's a brutal, pitch-black comedy that
never lets silly little things like plot and believable characters
get in the way of another senseless murder.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Berg, best known as Dr. Billy Kronk on the CBS medical
drama, ``Chicago Hope,'' makes his feature writing and directing
debut with this film about a bachelor party gone horribly awry.
Like most first-time filmmakers, he dearly wants to make a lasting
impression and fatally overshoots his target. As the film begins,
with a painfully off-key piano rendition of ``The Wedding March,''
Kyle (Jon Favreau) and Laura (Cameron Diaz) are just few days away
from tying the knot. But things seem doomed from the get-go.
</P>
<P>
   Laura is one of those women who has spent her entire life
planning her wedding, and she jumped into the project with
terrifying military precision. She is Bride-zilla, an unstoppable
force of nature who will not allow anyone or anything to screw up
her perfect day. So she's particularly ticked that Kyle plans to
head off to Las Vegas for a bachelor party with his best pals.
Laura, of course, hates his friends (she does have a point there),
and she is especially concerned that Kyle will enjoy one last love
dance with the obligatory party prostitute. She doesn't want him
saying his vows reeking from the ``stench of cheap-hotel-whore
sex.''
</P>
<P>
   But a man gotta do what a man's gotta do. Kyle hops into a
minivan with sleazebag Boyd (Christian Slater), creepy Moore
(Leland Orser), horny Mike (Jeremy Piven), and mild-mannered Adam
(Daniel Stern) for what will turn out to be a killer of a bachelor
party.
</P>
<P>
   Once they arrive in Vegas, there's booze, bongs, and blows
galore. The boys trash their room, trash each other, and quite by
accident, a stripper Boyd hired for the festivities. Adam wants to
call the cops, but Boyd has far less noble intentions. No one knew
the stripper was in the room, hence, he reasons, she's just a
``105-pound problem that has to be moved from point A to point B.''
They agree to sneak her body out of the hotel and bury her in the
Nevada desert. Cruel, but simple and clean _ that is, until a hotel
security guard investigating a report of a commotion in their suite
finds the body. Next thing, you know, he's just as dead with a
corkscrew in his heart.
</P>
<P>
   Each murder becomes an effort to conceal the original sin, and
the body count climbs until Berg starts to run out of cast members
to kill. Of course, most of the folks are so grating you wouldn't
mind someone taking a chainsaw to the whole bloody lot. Slater does
the smooth psycho thing he's been working since ``Heathers,'' a far
superior black comedy that also has murder on its mind. Stern plays
yet another nebbish, and there isn't much to distinguish the other
revelers. Berg doesn't spend nearly as much time on character
development as he spends trying to shock us with callow violence,
and more than a few jokes about handicapped children. He tosses in
some interesting camera angles, but those most often occur when
dialogue or a logical narrative fails him.
</P>
<P>
   The one true bright spot is Diaz, who just oozes screen presence
even when she's screeching like a banshee about having enough
chairs at her wedding. It's the frightening flip side of her perky
bride-to-be in 1997's ``My Best Friend's Wedding.'' She gives a
marvelously manic performance, and although it's basically a
one-note character, Diaz turns it into a symphony.

TAX CONSIDERATIONS ON SELLING SHARES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, November 29, 1998; this is the column that
normally moves Friday)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH HOOKER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I have been purchasing stocks and mutual funds shares for
several years, but I am experienced in selling them. I bought
$7,500 worth of shares of CGM Mutual fund between September of 1995
and July of 1997. During this time, I received long-term capital
gain distributions of $1,484 and short-term capital gain
distributions of $1,816. These distributions have been
automatically reinvested and I have paid income taxes each year
resulting from these distributions. I anticipate needing funds in
the spring for a different investment and am considering selling
all my shares. I prefer to complete my income tax forms myself, and
my question is how do I handle the sale? I invested a total of
$7,500 to purchase 234 shares, and these shares are worth about
$5,600 today. Through reinvestment of $3,300 in distributions, I
acquired an additional 121 shares, which would be worth $2,900 if
sold today. Thus if I sold the entire position, I would receive
about $8,500. This would appear as a $1,000 gain, but I already
have paid taxes on the $3,300 in distributions. If the
distributions are included, is my basis $10,800? If this is the
case, I would consider selling now and claiming a capital loss of
$2,300 -- thus avoiding the tax liability of distributions at the
end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; M.R. &LR; ,  &UR; Vancouver, Wash &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. The base cost for the CGM Mutual shares you own is indeed
$10,800 -- the total cost of all of your purchases, whether they
were made through direct purchases or through the reinvestment of
distributions. Thus if you sold the entire position for $8,500, you
could claim a capital loss of $2,300. (Fortunately for you, the
shares of this volatile fund have recovered strongly since you
wrote, and you would realize more than $9,000 if you sold at the
price prevailing as this is written. But in the discussion that
follows, I'll stick with the values cited in your letter.) I
understand your confusion:: How can you claim a capital loss when
you only paid $7,500 for the shares, and then you sell them for
$8,500? The answer is that reinvested distributions are no
different than direct purchases, and so you have actually paid
$10,800 for your 355 CGM Mutual shares, and thus you are entitled
to claim the capital loss.
</P>
<P>
   Effectively, what has happened is that the taxes you paid on the
distributions each year represented, from a long-term point of
view, an overpayment, and when you sell you will be able to reclaim
that overpayment through the capital loss.
</P>
<P>
   In fairness to CGM Mutual, which has been having a tough time
for the past 18 months or so, you apparently have been taking the
income distributions in cash; had you reinvested all distributions,
you would have a larger position and realize more from a sale. But
it's also fair to note that the fund's aggressive investment style
is sufficient for Morningstar Mutual Funds to note ``horrendous tax
inefficiency'' for the fund and to suggest it is best used as an
investment for a long-term tax-deferred account.
</P>
<P>
   There's one more wrinkle that you might want to consider. If you
sell only a part of your CGM Mutual holding, the tax rules allow
you a choice of two methods of allocating your base cost. The
default, which is the method used if you do not specify in writing
which shares you are selling, is to average the price paid for all
shares you hold, and then to multiply that average price times the
number of shares sold. But if you specify in writing which shares
you are selling -- carefully indicating the date of purchase -- you
can use the actual cost of the price of the shares you have sold,
and in a case such as yours, you would probably realize a larger
capital loss than you would achieve through averaging the costs.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, is it best to sell now rather than in the spring, so as
to avoid taxable distributions? My guess is that for 1998 this
won't be a big factor. As this is written, the fund has a 3.6
percent year-to-date total return. Although it's not impossible for
a fund with a modest total return to make a substantial capital
gains distribution, it's not particularly likely. The last time
this fund had a really bad year, losing 9.73 percent in 1994, there
were no capital gains distributions at all. And at the time of the
last Morningstar Mutual Funds report on the fund, dated Sept. 30,
the potential capital gains exposure for the funs was only 7
percent of assets.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, if you're pretty sure you're going to sell
early in 1999, why not indeed push the transaction forward to 1998,
thus allowing you to claim the capital loss on your 1998 tax return
rather than the 1999 return?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I have learned from you that my husband and I have too many
stock mutual funds and not enough with other types of investments.
My husband has retired from corporate life but not from work. At
age 66, he works part time counseling at a local junior college,
earning $1,200 a month, and has a consulting business which brings
in $20,000 to $30,000 annual before taxes. He also receives a $500
monthly pension. He does not see retirement in the future -- his
choice -- but I think we need to plan for the time when he may
change his mind. In that case, we would need $20,000 to $30,000 a
year to supplement our Social Security and his pension. Our
financial advisor has steered us away from GNMA and bond funds, but
I am questioning this. We have already lost money in the latest
correction and I think we need a more conservative portfolio. I
enclose a list of our investments. You will note that 23 percent of
the assets are in a trust, and I use the money there for art
expenses, since I am a semi-professional artist. I would like to
keep this money separate and pass it along to my children if it is
possible.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; M.B. &LR; ,  &UR; Brookings, Ore &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Given your particular situation, I don't necessarily agree
that you need more fixed- income funds. To begin with, I set the
conservatively-invested trust to one side, since it's your
intention to keep that separate to whatever degree is possible.
</P>
<P>
   Looking at the remaining assets, I tallied about 33 percent on
the fixed income side -- counting here your money market funds and
the 36 percent of the Vanguard Wellington fund positions which
represent fixed-income investments. A 33 percent fixed-income
holding is fairly typical for a couple of your age -- but it might
be viewed as fully adequate and even conservative since at this
stage you are not drawing upon your retirement savings, and indeed
don't expect to be drawing upon them for the foreseeable future.
</P>
<P>
   Let's suppose that you will be able to leave the non-trust
investments alone for five years. If the portfolio average return
during that period is 7 percent, you will see a gain of roughly
$100,000 during that time. (This presumes you use other funds to
pay any taxes generated from your taxable accounts.) In any event,
at that poit let's presume you begin to withdraw from the
portfolio at the rate of $25,000 a year. The funds would be
sufficient to last 41 years from that time. (But note that if you
raise withdrawals at the $30,000 annual rate, the pool would last
only a little more than 22 years, which is too close to a possible
life expectancy for most people.) Even though your portfolio seems
a little complicated at first, with 18 different holdings, I think
it's working well. For one thing, there's a good deal of
duplication of funds from category to category. I'd look at it this
way: 24 percent of the money is in Vanguard Wellington, 11 percent
in Fidelity Equity-Income II, 25 percent in money market funds, 9
percent in Fidelity Low-Priced Stock fund, and 31 percent in an
assortment of growth - oriented stock funds, with Vanguard's Index
500 fund dominating that category. They're all solid funds, and so
long as my assumption that your husband will continue to work for
at least five years, I think I agree with your financial advisor --
things are in good shape as they are.

   Q. Please comment on including Warren Buffett's Berkshire
Hathaway as part of an investment portfolio. The class A shares are
rather pricey. Do the class B shares offer the same potential?
Should these shares be viewed much like a mutual fund?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A.S. &LR; ,  &UR; Andover, Mass. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Well, Berkshire Hathaway certainly operates much like a
mutual fund with a very long- term outlook, and with the advantage
that since it isn't one, it can be more tax efficient than a fund
is likely to be. But if it were a mutual fund, it would be an
closed end fund, where share prices move as much as a function of
sentiment as the underlying value. If CEO Warren Buffett were not
at an age when most people are retired, I'd consider it an
attractive long-term holding. But he is, so I don't. I know that
it's broadly considered heresy to view a corporation as a one-man
show. Okay -- in this case, I'm a heretic.
</P>
<P>
   The class B shares of Berkshire Hathaway, which entered this
week trading at $2,244 each, have 1/30th of the value of a Class A
share, which were quoted at $67,400. But the Class B shares carry
limited voting rights, equivalent only to 1/200th of that of a
Class A share. That's the only substantive difference.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WELLESLEY, Mass. _ Dressed in a saffron robe and sitting on a
couch in this sprawling home, Lama Zopa Rinpoche holds court for a
steady stream of visitors who treat him like a wise grandfather.
</P>
<P>
   In one sense, Rinpoche, 58, is the patriarch of the family.
</P>
<P>
   But this is a family united by beliefs, not blood. Rinpoche, a
Tibetan Buddhist monk, has played a key role in bringing Buddhism
from the Himalayan highlands to the West.
</P>
<P>
   Rinpoche, a close spiritual ally of the Dalai Lama, is at the
head of a growing Buddhist organization with thousands of members
across the country.
</P>
<P>
   With its emphasis on practical exercises to cope with stress,
Buddhism has found an ideal spiritual home in a society where
stress from the demands of family and work is a daily fact of life
for many Americans.
</P>
<P>
   In Buddhism, an increasing number of practitioners are finding a
theological system that satisfies their yearning for spiritual
fulfillment, without the institutional qualities of most Western
religions.
</P>
<P>
   Buddhist masters such as Rinpoche draw loyal followings whenever
they travel across the United States. Some 200 people are expected
to attend the extensive Buddhist teachings Rinpoche, who lives in
India, is leading today through Thursday in Cambridge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many people cannot find answers for life's problems in
science, education, or their jobs so they are interested in
Buddhism,'' said Rinpoche. ``This is not to say that there are not
many good things in, for example, Christianity. But maybe one
cannot find all the answers there. Buddhism offers ways to cure
people of their sickness _ mental, physical, spiritual, everything.
It can fill that emptiness that many people say they feel inside
their heart.''
</P>
<P>
   The diminutive monk gives one concrete example of Buddhist
teaching when asked how one should deal with anger. Eyes closed,
head bowed, Rinpoche reflects silently for a moment. Then, leaning
forward, he says:
</P>
<P>
   ``If someone beats you with a stick would you get angry at the
stick? No. Why? Because the stick has no control over its actions.
In the same way the person that doesn't love you, that abuses you,
that hurts you, that person is completely under the control of
their anger. That person is a total slave to anger. This person has
no freedom. Therefore, the right response is compassion. You must
help the person find how to be free from their anger. You must help
the person find peace.''
</P>
<P>
   Rinpoche, who is regarded by followers as the reincarnation of
an important Tibetan Buddhist master, is spiritual director of the
Foundation for the Preservation of Mahayana Tradition, which has
110 centers worldwide including the Kurukulla Center in Cambridge.
</P>
<P>
   Mahayana is the school of Buddhism prominent in Tibet, Mongolia,
China, South Korea, Vietnam, and Japan. One of the school's most
essential teachings is the ``Great Compassion,'' the overriding
requirement that practioners practice compassion for all living
beings.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Mahayana stresses that an individual's ultimate personal
goal, nirvana, cannot be achieved until all living beings are freed
from suffering.
</P>
<P>
   Nirvana is defined as the complete detachment from this world
and all pain and desire, leading to an eternal blissful condition.
Buddhists believe in rebirth and reincarnation because it can take
many ``lifetimes'' of work and meditation to achieve nirvana.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Buddhism's rising popularity in America, Rinpoche
worries too many practioners are reducing Mahayana solely to
meditation. ``It is not true that you can meditate without working
on your external or moral life,'' Rinpoche said. ``If you do not
give shelter, food, justice, love, to those who need it, then that
is not practicing a moral life. You are missing the essence of
Buddhism.''
</P>
<P>
   A mind without moral discipline, Rinpoche instructs, is like a
pool of dirty water. ``You can't see anthing through the water
because of all the dirt, but a pure mind is like clean water; you
can see things perfectly because you are unobstructed by negative
thoughts or actions. The purpose of meditation is not just to relax
or to have peace of mind. The purpose is to achieve all those
things so that we can be useful to others. This is what we teach.
And it is much work.''

IT'S POLITICAL FOOTBALL IN CHAMPIONS LEAGUE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Galatasaray-Juventus match in the Champions League has been
postponed from Nov. 25 to Dec. 2 because of capital punishment.
Sort of.
</P>
<P>
   The official reason, according to UEFA headquarters, is ``the
deterioration of relations between Turkey and Italy,'' stemming
from the Italians' refusal to extradite Abdullah Ocalan. Italy's
constitution outlaws the death penalty, and its justice system is
obligated to not extradite to countries that allow capital
punishment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am profoundly sorry,'' said Italy's president, Massimo
D'Alema, ``but we cannot violate the Constitution, even if an ally
asks us to.''
</P>
<P>
   Such a concept is not easily accepted these days in Turkey,
where Ocalan is wanted for terrorist activities in the name of the
PKK Kurdistan Workers Party.
</P>
<P>
   Italian flags are being burned, products boycotted, and a
television commercial shows images of dead children, Ocalan, and a
plate of spaghetti with blood, with the message to Italy: ``You
should clean your pasta.''
</P>
<P>
   Near one of the dozens of Istanbul's Benetton stores, which have
covered their windows in black, Juventus shirts are being sold ``so
you can burn them,'' according to the proprietor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm afraid, I admit it,'' Juventus' French midfielder Zinedine
Zidane told La Gazzetta dello Sport.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Juventus cannot play in Istanbul, it could be the end of
soccer,'' Galatasaray coach Fatih Terim said. ``Why? Only
Galatasaray can calm all this tension.''
</P>
<P>
   When the teams finally do play, the match could become a symbol
for peaceful co-existence and understanding. Unfortunately,
Juventus' players are feeling threatened, and many of them are not
even Italian.
</P>
<P>
   ``Juventus made a mistake cancelling our welcome banquet and
seeking a neutral field,'' Galatasaray director of sport Mete
Razlikli said. ``Why? For a peaceful demonstration of 100,000
people in a city of 13 million. What do they want _ Ireland?''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Whither Ronaldo?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The failure of Brazil's national team and the virtual
disappearance of Ronaldo has not been adequately explained more
than four months after the World Cup final in Saint-Denis.
</P>
<P>
   But whether Ronaldo was drugged, spell-bound, or a combination
of factors sabotaged the Brazilians, Ronaldo should not have been
on the field for 90 minutes. Since that game, Ronaldo seldom has
performed.
</P>
<P>
   Ronaldo was burned out, mentally and physically. Roberto Baggio
was in a similar position in 1994. And after Italy lost to Brazil
in the final in Pasadena, Baggio required nearly a full season to
recover.
</P>
<P>
   Inter allowed Ronaldo to report late to training camp. In fact,
Ronaldo was absent when the team was playing its opening Champions
League matches in late August. He has been so out of form that his
orthopedist from Brazil was called in last week to consider knee
surgery.
</P>
<P>
   The surgery was ruled out, but Ronaldo was absent as Inter lost,
3-1, to first-place Fiorentina Sunday. But Ronaldo is expected to
return against Real Madrid in the Champions League Wednesday in
Milan.
</P>
<P>
   This could be an opportune moment. Real Madrid has been
struggling. In the last seven games, it has earned 8 points and
surrendered 13 goals. Fernando Hierro, the captain, has been
injured and the central defense appears slow. Much of the blame has
fallen on Sanchis, who nearly came to blows with Dutchman Clarence
Seedorf during a 3-1 loss to Valencia, and Fernando Sanz, son of
club president Lorenzo Sanz. The Valencia victory was considered a
positive sign for Inter because Valencia's tactics were designed by
Italian coach Claudio Ranieri.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Multiple choice
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Major League Soccer is among the few leagues that allows
multiple ownership of teams. Revenue sharing has been formalized on
all fronts under the single-entity structure of the league, so the
teams all belong to one ownership group.
</P>
<P>
   The Lamar Hunt family owns the Columbus Crew and Kansas City
Wizards; Philip Anschutz' Sports Enterprises controls Chicago,
Colorado, and Los Angeles; and now the Kraft Sports Group has added
the San Jose Clash to its ownership of the Revolution.
</P>
<P>
   Hunt invested in two franchises when the MLS began in 1996.
Other original investors were allowed to purchase the rights to
expansion teams under their initial investment terms, and Anschutz
paid $5 million for the Chicago Fire. Anschutz was so encouraged by
the success of the Fire that he offered to buy out Marc Rappaport,
whose group had purchased the Los Angeles Galaxy. But the
``original investor'' clause did not apply this time, and Anschutz
paid $26 million for the Galaxy.
</P>
<P>
   The Krafts stepped in after Dentsu Inc. financing failed in San
Jose, but the ``original investor'' clause did not apply since this
was not an expansion team.
</P>
<P>
   ``They paid about the same price as Anschutz paid for the
Galaxy,'' a Kraft spokesman said. ``They would love to be able to
buy a soccer team for $5 million, but that's just not possible.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Krafts received significant concessions. They paid a
comparatively low up-front amount of cash, and received credit for
capital investments in the league itself.

parenting's dirty little secrets is that everyone (OK, almost
everyone) bribes their kids. Not always, but sometimes. Most of us
sheepishly admit that we feel guilty resorting to bribes and wish
our kids would do the right thing simply because they want to.
</P>
<P>
   But here's another little secret: While they don't advocate
bribery, many childrearing experts believe that positive
reinforcement in the form of incentives or rewards _ used
judiciously _ can be a powerful discipline tool.
</P>
<P>
   ``If dangling a treat or a toy in front of your child becomes a
habit _ if you can't persuade him to consistently use good manners,
clean up his room, or leave Toys' R Us unless you buy him a fire
truck _ then the system won't work,'' says Dr. Charles Scott,
assistant professor of psychiatry at the University of California
at Davis. ``But parents needn't feel guilty if they use rewards
once in a while.''
</P>
<P>
   The trouble is, many parents find the distinction between
bribery and positive reinforcement hard to make. ``There's a big
difference,'' says Dr. Harold Koplewicz, director of the New York
University Child Study Center in New York City. ``A bribe is giving
your child something he doesn't deserve. When you bribe a child, he
doesn't really feel responsible for his behavior, he'll do
something because there's a payoff.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, positive reinforcement is given because of
hard work or a change in behavior noted over time. ``An incentive
acknowledges consistent progress. A reward marks achievement,''
Koplewicz explains. ``The difference _ and it's a critical one _ is
that the child has earned it.'' He'll eventually realize that
cooperating makes him feel good about himself, so good that the
behavior becomes automatic and you can eliminate the reward.
</P>
<P>
   Positive reinforcement can also help children understand that
sometimes we have to do things we don't want to do, things that are
boring or difficult. ``If a 7- year-old is struggling with math
problems, he may lose all interest in trying to solve them,'' says
Koplewicz. ``There is nothing wrong with using a carrot to get the
donkey moving again.'' In this way, you may be able to kindle a
child's interest long enough for him to reach the real goal: his
personal pleasure and pride in mastering a subject.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rewards and incentives both require time, perseverance, and a
well-thought-out plan that's followed consistently,'' notes
Koplewicz. ``Unfortunately, most parents either use rewards
indiscriminately or fail to stick with the program long enough for
a child to incorporate the new behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   What's more, not every behavior can be modified by using
rewards. ``Toilet training and getting a child to eat healthy meals
are critical for parents, but a child must be developmentally ready
to accept responsibility for her own body and be able to recognize
that she has the internal control to do so,'' says Patricia
Henderson Shimm, associate director of the Toddler Center at
Barnard College in New York City. ``Prompting a reluctant eater to
finish her peas by promising her some dessert afterward, or trying
to get a toddler to use the potty by offering her 'big girl
panties,' may set you up for a power struggle later on. When it's
more the parent's issue than the child's, rewards will not work.''
</P>
<P>
   While you're the one who decides whether (and how) to use
rewards, the following guidelines will help you set up an approach
that works for your family:
</P>
<P>
   _ Consider what's really important to you. For Joanne, a
Baltimore mother, what's important is that her sons, ages 4 and 6,
be gracious when they visit her in-laws, ``or when we're going to a
family event where I know that my kids and my parenting skills are
on view. I want my mother-in-law in particular to see that I'm
doing a good job,'' she says. ``So I tell my kids that if they make
an effort to talk to their grandparents instead of zoning out in
front of the TV, then the next day we'll get the new video they've
been asking for. I know it's more for me than for them, but it's
the only time I do it, and I've decided it's worth it.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Identify an appropriate reward. ``Many parents lament, 'He
wants for nothing,''' says Koplewicz. ``But simply spending time
with a child, going Rollerblading in the park, playing a board game
or baking cookies can be a potent incentive for even the most
gadget-laden children. Hugs, kisses, and words of praise _ you
can't really beat parental approval and recognition.
</P>
<P>
   _ Devise a system to track progress. Toddlers, preschoolers and
school-age children respond well to visual cues. Charts with stars
and stickers or a jar that gradually fills with checkers are
concrete signs of progress. Once the new behavior becomes routine,
the pride your child takes in mastering a difficult task will
trigger intrinsic feelings of self-worth.
</P>
<P>
   _ Don't overdo it. ``I used to be a drill sergeant in the
morning, and my harangues were totally unproductive,'' says Claire,
a clinical social worker in Washington, D.C., and the mother of
Sam, 7, and Jessica, 5. ``Often, the only way I got the kids out of
the house on time was to promise one thing or another. And I
resented it.''
</P>
<P>
   Then she had an insight: ``I realized I wasn't respecting their
needs,'' she says. ``Sam's priority was to play Nerf basketball,
and Jessica wanted to color.'' Enlightened, Claire was able to
reframe her requests. She told her kids, ``We're a team, so we need
to work together. Here's the deal: If you can be ready to go by 8
o'clock, then you can have 10 minutes to do whatever you want.'' It
worked.
</P>
<P>
   If you've become an inveterate briber, stop immediately.
Whenever your child demands a reward, make it clear that good
behavior and extra effort will be rewarded sometimes, but not
always, and never on demand.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, remember that rewards and incentives are only two of
the strategies you can use to instill cooperation in your child.

JOHN KERRY AND A WRITER'S BIG MISTAKE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX BEAM  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I spent $50 of my publisher's money Monday night to attend a
John Kerry fund-raiser. It was a pleasant affair, with singers
Shawn Colvin and James Taylor, and comedian Robin Williams arguing,
with varying degrees of conviction, that John Forbes Kerry was a
great gift to mankind. As the evening drew to a close, Kerry
delivered a brief comedy routine of his own, ogling the assembled
$1,000-a-head fat cats and Big Labor grandees, while blathering
about the ``grass-roots'' politics that have buoyed his successive
candidacies.
</P>
<P>
   What is it about John Kerry that makes people cringe? Is it the
plastic surgery to his lantern jaw, which he claims was medically
necessary? The Super-8 movies he filmed of himself in action in
Vietnam? The ``JFK'' monogram he wore on his oxford shirts at St.
Paul's prep school? His shallow, manipulative demagoguery over the
``missing'' POWs? Or his belated admission that the medals he
jettisoned in a famous 1971 antiwar protest were not his own?
</P>
<P>
   Kerry has said that he will decide whether to run for president
within a few weeks. There is plenty of logic to a Kerry campaign.
He stood on the sidelines six years ago, and watched a little-known
governor from a rural state buck the odds and capture the White
House. Nominal front-runner Al Gore has all the charisma of ... of
a John Kerry! And our junior senator, who whinges constantly about
money, has a bank in the back room: His second wife,
heiress/philanthropist Teresa Heinz, is worth an estimated $800
million.
</P>
<P>
   Curiously, the Kerry 2000 bandwagon seems to be stuck in first
gear. Approached by a Boston Herald reporter at a Kerry function
last month, Heinz called her husband's presidential ambitions
``ridiculous.'' In the key primary state of New Hampshire, Kerry is
about as popular as the income tax. Queried about backing a Kerry
presidential run, esteemed colleagues like Ted Kennedy and Barney
Frank have adopted a wait-and-see posture.
</P>
<P>
   With friends like these, who needs hostile columnists?
</P>
<P>
   Kerry is someone who seems to make a vice of his virtues. As a
Yale undergraduate, he was a star athlete and a member of the elite
secret society Skull and Bones. ``But,'' according to Globe
reporter Charles Sennott's definitive 1996 profile of the senator,
``despite his achievements, Kerry generally was not well liked.''
(That reminds me of the phrase that dogged Texas senator Phil Gramm
during his 1996 presidential run: ``Even his friends can't stand
him.'')
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, the Globe ran an amusing account of the just-divorced
Kerry's numerous liaisons, dubbing him ``The Senate's New Romeo.''
Not for the first time, we reported that Kerry had been keeping
company with actresses Morgan Fairchild and his fellow St. Paul's
alum, Catherine Oxenberg, described by the late Globe columnist
John Robinson as ``virtually without talent in her chosen field.''
Kerry said his characterization as a rake was ``unfair,'' and then
told an editor here we should feel ``ashamed'' to have printed the
article. And we did, we did.
</P>
<P>
   Several years ago, I committed the Columnist's Big Mistake. I
flew down to Washington and had dinner with John Kerry. At the time
he was mired in his principled but quixotic pursuit of the shadowy
Bank of Credit and Commerce (remember Robert Altman, Mr. Wonder
Woman?). Guess what? He's intelligent, well mannered, whiny _ yes _
but all in all a thoughtful, decent guy. This is why writers should
never confront the targets of their scorn; we are all Will Rogers
at heart. I never met a man I thought I didn't like, whom I didn't
end up liking, a little.
</P>
<P>
   One detail of our meeting stands out clearly. George Bush's Gulf
War was still fresh in people's memories, and Bill Clinton was
suffering the quadrennial media mauling in the run-up to the New
Hampshire primary. But John Kerry bet me that the Democrats would
win the White House in 1992, which of course they did. Is it
possible that the tall, arrogant elitist John Kerry knows more
about running for president than the average-statured, arrogant
elitist Alex Beam?
</P>
<P>
   My, that would be a revelation.

THE LOST VIRTUES OF HEADGEAR
</HEADLINE>
  By ANNE HOLLANDER 
 c.1998 Slate 
 World rights 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hats arouse fully as much feeling as hairstyles--or they would
if enough of them were being worn. For 30 years we have been living
in the Bareheaded Age, worrying intensely about our hair. Many of
us don't even remember the time when people would no more go
outdoors without a hat than they would without shoes.
</P>
<P>
   The exact character of your hat mattered a lot then, much as the
look of your hair does now. Your hat confirmed your outfit, putting
the final seal on whatever else you wore, crowning your image and
arming your ego for social and professional life--or just for
itself. During the summer in the country, my grandfather would put
on his hat to go down to the end of the driveway and get the
letters out of the mailbox. I would laugh at him, free of the
requirement myself; but in his youth, even kids wore hats whenever
they went outdoors.
</P>
<P>
   Hair rose up and drove out hats in the 1960s--rose up, spread
out, and flowed down in merciless torrents, sweeping away
conventional hats as if they represented all that was loathsome in
civilized life. A few cute hats, most of them faintly satirical,
costumey, and historical, were worn by a few cute people for
momentary effect. But the old hat rule was swiftly abolished. Off
came the top hat at the opera and the elegant homburg or fedora for
street wear, along with the whole range of casual hats and caps for
men.
</P>
<P>
   Swept away, too, were all the charming, infinitely various
feminine hats that once made women feel charming and infinitely
various themselves. Common usage once allowed hat makers to find
markets for many heterogeneous styles, for much discreetly
suggestive fantasy in shape and trim. Absurdity was the obvious
risk then, given the vast scope of hat design for women. Danny Kaye
once sang of ``The little ones, the big ones, the sat-on-by-a-pig
ones,/
</P>
<P>
   The foolish ones that perch, and the ghoulish ones that lurch.''
</P>
<P>
   But a man might still be seduced by an irresistible feminine
brim, curving and dipping to offset a meaningful glance. The
desired effect appeared in the movies on the heads of Greta Garbo
and Marlene Dietrich and their glamorous colleagues, such as Gene
Tierney in Laura in her scene at the Algonquin with Clifton Webb.
</P>
<P>
   Along with much else, women's hats are no longer a normal part
of the mating game. Women's hats are out there, but they're all
optional, and the range has shrunk. They come in very few basic
shapes (like dresses), and nobody gets any basic training in hat
choice or hat management, since real allure is felt to reside in
hair, not in hats. Real absurdity, too, of course.
</P>
<P>
   But winter is coming. The Hair Revolution was no help in bitter
weather, and for a while everybody but Floridians and Californians
simply froze above the neck. Lately healthy, utilitarian hats have
returned in force, along with athletic footgear and down jackets,
and there's even a certain limited stylishness in recent examples.
Fur is back, too, as are delicious pile fabrics, so that luxury can
be combined with utility. Meanwhile thousands of watch caps,
ear-flap caps, and wool berets are available from street vendors to
provide instant warmth for passers-by without much regard for
expressive charm. In this day of virtual uniformity, it's curious
that whenever a woman wears any hat at all, somebody is bound to
say, ``I love your hat!''--as if out of subliminal nostalgia for
the truly great days.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody says this to men about their baseball caps, the ubiquity
of which has reduced choices for men just as general hatlessness
has diminished the possibilities for women. What are old-fashioned
hat-loving men to do? Classic hats appear pretentious and
dandified. But such men could never wear--can barely
stomach--headgear with the inelegance, the laddishness, the
rakishness, the nerve of a baseball cap, especially one worn
backward.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, let us hope that the Return of the Hat is at hand,
inaugurated by men in their baseball caps, just as the strongest
and longest-lasting fashion changes always have been inspired by
men. The hat itself was a male invention and a male privilege until
women got tired of coifs, veils and wimples in the Renaissance.
Then they daringly adopted hats to profit from the erotic charge
male elements always add to feminine modes. Many women have done
this again in the last decade or so, usually sticking to masculine
sports hat shapes, baseball caps among them, or east European
rabbinical effects to combat the cold blast.
</P>
<P>
   I bought a fine example of that kind of winter hat. It surrounds
my head in a warm nimbus of fake fur, my brow, ears, and nape
encompassed by golden foxy fleece, my pate upholstered with plushy
leopard pelt, my beardless face mitigating the rabbinical flavor.
I've also acquired a neat hat that makes a black, furry sphere out
of my whole skull, leaving some wisps of my hair to curl up my
cheeks and down my forehead, Russian heroine style. More risky,
since I'm not tall, is my cavalier hat in silvery, streaked brown
and black velvet, with a biggish mobile brim for folding up and
down at will, fore and aft or amidships.
</P>
<P>
   Short, small women have to remember that they can quickly
resemble a mushroom in anything too big or a child in anything too
cute. Medium-sized or large and tall women have no such problem and
tend to look good in any kind of hat. They only have to remember to
let enough of their face show and not to let the hat flatten them
on top, so that their full-sized, shapely head and speaking eyes
will support the hat's dashing impact, and the hat itself won't
appear to jam a lid on the body's expressive means.
</P>
<P>
   Advice to all: Study the older royals for the way they manage
good proportions, especially the British Queen Mum, and don't
forget to study your own full-length hatted reflection--front,
back, and profile--before hitting the street. Absurdity forever
lurks.

POLITICAL KILLINGS LEAVE RUSSIA CHILLED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID FILIPOV  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ It was a rare public outpouring of grief for a country
all too familiar with gangland-style slayings of its political and
business leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of mourners paid their last respects Tuesday to Galina
Starovoitova, a prominent liberal legislator gunned down outside
her St. Petersburg apartment Friday night in an apparent contract
murder.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands more lined the streets outside the hall where
Starovoitova's body lay in state, their numbers forcing a
three-hour delay of the funeral. Many mourners carried banners
expressing shock and outrage, which the country's leaders, many of
them longtime allies of the slain lawmaker, for once seemed to
share sincerely.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are killing our comrades, our friends,'' said Anatoly
Chubais, a former deputy prime minister who now heads Russia's
electricity monopoly. ``Do they want to stop us? Do they want to
scare us? They will not succeed.''
</P>
<P>
   But as the sun set on St. Petersburg, and Starovoitova was laid
to rest in the Alexander Nevsky monastery, their indignation was
subsumed by a deeper sense of helplessness about a crime wave that
no one in Russia appears able to stop.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole system of power in Russia is rotten,'' said Andrei
Piontkowski, a well-known Moscow political analyst. ``What we are
seeing is systemic chaos, not a conspiracy.''
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of leading Russian businessmen, journalists, politicians,
and political aides have been killed in recent years. No major
murder case has been solved. Many of the killings have involved
business dealings gone bad, an ugly side effect of a lawless
society in which contract disputes often end in contract murders.
</P>
<P>
   The 52-year-old Starovoitova (pronounced stah-rah-VOY-tah-vah)
was the sixth member of the Russian parliament assassinated since
1993. Her spokesman, Ruslan Linkov, 27, barely survived the same
attack. At least 15 legislative aides have been killed in the past
two years.
</P>
<P>
   She was also the sixth prominent figure to be attacked _ and the
third killed _ in recent weeks in St. Petersburg, which is
preparing for local elections on December 6. The newspaper Segodnya
Tuesday called the fight for seats ``the dirtiest election campaign
in the history of Russia.''
</P>
<P>
   While Starovoitova was not believed to have business interests,
she was one of the leaders of an electoral bloc that hopes to win a
majority of the city's 50 districts. Control of the Baltic port's
lucrative trade and customs business is at stake. Boris Nemtsov, a
former deputy prime minister, said the city reminded him of
``Chicago in the 1920s.'' Many observers think Starovoitova was
getting in the way of powerful criminal clans who hoped to place
their candidates in the legislature.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's leading political forces have come up with other
theories to explain the shooting. Chubais and other liberals have
blamed ``Communists'' on the grounds that Starovoitova frequently
criticized them. Severnaya Stolitsa, a St. Petersburg newspaper
that she published, recently accused the Communist speaker of the
lower house of parliament, Gennady Seleznyov, of extorting the
city's businesses for campaign contributions.
</P>
<P>
   Seleznyov countered that ``democrats'' allied with Starovoitova
could have had her killed to attract public attention and sympathy.
He also said he planned to sue the paper.
</P>
<P>
   Other observers think the problem goes deeper than political
affiliations and power struggles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Evil fears no one in today's Russia. It is convinced of its
invulnerability,'' commented the newspaper Izvestia in an
editorial. ``This means that Russia is no longer a state. It is
dead.''
</P>
<P>
   President Boris Yeltsin appears powerless to do anything about
the situation. He came to power with the support of the democratic
movement Starovoitova helped form and later employed her as his
adviser on ethnic issues. Yeltsin was hospitalized on Sunday with
pneumonia, which his spokesman said was brought on by
Starovoitova's death. While Yeltsin found the strength to host
President Jiang Zemin of China in his hospital room, he has not
addressed the nation on television about Starovoitova's slaying.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the Kremlin issued a statement saying Yeltsin was
taking personal control of the investigation. Yeltsin said the same
thing after the 1995 murder of popular television host Vladislav
Litsyev, who was shot outside his Moscow home, and the 1995 killing
of reporter Dmitry Kholodov, who was blown in half by a suitcase
bomb. Neither murder has been solved.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Security Service, the successor of the once dreaded
KGB, has been put in charge of the investigation of Starovoitova's
murder. That order came just days after a group of former agents
accused leaders of the FSB, as the service is known in Russia, of
ordering contract murders for profit for crime gangs.
</P>
<P>
   For the past week, the agents have appeared in press conferences
and on Russia's main national television network, sometimes wearing
dark glasses and ski masks to protect their identities, to provide
details of assassination orders they claim to have received from
former FSB director Nikolai Kovalyov and others.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin has promised to look into these allegations as well. But
so far, the only threat of legal action has come from Kovalyov, who
has said he will sue the television station's owner, prominent
financier Boris Berezovsky.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the chief of Russia's police force, Interior Minister
Sergei Stepashin, has promised to spare no effort to find
Starovoitova's killers, and he dispatched a small army of
investigators and forensic experts to the scene.
</P>
<P>
   Police lost valuable time in the hours after the shooting,
almost guaranteeing the killers' escape. They ordered a dragnet to
catch the gunmen, but officers were not told whom they were looking
for, the newspaper Nezavisimaya Gazeta reported. The paper and
other sources said the investigation of the crime scene only began
eight hours after the shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov called for ``extreme
measures'' to deal with crime. The term has a scary ring to it,
given Russia's history of purges, and critics charged that the
Communists missed a chance to show their commitment to law and
order when they failed to censure one of their members of
parliament, retired General Albert Makashov, for a string of
anti-Semitic public comments.
</P>
<P>
   Starovoitova's allies noted that she had sharply criticized
Makashov in parliament.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every unsolved contract murder is a straight path to the next
one,'' Chubais mused Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   But Chubais, too, has critics who say he himself has concealed
knowledge of contract murders for murky political goals. One of
them, investigative journalist Alexander Minkin, on Monday
published a transcript of what he said was a 1996 conversation
between Chubais and other top officials about murders carried out
by Kremlin security chiefs. In the transcript, which Minkin said
was obtained by security officials, Chubais allegedly hints he is
keeping documents proving the murders secret to protect himself
from retribution. Chubais denied the allegations when they first
appeared two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   But Minkin's conclusion, one probably shared by most Russians,
is that there are no white knights among Russia's current leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``In (parliament), in the government, in the Kremlin, they are
only concerned with themselves, their successes, their
well-being,'' Minkin observed.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday in St. Petersburg, an unknown gunman fired several
rounds into the apartment of Konstantin Serov, a member of the city
legislature and a candidate for the Dec. 6 elections. He was
unhurt.

EDUCATORS SPLIT ON MAKING STATE TESTS A CLASS SUBJECT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JORDANA HART  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Although Massachusetts teachers are divided on whether
to ``teach to the test'' to boost scores on the statewide exams for
fourth-, eighth-, and 10th-graders, many educators say the test is
so broad that teaching to it could benefit many classrooms.
</P>
<P>
   The release next month of MCAS scores showing how each student,
school, and district performed is expected to pressure teachers to
boost their pupils' scores by teaching as specifically to the test
as they can.
</P>
<P>
   In statewide results released on Monday, a majority of students
scored in the ``failing'' or ``needs improvement'' categories in
English, math, and science, with one exception: Most eighth-graders
did well in English.
</P>
<P>
   In recent interviews, several educators said that if the
Massachusetts Comprehensive Assessment System effectively tests
critical thinking, analysis, and writing, then teaching to it could
only improve education.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the MCAS, it is not teaching to the test. It is teaching
kids to think and take risks,'' said Althea Brown, who teaches
ninth- and 10th-grade science at Medford High School.
</P>
<P>
   Said Boston School Superintendent Thomas W. Payzant, ``If you
are teaching them to write a decent essay or helping them learn to
answer key questions in a lesson ... then they should be able to
transfer those skills to any unknown question on the test.''
</P>
<P>
   But not all parents and educators are ready to see classes and
teaching methods altered especially for the MCAS, given that the
test was just taken for the first time in May.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is everybody performing for the right reasons?'' said Joyce
Knippenberg, a parent, former high school teacher, and president of
the Massachusetts Parent-Teacher Organization. ``I disagree with
teaching to the test because you are giving the wrong motivation,
and students pick that up.''
</P>
<P>
   This week, a cadre of education luminaries on an ad hoc
committee on MCAS dismissed the test as ``poorly written, filled
with trivia and ambiguities, excessively long, and (lacking) a
recognizable educational purpose.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, committee member Vito Perrone, director of teacher
education at Harvard Graduate School of Education, said the test
``looks very much like other standardized tests I have reviewed. It
is eminently coachable. It is possible to teach to this test
without teaching very much.''
</P>
<P>
   Perrone said that if states continue to depend on the
``multiple-choice, single right-answer, and limited choice test
format, it will be difficult to get at higher-level thinking,
understanding, and those things we most want.''
</P>
<P>
   The state's interim education commissioner, David Driscoll,
praised the test, but noted that it is not _ and should not be _
the only assessment of children. Assessment ``goes on every day,
every minute. This test is part of that,'' Driscoll said.
</P>
<P>
   But many educators who ardently oppose teaching to most
standardized tests say the MCAS may be an exception: a welcome
change from the ``drill and grill'' that has long dominated
American education.
</P>
<P>
   The MCAS exams, which take 12 to 17 hours over three weeks, use
many open-ended and essay questions, even in math. For the first
time in Massachusetts on a standardized test, students have had to
explain their answer to a math or science problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``The world of MCAS has changed a lot of people's minds about
teaching to the test,'' said Wayne Sylvester, chairman of the
social studies department at Pentucket Regional High School in West
Newbury. ``Private schools for years have stopped what they are
doing and prepped for SATs, but public schools never did that. MCAS
has changed everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Recent studies show that nationally, the practice of drilling
children for standardized tests is widespread, particularly in
preparing students for tests tied to high school graduation, as the
MCAS will be for 10th-graders beginning in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   But these studies indicate that coaching, while it can boost
test scores, rarely improves a student's genuine knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   A 1997 National Science Foundation test-taking study found that
such preparation goes on more often in districts with high
proportions of poor and minority pupils. About 60 percent of
teachers with many black and Latino students in class reported more
use of drilling and rote learning to prepare, and most said they
began preparing students as much as a month in advance.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a fair amount of evidence that you can boost scores
on high-stakes tests without really teaching students the
underlying skills,'' said Walter Haney, a Boston College professor.
``But because the MCAS uses three different formats to test kids'
knowledge, there's less danger of ill effects.''
</P>
<P>
   Perrone and others say the MCAS is still unproven as a measure
of student ability. Further, educators say it makes no sense to
change classroom practices now because districts are still matching
curriculums to the new state requirements.

IN BRITAIN, BUSH BROTHERS' ADVICE IS IN DEMAND 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (i and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe

<P>
   LONDON _ Trailing badly in opinion polls, and desperate for an
effective message against one of the most popular British
governments in memory, Britain's Conservative Party is turning to
the sons of former US President George Bush for advice on how to
sell ``compassionate conservatism.''
</P>
<P>
   Conservative Party leader William Hague plans to visit Texas
Governor George W. Bush in Austin early next year to learn how Bush
and his brother, Jeb, who was recently elected governor of Florida,
fared so well in elections earlier this month while hard-line
Republicans did so poorly.
</P>
<P>
   Hague's aides confirm that he spoke with George W. Bush after
the latter's landslide reelection and that the Conservatives indeed
can glean much from how both Bush brothers distanced themselves
from the more extreme elements of the Republican Party bent on
making the congressional elections a referendum on the impeachment
of President Clinton over his sexual conduct.
</P>
<P>
   While George W. Bush has presided over more executions than any
other American governor, Conservative strategists consider him to
be the embodiment of ``compassionate conservatism'' and are
intrigued by his ``inclusive politics.'' Like Bush, Hague is wary
of the religious right wing of his party and has sought to portray
himself as more tolerant of homosexual and abortion rights than
previous Conservative leaders.
</P>
<P>
   In appealing to successful American conservatives for help,
however, Hague may only arm critics who charge that he has no new
ideas of his own. But then Blair and his advisers consulted
extensively with the Clinton administration while preparing their
1997 campaign for Parliament, which resulted in the Tories'
humiliation and the biggest parliamentary Labor majority in nearly
two centuries.
</P>
<P>
   There exists a prior relationship between the Bush political
machine and the Tories. In 1992, advisers to Prime Minister John
Major made no secret of their preference for George Bush over
Clinton as president, and they helped the Republican campaign. As a
result, Clinton's advisers harbored a grudge, which occasionally
surfaced when Clinton and Major talked about Northern Ireland and
other matters of mutual interest.
</P>
<P>
   The significance of Hague turning to the Bush brothers for
advice merited front-page coverage Tuesday in The Daily Telegraph,
the newspaper most closely associated with Tory thinking. Questions
about the trip were referred to Hague's press secretary, Gregor
Mackay, who did not return telephone calls seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   Like Clinton, Blair moved a dogmatically liberal Labor Party
toward the center to seize victory. After 18 years in power, the
Tories have been slow to remount an effective opposition to Labor.
Major resigned after the electoral drubbing, and Hague, who is
described as youthful by supporters and boyish by detractors, has
tried to be statesmanlike while his party continues to mutiny over
Britain's role in the European Union.
</P>
<P>
   Euro-skeptics are now firmly in control of the Conservative
Party. They vow to frustrate Blair's attempts to integrate Britain
more deeply in Europe and get rid of the 759 members of the
1,164-member House of Lords who inherit their seats. Only 17 of
those so-called hereditary peers are Labor supporters, while the
overwhelming majority have traditional ties to the Conservative
Party.
</P>
<P>
   Hague's plans to consult with successful American conservatives
underscores the plight of European conservatives, who are in
opposition in every major European country except Spain. While the
British parliamentary system is far closer to those in Europe, the
Tories apparently believe the only worthwhile advice to be had is
in the United States.

PROGRAM SEEKS TO EDUCATE CLERGY ON DOMESTIC ABUSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIEGO RIBADENEIRA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Victims of domestic violence sit in their pastors'
pews, listen to their sermons, have them baptize their children.
</P>
<P>
   But when those same women go to their pastors after being abused
by their husbands or boyfriends, they have sometimes been told to,
`turn the other cheek.'
</P>
<P>
   For many clergy members there has long been tension between a
religious desire to maintain the sanctity of a marriage, and
personal concern for the safety of battered women.
</P>
<P>
   Today, after years of trying to grapple with the issue, an
increasing number of clergy members are conceding they have done a
poor job of shielding victims abusive partners. Simply put, many
clergy members say they do not know how to deal with domestic
abuse.
</P>
<P>
   With this in mind, Boston Justice Ministries, a nonprofit
domestic violence prevention group, this month launched a
groundbreaking project involving 10 Jewish and Christian
congregations.
</P>
<P>
   The Safe Havens Project will train clergy members on how to talk
to victims as well as abusers; require clergy members to write
sermons on the issue; and help congregations host workshops and
distribute literature on the issue, among other things. It is
believed to be the first program in the nation to provide extensive
and ongoing domestic violence training to religious congregations,
according to local victim advocates.
</P>
<P>
   As the Rev. Charles Virga, an Episcopal priest in Chelsea, put
it: ``We have to take a long hard look in the mirror and realize
that we as communities of faith have been far too negligent on a
fundamental issue of human justice.''
</P>
<P>
   Clergy members in the Justice Ministries say the training is
vital both because clergy members are often the first persons
abused women confide in, and because their moral authority makes
their advice so powerful with many women.
</P>
<P>
   ``Victims may be more at ease going to a clergy person because
that's someone they know and because churches are typically
considered places of refuge,'' said Debra Robbin, director of
education and training at Casa Myrna Vasquez, a battered women's
shelter in the Boston area.
</P>
<P>
   One Methodist minister says she will never forget the reaction
of her own minister several years ago when he found out that she
had walked out on her abusive husband.
</P>
<P>
   ``My husband had gone to him to try and get the minister to get
me to go back home,'' said the minister, who asked not to be
identified, although she does tell her story to those she counsels.
</P>
<P>
   ``He called me in and told me that I needed to forgive my
husband. He said I must not be a true Christian because I didn't
have any faith in the power of the Holy Spirit to change people. It
felt like God had turned his back on me,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  The Rev. Anne Marie Hunter, executive director of Boston
Justice Ministries, said she felt compelled to try to sensitize
religious congregations after years hearing disturbing stories from
some women about how they were treated by their clergy.
</P>
<P>
   ``One woman told me that that her minister encouraged her to
turn the other cheek,'' Hunter recalls. ``She did _ until she ran
out of faces. These are awful stories _ and there are stories where
congregations were wonderful in their response to abuse _ but there
is certainly room for improvement.''
</P>
<P>
   Some leaders of religious congregations say their thinking about
families and marriage has evolved as they have learned more about
the dynamics of domestic violence and how difficult it is for
victims to admit they have been abused or for abusers to admit they
are batterers.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, what has historically been a religious tilt in
favor of maintaining a marriage is shifting more to the view that
the Bible in no way condones a violent partnership.
</P>
<P>
   While years ago they might have been more inclined to try and
repair an abusive relationship, clergy members say, their first
priority now is to protect the victim.
</P>
<P>
   ``Marriage is a covenant, but that covenant is broken ... the
moment there is violence,'' said Rabbi William Hamilton, spiritual
leader of Congregation Kehillath Israel in Brookline &UR;  &LR; and a Safe
Havens participant. Hamilton has set up a private hot line in his
office for abuse victims.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a clergy person, I am not all ambivalent about that. I will
not send a victim back to her abuser.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past, he said, ``The truth is that for too long we, as
religious institutions, have wrongly believed that holding families
together was more important than the well being of individuals in
those families.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to bring this issue into the light and not relegate it
to hidden cracks of religiosity because it makes us comfortable or
causes conflict with our beliefs about marriage,'' said the Rev.
Jeffrey L. Brown, pastor of Union Baptist Church in Cambridge, one
of the congregations involved in the Safe Havens program.
</P>
<P>
   Debbie Brown, a deacon at New Covenant Christian Center in
Mattapan, said her church decided to enroll in Safe Havens because
for years New Covenant has resisted owning up to the reality that
``there are victims right inside our walls.''
</P>
<P>
   Too often, added Brown, who works at Finex House, a shelter for
battered women, her church ``took the attitude that it was shameful
to talk about it or that we were in church to talk about our
relationship with God and nothing else. But we have to make
churches realize that God doesn't have in his plan for a wife to
lay down and be beaten like a doormat.''
</P>
<P>
   For the next year, Smith said, Safe Havens will provide several
educational sessions as well as individual training to the 10
congregations, financed through private donations and foundations.
Since 1991 Boston Justice Ministries has run seminars, provided
speakers and organized candlelight vigils around the issue of
domestic violence. With additional funding, Smith hopes to add 10
congregations to the program annually.
</P>
<P>
   ``From our perspective this is a wonderful intervention
program,'' said Diane Coffey, deputy chief of the victim witness
assistance program in the Suffolk County district attorney's
domestic violence unit. ``It's not about breaking up families or
interfering with people's religious beliefs. It's about keeping
families healthy.''

PEARSON'S NEWEST THRILLER IS A MESMERIZING TALE

   ``The Pied Piper.'' By Ridley Pearson. Hyperion. $23.95. 497
pages.
</P>
<P>
   Ridley Pearson's fifth thriller featuring Seattle Police Lt. Lou
Boldt and forensic pathologist Daphne Matthews is fast-paced,
hair-raising and mesmerizing.
</P>
<P>
   It is not the best of times for Boldt. Newly promoted, he's been
moved out of homicide into intelligence. His wife, Liz, has cancer
and suddenly decides to stop treatment. And the serial kidnapper
who has been taking babies in San Diego and Portland has now struck
in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Dubbed the Pied Piper by the media because the kidnapper always
leaves a penny flute in the child's crib, the Piper always calls
when the parents are out, hits the baby-sitter with a stun gun and
takes the child. Boldt is assigned to a joint task force made up of
Seattle police officers and FBI agents.
</P>
<P>
   A second Seattle kidnapping goes from bad to worse when the
baby's grandmother suffers a fatal heart attack following the stun
gun attack. As Boldt tries to piece together clues, he finds that
much of the FBI's ongoing investigation evidence collected from
past kidnappings is off limits and he begins to suspect that
someone inside the task force is aiding the kidnapper.
</P>
<P>
   Then Boldt's 2-year-old daughter, Sarah, is taken and Boldt is
told to derail the investigation if he wants to see Sarah again.
Boldt enlists the aid of Matthews to get his son to his sister's
home outside Seattle. Once his son is safe, Boldt finds that in
past kidnappings, witnesses who should have been questioned weren't
and key paperwork has disappeared. When he talks to a Portland cop
tied to the kidnapping investigations there, he eventually learns
that the Portland cop's child was also grabbed but eventually
returned unharmed.
</P>
<P>
   As he tries to work on his own, his wife, Liz, enlists police
help for a second, secret investigation to find Sarah and the rest
of the missing children. They discover that in each instance, the
child had received a gift bearing a picture of them as a newborn.
Once the manufacturer is found, the investigation really takes off.
</P>
<P>
   Pearson's attention to detail is amazing. Nothing rings false as
inevitably Boldt pieces together the clues that will lead to the
identity of the Pied Piper. A terrific thriller by one of the best
in the field.

   ``Cat Chaser.'' By Elmore Leonard. William Morrow. $9.95. 283
pages.
</P>
<P>
   First published in 1982, ``Cat Chaser'' is just what one would
expect from Elmore Leonard _ quirky, peopled with oddball
characters, a scatter-shot plot, and more twists and turns than a
roller coaster.
</P>
<P>
   George Moran married rich and lived the good life in Coral
Gables. When his wife divorced him, he got the Coconut Palms, a
12-unit resort motel in Pompano Beach, Fla. One day, Nolen Tyner
walks in, rents a room and proceeds to sit by the pool and drink
beer all day. Moran figures Tyner has to be a private eye and sure
enough, Tyner is checking out a Latin couple who meet at the motel
each day. The woman is the sister of Andres DeBoya, a drug dealing,
mob-connected former top Dominican cop. Some toughs show up hunting
for the couple, then DeBoya arrives and makes an offer to buy the
Coconut Palms, which Moran rejects.
</P>
<P>
   Sixteen years ago when the United States invaded the Dominican
Republic, Moran was an 18-year-old Marine who ``was a First Squad
fire-team leader, shot a sniper, was wounded, taken prisoner by the
rebels, got a Purple Heart and met a Dominican girl he would never
forget.'' Now Moran wants to ``walk those streets again without
sniper fire coming in and see what he remembered.''
</P>
<P>
   Moran flies to Santo Domingo and places an ad in a newspaper:
``CAT CHASER is looking for the girl who once ran over rooftops and
tried to kill him.'' He doesn't find the girl, but he does find
DeBoya's wife, Mary, and they begin an affair. When they return to
Florida, the affair continues and the danger of discovery
escalates. A Dominican con artist shows up with a girl he says is
the one Moran was searching for. Tyner comes up with a plan to rip
off DeBoya.
</P>
<P>
   Vintage Elmore Leonard _ you'll never guess the ending. Leonard
would be great just for his characters. But throw in snappy
dialogue, twisted plots and over-the-top atmosphere and you find
yourself in the hands of a master.
</P>
<P>

   ``Where the Bodies Are Buried.'' By Janet Dawson. Fawcett
Columbine. $23.50. 279 pages.
</P>
<P>
   If you have a couple of free hours, check out Janet Dawson's
seventh mystery featuring feisty private investigator Jeri Howard.
</P>
<P>
   This time out, Jeri gets a middle-of-the-night phone call from
her ex-husband asking if she has a client named Rob Lawter. Then he
tells her that Lawter ``took a header'' out of his fifth-floor
window.
</P>
<P>
   Lawter was a paralegal at Bates Inc., a food-processing company.
About to blow the whistle on a corporate coverup, he hired Jeri
after receiving a threatening note. Jeri has already cashed his
retainer, and she wants to find out if he was murdered and if so,
by whom.
</P>
<P>
   A former paralegal, Jeri gets a temp job in Bates' legal
department and slowly learns that some products are causing health
problems and company officials are trying to cover it up.
</P>
<P>
   Dawson's plot, characters and dialogue are believable. A nice
little read for a rainy afternoon.

REGARDING HENRY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DERRICK Z. JACKSON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The one thing he did right was the day he started to fight. With
cameras and lights. Producers and editors. Historians and history's
forgotten soldiers. ``It was a civilized war,'' Henry Hampton once
said of the civil rights movement. He could have said that about
himself, with interviews, recordings and footage that destroyed the
shallow, patronizing history America had been telling itself about
the movement.
</P>
<P>
   ``A hundred civil rights stories had been told, but it was
always black people being saved by whites,'' Hampton said. He said
the stories ``have always been told by whites who depicted black
folks as poor, downtrodden and brutalized primitives ... it was the
strength of blacks that made the civil rights movement happen, with
support from some whites.''
</P>
<P>
   It was Hampton who unveiled black people as civilized warriors.
For six episodes in 1987, and then for eight more in 1990, America
was graced with ``Eyes on the Prize,'' Hampton's Emmy-award-winning
TV series on the civil rights years.
</P>
<P>
   The series was named after the freedom song that opened and
closed every episode with, ``But the one thing we did right / Was
the day we started to fight/ Keep your eyes on the prize/ Hold on,
hold on.'' Easily forgotten is that Hampton had to hold on
desperately to get the series on the air.
</P>
<P>
   One deal in 1979 with Capital Cities died as Hampton, who had
never taken on a series of this magnitude, became overwhelmed by
the task of putting the material together.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Hampton's production company Blackside, which
made government films, nearly went bankrupt as a hostile Ronald
Reagan became president.
</P>
<P>
   With the help of producer Michael Ambrosino, and with the
urgings of best friend, civil rights activist and television
investor Ruth Batson, Hampton began peddling an eight-minute
sampler of ``Eyes on the Prize.'' But commercial television and
many potential corporate sponsors were still too afraid of the
truth about the civil rights movement, the truth that black people
could speak for themselves, to be interested.
</P>
<P>
   His struggle mirrored his comments on one of the subjects ``in
Eyes'' _ the Black Panthers. ``What was really being called for
more widely was black empowerment, but white America was hearing it
as black power, and that was like pouring gasoline on the
situation,'' Hampton said. ``Black empowerment is saying, `We have
to take control of our community.' And you have to say it in soft
words, because it scares the horsefeathers out of the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Hampton found the money. The Public Broadcasting Service aired
the series. What makes it special are the faces of the unfamiliar.
No work of TV has captured the power of African-American women as
did the episode on the Montgomery bus boycott.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had won self-respect,'' said Jo Ann Robinson, who in one
night ran off 35,000 copies of boycott instructions. ``We had
forced the white man to give us what we knew was a part of our own
citizenship ... it is a hilarious feeling that goes all over you,
that makes you feel that America is a great country and we're going
to do more to make it greater.''
</P>
<P>
   No television seriess has so captured the depth of commitment of
freedom marchers who went to jail with none of the notoriety given
to movement leaders. In recalling his time in a Mississippi
penitentiary, Frederick Leonard recalled how the guards took away
the prisoners' mattresses for singing freedom songs.
</P>
<P>
   When the prisoners kept singing the next day and guards
threatened to again take the mattresses, Leonard, remembering how
uncomfortable it was to sleep in shorts and T-shirt on cold steel,
vowed not to let his mattress go. He was dragged out into the cell
block. The guards sent a muscular black inmate to beat the mattress
out of Leonard.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said, `Peewee, get him,''' Leonard said. Peewee came down
on my head. Whomp! Whomp! He was crying. Peewee was crying. And I
still had my mattress. Do you remember when you parents used to
whup you and say, ``It's going to hurt me more than it hurts you?
It hurt Peewee more than it hurt me. I still wouldn't turn my
mattress loose.''
</P>
<P>
   We have these stories because Hampton would not turn his vision
loose to either despair or commercialism. ``If you have the power
to believe in yourself, then you can confront these things,''
Hampton said. ``But if you give up on your country, or yourself,
then the answer's right there _ you won't change anything.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Eyes on the Prize'' changed America because Hampton showed how
civilized the war was for basic freedoms and human rights, from the
highly educated Martin Luther King, Jr., to the illiterate Mose
Wright, the elderly man who had the courage to stand up in a racist
Mississippi courtroom and point out the killers of Emmett Till. Now
that Henry Hampton has passed from us, his eyes and spirit are cast
down toward us. He is watching to see how we protect the prize. He
is watching to see how well we hold on.

NEW BIOGRAPHY OF ACHESON FLIRTS WITH PERFECTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARTIN F. NOLAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO -- The Cold War, which convulsed the world with
unknown fears, ended almost 10 years ago, the Berlin Wall having
weakened in 1988 before collapsing in 1989. Just when the Cold War
may be fading from memory, a new literature happily illuminates its
dangerously anxious decades for those who might not recall the
Inchon landing or civil defense.
</P>
<P>
   In writing ``Acheson: The Secretary of State Who Created the
American World,'' James Chace flirts with perfection in the art of
biography. Other works and Dean Acheson's own memoirs have detailed
his ``often impatient'' stubbornness and his reluctance to suffer
fools. Chace carefully documents Acheson's role and his stature
among the giants of that era, including Franklin D. Roosevelt,
Harry S Truman, and George C. Marshall, as they dealt with The
Bomb, the Soviet Union, Red China and other gargoyles that
terrified millions.
</P>
<P>
   He was tough yet elegant, blunt but diplomatic. Acheson would
not be bullied by Winston Churchill, Joe Stalin or Joe McCarthy,
who called him ``this pompous diplomat in striped pants with the
phony British accent.'' Acheson compared McCarthy to Shakespeare's
Caliban, inflicting ``a vicious madness'' on American society.
</P>
<P>
   The future secretary of state was not born wealthy. His father
was an Episcopalian cleric. (In his notorious defense of Alger
Hiss, the secretary of state cited Chapter 25 of St. Matthew.) He
went to Yale, where he met Averell Harriman, and Harvard Law
School, where his roommate was Cole Porter. Acheson regarded public
service as ``not only a powerful stimulant, but a habit-forming
one,'' which private law practice interrupted briefly.
</P>
<P>
   In the book's opening, Acheson arrives in singular loyalty to
greet Truman at Union Station after the disastrous 1946 elections.
The scene is from David McCullough's ``Truman,'' an essential
volume on a Cold War bookshelf, along with ``The Fifties'' by David
Halberstam; ``The Wise Men'' by Walter Isaacson and Evan Thomas;
and anything by Herblock, the Washington Post cartoonist. G. Pascal
Zachary's biography of Vannevar Bush, ``Endless Frontier,'' also
belongs there, as does ``Forged Consensus'' by David M. Hart, which
traces science and technology policies (or lack thereof) from 1921
to 1953.
</P>
<P>
   Chace answers the puzzlement of Scotty Reston of The New York
Times: ``I liked the guy and occasionally wondered why.'' At Groton
School, the rector, Endicott Peabody, called the teen-ager ``a very
unexpected sort of person. Irresponsible ... disagreeable to teach
at times.''
</P>
<P>
   I got to know Acheson during the Vietnam War, when his patrician
bearing gave way to an impish disposition and a gift for uncanny
analysis. Washington was a smaller town then and he was interested
in conversation, not drumming up clients for his firm, Covington
and Burling. One winter's day outside St. John's Church, he arrived
with no topcoat, but sported leather gloves and a homburg as we
attended the funeral of Christian A. Herter. ``Your former governor
was an extremely able diplomat, far superior to his predecessor,''
he told me. Herter had succeded John Foster Dulles as secretary of
state.
</P>
<P>
   He expressed his disdain for the self-promoting advisers to
presidents Johnson and Nixon with this truism: ``In Washington, the
purpose of a memo is not to inform the reader, but to protect the
writer.''
</P>
<P>
   At his Georgetown home, where he loved to talk about politics, I
never mentioned how I had once defended him against a teacher whose
heroes were Rev. Charles E. Coughlin, Generalissimo Francisco
Franco, and General Douglas MacArthur. Timothy Crouse wrote of my
youthful defense of Acheson in ``Boys on the Bus,'' published after
Acheson died in 1971. It's just as well he didn't read it. Although
he admired loyalty, sentimentality was a trait that would have
aroused the mustache-twitching, utterly charming wrath of Dean
Gooderham Acheson.

MOOD OF COMPROMISE MAY AID SOCIAL SECURITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was only by chance that my appointment to interview the boss
at State Street Bank and Trust in Boston began a half-hour after
the Dow-Jones Industrial Average, the world's box-score for how
goes the economy, set its new record Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Reversing a 20 percent drop that began in July and culminated on
Oct. 8, the index of 30 Blue Chips took off again like a dose of
Viagra. But that was merely prelude to my seminar with Marshall N.
Carter. State Street, a bank holding company, employs 17,000 people
in eastern Massachusetts alone.
</P>
<P>
   What do they do all day (and all night)? They keep track of $4.3
trillion in global assets over which they exercise record-keeping
chores, and oversee what happens to $422 billion in assets under
management. And Marsh Clark, who learned to watch his step during
28 months of combat duty in the field in Vietnam, keeps his eye on
the people who follow the money.
</P>
<P>
   So who better to jaw with about saving Social Security, which is
the number one priority next year of both the Republicans and the
Democrats, if you can believe what they say publicly?
</P>
<P>
   State Street is one of many financial institutions that want to
be in the mix if Congress and the White House agree to open up
Social Security to private investments. But the stakes are so high,
the numbers so vast, the politics so intense, the opinions so
divided, and the risks so Draconian, that the process has been
stuck for some time.
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 8-9, President Clinton convenes a government summit
meeting, bringing in the Congressional factions and the
bureaucratic experts, to begin to talk about how to solve the
problem we'll face in a few short years, i.e., too many Baby
Boomers retiring and too few people working to pay the taxes that
support Social Security pensions.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are 148 million taxpayers in the U.S., began Carter.
``That is five times the number of people who have 401-K plans,''
and already have learned the rudiments of deducting some of their
weekly pay at work, and funneling the pre-tax deduction into an
account that grows tax-free in an investment vehicle that may give
them six or eight or ten options, ranging from conservative to
risky.
</P>
<P>
   Carter and William Shipman co-authored a 1996 book, ``Promises
To Keep: Saving Social Security's Dream,'' exploring some of the
options. He is used to dealing in numbers with lots of zeroes
behind them, and he is well aware of the political complexities of
adjusting such a complex and important life-support system for so
many millions of Americans.
</P>
<P>
   But his banker's DNA tells him that the private sector is a
better wealth-generator than the public sector, and he is one of
thousands of experts surveying the terrain for ways to increase the
investment potential of Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   ``My bottom line,'' he sums up, is, 1. ``We should clearly have
the dialogue in the Senate and House,'' 2. it needs to be
emphasized that ``individual accounts create real wealth,'' and 3.
the eventual changes should be subjected to ``a study for two or
three years.''
</P>
<P>
   He is not a pure capitalist
damn-the-government-private-enterprise-will-save-us-all type.
``There is a very strong social responsibility ethic in the
American people, that there should be some balance in spreading the
wealth around.''
</P>
<P>
   And when it comes to the tax money paid into Social Security via
payroll taxes, he said, ``No one is talking about 100 percent
privitization.''
</P>
<P>
   The debate in Washington is about whether to invest some of that
payroll tax in some kind of government-supervised private sector
investment, or perhaps whether to change the rules regarding
Individual Retirement Accounts, or the new Roth IRAs.
</P>
<P>
   So vehement are some of the players _ the AFL-CIO and the
American Association of Retired Persons on one side, and the
privitize crowd on the other _ that touching ``the third rail''
issue of Social Security could lead to political electrocution of a
political candidate who mishandles the issue.
</P>
<P>
   It is only by chance that the Social Security summit comes to a
head as the Republican-dominated Congress tries to wriggle off the
impeachment hook by which it sought to bring down President
Clinton. Following upon the House Judiciary Committee's hearing
featuring 12 hours of Kenneth Starr's testimony, it is clear that
this Starr is not burning so brightly.
</P>
<P>
   A compromise falling short of impeachment, centering on some
kind of censure and political wrist-slap on the president's roving
hands, seems to be in the cards. That being the case, and with the
Republican leadership either changed (the let's-make-a-deal
Speaker-elect Bob Livingston of Louisiana supplanting the ousted
Newt Gingrich of Georgia) or chastened (Senate Majority Leader
Trent Lott choking on the notion of a go-nowhere impeachment
trial), there may be a compromise in store for Social Security as
well.
</P>
<P>
   No one in Washington wants to make the first concrete offer of
Social Security changes, for fear of getting torched in a political
ambush. But what about a backstage deal? In exchange for
censure-instead-of-impeachment, why can't Clinton promise the firm
of Livingston &AMP; Lott that he'll hold fire on denouncing them for
being soft on Social Security? Then some real work could get done.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine. Real work being done in D.C. Wow.

HARTFORD'S RANK; CELLULOID AND ASTEROID HEROES  
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DON AUCOIN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Paging Bob Kraft: Are you really sure you want to move the
Patriots to Hartford?
</P>
<P>
   Shangri-La it emphatically ain't, as we are reminded yet again
by a survey in the December issue of  &UR; P.O.V. &LR;  of the best cities
for entrepreneurs. Poor Hartford is ranked 75th on a list of 75 and
dissed by the magazine _ which caters to young men, a primary
audience for football teams _ as ``the lemon of all US cities.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A sleepy pessimism permeates the place,'' reports coauthor
Bryan Dawson. ``We could have discharged a howitzer down Main
Street without causing too much disruption. ... No one seems at all
psyched to be here _ a surefire business killer.'' Ouch! In a
tongue-in-cheek effort to gauge the prospects for start-ups, Dawson
set up a lemonade stand in downtown Hartford. He sold three cups.
</P>
<P>
   In case you were wondering, Boston is No.11 on the P.O.V. list,
up from 31st place last year. Burlington, Vt., ranks fifth. Now
there's nothing wrong with the magazine's gimmick of ranking
boomtowns, but the staffers at P.O.V. need to get the stars out of
their eyes. The magazine is utterly besotted with first-ranked
Seattle and its chief employer, Microsoft, a regular Camelot of a
company that is home, we are told, to ``14,000 forward-thinking
employees. ... If you are a computer-related startup owner, these
people are your friends.'' (The Justice Department might beg to
differ, no?) And there are too many insipid, boosterish quotes like
this one from a Denver entrepreneur: ``We have active, happy people
here. There's a lot of sunshine. People work hard, but they play
hard, too.'' Ah, shaddup.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Too often,  &UR; Premiere &LR;  settles for routine puff pieces on movie
stars. Once in a while, though, the magazine goes deeper and peels
a layer of tinsel off Hollywood, showing us an aspect the movie
capital might not want us to see.
</P>
<P>
   An example is Holly Millea's superb, well-reported piece on
actor Rodney Harvey (``My Own Private Idaho,'' the TV version of
``The Outsiders''), who succumbed to a heroin overdose earlier this
year at the age of 30. Harvey was a fundamentally good-hearted kid
from the streets of South Philly whose looks quickly landed him
gigs as a model and actor. Apparently believing it's better to burn
out than to rust out, he eagerly enlisted in the fast-lane life,
but his drug addictions derailed what could have been a decent
career. A series of harrowing police mug shots is testament to the
cycle of drug busts and rehab stints and more drug busts he fell
into.
</P>
<P>
   Millea chronicles Harvey's rise and fall with a sympathetic but
unsparing eye. She describes how he was drawn into a heroin
subculture that captivated many young actors in the early 1990s
(``It was just a movie all the time,'' one actress gushes about an
altercation with a gun-wielding drug dealer), while some older
members of the Hollywood establishment looked the other way. This
would make a pretty good movie _ ``The Smack Pack''? _ but somehow
I doubt it's one Hollywood would want to make.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
------ &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If you believe in both God and science and sometimes have
difficulty reconciling the two, the December  &UR; Astronomy &LR;  contains
some reassuring news.
</P>
<P>
   Author Tony Ortega journeys to an Arizona mountaintop to visit a
Vatican-run observatory containing a telescope known as ``the Pope
scope,'' where a Jesuit priest supervises the study of stars and
asteroids. It's part of the evidence for Ortega's assertion that
``science and religion have become compatible ways of understanding
the universe.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Pope's affinity with science ... has been matched by a
growing interest in religion from scientists,'' writes Ortega.
``The continued acceptance of the big bang theory and the
strangeness of quantum physics apparently prompt the coziness.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Planetary scientist David Grinspoon, who writes an
accompanying essay, points out that science, no less than religion,
often relies on knowl-edge handed down by authorities. And
Grinspoon suggests that scientists, the self-proclaimed ``masters
of reality,'' ought not to get too big for their britches.
``Remember, description is not explanation and when it comes to
primary causes science explains nothing,'' he writes.
</P>
<P>
   In  &UR; Life &LR; , Frank McCourt offers a somewhat superficial account
of his journey from the dogmatism of his Irish-Catholic upbringing
to the ``spiritual smorgasbord'' of America. More absorbing than
McCourt's words are the pictures that accompany them, photos of the
faithful of every imaginable denomination.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Jim Carrey has enjoyed a much bigger career than any of his
black costars _ Keenen Ivory Wayans, his brother Damon, and David
Alan Grier among them _ who made Fox's ``In Living Color'' such a
distinctive show.
</P>
<P>
   In  &UR; Icon &LR; , David Kushner asks why a show that seemed to have
``opened doors for primetime diversity'' has not had a lasting
impact. One reason, he suggests, is that networks like Fox and WB
emphasize ``urban'' programming when they are starting out, in an
effort to forge an identity and a niche in the marketplace, but as
they become more established, they succumb to a play-it-safe
mentality that leads to shows like WB's ``Felicity.''

`BABE' LEAVES A STY IN THE STICKS FOR THE SLIME OF THE CITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
BABE: PIG IN THE CITY 
Directed by: George Miller 
Screenplay by: Miller, Judy Morris, Mark Lamprell 
Starring: Magda Szubanski, James Cromwell, Mary Stein, Mickey
Rooney, with the voices of E.G. Daily (Babe), Danny Mann, Glenne
Headly, Steven Wright, James Cosmo, Nathan Kress, Myles Jeffrey,
Stanley Ralph Ross, Russi Taylor, Adam Goldberg, Eddie Barth 
Running time: 95 minutes 
Rated: G 
 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   How are you going to keep ``Babe'' down on the farm? George
Miller, faced with putting together a sequel, realized he couldn't.
Besides, it's a little difficult to accustom ourselves to accepting
James Cromwell as the farmer again after seeing him play the
corrupt cop in ``L.A. Confidential.'' So the talking pig is off to
the big bad city in ``Babe: Pig in the City,'' which is another way
of saying that the new film takes place in a nastier world.
Although chaotic, it's an interesting try, mostly because of the
way the menacing city has been conceived. Parents, however, may
find it too dark for younger children. Even the ending, while
happy, is not altogether so.
</P>
<P>
   ``Babe: Pig in the City'' is the darkest children's film since
``City of Lost Children.'' I liked the scary city, a sort of Red
Grooms pop sculpture composite that incorporates San Francisco's
Golden Gate Bridge, Los Angeles's Hollywood sign, the Statue of
Liberty, and the Eiffel Tower, but concentrates a lot on a
neighborhood that mashes together Venice, Italy, and Venice, Calif.
Actually, there's more city than story. It's a nice nightmarish
environment, with a hotel full of animals and sufficient action for
Babe, who quickly must develop fleeing skills to supplant the
sheepherding skills that are of no use in this new situation.
</P>
<P>
   The emblematic difference between the two films is that Babe,
impressionable adolescent that he is, exchanges his homey old brown
leather neck strap for a black spiked goth collar given to him by a
killer pit bull who turns friendly. The city and its dangers, in
short, are portrayed as grimly as in any of Grimm's Fairy Tales,
starting with an injury to Cromwell's farmer, necessitating Babe's
departure with Magda Szubanski's plump Esme, his wife, to raise
money to save the farm. When they fail to make an airplane
connection at a stopover in the States, their misadventures begin.
</P>
<P>
   Before it's over, Esme is mostly diverted out of the picture,
and another human dies, leaving Babe and his new friends _ a tribe
of dogs and a family consisting of an orangutan, chimps, and
monkeys _ to shift for themselves. One of the dogs uses a wheeled
apparatus to get around, having lost the use of his hind legs. Babe
almost becomes a late-night snack for a pair of junkyard dogs the
chimps feed him to. A merciless team from the pound crashes into
the hotel and rounds up the animals, setting the stage for a heroic
rescue effort from Babe, the little pig that could.
</P>
<P>
   In a couple of cases, the motives of the kind humans are
explained by the fact that they're pig-faced. And the sometimes
Venetian city holds at least as much menace as whimsy. Ferdinand
the Duck is back, and so is the trio of singing mice. Last time,
they were sensational in ``Blue Moon.'' Here their big number _
when they're not fronting the film's chapter headings _ is ``Are
You Lonely Tonight?'' The music _ different pop periods punctuated
by operatic excerpts _ is imaginatively chosen, including the big
theme _ a rescored version of the bombastic organ solo from
Saint-Saens's Symphony No.3 that makes it sound balletic.
</P>
<P>
   Miller is going to take some heat for making this new film
inhabit a cruel world. But better that than sugarcoating the story.
He's found a way to recycle a popular film _ choppily perhaps,
episodically perhaps, but provocatively. The setting at times
upstages the characters, and Babe seems at more of a loss here than
he was in his rural setting. The pig (pigs, actually, considering
that more than one was used) isn't quite given the chance to be the
charmer he was the first time around. But at least this sequel
isn't bland. It reminds us that the ``Babe'' films and Miller's
``Mad Max'' films aren't as far apart as people assumed.

`A BUG'S LIFE' A VISUALLY INGENIOUS TALE FOR YOUNGSTERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
A BUG'S LIFE 
Directed by: John Lasseter 
Screenplay by: Andrew Stanton, Donald McEnery, and Bob Shaw 
With the voices of: Dave Foley, Kevin Spacey, Julia Lewis-Dreyfus,
Hayden Panettiere, Phyllis Diller, Richard Kind, David Hyde Pierce,
Joe Ranft, Denis Leary, Jonathan Harris, Madeline Kahn, Bonnie
Hunt, Michael McShane, John Ratzenberger, Brad Garrett, Roddy
McDowall, Edie McClurg, Alex Rocco, David Ossman 
Running itme: 94 minutes 
Rated: G 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Pixar's ``Toy Story'' team has another winner in ``A Bug's
Life.'' Its writing isn't as witty as that of ``Antz,'' but it's
much more beautifully drawn, from the slight iridescent sheen on
the ants' hard bodies to the sunlight shining through the canopy of
green leaves towering over them like redwoods. After you've seen
the spruced-up new ``Wizard of Oz,'' go see ``A Bug's Life'' to
catch the real Emerald City. Just as DreamWorks's killer comet
movie, ``Deep Impact,'' didn't keep Disney's rival ``Armageddon''
from being the summer's big hit, so DreamWorks's ``Antz'' hardly
seems likely to leave ``A Bug's Life'' in the dust. It's that rich
and dazzling.
</P>
<P>
   While both have almost identical stories _ a misfit ant leaves
the colony in disgrace, yearning for the princess, then returns to
lead it against aggressors _ ``A Bug's Life'' is better suited to
younger audiences than ``Antz.'' The latter, headlined by Allen's
trademark kvetching, seems more skewed to adults or older kids.
Flik, the loser-turned-hero ant of ``A Bug's Life,'' hasn't as much
personality, and ``A Bug's Life'' hasn't the novelty value of ``Toy
Story,'' but more than makes up for it in detail, as the flat
indoor geometrics of ``Toy Story'' are succeeded by the much more
elaborate outside world here.
</P>
<P>
   If ``Toy Story'' rep-re-sent-ed a breakthrough, ``A Bug's Life''
rep-re-sents a snazzy step forward by John Lasseter's team. ``A
Bug's Life'' has lots of showbiz pizazz to go with its visual
delights, made even more eye-catching in CinemaScope. The film
reverses the ant and grasshopper fable. Here, the ants spend the
summer industriously piling up food, but instead of turning the
grasshoppers away when autumn comes and food gets scarce, the
grasshoppers are presented as a gang of extortionist thugs that
forces the ants to give them the food, leaving only enough to allow
the ants to live through the winter so they can gather a new bunch
of food for the grasshoppers each succeeding year.
</P>
<P>
   As one resigned ant says, ``They come, they eat, they leave.''
Formidable enough when they're flying in formation to Ant Island,
they're even scarier after they land, advancing on their long,
spindly legs, recalling the dreaded Imperial Walkers from ``Star
Wars.'' The trouble begins when Flik inadvertently loses the stored
food. Hopper, the grasshoppers' leader, voiced in film-dominating
fashion by Kevin Spacey with an entertaining sneer built into his
deliveries, tells them they've got to cough up twice as much by the
end of the season, or face the loss of their little ones.
</P>
<P>
   The hapless Flik, slinking out of the colony and into a
multispecies saloon (again suggesting the varied clientele of the
``Star Wars'' watering hole) rounds up a troupe of what he thinks
are tough mercenaries, but are unemployed circus insects. Bad for
the colony, but good for the film, since it provides a variety of
colorful turns from a moth, a caterpillar, a dung beetle, a male
ladybug, a black widow spider, and other multilegged diversions.
</P>
<P>
   Denis Leary is fun as the ladybug determined to proclaim his
virility, Bonnie Hunt hits some original notes as the spider, and
Jonathan Harris is amusing as the hammy old mantis. Unsuited as
they are to suiting up for battle, they throw themselves spiritedly
at the grasshoppers, who come swarming in, buzz-bomber style. But
the eye-catching array of characters is only part of what's so
engaging here, and perhaps a lesser part at that, like the
arrestingly rendered litter of food cartons and containers which,
to the ants, are skyscrapers.
</P>
<P>
   The difference between the indoor ``Toy Story'' and the outdoor
``A Bug's Life'' is not simply the difference between floors and
grass. Some of the most captivating moments in ``A Bug's Life''
come when rain and wind and water arrive, changing the ants' world
in a blink. We know what's going to happen when the brave little
bugs take on the bad big bugs. What we don't know is precisely what
this excursion into their microcosm is going to look like.
</P>
<P>
   But no fear. The Pixar wizards fill the wide screen with
knockout colors, visual dazzle, and magnified grandeur. They'll
soon have lots of company in the computer-generated animation
sweepstakes. But they're still the front-runners, not least because
of their knack of subtly exploiting the airless space of
computer-generated graphics, playing up its artificiality in ways
that turn what we would ordinarily overlook as a mundane patch of
country turf or stream bed into something captivatingly
otherworldly. There's more to ``A Bug's Life'' than meets the
camera's eye.

EXPERTS HELP MERGED COMPANIES PRESERVE THE MARRIAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE E. LEWIS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was one of the most talked about marriage proposals in the
high-tech world: Compaq Computer Corp., a hard-charging Texas
behemoth known for its meteoric rise in the personal computer
industry, had offered to buy Maynard-based Digital Equipment Corp.,
the staid, over 40-year-old struggling computer giant, for a
whopping $9 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Digital accepted, but, like most marriages, this one wasn't
going to be easy: Compaq was young and valued speed. Digital was
older, hierarchical, and slower-paced.
</P>
<P>
   So Digital found a merger ``marriage counselor:'' 43-year-old
Nancy Yahanda of Yahanda Inc. in Boston, a self-described executive
coach who, in recent years, has transformed herself into a
mergers-and-acquisitions guru for top executives seeking to thrive
in a reshaped workplace.
</P>
<P>
   First, Yahanda helped top Digital executives decide which
managers should make the transition to the new Compaq, then she
advised the executives on how to prepare their managers and staffs
for anticipated changes, recalled Ilene Jacobs, former senior vice
president of human resources at Digital.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq hired counselors, too: Among them, Price Pritchett, 56,
of Dallas-based Pritchett &AMP; Associates. He helped Compaq executives
abroad, and middle managers and staffers in the United States, make
the leap to a corporate culture requiring faster-paced development,
tighter security, and more teamwork.
</P>
<P>
   As the merger frenzy in corporate America continues, US firms
are finding that once the honeymoon is over, serious glitches over
corporate culture can derail even the best planned mergers. Often,
it's not the melding of product lines or marketing strategies that
can trip up a merger, but problems on the human side. Increases in
corporate marriages have created a booming industry for so-called
integration consultants.
</P>
<P>
   Take Wells Fargo's takeover of First Interstate Bank in Los
Angeles two years ago. Touted as one of the most lucrative
proposals in the banking industry, the huge $11 billion deal was
considered an ideal marriage. Indeed, Wall Street was less
concerned with the ramifications of a hostile takeover on employee
morale and customer loyalty than on the profits the two
institutions were expected to reap.
</P>
<P>
   Then, things went wrong. According to a recent report in the Los
Angeles Times, the new company started hemorrhaging jobs, more than
12,000 in all, thousands more than expected, and clients started
bailing out. Consumers got angry when a computer glitch caused
their deposits to be credited to the wrong accounts, workers were
mad about their new employer's &UR;  &LR; seemingly heavy-handed approach,
and some longtime customers didn't like the new company's sales
approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``Big companies usually have trouble with trying to integrate
cultures,'' said Chuck McVinney, cofounder of Michaels McVinney, a
Charlestown integration strategy firm. ``They don't get forums
started; they don't bring people in to discuss the transition,
which is why we are called in to do what we do. It is also why we
now have the Dilbert phenomenon: employees feeling as if they are
being jacked around.''
</P>
<P>
   The number of corporate mergers and acquisitions in the United
States rose from 1,570 in 1993 to 2,857 in 1997. Over the same time
period, the dollar value of those transactions soared, increasing
from an annual total of $118 billion five years ago to $462 billion
in 1997, according to New York-based Mergers &AMP; Acquisitions
magazine.
</P>
<P>
   No one knows exactly how many integration strategists have
cropped up over the last few years, but experts say big consulting
and accounting firms, workplace psychologists, and executive
coaches are all providing such services. Some offer classes,
seminars, and one-on-one sessions to senior executives. Others
provide group counseling to employees fearful of layoffs and
change.
</P>
<P>
   ``Failure to pay a lot of attention to and put a lot of thought
into how you are going to integrate two corporate cultures is a big
reason why a lot of acquisitions and mergers do not work,'' said
Kenyon Hodge, vice president of Mercer Management Consulting, a
general strategy firm in Lexington.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1998 study of 400 North American acquisitions and mergers
with a minimum value of $500 million each, Hodge found that 50
percent did not meet average industry shareholder returns within
the first year. An earlier study by Hodge revealed that nearly 50
percent of all mergers and acquisitions fail within the first few
years _ because either they lose money or the companies decide to
split up.
</P>
<P>
   The reason? They forgot they had to work together, according to
Hodge.
</P>
<P>
   When Yahanda meets with top executives, her top priority is
easing their fears. ``I tell people that this is a defining
moment,'' she said. ``You can either live in fear or be paralyzed.
You either sit back and watch what is happening, or decide to be a
leader during the transition. That really demonstrates who the true
leaders are.''
</P>
<P>
   Will it save an executive's job? ``Not necessarily,'' Yahanda
said, ``but you will have a better chance and it builds resume
value to be able to say, `I was on the transition team,' or `I
looked at cost-savings between the two entities.' It is better to
help than stand by and worry only about your own job.''
</P>
<P>
   But consultants sometimes meet with resistance from employees,
often demonstrated by work slowdowns and less productivity.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a certain amount of resistance to the acquisition or
takeover, and sometimes there is resistance to what we do,'' said
McVinney. ``Sometimes staff think we're just management's henchmen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had people say, `This is a waste of time. I'd be better
off in my cube, working on a resume.' It's expected. The further
down you go in the company, the more powerless and suspicious of
management people tend to be.''
</P>
<P>
   McVinney said &UR;  &LR; their morale slips, as they worry about the
future of their jobs and that everything they're used to will
change. They develop a kind of lethargy _ often, they get depressed
and stop putting in the extra effort.
</P>
<P>
   The solution? ``Leaders have to give people the feeling they are
connected to something that cares about them and will last,'' said
McVinney. ``That means giving them good compensation packages,
giving them career direction, building solid teams so they are in
it together and not competing for a single job.''
</P>
<P>
   Among those leaders who have been able to calm concerns: Peter
Hussey, president of CyberTrust Solutions in Needham. CyberTrust
was established as a division of GTE Internetworking, which in turn
was created by the 1996 merger of Bolt Beranek &AMP; Newman and GTE
Corp. &UR;  &LR;  The company hosted retreats for staffers, at which they
were encouraged to air and discuss their concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Said McVinney, ``Talking can make a huge difference. It calms
people and, if done well and followed up with real solutions, it
can let people know they are being heard. That's better than
leaving them stranded.''
</P>
<P>
   McVinney, Yahanda, and Hodge agree that the human side has to be
considered amid the financial frenzy of the merger process. They
point to logistical problems that may seem insignificant, but can
add up to serious morale and productivity problems for employees
being swallowed by a new entity. Some examples:
</P>
<P>
   _A week after a large company acquired a smaller one, movers
showed up to relocate the new employees downtown. ``There was no
warning,'' said Hodge. ``The employees were never prepared for the
move.''
</P>
<P>
   _Another firm moved everyone from a smaller company it had
purchased to its headquarters, but forgot to order ID and key cards
for its new staff.
</P>
<P>
   _Employees of a newly acquired company reported to work but
could not use the computers because their employer had forgotten to
assign passwords.
</P>
<P>
   _The sales staff of two merged companies were unable to combine
duties and services because personnel from the bigger firm refused
to listen to their new peers' ideas. The result? A stalemate that
cost the firm valuable time and money.
</P>
<P>
   _New employees from a tiny computer firm known for its flexible
hours kept to their regular schedules after a merger, showing up at
8:30 a.m., instead of 8 a.m. as the new corporate parent required,
and nearly lost their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   To prevent these kinds of bad feelings and snafus, Compaq and
Digital executives participated in a management course taught by
J.B. Pratt, a strategist with Texas-based Pritchett. ``Executives
from both firms were asked to put together a new mission statement
based on already established goals and values,'' said Pratt.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, some Digital managers experienced a bit of
culture shock when they visited Compaq headquarters for the first
time, coming from their open environment at Digital. ``What they
found was that once you get into the lobby, you can't go any
further _ not even to the bathroom _ without someone else or a
passkey or key card,'' Pratt said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Digital line staff were offended by a screen saver on
their computers warning against game-playing or downloading dirty
pictures during work. ``They said, `We know we can't download those
kinds of pictures, but now we are seeing this message every single
day.'''

RYDER CAPTAINS CONVENE AT TCC 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 BY JOE CONCANNON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROOKLINE, Mass. _ The 33d Ryder Cup matches will be contested
next September at The Country Club, and it has become a competition
of highs and lows. Ever since it became Europe against the US in
1979 at The Greenbrier, the event has been lively. They held a
gathering Tuesday, and the respective captains were in attendance.
Mark James of England for the European side, Ben Crenshaw of Texas
for the US.
</P>
<P>
   Each has known a few low moments as competitors. At the 1979
competition, James was fined, along with Ken Brown, by the European
Tour for balking at appearing at team functions. It's something he
didn't want to talk about at the time, nor will he talk about it
now.
</P>
<P>
   The European captain was John Jacobs, but James said, ``I'm not
saying the captain was the problem. I felt he was a perfect
captain. There was someone else involved who didn't take a showing
to me at that particular time. I have no intention of going into
the details. What I said at the time is, what happened was about
personalities and not misdemeanors. It's as simple as that.''
</P>
<P>
   Now he's captain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess there's a sense of irony in there,'' said James.
</P>
<P>
   In 1987, Crenshaw broke his putter on the sixth hole after
taking three putts in his match against Ireland's Eamonn Darcy. He
subsequently had to putt with his sand wedge and 1-iron before
losing, 1 up, in the deciding match of the competition _ the first
time the US lost on its own soil.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know why I had the head of the putter in my hand,''
said Crenshaw. ``I tapped the putter on the ground. It was a little
disgust, but I'd hit it much harder in much more of an anger
before. The shaft was rusted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did the best I could, but he played very well. We have a
laugh to this day about it, but it was very painful at the time.''
</P>
<P>
   The Europeans won the Cup again three years ago at Oak Hill, and
defended it successfully a year ago at Valderrama GC in Spain. They
are 4-2-1 in the last seven competitions.
</P>
<P>
   There have been questions raised about the composition of the
European team, since several of their top players compete on the US
PGA Tour instead of in Europe, where the Ryder Cup points are
accumulated.
</P>
<P>
   The previous captain, Seve Ballesteros, had campaigned for more
wild-card selections, and he even cut Spanish countryman Miguel
Angel Martin in a controversial move that allowed him to get both
Nick Faldo and Jesper Parnevik on the 1997 team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it will be a little easier this time,'' offered James.
``They've both rejoined our tour on a full-time basis. They'll be
competing for points. I've got a pretty good deal. I think the two
wild cards will be truly wild.''
</P>
<P>
   Crenshaw first saw The Country Club 30 years ago when he played
in the US Juniors at the age of 16, and the experience kindled his
interest in the game's tradition and the older courses. He is
excited about the matches.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't imagine a better place to have the matches than here
at The Country Club,'' said Crenshaw. ``It's a place that means
quite a lot to our golf history. Some wonderful things have taken
place here, and it will be a marvelous place for both teams to
enjoy.''
</P>
<P>
   He is hoping that players who compete in next year's $5 million
NEC Invitational, part of the World Golf Championships, will travel
from Akron, Ohio, to Boston and play some rounds at The Country
Club. That event ends Aug. 29, and the Ryder Cup is Sept. 24-26.
Course familiarity, it has been argued, was a major factor in the
US defeat at Valderrama.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some particular problems inherent to this course,''
said Crenshaw, who also competed here in the 1988 US Open. ``We can
go through all the gyrations of how you prepare your team, but it's
eventually left up to your players.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
------ &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There was a meeting at The Country Club earlier this month
regarding the formation of the Massachusetts Golf Alliance, whose
mission will be to bring together the various golf groups in the
state to work toward common goals in the best interests of the
game. The meeting included representatives of the Massachusetts
Golf Association, The Women's Golf Association of Massachusetts,
the New England PGA, the Golf Course Superintendents of New
England, the New England Golf Course Owners Association, and the
Ouimet Scholarship Fund.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not that novel an idea,'' said MGA executive director Tom
Landry. ``The premise is working collectively, and having all the
various bodies working together on an agenda that will be a lot
more beneficial to the game rather than have all of us working
alone on our particular agendas. We sort of orchestrated the
initial meeting, and people seem to be pretty excited about it.''
</P>
<P>
   The first step will be an economic-impact study.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will help us quantify what golf means to the Massachusetts
economy,'' said Landry. ``We have two of the largest manufacturers
in the state (Acushnet, Spaulding), and tourism plays a great part,
and I believe it's got to be in excess of $1 billion. We want to
engage somebody to make a comprehensive study.''
</P>
<P>
   There will be a subcommittee made up of Landry, Ed Carbone of
the NEPGA, Suzanne Nelson of the WGAM, James Fitzroy of the GCSANE,
Bob Donovan of the Ouimet Fund, and Leigh Bader of the NEGCOA.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to try to come up with a mission statement,'' said
Landry. ``There are legislative issues we should weigh in on and
keep an eye on.''
</P>
<P>
   These include the Americans With Disabilities Act, which drew
national attention in the case of Casey Martin, environmental
concerns, tax issues, and equal access legislation, which was
passed in Connecticut. The subcommittee will meet in early
December.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The MBTA has said there will be no vacations granted during the
week of the Ryder Cup, since extra buses will be running from
Cleveland Circle. ``I can't recall it happening before, and I've
worked for the MBTA for 27 years,'' says Brighton's major golf nut,
Tommy McCarthy. But an MBTA representative said, ``We do it for
First Night. We plan on even extra buses.'' ... Those holding Ryder
Cup tickets will ride free on the MBTA ... The NEPGA will have a
volunteer presence on site, and will coordinate golf outings for
visitors in the Greater Boston area. ``We'll line up golf for
corporations who have tickets and individuals who have tickets at
private and daily-fee facilities,'' said Carbone. ``They can give
us a call at 508-869-0000 to find out more information.'' ... There
were approximately 41,000 requests for the 10,000 tickets available
to the public, and they have been allocated to 5,000 lottery
winners.

YOU'LL MISS DREW BLEDSOE THIS SUNDAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Drew Bledsoe will eventually visit Canton. Not the Canton of
Massachusetts Route 128. We're talking about the Canton of
immortals, the one tucked in the righthand corner of Ohio. It is
the one where pro football legends give acceptance speeches, walk
away, and then let the plaques and busts do their speaking for
them.
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe will be in Canton five years after he throws the final
pass of his career. He is a Hall of Famer. That's right. The
quarterback of the New England Patriots will forever be known as
one of the best passers of all time. I hold these truths to be
self-evident: The designated hitter is a good thing; ``The
Godfather'' was a great thing; and Bledsoe being elevated as one of
the game's finest is a sure thing.
</P>
<P>
   It is 1998, the sixth season of Bledsoe's career. We should all
know the facts by now, right? Bledsoe reached 20,000 career passing
yards faster than every quarterback in history except one, Dan
Marino. Bledsoe has thrown 26 more touchdown passes than
interceptions in his career; Hall of Famer Dan Fouts ended his
career with 12 more touchdown passes than interceptions. Some
self-loving players exaggerate their abilities, calling themselves
Big Money and Mack Daddy; Bledsoe is a mellow man with a daddy
named Mac.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday night, for the fourth time in the last five meetings,
Bledsoe's team handled Marino's team. The Patriots came back to win
after trailing in the fourth quarter. They have done that at least
a dozen times in Bledsoe's career. Many of us are surprised when it
happens. Many of us are goofy.
</P>
<P>
   But I am not a preacher man. I am not here to point out the
goodness of having Bledsoe in the Patriots backfield. I am here to
point out the sadness of his likely absence from it. On his most
recent comeback escapade, Bledsoe broke his right index finger on
the last drive of game, the one that ended with a touchdown pass to
Shawn Jefferson. He will be fitted with a splint on the finger, but
he probably will not play. We will learn the truth the hard way. We
will learn how valuable Bledsoe is when he is not the starter
Sunday at Foxboro Stadium against the Bills. We will appreciate him
and be grateful for him and miss him _ when he is not in the
lineup.
</P>
<P>
   Fate has an absurd sense of humor that way. Only two weeks ago,
there were loud debates about whom you would rather have, Doug
Flutie or Drew Bledsoe. Some people looked at the 6-foot-5-inch
Bledsoe and wondered why he didn't move better. They wondered why
he seemed to do a Riverdance in the pocket. They wondered why he
never got on national television, let his face turn the color of a
fireball, and cuss out his teammates for not making a play.
</P>
<P>
   How silly.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Zolak, a very funny man who does hilarious sketches of his
teammates (most notably Todd Collins), expects to be the starter on
Sunday. ``I'll be ready to go,'' said Zolak, who once said that if
Deion Sanders was ``Prime Time'' he was ``local access TV or PBS.''
He was asked what he would call himself now. ``CBS,'' he said.
``Since Sunday's game is on CBS, and it looks like I'll be playing,
you can call me CBS.''
</P>
<P>
   Zolak does not have a lot of experience as a starter. His last
appearance was actually a co-start at the Paradise. That's when he,
Bledsoe, and Max Lane performed a stage-diving episode just over a
year ago. Zolak, though, is one of the good guys. He loved it
Tuesdat night when two young fans ran up to him outside the Roxbury
Goodwill in Boston and demanded that he take a picture with them.
He did. He is also a friend of Bledsoe's. He knows what it means to
replace his buddy, a certain Hall of Famer.
</P>
<P>
   ``My top three goes John Elway, Brett Favre, and Drew,'' Zolak
said of NFL quarterbacks. ``I've got to put Drew in the top three.
Mark Brunell is up there, too. You can never forget Marino and Troy
(Aikman), well Troy, he's got the jewelry. The jewelry (three Super
Bowl rings) matters.''
</P>
<P>
   Zolak, one of Bledsoe's film-studying partners, also knows who
throws the best ball in the league.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jeff George,'' he said. ``A lot of people don't talk about
him. But when you see him on film he blows you away. Me and Drew
agree on that.''
</P>
<P>
   So, he is asked, why don't most fans do the same with Bledsoe?
If you listened to some local sports conversations, you would think
Hugh Millen is calling the Patriot signals. Why is that?
</P>
<P>
   ``It comes with the position, I guess,'' Zolak answered.
</P>
<P>
   He's right. The hype of history and flawed perceptions rule.
Most people are afraid to touch the yellowing pages of history
books, afraid to find that what was always viewed as reverential is
actually attainable. Take Hall of Famer Len Dawson. He had 28,507
yards with Kansas City from 1962-75. Bledsoe has 21,232 yards in
less than half the time. He has missed four games in his career. He
is 3-3 in the playoffs, has won his only AFC Championship game and
lost his only Super Bowl. Fouts never got to the Super Bowl; Hall
of Famer Fran Tarkenton never won one.
</P>
<P>
   But that is the past and the future. The present makes you want
to give thanks for the quarterback. The Patriots are 6-5 and need
to win four of their remaining five games. That means they can only
afford a loss. So what if Bledsoe misses two starts? It doesn't
mean the Patriots can't win, but they will have to work harder than
they have all season to do it.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday they have Buffalo. Then they go on the road to
Pittsburgh and St. Louis. Their last two games are not easy: San
Francisco and the Jets. They will most certainly not put punter Tom
Tupa in at quarterback. With the kind of misfortune they have had
with injuries, the last thing the Patriots want to do is have
another injured special teamer (Godspeed, Troy Brown). So they will
go with Zolak, who has five career starts.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the Patriots will win all their games. They'll just have
to do it with things they don't have, such as a running game and a
strong pass rush. And they'll have to do it without something they
did have, such as a Hall of Fame quarterback.

NOW, A JUDGMENT TO RUSH?

<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ For most of this season, we've been unable
to put our finger on what's been troubling the Patriots. Sunday it
will be easy.
</P>
<P>
   If the fracture to quarterback Drew Bledsoe's right index finger
sidelines him _ which seems likely, if good sense prevails _ or
badly limits him _ which it obviously will, under any circumstance
_ the Patriots' problems against the Buffalo Bills will be easy to
point to.
</P>
<P>
   That the possible end of this sad season may have come wrapped
in glory seems fitting because it has been that kind of odd year. A
season that began with predictions of a Super Bowl trip has now
dissolved into headlines about a lame duck team fleeing to the
insurance capital of America to play a game in which there are few
assurances of anything, least of all success.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday night, with banners held high imploring Bob Kraft and
Thomas Finneran to rewrite their political version of ``High Noon''
and their fans on the edge of turning into a surly band of
malcontents, a nearly dead Patriot team held on at the last second
and beat the division-leading Dolphins. To have done anything less
would have been a death knell for a season shadowed by despair
dating back to the shocking loss of Curtis Martin last March to the
hated New York Jets. But the victory over Miami came wrapped in
another injury, the last-minute fracture Bledsoe sustained on his
throwing hand in the midst of the game-saving drive.
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe and the Patriots survived that on adrenaline overload as
the quarterback so many fans have wrongly criticized and questioned
for five years ignored pain, pressure, and the inability to fully
grip the football to deliver the way it was always hoped he would.
Yet that moment of glory was surrounded by two ominous signs for
the team's immediate future: Bledsoe gripping his fractured finger
as he left the field and the apparent decision of Pete Carroll's
offense to ignore the coach's sideline pleadings for a timeout as
the final throw approached.
</P>
<P>
   Could anything be a more obvious indication of how Carroll's
team has begun to slip away from him than his charges looking
straight at him as he signaled for a timeout and then turning their
back and returning to the huddle to sail their own ship with
Bledsoe on the bridge?
</P>
<P>
   We can expect Carroll's players to say that they never saw him
signaling or heard him bellowing, and Carroll will agree. It is
what teams do after such a circumstance, because the truth will not
set them free, they fear; it will only complicate matters.
</P>
<P>
   So which do you believe? Empty words or your own eyes?
Individuals, including Kraft and Bobby Grier, will have to make
that determination on their own, but it is an issue for another
day. Today a more pressing matter is the fickle finger of fate that
seems pointed at Bledsoe and his Patriots.
</P>
<P>
   After surviving 13 injuries in recent weeks to key personnel,
can the Patriots survive one more? Can they get more splintered
heroics from Bledsoe or was that simply their last stand, a night
of glory swathed in one injury too many?
</P>
<P>
   If Bledsoe is unable to take snaps from center Dave Wohlabaugh,
would Carroll put him in a permanent shotgun formation and fire it
at the Bills without much threat of a running game to slow
Buffalo's pass rush? Or, if Bledsoe is unable to grip the ball and
his passes begin to soar or dip off-target _ as Bledsoe said some
did Monday night _ will they force-feed a running game that has
been on a starvation diet for a month?
</P>
<P>
   Since losing to the Jets Oct. 19, New England has rushed 98
times for 210 yards, a dismal 2.1-yard average. The bulk of that
back-breaking work has been done by No. 1 draft choice Robert
Edwards, who has carried 80 of those times for a too-hard-earned
182 yards, an average of 2.3 yards a carry. It is a dismal record
of performance yet Tuesday Carroll insisted he would stick with it,
especially now with Bledsoe added to the wounded.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to need that (running game) if Drew is not able to
play,'' Carroll said. ``Once you go dead in the running game, you
can survive one game or two games but (this time of year) you've
got to have it.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we don't answer back this week it diminishes what we did
last week. It's no time for euphoria.''
</P>
<P>
   True enough, because what the dismal rushing numbers suggest is
that Bledsoe will be hard-pressed to rely on his ground game to
take the load off his finger, especially since just two weeks ago,
against these same Bills, it produced just 48 yards on 16 carries.
What that leaves him with then is his arm, and where that leaves
the Patriots is in a dilemma, because if he uses it, it will be a
nine-fingered attack, and if they go without it, they'll be relying
on a rusty attack.
</P>
<P>
   Is a healthy Scott Zolak or Tom Tupa _ who together have thrown
a grand total of 24 passes in the past three years _ a better
choice than a splintered Bledsoe? And will it matter whom they use
if they can't run the ball in a stadium that will have as many Doug
Flutie backers as Patriots supporters?
</P>
<P>
   These are questions that have to be answered to assess the
Patriots' chances of survival this season, and someone will have to
answer them.
</P>
<P>
   The question is who?

<TEXT>
<P>
   Three weeks ago, the popular band R.E.M. released its latest
album, Up. Within days, illegal copies of the disc could be had
literally anywhere on earth.
</P>
<P>
   Unscrupulous pirates have been selling cheap copies of recorded
music for years. But a new breed of pirates isn't &UR;  &LR;  making
crudely-dubbed cassette tapes. Instead, they're creating
high-quality digital copies of the music and publishing it on the
Internet, where anyone can have a listen.
</P>
<P>
   These audio thieves do their dirty work for pleasure, not
profit. And the tools of their trade are easy to find _ a computer,
an Internet connection, some inexpensive software, and contempt for
the copyright laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone is helping themselves to our property, and then, in a
strange Robin Hoodesque move, is offering that property to
others,'' fumes Bob Merlis, a spokesman for R.E.M.'s label, Warner
Bros. Records.
</P>
<P>
   Yet this computerized piracy may be the least of Merlis'
worries.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; The same technology could radically change the world of
recorded music. It can be used by the recording industry itself to
transform the way music is &UR;  &LR;  distributed . Consumers may be able to
buy R.E.M.'s next album directly over the Internet, downloading the
music right onto their hard drives. Or they might not buy entire
albums at all, but instead download songs one at a time to create
their own ideal albums.
</P>
<P>
   All this could devastate the business of traditional music
retailers, on whom the record companies still depend for most of
their sales. And the record companies will have to redesign their
own business models to cope with a world in which consumers can be
far more selective about the music they buy.
</P>
<P>
   The pioneering technology that makes &UR;  &LR;  Internet music
distribution popular, known as MP3, was originally developed to
enable Hollywood studios to put high-quality movie sound onto
CD-ROM-sized disks. But MP3 also enables almost anyone with a
personal computer to make copies of recorded music that sound
almost as good as the original recording. Equally important, MP3
music files are tightly compressed so that hundreds can easily be
stored on a computer's hard drive, or downloaded from the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past year, MP3 has been transformed from a technical
curiosity to a popular entertainment system. Free or low-cost MP3
players, software available on many Internet sites, are being used
by millions to download and record MP3-formated music onto hard
drives. A few record companies and recording artists like Eric
Clapton and Dionne Warwick have embraced the technology as a
promotional tool. They issue sample cuts from new albums on the
Internet in MP3 format, and encourage visitors to download them and
listen.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are MP3 pirates who use ``ripper'' software to copy
CDs into the new format and distribute illegal copies far and wide.
``Anybody with a modern personal computer can pop a CD into the
computer and make an MP3 file out of it,'' says Michael Robertson,
president of MP3.com, a leading distributor of legal MP3 music on
the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   MP3 piracy is still only a minor threat to the recording
industry. Most home computer users have slow Internet connections,
so it would still take five or six minutes to download a typical
MP3 song. Many music lovers would rather buy the disc and be done
with it.
</P>
<P>
   But this bottleneck is quickly disappearing &UR;  &LR; . Already tens of
thousands of Americans have high-speed Internet access at home,
through modems connected to their cable TV systems. And a new
system called ADSL will allow very fast downloads over standard
telephone lines.
</P>
<P>
   Dell Computer Inc. and Compaq Computer Corp., two of the biggest
PC makers, are now selling computers with built-in ADSL modems.
Most of the nation's telephone companies don't offer the new
service yet, but many have begun ADSL service in a few cities. Bell
Atlantic will start offering the service in Boston next year.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, downloading an entire album of songs will take just a few
minutes. And once they're downloaded, they can be converted back
into standard music CD format. Then the music can be ``burned''
onto traditional compact discs &UR;  &LR;  using a CD recorder. Prices for
these recorders are now falling below $200, and their growing
popularity opens a new frontier in music piracy.
</P>
<P>
   Scary as this might seem to the record companies, there's worse
to come. Graphics hardware maker Diamond Multimedia Systems Inc.
announced it would offer a $200 device called Rio, a sort of MP3
Walkman. Rio plugs into a computer and downloads up to an hour of
MP3 files from the PC's &UR;  &LR;  hard drive. Then the user can plug in
headphones and listen anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Rio raises the specter of a cheap, simple device that could make
downloading stolen music into a new national pastime. Last month,
the Recording Industry Association of America, or RIAA &UR; , &LR;  responded
with a federal lawsuit that sought to bar Diamond from selling the
Rio. The RIAA cited the 1992 Audio Home Recording Act, which
requires digital home recording equipment to have a circuit that
prevents making more than one copy of a recording.
</P>
<P>
   Diamond's attorneys responded that the Rio can only download
music from a computer. It can't load the MP3 files onto another
computer or any other digital device. That was good enough for a
federal judge, which rejected the RIAA's demand for an immediate
injunction against Diamond. The Rio is set to go on sale at the end
of November.

<P>
   But the RIAA isn't giving up. The group still believes it will
win its &UR;  &LR;  case against the Rio at trial. Meanwhile, the RIAA is
waging an aggressive campaign against Internet sites that feature
illegal MP3 copies of popular music. ``We get calls from bands and
managers every day, asking us to get their records off MP3 files,''
says RIAA president Hillary Rosen.
</P>
<P>
   In response, RIAA uses a Web ``crawler'', software that
automatically searches the Web for MP3 files. When any are found,
the software reports to investigators who visit the site to
determine if the MP3 files are legal. If they aren't, the RIAA
complains to the Internet provider where the files are hosted.
Usually, the files quickly disappear.
</P>
<P>
   But Rosen admits her campaign against the pirates is like
bailing the ocean with a CD case. She says that the Audio Home
Recording Act should be applied to all recordable CD-ROM devices
and MP3 recorders. They should all be required to add chips that
limit their ability to copy MP3 files. ``Technology has to provide
the solution,'' says Rosen.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, technology has already provided a solution _ software
that lets record companies sell their songs electronically over the
Internet, while maintaining control of their artistic properties.
The best-known of these secure Internet music systems comes from
Liquid Audio Inc. of Redwood City, Calif. The Liquid Audio system
boasts sound quality at least as good as MP3, but with built-in
encryption features that give music vendors plenty of control over
the downloaded songs.
</P>
<P>
   To download a free Liquid Audio player, the user must provide
personal information, so that he or she can be traced. Any Liquid
Audio music files he downloads can be transferred to another
computer but the files won't play back unless the new owner pays
for it. The file can be burned onto a CD, but only once. And while
a pirate could make copies from that single CD, each pirate copy
would contain a digital watermark, an encrypted code, that
identifies the person who first downloaded it, making it easy to
hunt down the music thief.
</P>
<P>
   Liquid Audio also contains a ``passport'' program that stores
credit card data. It enables the user to pay for an entire CD or an
individual song. An artist could charge a dollar or two to someone
who listens to a song. Knitting Factory, a Web site that sells
Liquid Audio recordings, uses a 10-cents-per-minute pricing scheme.
Download a three-minute song, and your credit card is charged 30
cents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody wins,'' says Liquid Audio spokesman Bill Woods.
``The consumer wins and the artist wins because they're going to
get paid.'' Woods argues that most consumers are honest, and will
gladly pay for Internet music if it's readily available. But up to
now, few record companies have been willing to offer on-line music
for fear of theft. Liquid Audio aims to change this.
</P>
<P>
   But what if Liquid Audio, MP3 and other technologies for digital
distribution of music succeed &UR; .  &LR;  Suddenly, the entire record
business will begin to look very different, for musicians, record
companies and retailers.
</P>
<P>
   Woods sees the change as good news for artists, who can now gain
public exposure faster and cheaper than ever. ``They don't have to
go into the studio for six months and come back with 72 minutes of
music,'' he says. Instead, a little-known independent band, or a
superstar outfit like R.E.M., could record just one song, and sell
it to all comers.
</P>
<P>
   Good for the band, perhaps, but disastrous for the record
company. ``It's a potential way to lose vast amounts of money,''
says Warner Bros.' Merlis. ``We have to record an entire album to
produce a viable product.'' Singles alone won't bring in enough
revenue, he says. Besides, Merlis warns of a sharp decline in the
quality of music, as artists stop designing complete albums with a
unified theme and just begin banging out hot-selling pop tunes.
</P>
<P>
   And what's to become of the traditional record store? Companies
like Tower Records, which sell millions of dis &UR; c &LR; s every year from
119 stores &UR;  &LR; in the United States, could see their sales decline if
large numbers of consumers buy music on-line. That would probably
anger retail executives who would find themselves in competition
with their erstwhile business partners, the record companies.
</P>
<P>
   Liquid Audio's Woods concedes that fear of a backlash from
retailers has made some record companies think twice about using
his firm's technology. ``Were they to do that, they would break the
covenant with their existing retail chain,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   For now, record companies are limiting their use of Liquid Audio
to albums by little-known artists, or teaser cuts from major
recording stars like Lyle Lovett. Woods thinks the major record
companies will also test the water by issuing downloadable versions
of older, out-of-print recordings rather than the latest hits.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Mike Farrace, Tower's vice president of worldwide
marketing, thinks the Internet &UR;  &LR;  could become a major channel for
all sorts of popular music. ``There's a possibility that this could
represent a dramatic and potentially significant...delivery
method,`` Farrace says.
</P>
<P>
   Already faced with growing purchases of CDs by mail from
Internet sites, Tower expects that electronic music delivery will
make it harder to keep the customers coming. ``We just have to be
sharper and better, and make it more fun and interesting to come
into a record store than to go onto the Internet,'' Farrace says.
</P>
<P>
   Just as online bookstores haven't driven traditional book
retailers &UR;  &LR;  out of business, record stores will certainly survive
the rise of downloaded music. But they'll have to offer an
appealing ambience and lower prices. Otherwise many of their
traditional customers could download R.E.M.'s next album instead.
They might not bother to pay for it.

CHRISTMAS TREE BUSINESS FACES TOUGH COMPETITION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JO-ANN JOHNSTON  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALTAMONT, N.Y. _ The product development cycle is long and the
profit margins are slim, but the finished products sure do smell
good.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers can start catching a whiff this weekend, when
Christmas tree growers open up their plantations and ship trees to
retailers for the hectic and competitive Yuletide selling season.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, tree farmers say, a fresh tree you buy this weekend will
easily last through Christmas if properly cared for. So again this
year, New York farmers, who account for more than $30 million in
annual sales of trees and wreaths, will be touting the virtues of
their crops as they compete for sales with other top tree-producing
regions, including the Midwest, the Carolinas and Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Demand is usually strong at Weathered Willow Tree Farm in the
upstate New York community of Altamont, said Earl MacIntosh, who
owns the farm with his wife, Anne.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can sell them as fast as I can grow them,'' he said. Of
course, that's not so fast. It can take 12 years or more to grow a
tree from seedling to maturity in colder climates.
</P>
<P>
   So MacIntosh has stepped up his production cycle in recent
planting seasons by purchasing 5-year-old nursery transplants and
raising them for only another ``seven or eight years on top of
that, if I'm lucky.''
</P>
<P>
   The MacIntoshes run an elaborate Christmas tree operation.
Customers can come for either a daylong holiday excursion into the
countryside, or just a quick errand, the MacIntoshes say. They grow
a variety of different species, and sell most of them on a
choose-and-cut basis.
</P>
<P>
   Customers can ride up into the plantation fields on a wagon that
is pulled by Earl MacIntosh, driving his blue Ford tractor. He
makes stops at different spots where customers can shop for a
Fraser fir, a blue spruce, balsam fir or other variety.
</P>
<P>
   The customers typically use a borrowed angled bow saw to cut
down the tree of their choosing. Then, clutching their trees, they
hitch a ride back down the hill on the wagon. They pay for the
trees at a little cashier's booth in the front yard and may
purchase a wreath or hot chocolate, and then drive away.
</P>
<P>
   Another selection of precut trees is kept cool in a barn to sell
to customers in more of a rush.
</P>
<P>
   In the warmer months, like all other tree-farm operators,
MacIntosh ``shears'' the branches to get attractively shaped trees,
mows the grass between the trees and guards against the hazards of
insects, weeds, bad weather and deer nibbling on tree buds.
Typically, growers raise 1,000 trees an acre.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a case of just putting a tree out and letting it
grow; it doesn't work like that,'' agrees 89-year-old Willard Ives
of Brunswick, who still operates Mountain Gardens Tree Farm with
the help of his daughter. Ives has been raising trees for 40 years,
almost since Christmas trees first emerged as a commercial crop in
the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   So while a choose-and-cut operation demands extra seasonal
attention for six weeks or so, tree farming already is a heavily
labor-intensive business for much of the year, and hired help is
often hard to find.
</P>
<P>
   In the wider view of the business, creating a holiday ``tourist
attraction'' with a choose-and-cut venue probably isn't much more
work, and more important, probably is the best way to make money in
Christmas trees, said Bruce Carpenter, owner of River Bend Tree
Farm. He raises Scotch pines in Lake Luzerne. Carpenter currently
sells his trees wholesale to groups like the Kiwanis, usually for
about $12 a tree, or about half of what the groups charge retail
customers.
</P>
<P>
   He is only breaking even this way, he said.
</P>
<P>
   While the overhead is high, low prices are also undoubtedly part
of the problem.
</P>
<P>
   For years, there were too many trees on the market, with
less-expensive trees for sale at supermarket lots and convenient
retail parking lots.
</P>
<P>
   There also is competition from Canadian growers, who have a
built-in advantage in selling to the U.S. market because the
American dollar is so much stronger.
</P>
<P>
   In the short term, Carpenter is competing by stressing the
freshness of his trees and urging civic groups to buy local. He
labels his trees with ``Pride of New York'' tags developed by the
state Department of Agriculture and Markets to promote the state's
crops.
</P>
<P>
   Other farmers are doing the same, and supplementing profits by
selling wreaths, which, at $30 to $35 retail, can fetch more money
than trees.
</P>
<P>
   But these are just short-term tactics, Carpenter said. In the
longer term, it probably makes more sense to consolidate his land
holdings into one parcel and put up a barn. Then he can sell a
wider variety of accessories and refreshments, as the MacIntoshes
do, and keep the profit margins on the trees to himself.
</P>
<P>
   Still, slim profit margins are a fact of life in Christmas tree
farming, says Robert Norris, executive secretary of the New York
Christmas Tree Growers' Association Inc., which claims about 700
members.
</P>
<P>
   ``If somebody's making 10 percent, they're doing well,'' Norris
said.

MAKE PLANS BEFORE YOU SHOP SO YOU WON'T DROP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE M. SPITZA  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - Thanksgiving weekend is about feasts, football and, of
course, foraging for gifts.
</P>
<P>
   Retailers have candidly dubbed Friday ``Black Friday'' _ the day
when stores hope to start moving out of the ``red'' and into the
``black.'' Venturing out to the malls on what is one of the busiest
shopping days of the year is not for the shopping-challenged.
Parking trauma, pushy purchasers and long lines to see the big guy
(that would be Santa) can squelch even the most heartfelt
inclinations for peace on Earth _ not to mention goodwill towards
your fellow man.
</P>
<P>
   Heading out on your gift-buying adventure with a budget and a
strategic plan of attack, however, just may save your sanity. It's
also likely to lessen the damage done to your pocketbook. (Heaven
forbid, you may even have some fun.) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Jolly good advice
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The best pre-shopping advice comes from a world-renowned expert
on holiday gift giving: Santa.
</P>
<P>
   ``Make a list and check it twice,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   (A wise man, that Santa. A snappy dresser, too.)
</P>
<P>
   Compiling a list of every last person you plan to buy a gift for
is the first step toward reining in runaway holiday spending.
Playing Scrooge by settling on a maximum dollar amount for each
gift (including shipping) is the next step. Sure, you can have big
fun buying willy-nilly for everyone from Uncle Fred to Fido, but a
financial hangover is no way to start the new year.
</P>
<P>
   `` `Budgeting' is kind of a dirty word because it implies not
only tracking and monitoring your spending but restraining
yourself,'' said Tony Cook, managing editor of Quicken.com, a
leading personal-finance site on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main benefit (to budgeting) is that you are less inclined
to make impulse purchases that you will regret on Jan. 1, 1999.''
</P>
<P>
   According to a holiday-spending survey conducted by Intuit Inc.
_ maker of the Quicken personal-finance software _ 60 percent
ofAmericans don't set a holiday budget. Yet, 30 percent think they
spend too much on holiday gifts.
</P>
<P>
   Cook's advice is simple: Set a realistic budget and stick to it.
Plan your shopping. Know _ at least vaguely _ what you want to buy
for each person on your list before you leave for the mall. Avoid
shopping for the sake of shopping to lessen the chance of impulse
purchases. Finally, don't shop when you're tired, hungry or feel
pressured. (Translation: Don't wait until Christmas Eve to do your
Santa bit.) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Budget matters
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Just how much the average American plans to spend this holiday
season seems to be up for grabs. The Intuit survey predicts $1,003
a household, up from $816 last year. A national survey released by
Syracuse University forecasts that shoppers will spend an average
of $977, up $200 from last year, according to its figures. Yet
another survey, by Deloitte &AMP; Touche and the National Retail
Federation, says consumers plan to spend $814 this year.
</P>
<P>
   These crystal-ball projections may vary, but each represents a
sizable outlay, which makes it worthwhile to consider in advance
what you plan to spend.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want to give within your means,'' Cook said. ``You make
trade-offs. That's sort of unpleasant, but it's much easier to do
it before than after, when you are stuck with a bill you really
don't want to pay.''
</P>
<P>
   Figuring out just how much to spend is not an easy task. Frugal
financial specialists suggest spending only what you can afford to
buy with cold hard cash (no charge cards, please) _ and spreading
holiday purchases over several paychecks.
</P>
<P>
   Those planning to pull out the plastic are advised to charge no
more than they can reasonably pay off by March _ at the latest.
Putting all holiday purchases on a single low-interest bank card is
also recommended. This will consolidate your holiday debt, giving
you a single view of what you owe. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
When to shop
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With the ``Bah, humbug'' of holiday budgeting out of the way,
it's time to concentrate on a serious shopping strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Thanksgiving Day's newspaper is traditionally the biggest of the
year _ weighing in at several pounds and packed with oodles of ads.
Clipping sales ads and cross-referencing the items with the gifts
on your list is a good plan of attack. Mapping your shopping route
with the minimum amount of travel is also wise. Keep in mind that
mall parking lots will fill quickly, so an early start is advised.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix-area gift consultant Liz Lyons advises writing down what
you buy for every person on your list as you make your purchases.
</P>
<P>
   ``Noting every item you bought for that individual is absolutely
critical because, otherwise, you will forget what you purchased for
that person,'' she said. ``I guarantee it.''
</P>
<P>
   Because a lot of energy is spent finding a really good gift,
Lyons also suggests buying that very same item for several people
on your list. Especially if they don't know each other.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Lyons recommends clustering your shopping. This will
help keep stress and confusion to a minimum. For example, if you
have several children on your list, shop for all of them at the
same time in stores that cater to kids. If you have three or four
feminine-clothing gifts to buy, concentrate on finding them during
a single outing.
</P>
<P>
   One final note. Although the day after Thanksgiving may be the
busiest shopping day of the year, it is actually the last Saturday
before Christmas (Dec. 19 this year) that tends to be the day with
the biggest sales volume. This fact simply serves as another
incentive to get your holiday shopping done early. &QL;

UNDER EVERY ROCK LURKS A POLLSTER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID LEIBOWITZ  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDTAED - The story ran small in ``The Arizona Republic,'' but
my disgust was anything but. I read it three times, not for its
content, but for the directive that story positively shouted.
</P>
<P>
   It's a simple mandate, a twist on Shakespeare.
</P>
<P>
   Let's kill all the pollsters!
</P>
<P>
   They slaughtered politics first, see, then barraged us with
useless trivia. Now they've turned dangerous, as this nasty little
story shows.
</P>
<P>
   Its headline, in bold: ``Poll: Third of Blacks anti-Semitic.''
</P>
<P>
   This was a phone poll, paid for by the pro-Jewish zealots at the
Anti-Defamation League. Their pollster queried 999 adults
nationwide, asking them to agree or disagree with the usual
stereotypes:
</P>
<P>
   - ``Jews have too much power in the U.S. today.''
</P>
<P>
   - ``Jews still talk too much about what happened to them in the
Holocaust.''
</P>
<P>
   - ``Jews have too much influence over the American news media.''
</P>
<P>
   The findings were supposed to be heartening: Only 12 percent of
Americans now hold ``strong anti-Semitic opinions,'' said the
pollsters, down 8 percent from 1992. Unfortunately, the ADL and its
hired hands couldn't resist getting ugly.
</P>
<P>
   In a poll allegedly concerned with prejudice, they divided up
respondents by skin color _ highlighting race on a subject where it
needs no highlighting.
</P>
<P>
   Only 21 percent of Blacks got the ADL ``not anti-Semitic'' stamp
of approval. While 45 percent were in the middle, another 34
percent were branded ``most anti-Semitic.'' Only 9 percent of
Whites were so labeled. &QL; 
 &QL; 
POLLING AS A WEAPON &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Said ADL national director Abraham Foxman: ``We do not pretend
to fully understand why the discrepancy between White and Black
attitudes exists.''
</P>
<P>
   Thanks, Abe. Then why bring it up?
</P>
<P>
   Allow me to answer: Using a poll to reinforce a tired stereotype
_ Blacks hate Jews _ gives the ADL reams of publicity and, better
yet, the bogeyman they so badly need to survive.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble is, the resultant seven-paragraph story in ``The
Republic,'' multiplied by newspapers and newscasts nationwide, acts
as a wedge, one more way to fracture America the Divided. It's not
polling as a tool, but polling as a weapon.
</P>
<P>
   You see it often in politics, under the alias ``push poll'' _
asking loaded questions about a foe in hopes of influencing the
respondent. You say you support Candidate Joe Arpaio, sheriff of
Maricopa County, for King of the World; the pollster has a
follow-up question.
</P>
<P>
   ``Would it make any difference,'' he asks, ``if I told you
Candidate Arpaio is an egomaniacal media hound who, in his spare
time, calls press conferences to highlight his obsession with
satanical teenagers who allegedly eat the hearts of defenseless
kitty cats?''
</P>
<P>
   It probably wouldn't, but that's a story for another day.
</P>
<P>
   The push poll has an equally evil cousin _ ``poll-testing,'' the
specialty of our president, who's never met a principle worth
standing on until a pollster unfurls the ``Welcome'' mat. The
V-chip, gun safety locks, school uniforms, education tax credits _
all pandering, all poll-born. &QL; 
 &QL; 
POLLS FOR EVERY ISSUE &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's a national rage, this taking of the population's
temperature. When not used for evil, it's mostly used for garbage.
</P>
<P>
   According to PollNET, the Internet's leading pollster, 16
percent of us still ``sometimes get sad or angry'' at the death of
Princess Diana. Two percent are ``not sure'' if ``Saving Private
Ryan'' was too violent. And 41 percent said ``Yes, immediately'' to
the question of the U.S. abiding by the Kyoto agreement.
</P>
<P>
   There's a poll for every issue. Beneath every rock lurks a
pollster.
</P>
<P>
   Drop it on their heads. Or, at the very least, lie to them. Lie
like a rug.
</P>
<P>
   ``Totally approve'' of Ken Starr. ``Seriously worry'' about
global warming. ``Definitely'' label Bill Clinton honest.
</P>
<P>
   Lie enough, and our ideas may again become our own. Get caught,
and there's an easy excuse: You were told to lie by some Jew who
controls a newspaper column. &QL;

HOLIDAY FEAST BECOMES A LANGUAGE LESSON FOR IMMIGRANTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ANNIE NAKAO  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The first day of school is hard enough for
anybody, but Kenneth Mo, 8, had to deal with his very first pumpkin
pie, too.
</P>
<P>
   He and some 100 other immigrant students at the Chinese
Education Center in San Francisco took part in an American
tradition on Tuesday: their first Thanksgiving feast.
</P>
<P>
   Mo said the pie was ``ho-ho,'' or good, in Cantonese.
</P>
<P>
   Surrounded by their beaming parents and teachers, the children
experienced the quintessential American holiday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything's brand-new, everything is fresh,'' said teacher
Marian Fong. ``Like the pilgrims.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the children, grades kindergarten through 5, are Chinese
immigrants who have been in the country for no more than six
months. They spend a year in transition at the center, which uses a
bilingual approach in teaching non-English-speaking students.
</P>
<P>
   Principal May Huie sees Thanksgiving as a particularly
meaningful holiday for the newcomers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every culture has its way of celebrating family and
togetherness,'' Huie said. ``In America, Thanksgiving is the
holiday that perhaps best reflects family tradition and
togetherness.''
</P>
<P>
   As part of their Thanksgiving experience, the youngsters
compared their own immigrant experience with that of the pilgrims.
</P>
<P>
   ``Settling here, these kids also had a lot of relatives to stay
with,'' Fong said. ``The pilgrims didn't have relatives.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, food being the centerpiece of any Thanksgiving
experience, the children got a good grounding in preparing the
traditional meal.
</P>
<P>
   They went shopping for the essentials, and helped make teacher
Marlene Tran's ``delicious candy yams,'' stuffing and pumpkin pie.
</P>
<P>
   ``They read the whole recipe _ they know what they're eating,''
Fong said.
</P>
<P>
   Then it was time for the feast. The pie was a hands-down
favorite.
</P>
<P>
   Proud parent Yan Shao Xia ate her meal with the other parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's my first Thanksgiving,'' she said through a translator.
``I like it because it's so special.''
</P>
<P>
   For Fong, the ritual is part of a transition.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're just at the very beginning. Most of my kids have been
with me only since August,'' she said. ``But they know a lot
already.''

 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. _ We never knew her as Foo Tooey Moo, ``Moo''
being a Cantonese word of respect for older women. Her
transliterated name was Soo Hoo Shee Tom. Neither of those names,
however, contained her true Chinese married family name, which was
Fong.
</P>
<P>
   This is not a recitation on the vagaries of Chinese names during
the Chinese Exclusion Act era of American history (1882-1943). It
is about one of the last, if not the last, old Chinese women of
pre-World War II Oakland Chinatown, where I grew up.
</P>
<P>
   Foo Tooey Moo was 92 years old when she died on Nov. 14. Her
passing punctuates the passing of an era, almost ineffably. It was
just this past summer that another Oakland Chinatown icon, George
Catambay, a barber of Filipino descent, died at the age of 93.
</P>
<P>
   In their own ways, both Mrs. Tom and Mr. Catambay epitomized the
compact, tight-knit Asian district of Oakland when legal
segregation was the law of the land. Not only did both manage to
survive hostile conditions, they also left enduring legacies in the
form of large and productive extended families.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Tom's wake and funeral brought out an overflowing crowd,
many of whom were of the same generation of her seven American-born
children, ranging in age from about 60 to early 70s.
</P>
<P>
   The services were like a reunion of the children of the old
Chinatown generation that struggled in the 1920s and 1930s and
finally began to prosper during the war years of the early 1940s.
(A major shipyard operated six blocks from Oakland's Chinatown.)
Many of these ``children'' have had children and grandchildren of
their own. They have worked and retired, living now in the suburbs
or the Oakland hills, far from the pulsating grit of flatland
Chinatown.
</P>
<P>
   According to the eulogy delivered by Beverly Low, one of the
daughters, Mrs. Tom was born in Guangdong Province in China in
1906, married when she was 19, and emigrated to Oakland in 1926.
Beginning in 1927, she began having children, seven in all. In
1943, she and her husband bought Man Lung, a grocery store.
</P>
<P>
   Tragically, her husband died six years later, leaving her at age
43 with seven children to raise. With almost no education and
limited English proficiency, she raised a family and made her small
business thrive. In all, she had 38 grandchildren, 39 great
grandchildren and one great great grandchild.
</P>
<P>
   After she retired from her business, she became a Christian at
the age of 74. Her daughter, Beverly, said her mother always
practiced the Golden Rule _ do unto others as you would have them
do unto you _ even before she embraced Christianity.
</P>
<P>
   My parents operated a restaurant around the corner from Mrs.
Tom's grocery store. One of my older sisters, Li Keng Wong, a
retired schoolteacher, told of our indebtedness to Mrs. Tom. When
my mother and her three young daughters emigrated to Oakland in
1933, Mrs. Tom ``reached out to our family and helped us in our
transition to a new strange world,'' Li Keng said in a letter to
Mrs. Tom at the funeral services. ``You were ever so thoughtful.''
</P>
<P>
   I, too, remember Mrs. Tom as a kind, caring, extroverted woman
who unfailingly asked about our family.
</P>
<P>
   Oakland's Chinatown today is much larger, filled with newer
immigrants of all ages. The outside world is less intimidating now
than it was when Mrs. Tom was a young parent. By bowling over huge
societal and personal obstacles, Mrs. Tom embodied the indomitable
can-do spirit of many immigrants, past and present.

NOTARO: HUSBAND HAS A DREAM, WIFE HAS NIGHTMARES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By LAURI NOTARO  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - It didn't hit me that he was serious until he brought
the box home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look,'' my husband said, lifting the lid and exposing two
matched bright and shiny shoes. ``They're new!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Those look like running shoes!'' I balked.
</P>
<P>
   He took a deep breath and shot me a look. ``They (begin ital)
are (end ital) running shoes,'' he said, shaking his head. ``I told
you I'm going to run that marathon with some people at work. We're
a team!''
</P>
<P>
   I never believed him. How could I? We're not running people.
We're not even people that walk very fast. We're shufflers. Look at
our shoes. It's always the outside rim that gets worn out first.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not built for that sort of thing. The most athletic
activity we engage ourselves in is chewing,'' I said, shocked at
how much I really did sound like my mother. ``Bringing those things
into this house is sacrilege!''
</P>
<P>
   The thought of my husband jogging secretly scared me. One of the
big reasons I married him was because he wasn't a jock. That was on
my list of things to avoid when choosing a spouse. Don't marry
anyone who weighs less than you. Don't marry anyone who refers to
you as ``My Old Lady,'' ``the Warden,'' or ``Babe.'' Don't marry
anyone who wears tennis socks instead of real socks. Don't marry a
guy who would rather burn calories than sit on the couch with me,
eating chips and dip.
</P>
<P>
   Even the first time my husband watched a basketball game, I was
horrified and felt betrayed but figured, well, at least he's
sitting down. Our relationship is still solid.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did you want to borrow a bra?'' I said. ``Those things hurt
when they bounce up and down.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, I thought I saw a red hourglass shape on your belly.
But I'm going to ignore that last spray of venom,'' he said,
lifting his leg up to the arm of the couch and leaning over toward
it. ``I'm going to take it out on the track!''
</P>
<P>
   ``OK, Sporty Spice,'' I shot. ``But you just remember what
happened last time you did something active!''
</P>
<P>
   I didn't really need to remind him. We're still paying the bills
for the ambulance ride and the months of physical therapy he had to
endure after hitting a bank of sand on a dirt bike last year and
dislocating his shoulder. While his brother went for help, my
husband lay in the desert for a couple of hours like a pork chop as
big, filthy birds started to circle from above. When he finally got
to the hospital, they shot him up with morphine, after which he
burst into a dialogue of Elizabethan verse and scared a couple of
nurses who were dressing his arm in a sling. Thankfully, the
accident happened in October, so for Halloween, we put a ballpoint
pen in my husband's hand and he went as Bob Dole.
</P>
<P>
   I had visions of this marathon ending the same way. I was
convinced that he would finish this race on a stretcher after he
ran into a light pole or a parked car. I, in turn, would be forced
to spend the remainder of the day listening to a soliloquy from
``Macbeth'' in some emergency room, repeatedly telling him that the
damn spot in my lap was the crust of the Ding Dong I'd dropped at
breakfast and nothing more.
</P>
<P>
   For a month, my husband trained, stopped indulging in bad habits
and started eating dried fruit and things with oats in them. He had
become determined, dedicated to his dream. He had become a runner.
</P>
<P>
   The night before the race, I had a horrible nightmare. I was at
the race, watching the runners, and all of a sudden, loud peals of
laughter broke out from the crowd. As I looked to see what was
causing the commotion, I saw my husband pass, and I gasped. He was
running like a girl. His little arms twirled in circles as they
flailed from his body flamboyantly, and people started to point,
calling out, ``Look at the girlie guy! Hey, Pansy Man, are those
running shorts or a G-string!''
</P>
<P>
   I was just waking up from this dream when I smelled something
foul and noticed my husband sitting on the edge of the bed. Next to
him was a little jar of Icy Hot, and he was generously smearing it
on every part of his body that bends.
</P>
<P>
   ``You smell like a rest home,'' I said. ``If you insist on
putting that in your hair, there's nothing I can do to help you.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Take it out on the track!'' I heard him say to himself as he
walked out of the room. ``Take it out on the track!''
</P>
<P>
   ``When you run,'' I called out after him, ``do me a favor and
keep your hands down at your sides! Think of manly things, like
chopping down trees or building fires!''
</P>
<P>
   When the rest of his team arrived at our house, they pinned
their numbers on and did some last-minute stretching.
</P>
<P>
   I saw him as he pointed to two overflowing ashtrays on the
coffee table and showed them to the team. ``This is Laurie's, and
this is the Warden's, too,'' he continued, picking up my inhaler. I
scurried back into the hallway before I was forced to listen to the
healthy people laugh at me.
</P>
<P>
   An hour later, I was at the ballpark, standing with the rest of
the people watching the runners cross the finish line. I was afraid
that I had gotten there late, but after I saw that the runners who
were finishing were still in fairly good physical condition, I knew
I hadn't missed my husband. I stood for a while as the crowd
cheered them on, and suddenly, I smelled old people and then saw
him.
</P>
<P>
   He jogged right past me, thin streams of sweat running down his
face, his eyes staring straight ahead. He wasn't even bleeding,
though there were little bits of grass and a candy wrapper stuck to
one of the Icy Hot spots. No one was laughing, his arms were bent
at the proper angles, and his shorts hadn't risen up between his
thighs.
</P>
<P>
   He had done it.
</P>
<P>
   I jumped and waved and heard myself scream, ``Yea, honey!'' and
inside my heart I felt a little flutter, but I don't think it was a
heart attack from jumping.
</P>
<P>
   I think that, maybe, it was pride. &QL;

MERCEDES, NISSAN MAKE KEY CHANGES  
 (ADV: EMBARGOED FOR SATURDAY, NOV. 28) 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB GOLFEN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - Two very different types of vehicles _ a slick,
expensive sports car and a practical compact pickup truck _ share
the space this week.
</P>
<P>
   The Mercedes-Benz SLK Kompressor and the Nissan Frontier SE may
seem like the original odd couple, but they do have one thing in
common: each suffered from a serious omission in '98 that has been
rectified for '99.
</P>
<P>
   When the SLK appeared on the scene last year, there was
something about the wedgy two-seater that was just not right.
</P>
<P>
   It looked cool, especially when the trick folding top was down.
With its supercharged engine, it ran like a strong little bear.
</P>
<P>
   But it had a problem, pretty obvious to everyone except,
perhaps, Mercedes-Benz. For here was a hot little sports car that
came only with automatic transmission.
</P>
<P>
   So although well-heeled sports-car buyers scooped up every
stick-shift BMW Z3 and Porsche Boxster that came along, and even
Chevrolet Corvette was delivering a much higher percentage of
manual transmissions than projected, the SLK soldiered on with
automatic only. Yawn.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Mercedes sees the light and offers the SLK with
five-speed manual and a few other enhancements that help shed its
wallflower image in favor of something more flamboyant.
</P>
<P>
   What a difference a year makes. Stick shift is a huge
improvement in this car, creating a more lively feeling, more like
a sports car and less like a two-seat poser.
</P>
<P>
   Particularly enjoyable is the exhaust note that raps behind your
right ear when you have the top down. Handling is very
Mercedes-like, precise and agile, with a suspension that's a bit
soft for an all-out sports car.
</P>
<P>
   The SLK is much more pleasant with the top down, looking better
in profile and freeing you from the narrow confines of the small,
pagodalike top. SLK still has the only fold-away hardtop in the
business, combining the security advantages of a coupe with the
sensual pleasures of a convertible.
</P>
<P>
   The four-cylinder engine may seem small for the lofty price, but
a supercharger (that's the Kompressor) provides enough extra oomph
to be up to snuff with competitors Z3 and Boxster. With the stick
shift, the engine is unleashed, revving quickly into its power band
and feeling so much freer and more powerful than with the
automatic.
</P>
<P>
   The stick shift in our test car felt like it had undergone some
serious abuse from past journalist road testers, seeming vague and
disconnected in the first- and second-gear positions.
</P>
<P>
   The SLK still draws lots of attention on the street, turning
plenty of heads, especially female ones. It's really a honey,
though still much too expensive for most people to even consider.
The Sports package of upgraded wheels, tires and suspension added a
cool $4,000 to the base price.
</P>
<P>
   More down to earth is the Nissan Frontier, which gets a major
power boost for '99.
</P>
<P>
   Frontier is the latest pickup truck to wear the Nissan (nee
Datsun) badge since the Japanese company began exporting them to
the United States in 1959. Then, the diminutive pickup was more of
an oddity, but soon became a popular mainstay.
</P>
<P>
   Frontier is the latest, but for the past two model years, it has
been available only with a four-cylinder engine. It's a good four,
smooth and strong, but not really up to the torque war that is
raging among pickup-truck makers.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Frontier also has an available V-6, a 170-horse unit
that puts out 200 pound-feet of torque, enough to pull a
5,000-pound load or accelerate briskly from a stoplight. The new
engine is available only in four-wheel-drive King Cab truck models,
however, leaving all two-wheel-drive and short-cab models to make
do with the four.
</P>
<P>
   Our test truck, a pre-production model, had all the bells and
whistles available in the SE package. That included a dynamite
stereo system (with subwoofer built into the rear of the cab) and
standard bucket seats. The two jump seats in the back are really
small and should be considered only as occasional seating for
children or teeny adults.
</P>
<P>
   The Frontier has a generally kinder, softer suspension than
Nissan pickups of the past, with more creature comforts and
amenities than usually found in this range of truck. It has a nice
ride, though with its tall 4-by-4 suspension and bigger wheels and
tires, the handling can be kind of tippy.
</P>
<P>
   The rear wheels squeal a bit too easily on acceleration,
especially in curves, making the Frontier seem more squirrelly than
it really is. I didn't get a chance to take the Frontier off-road,
but I've driven plenty of Nissan trucks in rugged places, and they
pass muster. So I'm confident that the Frontier would do well under
harsh circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   So whether you're a well-off SLK driver or a working person
looking for a solid truck, these two have each moved up a notch in
ability and desirability. &QL;

AOL CHIEF SEES IMPROVEMENTS WITH ACQUISITION OF NETSCAPE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MATT BEER  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ While Wall Street analysts chewed over America
Online's $4.2 billion acquisition of Internet pioneer Netscape
Communications Corp., computer users were asking what was in it for
them.
</P>
<P>
   The San Francisco Examiner posed some user questions to AOL
chief executive Steve Case in a telephone interview Tuesday from
his headquarters in Dulles, Va.:
</P>
<P>
   Question: Will AOL cost more?
</P>
<P>
   Answer: No.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is AOL going to invest in system improvements so I can get
on-line faster?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes. We've invested over a billion dollars over the last year
in system improvements, and that continues. We've made tremendous
progress over the last year and a half in improving the quality of
access. The busy signals that we had a real problem with a year and
a half to two years ago have largely subsided. There are still
certain cities at certain times of the day where there may be
problems, but it's not a significant national problem.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How else will the merger affect AOL right now?
</P>
<P>
   A: The merger won't be complete for three or four months. Then
over time, we'll incrementally add functionality to AOL where it
makes sense. But for now, the AOL service, the AOL experience, will
stay pretty much the same. (The merger) is more about building the
Netscape-Netcenter brand to reach another audience. It really has
less to do with the AOL service itself.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Will Netscape keep being updated?
</P>
<P>
   A: Absolutely.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Will Netscape continue to be free?
</P>
<P>
   A: Absolutely.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Will the Netscape browser continue to let me browse the whole
Web or just AOL-affiliated sites?
</P>
<P>
   A: Everything, absolutely. We recognize that there's a lot of
momentum for what Netscape is doing. Tens of millions of people use
the software. Nine million in the last year have registered as
users of the Netscape-Netcenter site.
</P>
<P>
   Our strategy, when we do acquisitions _ we acquired Compuserve a
year ago _ is to try to allow them to run as an independent entity
and to provide support wherever it's helpful.
</P>
<P>
   Take the ICQ (Web-chatting software) audience, for example,
which we acquired six months ago. A lot of people said, ``Oh,
what's going to happen here? AOL is going to acquire this, start
charging for it and start putting ads on.'' Six months later, the
audience there has doubled, and they're as happy as can be with the
enhancements we've added to the service.
</P>
<P>
   All of the fears have been for naught. The same will be true
here.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Will my AOL Web browser change?
</P>
<P>
   A: No.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is AOL going to eventually wind up being totally on the Web?
</P>
<P>
   A: We will use whatever technologies seem appropriate to create
the best possible experience for consumers. We're doing more and
more things on the Web, but there's still benefits to using some of
the capabilities we've got uniquely on AOL.

ARTS(AT)LARGE 
 PUTTING A PRICE TAG ON DIGITAL ART 
</HEADLINE>
  By MATTHEW MIRAPAUL 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   How much is that Degas in the browser window?
</P>
<P>
   Money is a subject that few in the art world will discuss
openly, and the topic becomes even more challenging when the focus
is on digital art, a genre so new and unusual that sale prices and
other decimal points of reference are nearly impossible to come by.
</P>
<P>
   As digital art slowly gains acceptance from museums and other
arbiters of cultural taste, the issue of ``Net worth'' is emerging
as a complex one. At the same time, a few artists are beginning to
challenge the notion that Web-based works are without value because
no one knows what kind of price tag to hang on them.
</P>
<P>
   The Walker Art Center in Minneapolis is a case in point. On Nov.
20 the museum announced its acquisition of the complete archives of
adaweb, the pioneering exhibition space for original online art.
The adaweb archives will serve as the centerpiece of the Walker's
new digital-art study collection, also to be unveiled on Friday as
part of a broad and visionary program that establishes the museum
as the leader in high-tech cultural initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   The adaweb site, which features online works by Jenny Holzer,
Lawrence Weiner and others, increasingly appears to be one of the
landmarks of the digital-art era -- so much so that ``The
Unreliable Archivist,'' a clever new piece on the Walker site, uses
adaweb as its raw materials.
</P>
<P>
   Yet trying to assign a dollar value to adaweb has been a
worthless exercise to date.
</P>
<P>
   The site, which has not been updated since its publisher,
Digital City Inc., stopped funding the 3-year-old project earlier
this year, is being donated to the Walker. This charitable gesture
will result in no tax benefits for Digital City because the firm
has been unable to determine the site's value, according to adaweb
co-founder John Borthwick, who is now vice president of product
development and programming at AOL Studios, the America Online
division responsible for Digital City.
</P>
<P>
   Borthwick said, ``We spent quite a bit of time trying to figure
out how to get the donation done and assign a value, and then at
the end we said, OK, let's just go ahead and do it.''
</P>
<P>
   As part of the unsuccessful effort to get an independent
appraisal of the site's worth, Borthwick recalled, the adaweb staff
approached Christie's, but the auction house declined to take on
the task.
</P>
<P>
   Kathy Halbreich, the Walker's director, said her institution
does not attach a dollar value to the donations it receives. That
way, the giver, not the museum, is responsible for justifying any
amounts claimed as tax deductions. Nor, she said, will the museum
now assign a price for insurance purposes. ``What would you
insure?'' she asked. ``The crashing of the site?''
</P>
<P>
   Halbreich maintained that the dollar value of adaweb is
irrelevant to the Walker.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our delight in this acquisition has nothing to do with
monetary value and everything to do with being able to shelter what
I believe will be among the most important historical precedents
for digital art,'' she said. ``So, for us, it was really the
intellectual and artistic value that was delightful. It didn't
matter to us if it had a high monetary value or no monetary
value.''
</P>
<P>
   A few Web-savvy artists are striving to establish such a market.
</P>
<P>
   In July, Olia Lialina launched Art.Teleportacia, an online
gallery that sells Internet-based works by Lialina, Vuk Cosic and
three other artists. Deliberately overwrought curatorial comments
have been appended to each work, but Lialina insisted that the
venture was a serious one.
</P>
<P>
   Prices for each piece are about $2,000, a figure arrived at
though common sense, Lialina explained in a telephone interview
from her Moscow home. A fee of a few hundred dollars, which she
said is sometimes paid as an honorarium when a Web work is included
in an exhibit, seemed too low. If she charged $20,000, she said,
``it would look like a joke. But $2,000, I like this.''
</P>
<P>
   Lialina has had no buyers yet, but she said she is close to
snaring one. Meanwhile, she is planning to expand the gallery early
next year with an exhibition of about 10 new works.
</P>
<P>
   Because Web works can be effortlessly duplicated, their value
has sometimes been viewed as limited. Barbara London, the Museum of
Modern Art's associate curator of film and video, dismissed that
argument as outdated.
</P>
<P>
   ``A tape of Bill Viola's or Nam June Paik's that has been
broadcast, anybody and everybody could have copied it with their
VCR,'' London said. ``It's not like having a Picasso painting where
it's truly, truly unique. We know these are in effect easily
reproducible multiples.''
</P>
<P>
   Lialina said each project's unique URL would serve to
authenticate it and preserve its value. A buyer has a number of
options for collecting a work, ranging from keeping it accessible
on the Web to storing it in a private online location.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the Berlin-based graphic designer Holger Friese and
Max Kossatz, a webmaster in Vienna, sold their Web-based work
www.antworten.de (``answer'') to a German collector, a transaction
that included rights to the domain and a hard drive with all the
necessary code in place.
</P>
<P>
   Friese declined to identify the buyer further or to reveal the
price paid, but he said he set the amount based on his normal fees
for commercial Web projects. He is also selling a limited-edition
disk-based version of his unendlich, fast... (``infinite, almost'')
for 460 marks (about $30).

SUIT CHALLENGES SUBSIDY FOR PAROCHIAL SCHOOLS 
</HEADLINE>
  By PAMELA MENDELS 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In what could well be the first lawsuit involving the Internet
and First Amendment principles that mandate the separation of
church and state, a Wisconsin group is challenging the ability of a
new state program to offer telecommunications subsidies to
parochial schools and religious colleges.
</P>
<P>
   The suit was filed in U.S. District Court in Madison earlier
this month by the Freedom from Religion Foundation Inc., a
Madison-based group that over the years has pressed for an
unbreachable wall between religion and government in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   The suit challenges a program that is part of Wisconsin's recent
Technology for Educational Achievement (TEACH) initiative, a
wide-ranging multi-million dollar government effort to provide
technology resources to schools, which was approved by the
Legislature last year.
</P>
<P>
   The program, Educational Telecommunications Access, offers
highly discounted rates for high-speed Internet access as well as
special video data lines to a range of educational institutions,
including public and private schools and private colleges. Those
approved to participate would pay about $100 monthly for Internet
access via a high-speed T1 line, while the state would pick up the
rest of the cost, about $600 a month.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs in the lawsuit, the Freedom from Religion
Foundation and three of its members, all taxpayers in Wisconsin,
say parochial schools and religious colleges should not be allowed
to receive the subsidies because their participation would
constitute an illegal state subsidy of religion. As of last summer,
13 religious elementary schools, 13 religious high schools and at
least 10 religious colleges in the state had been approved for the
subsidies, according to the complaint filed in court Nov. 4.
Jeffrey J. Kassel, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, said most of the
institutions had either Roman Catholic or Lutheran affiliations.
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, the First Amendment prohibits government
``establishment of religion,'' which refers to government
endorsement or support of any religion. Over the years, courts have
allowed government to help pay for certain non-religious activities
related to parochial schools, like transportation, Kassel said.
But, he asserted, they have also ruled that the government may not
subsidize services directly related to the religious mission of a
sectarian school.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, the U.S. Supreme Court sidestepped the issue
by declining to get involved in a Wisconsin case involving the use
of taxpayer-financed school vouchers. The court let stand a ruling
by the Wisconsin Supreme Court that held that a program in
Milwaukee in which poor students are given vouchers that may be
used at religious schools did not violate either the state or
federal constitutions.
</P>
<P>
   In the current lawsuit, Kassel maintains that state-subsidized
Internet access could be employed in two ways in parochial school
classrooms that would violate the First Amendment as well as the
``no establishment'' provisions of the Wisconsin state
constitution. For example, he said the Internet might be used by
teachers and students to gain access to church materials online.
But even if the Internet access were used for a seemingly secular
purpose, like gathering information for a science class, he argued,
the government would still be impermissibly advancing a religious
cause because the information would be presented in a religious
setting.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a subsidy to religious schools,'' Kassel said. ``The
schools will use it to fulfill their religious mission.''
</P>
<P>
   Sharon L. Schmeling, associate director of the Wisconsin
Catholic Conference, defended the program. For one thing, she said
the money used to pay for it comes from the state's universal
service fund, which is paid for by a tax on telecommunications
companies, not on taxpayers. ``The money is not taxpayer money,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Schmeling also asserted that to argue that the program violated
the First Amendment was to argue that churches should be ineligible
to use the emergency ``911'' telephone system, because that, too,
is paid for through the universal service fund. ``No one has
questioned the 911 program,'' she said. ``And every church in the
state can call 911 and get the police or ambulance to come.''
</P>
<P>
   But Kassel said this analogy did not work, because providing an
emergency service to a religious institution was not the same as
offering a benefit that could advance its religious cause. As for
the source of the money for the program -- individuals or companies
-- Kassel said this was irrelevant to the case. What mattered, he
said, was that government was involved. ``The state is taxing the
[telecommunications] companies, collecting money from the
businesses and passing it on to private schools,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce A. Olsen, assistant attorney general for Wisconsin, said
that the government would file a response by Nov. 24 and that he
needed to study the case more before commenting on it in detail.
But, he said: ``It's true there is recent Wisconsin legislation
that makes these subsidies available to public and private
institutions. And it's true some private institutions are
sectarian. As to whether that violates the First Amendment and the
state constitution, I think the state will be denying that.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Olsen and Kassel said they were unaware of any other cases
involving the Internet and the separation of church and state.
</P>
<P>
   The Wisconsin program is similar to the new federal ``E-rate''
initiative to subsidize telecommunications services in schools and
libraries around the country. That program, too, has been
embattled, but for different reasons. Opponents in Congress are
opposed to the new tax it imposes on telephone companies.
</P>
<P>
   Like the Wisconsin program, the federal effort would assist not
just public, but private and parochial schools. Kassel said he
would need to know more details about the E-rate program before
saying whether he thought it, too, ran afoul of the First
Amendment.

ANTI-PORN LAW ENTERS COURT; DELAY FOLLOWS 
</HEADLINE>
  By CARL S. KAPLAN 
 Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   After arguing that a new federal law intended to protect
children from Internet pornography could instead ensnare legitimate
cyberspace enterprises, civil rights groups and Web site owners won
a temporary delay of the measure in a Philadelphia court on Nov.
19.
</P>
<P>
   The temporary restraining order, issued by Judge Lowell A. Reed
Jr. of U.S. District Court, is the first action in what could be a
long court battle over the new law, which was to have gone into
effect Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The order delays implementation of the law, the Child Online
Protection Act (COPA), for 10 days, and the judge can renew the
order for a maximum of 10 more days. The court will conduct a
second, more leisurely preliminary injunction hearing on Dec. 8 and
9.
</P>
<P>
   Ann Beeson, a staff lawyer for the American Civil Liberties
Union, said that when the judge rules after the December hearing,
she expects that the losing side will appeal the decision to the
United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit in
Philadelphia, and then to the Supreme Court, though it is not
certain that the Supreme Court will accept the case for review.
</P>
<P>
   The law makes it a federal crime to knowingly make material
considered harmful to minors available on a commercial Web site,
unless some reasonable effort is made to restrict children's
access. An electronic ``brown wrapper,'' like a credit-card
checkpoint or other adult-verification system, would be considered
an adequate barrier. The law, which President Clinton signed a
month ago, is intended to protect children from visual or written
sexual material that would be considered obscene and that would
have no redeeming social or educational value.
</P>
<P>
   But critics of the law have said that it could have the effect
of punishing a store that provides free information about
contraceptives on its Web site, or even an online magazine that
publishes the independent counsel report detailing President
Clinton's encounters with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   The government and its opponents laid out their arguments in
filings with the court this week. The ACLU filed a brief on behalf
of a broad coalition that also includes the Electronic Privacy
Information Center, the Electronic Frontier Foundation, Salon
Magazine, the contraceptive retailer Condomania, and an online
publishers group whose members include The New York Times
Electronic Media Company and Time Inc., among others.
</P>
<P>
   The brief argued that the new law, in an effort to deny minors
access to potentially harmful speech, will unconstitutionally
suppress and chill a large amount of speech that adults have a
right to receive.
</P>
<P>
   In passing the new law, ``Congress made it a crime for adults to
communicate and receive expression that is clearly protected by the
Constitution,'' the ACLU said.
</P>
<P>
   An earlier congressional effort to restrict children's access to
sexual material on the Internet, the Communications Decency Act
(CDA), was struck down by the Supreme Court last year as a
violation of the First Amendment. That successful challenge, which
was also filed initially in federal court in Philadelphia, was
brought by the ACLU and other groups and individuals.
</P>
<P>
   When Congress drafted the new law, it tried to avoid the
pitfalls of the CDA. For example, the new law singles out a
category of speech -- ``harmful to minors'' -- that is arguably
narrower and less vague than ``indecent'' speech that the CDA would
have barred. In addition, the new law applies only to commercial
Web sites, while the old law was aimed at all Internet
communication, including e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   But in its filing with the court, the ACLU argued that the Child
Online Protection Act and the CDA share the same fatal flaws. It
said that the categories of ``indecent speech'' and ``speech
harmful to minors'' are both constitutionally protected for adult
viewing, and adult rights are restricted under either scheme.
</P>
<P>
   The ACLU also argued that the loose wording of the new law would
make it apply not only to commercial pornography sites, but also to
any free Web site supported by advertising revenues that posts
material considered ``harmful to minors.'' Thus the law would
threaten free publications that posted the Starr report, like Salon
Magazine and The New York Times on the Web, the ACLU said.
</P>
<P>
   True, Web sites could protect themselves if they instituted
credit-card verification gates to keep children out. But the ACLU
claimed that such a system could not be used by sites that have no
reason to take credit card numbers from users, like free news sites
or sites offering e-mail or chat services. Nor could free Web sites
easily use other means to verify the age of users, because this
would be prohibitively expensive, the ACLU said.
</P>
<P>
   The best and ``least restrictive means'' to shield children from
inappropriate sexual content on the Web is for parents to install
filtering software on home computers, the plaintiffs said.
</P>
<P>
   In response, the government claimed in its brief that the court
should interpret the new law as Congress intended, and consider it
only as it applies to Web sites that are in the business of selling
pornography for a profit.
</P>
<P>
   The government also asserted that Congress has a ``compelling''
interest in protecting children from harmful material, and that the
law's age-verification requirement was necessary and more effective
than private filtering software.
</P>
<P>
   ``New online sites are created daily and no software can
guarantee that it will block access to every site,'' the government
said.
</P>
<P>
   Eugene Volokh, a law professor at the University of California
at Los Angeles whose writings on Internet free speech and
censorship were quoted in the government's brief, said in an
interview that the constitutionality of the new law is ``a much
closer question than the CDA.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the CDA was struck down, in part, because it restricted
speech on the Internet in an unprecedented way. ``Nobody would
dream of having a Newspaper Decency Act,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But the new law is a more difficult issue, because lower courts
have upheld so-called public-display laws that bar the display or
availability of material that is harmful to minors in places where
children may be present. A bookstore, for example, may be forced
under public-display laws to sell sexually oriented materials in a
special adult-only section, he said. Or an unattended news rack on
the street may not be allowed to display certain sexual magazines.
</P>
<P>
   ``These laws, which are very analogous to COPA, have been upheld
in a great majority of lower-court cases,'' Volokh said. ``Courts
have found that modest burdens on adults are justified in order to
shield children. Maybe those cases are wrong, but if they are
right, then COPA is not unprecedented,'' and the new law merely
extends some real-world restrictions to cyberspace, he said.

IMPROVEMENTS FOR THE PILOT 
</HEADLINE>
  By STEPHEN C. MILLER 
 Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   For those mobile Palm Pilot users who synchronize their data
using a laptop, the synchronizing cradle is not the most convenient
thing with which to travel. The cradle isn't heavy, but its design
is bulky and it doesn't fit neatly in computer bags.
</P>
<P>
   There is an alternative for Palm III users and those who upgrade
previous models to get the ability to transfer information using
infrared technology. The IBM WorkPad, the company's own brand of
the Palm Pilot, has the capability to ``HotSync'' to an IBM
ThinkPad using infrared.
</P>
<P>
   You can download the program that makes it work from the IBM Web
site. However, IBM only supports the infrared syncing on its own
machines. Since there is absolutely no difference in the operating
system for either brand, there should be no reason why one cannot
use the IBM program to turn on the infrared HotSync in the Palm
III. Palm Computing is mum on the issue -- not surprising since
they also manufacturer and sell the cradles.
</P>
<P>
   While there is no support or admission that the infrared will
work on Non-IBM Palm Pilot units, my Palm III doesn't seem to know
that. I've been doing cradle-less synchronizations for several
weeks. There doesn't seem to be a speed problem either. If the
infrared HotSync is slower than synchronization through the serial
port, I can't detect it. The difference may exist, but I'd need
much more sophisticated testing tools than my 
start-the-HotSync-go-to-the-kitchen-and-dump-my-cup-of-tea-in-the-si
nk-and-then-rinse-it-out timing method. In both cases, cradle or
infrared, the synchronization is complete when I come back.
</P>
<P>
   While the Pilot is great at organizing contacts, appointments,
to-do lists, etc., it fails at entering lots of text with any kind
of speed, even for experts in Graffiti, its special form of
writing. Perhaps it is because I'm a writer and a very fast typist;
my inability to enter anything in the Pilot other than small bits
of text is frustrating. The new GoType keyboard from Landware has
minimized that problem.
</P>
<P>
   You drop your Pilot into the keyboard's built-in cradle and then
all the functions can be done from the keyboard. The keyboard is
slightly smaller than a standard laptop keyboard, but it is large
enough for those of us who are touch typists. The unit is well
designed and when closed is about an inch thick.
</P>
<P>
   I wanted the keyboard so that I could write articles and long
documents into the Memo Pad. But you can completely control the
Palm Pilot with the keyboard. There are function keys for each of
the major functions and each is programmable through the software
provided with the GoType. I was able to write a long memo, copy it
and then paste into an e-mail message I created.
</P>
<P>
   The GoType is very light, partially because it doesn't have an
independent power supply. It runs off the batteries in the Pilot.
According to Ken Landau of Landware, the power drain is minimal.
``If your batteries last two weeks, using the keyboard will cause
them to last one week, six days and 22 hours,'' he said. So far, I
haven't noticed that the Palm Pilot's battery is draining any
faster when using the keyboard.
</P>
<P>
   The GoType keyboard sells for $79. I'd also suggest that you
spend another $20 for the stylish leather carrying case. It holds
the keyboard and the external two pockets can hold the Pilot, a
cell phone or other odds and ends. Now if only their keyboard had a
built-in modem so I could send my column without removing the Pilot
from the keyboard.
</P>
<P>
   There are times when even a Palm Pilot is too heavy. I'd always
liked the Franklin Rex. Its only drawback was that it was
read-only. You dumped your data onto it with no way to update
without doing it from a laptop or desktop PC.
</P>
<P>
   The new version, the Franklin Rex Pro, is interactive. You can
make changes, add new appointments, etc. The drawback is that you
must use its virtual keyboard, which forces you to input one
character at a time by navigating to each letter in the alphabet.
With some practice, you can move pretty fast, but it is still
tedious.
</P>
<P>
   On the plus side, the new TrueSyncPlus software from Starfish is
a major improvement over the previous version. The mapping of
matching fields in supported Personal Information Managers (PIM)
like Outlook, Act and Lotus Organizer is much simpler. The actual
syncing has the best logging system I've seen lately. It not only
tells you what went wrong, but also what it did about it. And all
of it is in English.
</P>
<P>
   I have an upcoming three-day seminar but the Rex can't handle
multiple day alarms. The message I got during the log process
informed me that the event would be placed in the Rex, but the
alarm would not go off on the Rex.

site. However, IBM only supports the infrared syncing on its own
machines. Since there is absolutely no difference in the operating
system for either brand, there should be no reason why one cannot
use the IBM program to turn on the infrared HotSync in the Palm
III. Palm Computing is mum on the issue -- not surprising since
they also manufacturer and sell the cradles.
</P>
<P>
   While there is no support or admission that the infrared will
work on Non-IBM Palm Pilot units, my Palm III doesn't seem to know
that. I've been doing cradle-less synchronizations for several
weeks. There doesn't seem to be a speed problem either. If the
infrared HotSync is slower than synchronization through the serial
port, I can't detect it. The difference may exist, but I'd need
much more sophisticated testing tools than my 
start-the-HotSync-go-to-the-kitchen-and-dump-my-cup-of-tea-in-the-si
nk-and-then-rinse-it-out timing method. In both cases, cradle or
infrared, the synchronization is complete when I come back.
</P>
<P>
   While the Pilot is great at organizing contacts, appointments,
to-do lists, etc., it fails at entering lots of text with any kind
of speed, even for experts in Graffiti, its special form of
writing. Perhaps it is because I'm a writer and a very fast typist;
my inability to enter anything in the Pilot other than small bits
of text is frustrating. The new GoType keyboard from Landware has
minimized that problem.
</P>
<P>
   You drop your Pilot into the keyboard's built-in cradle and then
all the functions can be done from the keyboard. The keyboard is
slightly smaller than a standard laptop keyboard, but it is large
enough for those of us who are touch typists. The unit is well
designed and when closed is about an inch thick.
</P>
<P>
   I wanted the keyboard so that I could write articles and long
documents into the Memo Pad. But you can completely control the
Palm Pilot with the keyboard. There are function keys for each of
the major functions and each is programmable through the software
provided with the GoType. I was able to write a long memo, copy it
and then paste into an e-mail message I created.
</P>
<P>
   The GoType is very light, partially because it doesn't have an
independent power supply. It runs off the batteries in the Pilot.
According to Ken Landau of Landware, the power drain is minimal.
``If your batteries last two weeks, using the keyboard will cause
them to last one week, six days and 22 hours,'' he said. So far, I
haven't noticed that the Palm Pilot's battery is draining any
faster when using the keyboard.
</P>
<P>
   The GoType keyboard sells for $79. I'd also suggest that you
spend another $20 for the stylish leather carrying case. It holds
the keyboard and the external two pockets can hold the Pilot, a
cell phone or other odds and ends. Now if only their keyboard had a
built-in modem so I could send my column without removing the Pilot
from the keyboard.
</P>
<P>
   There are times when even a Palm Pilot is too heavy. I'd always
liked the Franklin Rex. Its only drawback was that it was
read-only. You dumped your data onto it with no way to update
without doing it from a laptop or desktop PC.
</P>
<P>
   The new version, the Franklin Rex Pro, is interactive. You can
make changes, add new appointments, etc. The drawback is that you
must use its virtual keyboard, which forces you to input one
character at a time by navigating to each letter in the alphabet.
With some practice, you can move pretty fast, but it is still
tedious.
</P>
<P>
   On the plus side, the new TrueSyncPlus software from Starfish is
a major improvement over the previous version. The mapping of
matching fields in supported Personal Information Managers (PIM)
like Outlook, Act and Lotus Organizer is much simpler. The actual
syncing has the best logging system I've seen lately. It not only
tells you what went wrong, but also what it did about it. And all
of it is in English.
</P>
<P>
   I have an upcoming three-day seminar but the Rex can't handle
multiple day alarms. The message I got during the log process
informed me that the event would be placed in the Rex, but the
alarm would not go off on the Rex.

   WHITE-HOUSE _ WASHINGTON _ A day in the life of the White House
begins an hour before midnight when Susanna McGuire rubs her coded
photo ID across the electronic scanner at a wrought-iron gate,
punches in a personal number, then enters under the gaze of a
uniformed Secret Service agent. An ambitious young press aide who
will spend the night clipping papers for President Clinton's
morning news summary, McGuire is one of hundreds of human cogs who
make the White House a perpetual motion machine _ running day after
day, decade after decade, president after president. Unique in the
world, the building where the president lives and works is among
the most recognizable symbols of American democracy. It is a home
and a museum, a fortress and a bureaucracy, a playground and a
monument and a backdrop for TV newscasts. It is a place permeated
with the temptations of power, of course, but also blessed with the
virtues of community and continuity. (Dart, Cox News Service 3500).

 (For release Sunday, Nov. 29)  
 THE GOOD AND BAD SIDES OF BILL CLINTON ,
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROBERT E. THOMPSON  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ If there were no 22d Amendment, a smiling Bill
Clinton told a town meeting in Tokyo two weeks ago, he might run
for a third term because ``I like the work.''
</P>
<P>
   That's an audacious ambition for a president standing on the
brink of impeachment. But audacity always has been a factor in
Clinton's upward mobility.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, there IS a 22d Amendment, which decrees that ``no
person shall be elected to the office of president more than twice
... '' So on Jan. 20, 2001, if not before, Clinton will become a
private citizen and have to find a new line of work to help support
his family and pay the huge legal fees that have accumulated as a
result of almost endless investigations into his private and public
activities.
</P>
<P>
   He can, like Richard Nixon and Jimmy Carter, write books based
on his experiences and his counsel to the republic and to future
presidents. He also can, if he chooses, return to the practice and
teaching of law, which is something Woodrow Wilson tried to do
after his presidency ended. But Wilson's venture failed because he
had suffered a debilitating stroke and was unable to take part
actively in the law practice he established with his former
secretary of state, Bainbridge Colby.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also can take to the lecture circuit and make a fortune,
emulating Ronald Reagan, who made millions from speeches in Japan.
In addition, like Gerald Ford, he can make money by serving on
corporate boards of directors.
</P>
<P>
   But while Clinton is seeking ways to fill his coffers and those
of his lawyers, the flood gates will open for historians and
pseudo-historians to cash in from the sale of books, magazine
articles and television documentaries dissecting and analyzing
Clinton and his times.
</P>
<P>
   Never before has the republic faced a situation quite like this.
Other presidents have sinned, but very often the people knew little
or nothing of their conduct.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Johnson was impeached by the House on 11 counts, most of
which grew out of his refusal to bow to the dictates of Congress,
dominated by radical Republicans who opposed Johnson's lenient
policies toward the post-Civil War South.
</P>
<P>
   In the Senate, where a two-thirds vote is required to convict,
Johnson was saved by a single vote and served out the remainder of
his presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Ulysses S. Grant's administration was tarnished by scandals in
which private citizens and public officials sought to line their
pockets at the expense of the government. But Grant, whose military
prowess won the Civil War for the North, rode out the crises and
remained popular.
</P>
<P>
   Like Clinton, Warren G. Harding and John F. Kennedy indulged in
extramarital sex in the White House. But the public did not learn
of those escapades until after the two presidents were dead. Nor
did the public learn of the Harding administration's Teapot Dome
scandal while Harding was alive.
</P>
<P>
   The closest parallel to the current situation can be found in
Richard Nixon's Watergate scandal. House and Senate hearings in
1973 and 1974 gave people their first lucid view of the tawdriness
that can exist within the Oval Office. The revelations were
shocking, as tapes of presidential conversations showed Nixon to be
dishonest and vengeful, a plotter who indulged in vile language,
contempt for many Americans and an attempt to use the CIA to
obstruct justice.
</P>
<P>
   As the impeachment process moved toward its climax, Nixon
finally realized that he would be found guilty, and he resigned.
</P>
<P>
   But at no time was there even a hint that Nixon was cheating on
his wife or indulging in a raucous sex life. Nor did Nixon, despite
his amazing career, possess Clinton's charisma.
</P>
<P>
   Now, however, the people once again have seen the shoddy side of
life in the White House. Clinton's bawdy behavior has been explored
and exploited in a continuous soap opera that has provided
newspaper readers and television viewers with more than their share
of shock and disgust.
</P>
<P>
   Once Clinton has left the White House, the big push will be on
to evaluate his policies and his conduct.
</P>
<P>
   The balance sheet should provide fascinating reading. On one
side of the ledger are the transgressions of a president who is not
exactly the ideal role model for young Americans: lecherous
behavior including the extramarital sex, lies to the public and the
federal grand jury about his relationship with Monica Lewinsky, the
Paula Jones affair and improper use of campaign funds.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side of the ledger are his achievements: a soaring
national economy that has produced bountiful employment, the first
balanced budget in 30 years, efforts to improve public education,
use of America's good offices to obtain peace in Northern Ireland
and the Middle East, his promise to use the budget surplus to save
Social Security, welfare reform and his determination to make life
better for blacks, Hispanics and other minorities. In a number of
key areas, he was prodded by a Republican Congress.
</P>
<P>
   But charm, intelligence and political perspicacity have carried
Clinton a long way. For all his sins, a majority of the American
people appear to forgive him and want him to get on with the
business of being president.
</P>
<P>
   The House Judiciary Committee's impeachment hearings, including
testimony by Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr, appear to have had
little impact on the public's feelings about Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   In those hearings there were no heroes, only partisans.
</P>
<P>
   The public's attitude toward Clinton is reminiscent of Abraham
Lincoln's attitude toward General Grant. When he learned that
Grant, who had been winning great victories, drank too much
whiskey, Lincoln reportedly ignored the complaint and instead
proposed that his other generals be provided with the same brand of
whiskey.

 &HT;    SHORTTAKES: Didn't cook my goose
 &HT;    (Eds: Resending for those who need it.)
 &HT;    By Arnold Rosenfeld
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Our traditional Thanksgiving bird is smoked goose. Actually, I
only did it last year, but I was hoping to establish a family
tradition.
</P>
<P>
   I have one of those clay smokers that won't let you goof up. I
follow instructions. Charcoal. Temperature. Time. All precise. I
think I must have a lech for Martha Stewart.
</P>
<P>
   I thought last year's goose came off pretty well. Until
recently, when my daughter asked, ``Dad, are you going to smoke a
goose again for Thanksgiving?'' Sure, I said, I thought it came off
pretty well last year. Two weeks later, she said, ``Dad, you're not
going to smoke another goose for Thanksgiving.'' ``Are you'' had
become ``you're not.''
</P>
<P>
   Her views are a little suspect. She's a vegetarian and eats tofu
the shape of a meatloaf for Thanksgiving. ``Bill liked it,'' I
said. Bill is my oldest son. ``Bill doesn't want to hurt your
feelings,'' she said. I tried again. ``Debbie liked it.'' Deb is
Bill's wife. ``Debbie would never say she didn't like it. The goose
WAS TOO GREASY, DAD. `` Greasy? Greasy? What grease?

   So that was why I canceled my goose order at the supermarket
this year, and we had turkey. Went over pretty well, too. Martha
would have been proud.

   CIR-TRAINS (Undated) _ In a sign of the times, in addition to
starter sets for children age 8 and older that cost as little as
$100, the really big kids (read: grown-ups) will also be carrying
home Christmas locomotives crammed with high-tech electronics and
sound systems whose realism is nothing short of amazing. By Les

   CIR-PEOPLE-FINDERS (Undated) _ The Internet is full of stories
of people who once were lost but now are found: high school
sweethearts reuniting, college roommates catching up on old times,
people who need transplants finding lost blood relatives. With
``people finders,'' the search engines that serve as giant phone
books, it's easier than ever to find and be found, and that's good
news. Mostly. But what if you don't want to be found? By Tina

   CIR-VIRTUAL-FLOORS (New York) _ Moss, a four-year-old interior
design store on 146 Greene Street in SoHo, has added four new
floors, but customers will not climbing stairs to reach them.
Instead, they will be clicking a mouse. That's because Moss's new
floors exist within a computer program and can be reached only

   CIR-GAME-CHEATS (Undated) _ The hurried scribbles on miserly
scraps of notebook paper are treasures, passed from hand to grimy
hand at school bus stops, soccer practice and sleepovers. To the
uninitiated their contents are unintelligible: ``C-left, c-right,
repeated four times during game play,'' goes one making the rounds
lately. But to young game players, these hieroglyphics are prized

   CIR-HOLIDAY (Undated) _ Everyone knows about the Mayflower. A
group of Puritans were headed for Virginia but steered badly off
course and landed far to the north. After dispossessing the
Indians, they began an annual celebration of Thanksgiving, dressed
in their strict buckles and all-black clothing. According to Caleb
Johnson, just about the only truth in that passage is the name of
the ship. Johnson, 22, who graduated last summer from Texas Tech

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: PC'S ARRIVE AT THE TIPPING POINT
 &HT;    Moving in (k) commentary and (f) financial queues for release
Sunday,
 &HT;    Nov. 29.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ December will usher in a quiet milestone in
American life: Some 52 million homes _ half of all U.S. households
_ will have at least one personal computer.
</P>
<P>
   Low prices and a desire to be linked to the Internet drove
nearly 4 million new buyers to purchase their first PCs in the
first half of 1998, a newly released market survey by ZD Market
Intelligence shows.
</P>
<P>
   That torrid pace has held up, even ahead of the Christmas buying
season, industry analysts report. It's likely that 1998 will see
more than 8 million new PC users, nearly double the 4.9 million
first-time buyers in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   A sea change also appears to be occurring among people of modest
means. Currently, households with incomes of less than $30,000 make
up only a quarter of PC-equipped households. Yet they will account
for a third of all new PC purchases this year.
</P>
<P>
   To gauge a comparable potential impact on U.S. society, you'd
have to go back two generations, when access to television became
widespread. Go back two more generations _ to the World War I era _
and you could draw some parallels between what's happening now in
cyberspace and what happened then with the automobile.
</P>
<P>
   The critical tipping point in sales of new passenger cars came
in 1917, when a record 1.75 million were sold. That raised the
number of motor vehicles of all types on U.S. roads to just over 5
million.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, the administration of Woodrow Wilson took a
serious look at national highway policy. Today, another Democratic
president, Bill Clinton, who had hardly heard of the Internet when
he was elected in 1992, hangs out with Silicon Valley moguls
introduced to him by Al Gore, his technophile would-be successor.
</P>
<P>
   Back then, the industry giant was the Ford Motor Co., comparable
to the Intel chips and Microsoft programs now driving PC sales. In
1918, Ford's Model T had been in production for 10 years and the
pioneering assembly line had been running for five years.
</P>
<P>
   With $275 million in sales and $160 million in assets, Ford was
then the 20th largest U.S. industrial corporation _ smaller than
Singer, a maker of sewing machines, and one-fifteenth the size of
U.S. Steel.
</P>
<P>
   Company founder Henry Ford defined his management philosophy
when he airily announced in 1909: ``Any customer can have a car
painted any color he wants, so long as it is black.''
</P>
<P>
   The Henry Ford of our day, Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, uses
a black laptop with a docking station. He unhooks it when he leaves
the office in his black BMW and plugs back in at his cozy mansion.
</P>
<P>
   Even as the tipping point for PC use approaches, Gates and Ford
share a characteristic persona. Beyond their incredible wealth,
both men were powerfully entrenched innovators who pursued a
one-man, star-system, idiosyncratic corporate management style.
Such leaders come to be better known to the public than the
corporate bureaucracies that they head.
</P>
<P>
   In time, Gates's iconic standing might draw him to testify at
the Microsoft antitrust trial. If that happens, a majority of
Americans would be able to follow the results on the World Wide
Web.

RETAILERS ANTICIPATE GOOD TIDINGS THIS YEAR

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Predicting holiday retail sales blends a curious
mix of pessimistic analysts and relentlessly optimistic retailers.
But this year, the humbugs and the revelers are in rare accord.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides expect a sales gain of about 4 to 6 percent over last
year, an increase strong enough to make the season merry and
lucrative for retailers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to find a dark cloud, at least at the moment. It's
very discouraging for the practitioners of this dismal science,''
said Carl Steidtmann, chief retail economist for the
PricewaterhouseCoopers accounting firm.
</P>
<P>
   A rebounding stock market, low unemployment and an increase in
consumer confidence _ along with other factors such as lower
interest rates and energy prices _ account for the high holiday
hopes. The consumer confidence index, reported Tuesday, rose 6.9
percent after four months of losses.
</P>
<P>
   The day after Thanksgiving, known among retailers as ``Black
Friday'' because of its reputation for putting stores into the
black, is considered the traditional start of the Christmas
shopping season.
</P>
<P>
   While retailers and industry experts have been making
projections for months, the outlook has become clearer as shoppers
start plowing through their lists.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year at this time there was a lot disagreement,'' said
John Konarski, vice president of the International Council of
Shopping Centers, a New York-based trade group that represent mall
owners, developers and retailers. ``This year, almost everyone
agrees it is going to be a good year.''
</P>
<P>
   Konarski said his group was predicting an increase in sales of
about 4.5 percent, with a strong comeback in apparel sales.
</P>
<P>
   PricewaterhouseCoopers is even more bullish on its 1998
projections. Steidtmann said he expected a 5.5 percent increase in
sales growth. Last year, he said, the industry logged a 3.8 percent
increase, which was considered solid and decidedly better than the
previous two years.
</P>
<P>
   Deloitte &AMP; Touche's 13th annual holiday retail Mood Survey
reported that consumers nationwide would spend an average of $814
on holiday gifts this season, or 4.5 percent more than last year.
</P>
<P>
   While shoppers are still planning to spend the bulk of the
dollars in the last two weekends before Christmas, industry
insiders are seeing a change in when consumers are shopping.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Krugman, spokesman for the National Retail Federation,
said people were starting to shop earlier and were spreading their
shopping throughout the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``People aren't really confined to the November-December time
period,'' said Krugman, who could not explain the change. ``People
are doing their shopping well before and well after the holiday
season.''
</P>
<P>
   Krugman said this trend had shifted retailers' profit patterns
in recent years. Retailers used to rely on the Christmas shopping
season for 40 to 50 percent of the entire year's profits. Krugman
said that figure was dropping to as low as 25 percent for many
retailers.
</P>
<P>
   Retail experts also agree that there will be some changes in
where people are shopping this year.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Tashjian, senior retail analyst with NationsBanc Montgomery
Securities in San Francisco, said he expected traditional
department stores to lose a share of their market to specialty
retailers, like The Gap and Banana Republic. That is a change from
the past couple of years, when many specialty retailers were
struggling.
</P>
<P>
   Tashjian projects sales at stores open at least a year to rise
just 1 percent for department stores compared with an overall
increase of 4.5 percent for general merchandise.
</P>
<P>
   Tashjian blames the shift on a lack of distinction among major
department stores. ``Their predictability is hurting them,'' he
said. ``When you walk into the department stores, you see the same
10 labels.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Continuing a pattern built over the last several years, general
merchandise discounters such as Wal-Mart, Target and Kmart will
still reign supreme this holiday season. Tashjian expects a 5
percent increase for mass merchandisers.
</P>
<P>
   The International Mass Retail Association, an Arlington,
Va.-based group that represents 230 mass retailers, found similar
results when it surveyed 1,000 people nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   When asked where they were going to shop, consumers listed big
discount stores as their top destination for the first time since
the survey began in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Roberts, spokeswoman for the group, said convenience
and lack of time to shop were the main motivations behind this
switch. ``When you go to a category dominant store, you know you're
going to find what you want,'' she said, defining category dominant
as places like the hardware and household goods company Home Depot
and the electronics retailer Circuit City.
</P>
<P>
   As for what people are buying, apparel continues to top people's
wish lists. The usual suspects _ toys, jewelry, computer-related
items _ round out the gift requests.
</P>
<P>
   According to the International Mass Retail Association holiday
survey, which was funded by Eastman Kodak, clothes came out No. 1
for 47 percent of those questioned, followed by toys, consumer
electronics and housewares.
</P>
<P>
   What is noteworthy is the resurgence of consumer electronics.
They fell into a slump last year but are expected to rebound,
buoyed by low prices for personal computer and a slew of new
products such as DVD and digital cameras.
</P>
<P>
   NationsBanc Montgomery Securities is predicting a healthy 6 to 7
percent increase in consumer electronics sales.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone is convinced that low prices for PCs will mean
higher profits.
</P>
<P>
   ``With these new lower and lower prices on computers, I'm sure
the unit count will be way up, but I'm no sure the dollar count
will be up,'' said Al Aguiar, a retail consultant in Sacramento,
Calif.

 By HOWARD ALEXANDER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The earliest hearing aid was simplicity itself and is still in
use: a cupped hand behind the ear. But today's technology has made
hearing aids much less obtrusive and much more helpful.
</P>
<P>
   While early hearing aids tried to improve upon the external ear,
with devices to direct the sound coming from the front into the ear
of the listener and block noise from the sides and rear, modern
devices fit surreptitiously behind or into an ear while augmenting
the sound coming in.
</P>
<P>
   In the 17th century, artisans made metal ``ears'' to fit over
the natural ears. Ear trumpets, cones that could be aimed at the
source of a sound, came into use in the early 1800s.
</P>
<P>
   By the late 1800s, the acoustic horn became available. It was a
flexible tube with two ends _ one cone shaped to catch the sound,
the other gently tapered to fit inside the ear.
</P>
<P>
   The approach changed from art to engineering in this century. In
1913, Siemens became one of the first companies to offer
electronically amplified hearing aids. These early units were large
and not very portable _ about the size of a tall cigar box _ but
they had a speaker that fit into the ear.
</P>
<P>
   Acousticon's Model 56 in the mid-1920s was one of the first
really portable units, although it was quite heavy. Some of the
technological advances of World War II showed up after the war in
hearing aids. Zenith's pocket-sized Miniature 75 helped set a trend
toward smaller and more effective prosthetics.
</P>
<P>
   Transistors led to startling improvements in hearing aids. Tiny
transistors in newly developed miniature microphones could be built
into the frames of eyeglasses along with better, smaller batteries.
</P>
<P>
   Mounting a hearing aid behind the ear, as in Zenith's Diplomat
of the late 1950s, is called BTE in the industry. The next step was
to put hearing aids in the ear (ITE), then, as they got even
smaller, partly into the ear canal (ITC). Now hearing aids can fit
completely into the ear canal (CIC).
</P>
<P>
   Until the early 1990s, most hearing aids were analog and
consisted of a microphone, an amplifier and a speaker (transducer).
But with the availability of miniature computer components, as well
as the audio-processing technology found in CD and DVD players, the
digital hearing aid was born.
</P>
<P>
   Most hearing aids now have some digital components, and
all-digital hearing aids are becoming popular.
</P>
<P>
   Using the power of computer chips, or microprocessors, digital
hearing aids are able to manipulate the incoming sound to amplify
the specific frequencies that a user is having trouble hearing.
This feature, called equalization control, was rarely available
with analog devices.
</P>
<P>
   One example of this kind of technology is the Senso, a fully
digital unit that fits completely in the ear and is made by the
Danish company Widex. A number of other companies also make digital
hearing aids, including Siemens, a German company, and Telex, based
in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Settings on digital hearing aids can be adjusted for specific
environments. Going to a chamber music concert? Select setting No.
1. Meeting the boss for a business lunch in a noisy restaurant?
Select setting No. 4.
</P>
<P>
   What these settings do is adjust the equalization, volume and
signal-processing functions. If you cannot hear high frequencies
well but love chamber music, the appropriate setting would
emphasize the high frequencies (for the violins) and give you a
moderate increase in volume.
</P>
<P>
   Lunch with the boss would require an emphasis on the middle
range (for the human voice), a decrease in the high frequencies and
some form of extraneous noise reduction.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1940s, the cost of a hearing aid started at about $150, a
great expense at the time. Today's units can range from $700 for an
analog unit worn behind the ear to $1,200 for an analog model
completely in the ear canal or up to $3,000 or more for digital
devices worn completely in the canal.
</P>
<P>
   Several companies are beginning to offer products with greater
processing power that they say will provide a better match for a
user's pattern of hearing loss. And, taking a cue from science
fiction, cochlear implants are beginning to be used.
</P>
<P>
   These implants bypass some of the faulty nerve circuitry in the
cochlea, a spiral-shaped structure in the inner ear that contains
the cells that transmit nerve impulses representing sound toward
the brain. That allows some people who are deaf or who have severe
hearing loss to have some degree of hearing.
</P>
<P>
   A number of companies, like the Cochlear Corp., have developed
cochlear implants, which are surgically connected to the cochlea.
Researchers are also studying the possibility of brain implants or
nerve regeneration as future remedies for hearing loss.
</P>
<P>
   As the American population ages, hearing loss afflicts a growing
number of people. Although some of the causes of hearing loss (loud
music and noisy environments) can be avoided, some cannot
(heredity, accidents, disease and aging).
</P>
<P>
   Many people try to avoid dealing with the problem, but the
evidence is clear: hearing loss does not reverse itself and
generally gets worse. If you think your hearing may be impaired,
see an audiologist or other doctor. Hearing aids may not give you
perfect hearing, but at least you'll be able to hear the music. And
the children. And the car alarms.

   BUSINESS-MAGAZINES _ The long 1990s bull market has (A), been a
boon to Main Street thanks to the ``wealth effect,'' or (B),
``encouraged the tricksters'' and ``will leave many individuals
wrecked upon the shoals of greed and improvidence.'' Those
drastically different perspectives come from the December editions
of Smart Money and Harper's Magazine. (Walker, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution).

<P>
   DELTA-NEWVP _ Delta Air Lines has named Martin C. White vice
president - consumer marketing, a position in which he will oversee
advertising as well as high-profile products such as the SkyMiles
program. White, 34, was recruited from rival US Airways, where he
was vice president- marketing programs and services. He previously
worked at Continental, as well as for a marketing firm that worked
for United. (Thurston, Atlanta Journal-Constitution).

<P>
   SANTA _ ATLANTA _ Santa's already in full swing by this point.
Most metro Santas made their grand entrances last weekend; some
took their mall thrones two weeks ago. It's an intense six weeks
for the mall Santa, a unique breed that stays in character all
year-round. Features local long-time and beginning Santas and a
Santa boot camp. (Bond, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)
</P>
<P>
   SHOPPING-BUDGET _ Before you head out to the big after T-Day
sales, take heed: Set up a budget. Prepare a shopping list. And
stick to that list. If you can't be prepared for a big financial
hangover in January. ``Heading to the mall without a concrete plan
is a recipe for a holiday hangover,'' said Suzanna Boas, president
fo the Consumer Credit Counseling Service of Greater Atlanta.
(Conwill, Atlanta Journal-Constitution).

</P>
<P>
   WORLD-TRAVEL _ Atlanta-based WorldTravel hasn't become one of
the nation's biggest travel companies by relying on storefront
franchises that entice passers-by with vacation scenes. Rather, it
concentrates on the behind-the-scenes, high-volume world of

It also concentrates on growth. In October, WorldTravel vaulted
from No. 8 to No. 3 in the industry through a merger with BTI
Americas, a larger company based in Chicago. (Thurston, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution).

   BUSINESS-MAGAZINES _ The long 1990s bull market has (A), been a
boon to Main Street thanks to the ``wealth effect,'' or (B),
``encouraged the tricksters'' and ``will leave many individuals
wrecked upon the shoals of greed and improvidence.'' Those
drastically different perspectives come from the December editions
of Smart Money and Harper's Magazine. (Walker, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution).
</P>
<P>
   DELTA-NEWVP _ Delta Air Lines has named Martin C. White vice
president - consumer marketing, a position in which he will oversee
advertising as well as high-profile products such as the SkyMiles
program. White, 34, was recruited from rival US Airways, where he
was vice president- marketing programs and services. He previously
worked at Continental, as well as for a marketing firm that worked
for United. (Thurston, Atlanta Journal-Constitution).

<P>
   SANTA _ ATLANTA _ Santa's already in full swing by this point.
Most metro Santas made their grand entrances last weekend; some
took their mall thrones two weeks ago. It's an intense six weeks
for the mall Santa, a unique breed that stays in character all
year-round. Features local long-time and beginning Santas and a
Santa boot camp. (Bond, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)
</P>
<P>
   SHOPPING-BUDGET _ Before you head out to the big after T-Day
sales, take heed: Set up a budget. Prepare a shopping list. And
stick to that list. If you can't be prepared for a big financial
hangover in January. ``Heading to the mall without a concrete plan
is a recipe for a holiday hangover,'' said Suzanna Boas, president
fo the Consumer Credit Counseling Service of Greater Atlanta.
(Conwill, Atlanta Journal-Constitution).

   SYNOVUS _ ATLANTA _ Synovus Financial of Columbus has agreed
Tuesday to acquire Birmingham-based Canterbury Trust Company, an

management.(Chambers, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)
</P>
<P>
   WORLD-TRAVEL _ Atlanta-based WorldTravel hasn't become one of
the nation's biggest travel companies by relying on storefront
franchises that entice passers-by with vacation scenes. Rather, it
concentrates on the behind-the-scenes, high-volume world of
corporate travel management and, increasingly, Internet bookings.
It also concentrates on growth. In October, WorldTravel vaulted
from No. 8 to No. 3 in the industry through a merger with BTI
Americas, a larger company based in Chicago. (Thurston, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution).

<P>
   DELL-VISACARDS _ ROUND ROCK, Texas _ In a new bid to increase

</P>
<P>
   TRAVEL-AGENT-CUTS _ Just in time for the holidays, travel agents
hunker down for a depressing time of year. Seems they won't be
making much money, thanks to cuts in airline commissions, etc.

   FBC-QUINCYCARTER _ Quincy Carter's initial signing with Georgia
Tech and eventual move to Georgia has been well-documented, but his
decision will be the topic of discussion this week as Georgia and
Georgia Tech prepare to meet in Athens. Carter has been one of the
key players for Georgia this season, and the Bulldogs might not
have a winning season without the freshman at quarterback.
Meanwhile, Tech has continued to succeed behind junior QB Joe
Hamilton. We will attempt to talk to players on both sides about
Carter's impact at Georgia, any hard feelings from Tech players,

   FBC-LASTPLAY _ It has been a long year for Georgia Tech
cornerback Kofi Smith. He was the defender on Georgia's winning
touchdown pass in last season's 27-24 victory over Tech, and he
remembers the sequence of events as if it happened yesterday. Smith
had a difficult time accepting the loss and even contemplated
transferring to avoid facing fellow students and fans after getting
beat by UGA's Corey Allen for the touchdown. Smith has been an
important part of Tech's success this season, but is still haunted
by last year's game. He hopes for redemption Saturday against the
Bulldogs in Athens. (Rogers, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 20.

   FBC-CHAMPBAILEY _ The Georgia Tech game was Champ Bailey's
coming-out party last season. Bailey was noted for his play at
cornerback, but he had several key receptions on offense that
helped the Bulldogs to a 27-24 victory. As the Tech game approaches
this season, Bailey has developed into one of the top two-way
players in the nation, leading the team in receptions and
interceptions. The game could be the final home game for Bailey, a
junior who is expected to turn pro next season. (Schlabach, Atlanta

   FBC-BOHLS-COLUMN _ AUSTIN, Texas _ In what should be the biggest

   FBC-UT-RECORD _ AUSTIN, Texas _ UT officials planned Monday for

   FBN-VERMEIL _ When the three old codgers, Dan Reeves, Mike Ditka
and Dick Vermeil, returned to coaching two years ago, people
wondered if they'd be able to handle the changing face of the NFL.
Vermeil is struggling. After leaving the profession 15 or so years
ago because of burnout, he's facing those same demons while
coaching the Rams, Atlanta's Sunday opponent. In short, Vermeil
looks stressed, frustrated and sick. (Pasquarelli, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution)

   FBN-NFLBEST _ Highlights from upcoming NFL weekend.
(Pasquarelli, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)
</P>
<P>
   FBC-GA-GATECH _ Matchup story on Georgia Tech's running game vs.
Georgia's run defense. Another one of the keys to the
Georgia-Georgia Tech game will be Tech's running game against the
Georgia defense. Tech has been ranked among the conference leaders
in rushing throughout the season with Joe Hamilton effectively
running the option. Georgia's defense is allowing more than 130
rushing yards per game, and Tech hope to exploit that weakness in
Saturday's game. (Rogers, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)
</P>
<P>
   FBC-BAYOU _ Eddie Robinson is no longer coaching at Grambling,
but the event he helped to begin will carry on this weekend in New
Orleans. The Bayou Classic, featuring Grambling and Southern, is
expected to attract more than 70,000 fans to the Louisiana
Superdome to watch a new era of Grambling football led by Doug
Williams, the former Tiger player and Super Bowl MVP. (Reese,
Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

NEW YEAR'S EVE CANVASES FOR PAINTING THE TOWN RED 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sun., Nov. 29) 
(JT) 
 By PAMELA NOEL    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   With New Year's Eve 1999 looming, it would be easy to dismiss
the end of 1998 as a non-event. But for anyone who wants to make
this New Year's Eve special by leaving town, traveling to one of
the First Night celebrations being planned in 183 American cities
this year might be a refreshing alternative.
</P>
<P>
   Although First Nights are designed to provide alcohol-free,
family- and arts-oriented events for a city's residents, even the
smallest city is likely to present an array of cultural
performances and activities that might interest an out-of-towner.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, cultural institutions and other public spaces
sometimes will take on new roles for First Night. Instead of
touring the Museum of the City of New York, for instance, First
Night participants in Manhattan this year can learn Latin dancing
there.
</P>
<P>
   In Burlington, Vt., the Patrick Gym at the University of Vermont
will become the stage for a Peruvian dance group called Inca Son.
And in Raleigh, N.C., the Convention Center Plaza will be the site
of an early evening children's countdown to the new year, complete
with fireworks and a drop of the city's giant acorn (the symbol for
this City of Oaks).
</P>
<P>
   First Night International, the nonprofit organization that
licenses all First Nights, has a Web site at www.firstnightintl.org
with links to individual cities' sites.
</P>
<P>
   Programs are subject to change, and all First Nights charge a
modest price for buttons that admit participants to indoor
entertainment, although food and beverages usually must be bought
separately.
</P>
<P>
   Below are 10 First Night celebrations where you can party like
it's 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Annapolis
</P>
<P>
   As befits this city of Colonial buildings and naval profile,
First Night Annapolis will feature hundreds of performances and
events on or near the waterfront and in some of its history-rich
buildings.
</P>
<P>
   The City Dock, at the foot of Main Street, will be filled with
illuminated boats and the sounds of African and Caribbean music.
Other entertainment will range from a presentation of ``Much Ado
About Nothing'' by the Richmond Shakespeare Company at the Asbury
Methodist Church to shows by Jeanie Bryson, jazz singer and
daughter of Dizzy Gillespie, at the Banneker-Douglass Museum.
</P>
<P>
   Masked revelers and costumed characters will glide through city
streets _ but be mindful of their tradition: they're not supposed
to speak. You can join the Chesapeake Caledonian Pipe Band at the
top of Main Street for the city's traditional March to Midnight
down to City Dock, followed by fireworks.
</P>
<P>
   (One minor disappointment: Plans for a giant illuminated crab to
descend at midnight are being shelved until the millennium party
next year.)
</P>
<P>
   First Night buttons cost $10, $14 after Dec. 19. Information:
First Night Annapolis, 100 Cathedral St., Annapolis, Md. 21401;
(410) 268-8553 or www.fstngt.org.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta
</P>
<P>
   Peachtree Street in midtown will be the epicenter of the city's
sixth First Night. Twenty-five indoor sites (including theaters and
churches) along Peachtree will serve as stages for continuous
30-minute music and dance shows. A parade that anyone can join will
be led by the Seed and Feed Marching Abominable, which includes
more than 40 people in colorful makeup, wigs, hats and costumes
that are heavy on sequins and feathers. There will be a family
festival from 3 to 9 p.m., and fireworks at midnight in front of
the Colony Square Plaza at Peachtree and 14th Streets. A planned
rendition of ``Gone With the Wind'' will be performed by one man
with a fast tongue: It's billed as taking just 20 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   First Night buttons are $7, $12 on Dec. 31; free for children
under 6. Information (including hotel packages): First Night
Atlanta, 999 Peachtree Street, Suite 795, Atlanta, Ga. 30309; (404)
881-0400; www.firstnightatlanta.com.
</P>
<P>
   Boston
</P>
<P>
   First Night Boston, which produced the first of these
celebrations in 1976, remains the largest (1.5 million expected)
and among the most lavish (more than 1,000 performers scheduled).
Plans are already in place for a three-day First Night 2000
extravaganza. This year entertainment will range from the New
England Philharmonic to the Weepin' Willie blues band to standup
comedy and even calypso and gospel played on steel drums by a group
of students at a Catholic church who bill themselves as St. Mary's
Heavenly Fire Steel Band. Among the 45 sites _ both indoors and out
_ will be the Boston Common, Copley Square and the Old State House
museum. There will be fireworks over the Boston Harbor. If you're
lucky, you might even snag one of the hotel rooms reserved for
First Night revelers.
</P>
<P>
   First Night buttons cost $12, free for children under 4.
Information: (617) 542-1399 or www.firstnight.org. For hotels: the
Greater Boston Convention and Visitors Bureau, (888) 733-2678.
</P>
<P>
   Burlington, Vt.
</P>
<P>
   After 15 First Nights, Burlington has figured out how to make
its celebration something of a hot ticket. As in previous years,
some 20,000 revelers are expected. Among the highlights will be a
fireworks display for children at 7:15 p.m., performances by local
favorites like the Green Mountain Cloggers, and a workshop, music
and dancing by Inca Son, a 12-member Peruvian troupe. Horse-drawn
wagon rides through the Church Street Marketplace are free with a
button.
</P>
<P>
   First Night buttons cost $8, or $35 for a family of five, until
Dec. 24. After that, all tickets $11; children under 2 free.
Information (including hotel packages): (800) 639-9252 or
www.firstnightburlington.com.

   Miami Beach
</P>
<P>
   In Miami Beach, home of sand, surf and supermodels, First Night
Miami Beach has planned lots of G-rated activities (like a
children's festival at the Miami Beach Convention Center) and
performances in English, Spanish and Creole. Iliana Lopez and
Franklin Gamero, principal dancers with the Miami City Ballet, will
perform, as will the Pilobolus Too dance company and La Gran Scena
Opera Co. At one art installation, revelers will be asked to write
resolutions on pieces of cloth that will be in a large quilt to be
displayed next year.
</P>
<P>
   First Night buttons are $10, $5 ages 6 to 12, under 6 free.
Hotel packages available. Information: (305) 670-7053.

rides at Bryant Park from noon to 4 p.m. Live reggae music will be
the highlight of a D.J. dance party at the Manhattan Mall, Avenue
of the Americas and 33d Street, with a balloon drop at midnight.
Latin music, dance lessons and a Havana-style dance party are
moving uptown and downtown this year, to the Museum of the City of
New York at Fifth Avenue and 103d Street and to the National Museum
of the American Indian, at Bowling Green and Broadway, near Battery
Park. Donna McKechnie, a Tony Award-winner for ``A Chorus Line,''
will perform as part of an evening of Americana at the New York
Society for Ethical Culture at 2 West 64th Street, at Central Park
West. For hardy souls, there will be a skating party at the Wollman

   Raleigh, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   Here is a New Year's Eve celebration that manages to embrace the
scraps of auld lang syne. First Night Raleigh encourages revelers
to show up at the Scrap Exchange Tent on the Bicentennial Plaza
downtown to have old stuff turned into hats, masks and costumes
that they can wear in the 6 p.m. People's Procession through
downtown. The parade (5,000 usually participate) will be led by a
200-foot dragon mascot named Trigon and a large mobile puppet with
a six-foot-long smile called Face. The early evening is reserved
for the new Kids Countdown at the Convention Center Plaza, from 7
to 8. It's essentially a children's version of the late night event
and will be the culmination of an afternoon of family festivities
at the North Carolina State Museum of Natural Sciences and the
North Carolina Museum of History. For adults, there will be evening
performances at 35 sites in the downtown area, including music by
the Raleigh Oratorio Society and the Raleigh Flute Choir, and dance
by Chuck Davis and the African American Dance Ensemble.
</P>
<P>
   First Night buttons cost $6 through Dec. 25, $8 after; free for
children 2 and under. Information: (919) 990-1158 or

</P>
<P>
   St. Louis
</P>
<P>
   Cups of hot coffee and cocoa ($1) will be staples at some
shuttle stops around downtown St. Louis as part of this year's
celebration. The idea is to keep revelers warm enough to take part
in a choreographed Grand Procession from the Central Library and
the City Museum shortly after 11 p.m. to the Kiener Plaza on
Broadway, for a finale of entertainment and fireworks. Throughout
the evening, in a 10-block area of downtown, there will be street
performers outside along with food vendors on Washington Avenue.
Inside, seven locations will offer entertainment for children and
adults, including a Velcro wall for climbing and the music of P.
Funk with Lost Children at the America's Center, and storytelling
and line-dance lessons in the Great Hall of the Central Library.
</P>
<P>
   First Night buttons cost $8, $4 for children in advance; $10, $5
for children on New Year's Eve. Information: (314) 588-0002;
www.firstnight-stl.com.
</P>
<P>
   St. Petersburg, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   A laser light show in St. Petersburg's new domed baseball
stadium, Tropicana Field, will begin the activities this year,
which will end with waterfront fireworks over the gulf. In between
will be an assortment of performances in music styles from blues
and Cajun to rock and world beat. The Florida Orchestra's Bayside
String Quartet and the 97th Regimental String Band also will
perform in St. Peter's Sanctuary. The city's Historical Museum will
become a stage for Allen Moffatt and Blind Willie, a blues and
gospel duo, and for Peter Merrigan, a contemporary acoustic
guitarist. The Florida International Museum will be used for a
performance of ``Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.'' But perhaps the
most festive sites will be the Pier, at the foot of Second Avenue,
with magic acts, a circus and a mariachi band; North Straub Park,
which will have a steel drum performance and fireworks; and South
Straub Park, which will feature a percussion garden _ sculptures
that can be played.
</P>
<P>
   First Night buttons cost $8, $5 ages 6 to 12, free under 6.
Information, (813) 823-8906.
</P>
<P>
   San Diego
</P>
<P>
   Celebrating First Night is as good an excuse as any to go to San
Diego. All the festivities will take place downtown at Embarcadero
Marina Park. The mix of merriment will include performances by
groups with names like the Zydeco Blues Patrol and the Javalinas.
There are plans for a Native American camp and a Renaissance camp.
Both will include presentations about customs. An international
food court and fireworks also are scheduled.
</P>
<P>
   First Night buttons cost $10, $5 for children under 12 and
seniors. Information: (619) 296-8731.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Moss, a four-year-old interior design store on 146
Greene St. in SoHo, has added four new floors, but customers will
not climbing stairs to reach them. Instead, they will be clicking a
mouse. That's because Moss' new floors exist within a computer
program and can be reached only through what could be Manhattan's
first virtual elevator.
</P>
<P>
   Murray Moss, the store's owner, has wanted to expand for quite
some time. But it occurred to him that a larger physical space
might not be the best solution. ``I asked myself what my products
would look like virtually,'' said Moss, who is 49.
</P>
<P>
   So he and Ron Ryan, a graphic designer, created a computer
graphics program that allows customers to choose an image of an
elevator to lift them digitally to virtual floors with animated
displays of furniture. It even plays elevator music.
</P>
<P>
   The virtual elevator of this cyberstore is reached on a
large-screen Macintosh G3 computer monitor, which is near
oil-and-vinegar set created by the Italian industrial designer
Ettore Sottsass, a shrimp bowl by Nambe, a manufacturing firm based
in New Mexico, and a silver inflated lounge chair by Ilkka
Suppanen.
</P>
<P>
   On the monitor, you choose one of the four floors. Two digital
voices, who introduce themselves as Fred and Princess, tell the
story of the virtual Moss store. ``For some time, we have wanted to
expand,'' the voices say in unison, ``But Barbara and Ken Cooke,
our upstairs neighbors, weren't ready to move.'' Moss explained
later that he had never really had a conflict with his upstairs
neighbors. ``I just thought it was a cute story,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Only two floors of the virtual Moss building are occupied. If
you click on the second floor, the doors close and the elevator
lifts you to Kartell(AT)Moss, which features a display of Italian
furniture by Kartell (some of which Moss also displays in the
store.) For the virtual display, Ryan created animations out of
photographs of the furniture that show qualities that cannot be
easily displayed in the physical store. One animation, for example,
shows a Kartell chair being assembled.
</P>
<P>
   Moss does not want the computer display to be a substitute for
his actual displays. ``I want it to be an extension of the physical
experience,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Moss said sales of Kartell furniture had doubled since he added
the computer display. The fifth floor features designs by the Swiss
furniture manufacturer Vitra.
</P>
<P>
   The remaining two floors are still vacant. Moss said he planned
to open a digital art gallery on the third floor and to rent the
fourth floor. Even though there is no limit to the number of
virtual floors he can build, he said he would honor the
neighborhood's very real zoning limit of five floors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although,'' he added, ``I reserve the right to make each floor
as big as I want.''
</P>

SHOPPING WITHOUT DROPPING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BARBARA DE WITT 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ So many gifts, so little time.
</P>
<P>
   As you head to the malls today, remember, you've only got 16
days until Hanukkah and 27 days left until Christmas to buy
presents for the people you love a lot, those you think of fondly,
and those who, well, your mother taught you to be nice to in spite
of your differences.
</P>
<P>
   And be ready to spend more than you did last year, reports the
American Express Financial Advisors. The group that makes a living
keeping track of how we spend money says folks across the country
will spend about $915 on gifts this year, up from $879 last year.
And for those of us on the West Coast, we'll be spending a total of
$1,522 for gifts, travel and entertaining expenses.
</P>
<P>
   To make this year's shopping expedition easier, we've already
scouted the malls, catalogs and Web sites for what's new and nifty
(and even thrifty) for everyone on your list. &QL; 
MONEY IS NO OBJECT (You have to ask?)  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Jewelry, furs and trips fall into this category _ but don't stop
there. Think of toys for big kids, like Neiman Marcus' Cracker Jack
box of caramel corn with really ritzy prizes. For her, an 18k gold
ring with a ruby or emerald, priced at $950; for him, a box with a
limited-edition pair of enameled cuff links, priced at $400.
</P>
<P>
   Other ideas for big-spenders include:
</P>
<P>
   $63,700 _ Lottery winners looking for something to spend their
new-found bucks on should think about a single red rose _ made of
48 carats of rubies with 2.38 carats of diamonds. It's a
one-of-a-kind brooch by Le Vian, available at Macy's at the
Northridge Fashion Center.
</P>
<P>
   $18,000 _ If she wears St. John knit suits, how about a St. John
wristwatch? It's a hefty stainless-steel tank (the season's hottest
style), trimmed with a bunch of diamonds. The new collection also
has a sporty stainless-steel model for $450 at upscale stores such
as Saks Fifth Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   $2,500 _ The economy is booming again, and power pens have made
a major comeback. One of the most impressive is Parker's
limited-edition silver snake design with real emerald eyes that was
first introduced in 1906. Look for it at luxury goods stores, or
call (212) 601-8344.
</P>
<P>
   $1,695 _ A tiny but incredibly precise camera like those used by
spies, the Leica Minox CLX is sold at camera and electronic stores
everywhere. Other way-cool cameras are Nikon's new Coolpix 900s
megapixel digital camera for $799, and Fujifilm's new Endeavor 1000
MRC Tiara, touted as the world's smallest 24mm Advanced Photo
System camera, for $479.95.
</P>
<P>
   $800 _ For the guy who always wanted a swanky car with an
elegant hood ornament, check out Lalique's limited-edition
Sagittarius crystal flacon that's reminiscent of a '30s hood
ornament and mounted on wood to be used as an objet d'art. The
crystal bottle, which features the torso of a man and the body of a
horse, is filled with a manly fragrance and sold at Neiman Marcus,
Saks Fifth Avenue, Nordstrom and Bloomingdale's.
</P>
<P>
   $590 _ For the executive (or wanna-be's) desk, the
sterling-silver Bolide Office Collection at Christofle, Beverly
Hills. The set includes a small desk clock, letter opener, pencil
holder, ruler and business-card holder.
</P>
<P>
   $549 _ A mirrored, lighted curio cabinet designed to showcase
eight of her limited-edition Barbie dolls, available at J.C. Penney
stores.
</P>
<P>
   $525 _ Tommy Hilfiger's bright yellow M400 mountain bike for
pedaling off to Starbucks or cruising along the coast. It's
available at Cannondale bicycle retailers; call (800) 245-3872.
</P>
<P>
   $399 _ Gearys Beverly Hills' pewter cocktail shaker with narrow
spout and handle on a gallery tray with two martini goblets. Just
the thing for mixing a batch of Cosmopolitans at your next soiree.
</P>
<P>
   $395 _ For that next black-tie gala, give him a custom-made
tuxedo from the Lands End catalog. To order, call (800) 356-4444.
</P>
<P>
   $300 _ You couldn't afford the Gucci ``G'' watch that was so hot
last year, but Calvin Klein's new stainless-steel collection is
almost as statusy _ and way cheaper. Available at Macy's.
</P>
<P>
   $295 _ Got a global friend? He'll always know what time it is in
Los Angeles and Paris with Swiss Army's new Odyssey GMT watch,
available at department and jewelry stores.
</P>
<P>
   $250 _ You call her your angel, so give her a pair of wings.
You'll find the Christmas Angel white satin bras with real feathers
(not that fuzzy marabou stuff) at Victoria's Secret for $250;
matching bikini panty is $30.
</P>
<P>
   $199 _ Euro-wires are sooo last year. Diamond studs are the
season's ticket, available at Mervyn's stores. While you're there,
check out the matching tennis bracelet for the same price. &QL; 
SENSIBLY CHIC (Gifts under $150) &QC;
</P>
<P>
   OK, so you can't afford a diamond bracelet or new car. You've
still got style when it comes to picking presents that might
include a sterling-silver bracelet with a tiny heart charm engraved
with your initials for $110 at Tiffany &AMP; Co., Beverly Hills; or the
new Jeep Home/Road Emergency Kit that comes with a three-band
radio, warning flashes and spotlight, first-aid kit, tire inflator,
lighter-to-lighter jumper and other goodies for $99.99 at
Jeep/Chrysler dealers. But read on, we've got more ideas below:
</P>
<P>
   $139 _ A classy cigar humidor in antique cherry for the guy who
is still smoking, from Bombay stores.
</P>
<P>
   $135 _ When he's got everything, consider a '50s-style chrome
stapler for his desk by Casco. Available at upscale office-supply
stores and Barney's New York in Beverly Hills.
</P>
<P>
   $129 _ For the coffee snob, Starbucks' Round the World Getaway
Tour, featuring six shipments of two 1-pound bags of coffee beans
from places like Italy, Guatemala and Sumatra. To order, call (800)
782-7282.
</P>
<P>
   $110 _ Bill Clinton wore them, now he can, too. We're talking
about those Italian ties by Zegna, available at Bloomingdale's.
</P>
<P>
   $95 _ She finally gets something from Louis Vuitton with this
checkbook cover, available at major department stores.
</P>
<P>
   $92.50 _ A custom-made shirt of Egyptian cotton with French
cuffs and perfectly cut sleeves, from Huntington Custom-by-Mail
catalog; (800) 848-6203.
</P>
<P>
   $90 _ A sterling-silver compact for her to touch up her
lipstick, at Tiffany &AMP; Co., Beverly Hills.
</P>
<P>
   $89 _ No more dings and dents in the fender with the handy,
dandy Park Zone gadget. It's got sensors that flash lights to tell
you when to stop so you won't hit the wall, or the car next to you.
Available at Sharper Image stores.
</P>
<P>
   $79 _ For the woman who loved ``Breakfast at Tiffany's,'' a doll
that's dressed like Audrey Hepburn with a tiara and little black
dress. It's by Mattel, at toy and gift stores.
</P>
<P>
   $60 _ Chanel's new beauty kit with Marilyn Monroe's favorite
scent, Chanel No. 5, plus lipstick, nail polish and eye pencil.
Available at department stores and the Chanel boutique, Beverly
Hills.
</P>
<P>
   $69.95 _ For the friend who loves to write letters, a gold-toned
desktop embosser with monogram and/or address, from the Levenger
catalog; (800) 544-0880. &QL; 
LITTLE TOKENS OF AFFECTION (Gifts under $50) &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Gifts that show you care even if you're broke, job-impaired or
still waiting for this week's allowance.
</P>
<P>
   $50 _ Warm and snuggly pajamas just like the ones Oprah wears,
by Karen Neuburger. Available at Macy's and Bloomingdale's.
</P>
<P>
   $49.95 _ He can command his starship _ or at least open the
garage door _ with the new Star Trek Docking Communicator that
features Star Trek sound and light effects. Available at
mass-merchandising and electronics stores.
</P>
<P>

love. Available at Angel's Corner in Valencia; Fashion Square Car
Wash in Sherman Oaks; Up Your Alley in Newhall; and the Love
Boutique in Tarzana.
</P>
<P>
   $45 _ Like all that other stuff from the '60s and '70s,
astrological signs are in again. For her retro dressing table, try
a perfume atomizer featuring her sign, by Debbie Palmer at Neiman
Marcus, Beverly Hills.
</P>
<P>
   $40 _ A pair of golf gloves sure to give you an extra edge, at
Coach stores.
</P>

GIFTS FOR KIDS &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Barbie is still big, and so are Hot Wheels and Tonka toys, but
the major news is toys that talk on a variety of subjects ... and
even call your kid by name. And in spite of all those
techno-advances, there's a new generation discovering the joys of
old-fashioned board games.
</P>
<P>
   Can't decide which toy to choose? The Duracell Kids' Choice

them play-test the season's newest toys and games for a two-week

software from Connectix (about $200 total). For about $1,300.
</P>
<P>

extras. For about $400.

equalizer. Also sounds great with televisions, personal stereos,
even Power Macs. Around $260.
</P>
<P>
   _ Compaq 2015c hand-held computer: Windows CE 2.0-based computer

   _ Color Game Boy: Nintendo has sold 65 million Game Boys, and
now has finally added a color screen. Only about 15 new color

black-and-white Game Boy titles will show up to 10 colors on the
new machines.Now that's a technological marvel. About $65.
</P>
<P>
   _ Microsoft Sidewinder Freestyle Pro game controller: The
combination joystick and gamepad offers plenty of basics, but best
of all is how internal positional sensors translate your body
English into commands for a game. Cool. Comes bundled with a very
good game, Motocross Madness. Even cooler. About $75.

<P>
   _ My Design dolls: Dial up Mattel's Web site at www.Barbie.com

</P>
<P>

sci-fi role-playing game that's one of this year's best in the
genre.

more, with eight new battlegrounds, 12 new vehicles and numerous

the N64, you play a human who's sent back in time to hunt down
alien invaders before they eradicate mankind.

substitutions and nowhere to hide.'' Play all this season's games,

<P>
   _ James Cameron's Titanic Explorer: This disk he did for love.
An hour of film footage evokes life on board, as do tons of photos,
1,200 pages of Senate testimony, and much, much more for the family
Titanic freak. But sorry girls, no Leo.

<P>
   _ Microsoft Combat Flight Simulator: Flight Simulator with guns,
finally. Good game, too. Endlessly expandable and compatible with
planes from Flight Simulator 5.0 and 98.

   LOS ANGELES _ Got game? Well, if you don't, this is a good year
to get game.
</P>
<P>
   Both the Sony PlayStation and Nintendo 64 video-game consoles
are hitting the sweet spot in their life cycles, with dozens of
excellent titles available, many for as little as $20, even as the
machines' prices have dropped to $129.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, more and more companies are creating compelling
titles for the personal computer, whose power and expandability
make truly eye- and ear-popping experiences possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to be the best year for games ever, that much is
already clear,'' said Jennifer Pahlka, director of the Game
Developers Conference. ``(PlayStation and Nintendo 64) both are
hitting the biggest installed base ever.''
</P>
<P>
   And we're talking big indeed. Industry estimates say Americans
will spend more than $6.3 billion this year on video games, a
record total that outstrips the domestic gross at movie box
offices.
</P>
<P>
   Seema Williams, an analyst who follows the video-game industry
for Forrester Research in Cambridge, Mass., said part of what is
driving the great year is that the slow-starting N64 console now
has enough distinctive games that take advantage of its better
graphics abilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nintendo is finally coming into its own,'' Williams said.
``The No. 1 complaint for several years has been that there were
not enough N64 games. For the first time, they're on fairly
reasonable footing in terms of hot games.'' &QL; 
MORE POWER &QC;
</P>
<P>
   N64 is newer and more powerful, with better graphics
capabilities that will be further augmented by this week's release
of the !bold!Expansion Pak!off!, which doubles a console's memory,
allowing it to display more and smarter enemies, in better-looking
backgrounds.
</P>
<P>
   Nintendo games have always appealed to a younger audience, with
sweeter characters and gore-free situations. That's still largely
the case, but games like the new ``Star Wars''-based title, Rogue
Squadron, and the dinosaur-hunting Turok 2: Seeds of Evil, will
provide a broader range of choices.
</P>
<P>
   But the season's hottest game, on any platform, likely will be
N64's The Legend of Zelda: The Ocarina of Time. Crafted by gaming
legend Shigeru Miyamoto _ also responsible for such huge-selling
franchises as Donkey Kong and Mario Brothers _ this Zelda title has
already been dubbed the ``game of the century'' by Next Generation
magazine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Zelda'' was released this week, and Nintendo company
spokespeople say they've had more than 400,000 preorders and expect
to sell more than 2.5 million copies by Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are other titles supporting that, but if you're looking
at one premier flagship title, it has to be Zelda,'' said
Nintendo's Beth Llewelyn. ``People have described it like walking
into the middle of your favorite book or movie.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the game for the holiday season,'' Williams said. ``The
first shipment is sold out, and some people will be lucky to get
one for the holidays. I don't hear enough buzz about a similar
title for the PlayStation to give it a similar pickup in sales.'' &QL; 
LOTS OF TITLES &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Which isn't to say there aren't plenty of choices on the
3-year-old PlayStation machine. Roughly 500 PSX games are available
in the United States, and the mix of titles is changing, said Sony
Computer Entertainment America spokeswoman Molly Smith.
</P>
<P>
   The PlayStation has always had plenty of titles that appeal to
the twitchy, gore-minded older teens in the household. Now it
finally is getting games anyone can play, including Spyro the
Dragon, Crash Bandicoot: Warped, and upcoming titles based on the
animated movies ``A Bug's Life'' and ``Rugrats.''
</P>
<P>
   Those help fill out a bulging portfolio that includes such
much-awaited new releases as Metal Gear Solid, Tomb Raider III,
Twisted Metal III, Madden '99 and NFL Gameday '99!off!.
</P>
<P>
   ``PlayStation is the leader in the industry, with more than 12.5
million units installed,'' said Smith. ``The best reason people are
going to buy it is purely for the entertainment experience that our
system offers that no one else can offer.''
</P>
<P>
   On the computer side, the arrival of Apple Computer's iMac is
starting to make the Mac gaming market more attractive finally,
Williams said. With about 500,000 of the low-cost, slickly
designed, simple-to-set-up machines expected to be sold by year's
end, ``some of those (gaming) companies will be looking to move
their titles over to this mass market,'' Williams said. ``It's
low-hanging fruit.''
</P>
<P>
   But hyped-up IBM-compatible PCs loaded with two fast graphics
accelerator cards, screaming processors, big screens, high-end
stereo sound and joystick controllers remain the machine of the
gaming ubergeek.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't pry those guys off their PCs,'' Williams said. &QL; 
BEYOND THE NERDS &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for the housewife in Pacoima who enjoys simpler
gaming pleasures, the PC game market is diversifying, moving away
from a hard-core audience of twitchy teens.
</P>
<P>
   ``The industry is now convinced there are people who are casual
gamers who will go out and buy different games, like !bold!Deer
Hunter, Barbie Nail Designer, You Don't Know Jack!off!, and Parappa
the Rapper, Pahlka said. ``This is somebody who's not going to
spend 20 hours a week playing a game. They want to play an
entertaining game for maybe a shorter period.''
</P>
<P>
   So increasingly there are trivia games, hunting games, digital
versions of board games and TV game shows, music games, games that
combine education and entertainment, games that allow you to create
something on the computer and print it out and assemble it.
</P>
<P>
   And next year, everything will change again, in part because of
Sega's Dreamcast console, being unveiled today in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   A strange and powerful hybrid that includes a built-in 33.6 Kbps
modem, a tiny personal digital assistant that plugs into the
Nintendo-like bat-shaped game controller, and a high-performance
processor tweaked to provide graphics performance as much as four
times better than a Pentium II computer.
</P>
<P>
   A Sega spokeswoman said the machine is expected to debut in the
United States next fall, accompanied initially by 12 to 15 titles.
Its arrival will begin the eclipse of the PlayStation and N64,
though both platforms should be sources of enjoyable games for
years to come.
</P>
<P>
   The two warring consoles remain the best gaming alternative for
many families, especially in households where access to a PC is
nonexistent or limited. Some families may wait until Dreamcast
debuts next year, but the cheap prices and broad selection of this
generation of consoles likely will be hard to resist for many.
</P>
<P>
   If you can't resist, what does Williams recommend? The N64, with
its newer technology and superior performance, will probably have
more interesting titles in the next couple of years. But the better
approach depends on what your family wants.
</P>
<P>
   ``Go stand in a software aisle and see which game your kid
points to,'' Williams said. ``It always has to be a software buy.
Because the prices aren't that different, go for (the console that
runs) the software your kid wants.'' &QL;

THOROUGHLY BRAINWASHED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED SHUSTER 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The music is polished, the voice soulful, but it's
Gregg Alexander's melodies and lyrics that make his acclaimed
``Maybe You've Been Brainwashed, Too'' an album to come back to
often.
</P>
<P>
   The disc, credited to the New Radicals, which is really
Alexander, some musician friends and a couple of high-priced
session dudes, is the sort of record you just don't hear much
anymore.
</P>
<P>
   First of all, it's not simply a couple of catchy radio tunes and
a ton of filler, like so many other albums from new or developing
artists.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander, as Rolling Stone said in its recent review of
``Brainwashed,'' is clearly a deep thinker, and his songs stand
repeated listenings at home and on the radio, where the New
Radicals cut ``You Get What You Give'' has fast found a home.
</P>
<P>
   Grosse Point, Mich.-bred Alexander, 27, is essentially an
unknown quantity, even though he made an album for A&AMP;M in 1989.
After grunge arrived a few years later and swept away all that came
before, Alexander moved to Europe, where he had some of the dark
adventures chronicled in ``Brainwashed'' (MCA).
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of these tunes are based on experience, for better or
worse,'' Alexander said last week. ``There's definitely some strong
similarities between fact and fiction. Some of these songs are
really dark.''
</P>
<P>
   One of those songs might be album standout ``I Hope I Didn't
Just Give Away the Ending,'' in which the narrator meets a girl in
Amsterdam, they go off to buy illicit substances and end up ``doing
a porno film for coke/I hear I'm big in Japan.'' Eventually someone
dies, the police show up and ``I'm blamed in the confusion.''
</P>
<P>
   Alexander admits to listening to a lot of Steely Dan as well
Prefab Sprout's mid-'80s pop masterpiece ``Two Wheels Good.''
Adding to his new album's sheen are key contributions from such
high-profile session players as percussionist Lenny Castro and
pianist Greg Phillinganes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried a lot of different people to play piano, because it
was a real communal record-making process at the end,'' Alexander
explained. ``If there was a piano part and it didn't sound good,
I'd bring in two or three people and have them take a crack at
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Some have said Alexander's ``Brainwashed'' is as close to
blue-eyed soul as you get these days. Alexander, who produced and
arranged the disc, agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people who are prone to like the music are having an
emotional reaction to it,'' he said. ``When it gets under people's
skin, that's attributable to the fact that these songs aren't
lighter than air. There's an emotional content to the music.''
</P>
<P>
   Alexander _ who plans a Los Angeles date in the new year _ said
that when demo tapes of his New Radicals material began to
circulate in the industry last year, ``people started coming at me
with checkbooks.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, he realizes that there are no guarantees in this
business.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know if it would be like that Steve Miller song _ `I
might get rich, I might get busted,''' he says.

SHOPPING WITH A NET 
</HEADLINE>
 ? -BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SIMSON GARFINKLE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Friday is the biggest shopping day of the year in the physical
world, and indications are good that it's going to be a
record-breaking shopping day in cyberspace as well. That's because
the combination of easy-to-use Web sites, incredible selection, and
overnight delivery is turning on-line shopping from a novelty into
a necessity for more and more consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Consider me. I'm a book junky. Last year at this time I had
spent $1,491 on books, of which $327 went to Amazon.com, probably
the Internet's most successful on-line merchant. This year the
amount that I've spent on books has dropped to $1,059, but $864
went to Amazon purchases. That trend is great for Seattle-based
Amazon, but lousy for local booksellers.
</P>
<P>
   Although I still love walking through a brick-and-mortar
bookstore, for some reason these trips are growing less productive.
Indeed, one thing I've discovered myself doing is visiting a
physical store, then going on line to order the same book.
</P>
<P>
   Why purchase a book over the Web from Amazon, when you can buy
it just as easily in Harvard Square? One reason is price. I find
Amazon consistently has lower prices than my local bookstores. And
even though I do have to pay a shipping ($3 per shipment plus 95
cents per item) fee, I don't have to pay sales tax. While it's true
that I don't get the book for a day or two, usually the delay is no
big deal.
</P>
<P>
   But the biggest advantage to shopping on line isn't price; it's
selection. Last year I had the pleasure of meeting Jeff Bezos,
Amazon's brilliant president and founder. He told me people are
always asking him why he decided to name his Web site after those
one-breasted huntresses of Greek mythology. He didn't. Amazon, he
said, is named after the Amazon River, the largest, most powerful
river of the world. His goal was to be the Amazon of the book
selling world. And he's done it.
</P>
<P>
   Case in point: A few weeks ago, I wanted to get my 1999 FoxTrot
16-month weekly planner. No local bookstore had it in stock, so I
clicked to Amazon on the Web. Less than a week later, I had the
calendar. But the company didn't just send the book to me; it also
scanned the cover and put it on its Web site, building out their
database in the process.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, if you look beneath the covers, there is something else
happening with on-line merchandising that's being generally
overlooked. Like many things on the Web, Amazon's size is part
virtual. It doesn't really stock every book. Instead, it has
extremely close relationships with book distributors and publishers
around the world. Amazon shelves have only the most popular books
that customers purchase; order a less popular book, and Amazon
requests it from its distributor in its next shipment, unpacks a
big box in Seattle when the books arrive, packs your book into a
box destined for you, and sends the package on its merry way.
Amazon is really a huge trans-shipping point, and the company's
programmers have spent an incredible amount of effort trying to
tune this process to be as efficient as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Order a book from Amazon, and you'll discover that your invoice
is covered with barcodes. After each book title is a little code,
like (2-2-6), which describes the book's exact location in the
warehouse. The invoice serves double-task as a pick list that tells
Amazon's warehouse workers were to pick up each book. Books in the
warehouse are not organized alphabetically or by Dewey Decimal;
they're arranged so that orders can be filled in the shortest
amount of time. Running the whole operation is Amazon's extremely
sophisticated order processing system, which combines aspects of
ordering books, managing the warehouse, fulfilling customer orders,
and, of course, running the Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon isn't really a bookseller; it's essentially a big
software development firm. The company currently has 60 job
openings in software development and systems management. It has
just two openings in business development, five in marketing, five
in merchandising. This is one reason that it's so easy for the
company to move into other markets, like CDs, DVDs, and software.
The next logical step for Amazon is to eliminate UPS and Federal
Express entirely and sell intellectual property on line.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon's software has two primary goals: improving the shopping
experience, and cutting operations costs as tightly as possible.
Ease-of-use, selection, and customer satisfaction are important
issues for on-line shopping --- far more important than they are
with stores in the physical world. That's because in the physical
world, there is an important tangible advantage that blesses some
stores at the expense of others: location. If I live next to a
shoddy bookstore, I'll still check it for a best seller or a travel
book, simply because it's easier than going across town to another
store. But on the Internet, it's just as easy to shop the best. For
this reason, the Internet may represent a fundamentally new twist
in shopping: the emergence of winner-take-all retailers.
</P>
<P>
   (Indeed, there are other bookstores on the Web, such as
barnesandnoble.com and www.books.com, but I don't enjoy using them
as much. Barnes and Noble didn't have FoxTrot 1999 calendar.)
</P>
<P>
   Five or 10 years from now, shopping on the day after
Thanksgiving might be a very different experience. Buying books,
CDs, or software at a store might be a thing of the past. Instead,
Mom and Dad might just gather around a computer screen and pick out
their gifts. Or, in another twist, we might still find ourselves
going to brick-and-mortar bookstores where we will look at the
books, enjoy a coffee, and perhaps pick up a little toy. But
instead of walking home with the books, we'll just scan their
barcodes, and then wait to have them delivered a few days later by
UPS.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The male cadets of Virginia Military Institute, in
their second awkward year of unisex education, are still having an
attitude adjustment problem.
</P>
<P>
   After female cadets were added to the previously all-male
football cheerleader squad, the male fans did not react like the
gentlemen-officers they are in training to become. They booed,
jeered and threw peanuts at the women during home football games in
Lexington, Va. They shouted ``Get out of here. We don't want you!''
</P>
<P>
   Oh, for pity's sake. Get a life, guys. Are male VMI cadets all
terminally juvenile or is there too much beer sold at the games?
</P>
<P>
   This is an odd twist in the gender wars. Some of us thought that
equal rights were supposed to free women from having to be
cheerleaders on the sidelines while men got to be the players on
the central field. It is something of a role reversal that men are
now jealous that their female classmates are among the
cheerleaders.
</P>
<P>
   Some cadets circulated a petition claiming that watching fellow
students in short cheerleader skirts was creating ``sexual
tension.'' This would seem to mean it's fantastically easy to
arouse a VMI cadet. Cosmopolitan magazine, please take notice.
There's a story in this.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the male cadets are trying to argue it both ways. Some
contend the women aren't sexy enough. The ultimate insult was
delivered by Jason Clough, a cadet from Florida. ``They don't look
like cheerleaders,'' he said, because of their close-cropped
military haircuts. ``They look like men in skirts.'' Sure. Get a
new pair of glasses, pal.
</P>
<P>
   Gussie Lord, a sophomore female cheerleader, by now a veteran of
such macho male foolishness, responded sensibly, ``Just because we
go here (attend VMI) doesn't mean we're not feminine, that we're
not women.''
</P>
<P>
   Female cheerleaders are not a novelty at VMI. For years there
have been cheerleaders of both sexes, but the women were imported
from neighboring schools for VMI football games. This apparently
made them less threatening or provocative or whatever it is that
bugs the male cadets other than women who happen to share the same
classroom with them.
</P>
<P>
   VMI is not accustomed to a class of cadets composed of both men
and women equally eligible for cheerleading and every other
competitive campus leadership role. Other colleges take it for
granted that men and women can peacefully participate in school
activities side by side. But the male-oriented military atmosphere
at VMI makes such a comfort level difficult to achieve.
</P>
<P>
   VMI reluctantly surrendered its male-only status after the
Supreme Court ruled in 1996 that it could not simultaneously take
tax revenues from the state of Virginia and discriminate against
women. It was the last state-supported college in the country to
exclude women, having spent millions of dollars over six years
fighting integration. VMI's patrons could not raise enough money to
support the school privately. So they were legally forced to accept
women to keep state revenues flowing.
</P>
<P>
   This year's freshman class includes 50 women and 1,250 men. Two
women and 30 men dropped out earlier this year for undisclosed
reasons. Last year, the first in which women were admitted, there
were 31 female students.
</P>
<P>
   VMI President Josiah Bunting has taken serious steps to
encourage a civilized academic environment, hoping to avoid the
scandals that initially beset The Citadel in Charleston, S.C.,
after it was forced to accept female cadets against its will two
years before VMI's own transformation. Bunting has required
coeducation orientation sessions, seminars on the evils of sexual
harassment and committee studies on transition problems.
</P>
<P>
   Bunting insists he will punish anyone who physically abuses a
female student. But he also confessed last year to a National Press
Club audience that his heart was not with the women. He said he
personally thought admitting women was a bad idea bound to diminish
the importance and quality of VMI's military-style education.
</P>
<P>
   The cheerleader episode is more of a silly social commentary
than a serious threat to the principle of coeducation. But VMI
should be ashamed of itself. This is not the way that potential
leaders of our army should behave.

NETWORK TELEVISION'S NIGHTMARE 
</HEADLINE>

 By JOHN ELLIS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Five years ago, Marc Andreessen was a student at the University
of Illinois, tinkering with software that enabled people to access
the Internet with ease. Five days ago, the company he founded after
graduating from college _ Netscape _ was sold to America Online for
$4 billion. In the course of five short years, Andreessen changed
the face of computing forever. He is now involved in a venture that
may do something similar to broadcast television.
</P>
<P>
   Three weeks ago, it was announced that Andreessen had made a
significant investment in a small Silicon Valley start-up called
Replay Networks Inc., and that he would take a seat on the
company's board. Replay Networks will soon bring to market a
digital television recording system, similar to a video cassette
recorder, that will initially retail for $999.
</P>
<P>
   The system is called ReplayTV and in the words of New York Times
technology correspondent John Markoff, it will ``enable users to
record a complete program that is already in progress, to
automatically record programs that meet a predetermined criterion _
for example, movies featuring a particular actor _ and to
intelligently skip commercials.''
</P>
<P>
   The ReplayTV system houses a 7-Gigabyte hard-disk drive similar
to a personal computer's hard drive. According to Daily Variety,
``cable or satellite TV programming signals coming into the house
are sent into the unit, where they're compressed and recorded on
the disk drive. Software inside the device enables the user to
easily select programs up to two weeks in the future to record on
the disc drive for later viewing, as well as pause, fast forward
and review programming that they're currently watching and that's
still being recorded.''
</P>
<P>
   This technology represents a potentially lethal threat to the
broadcast television business. Broadcasters break even (or lose
money) on network programming and make a killing on their
owned-and-operated affiliates (O&AMP;Os). This arrangement allows
broadcasters to present themselves as competitively disadvantaged
(we can't make a buck in this business) while their O&AMP;Os mint money
for shareholders (we've just had another record year).
</P>
<P>
   Everything depends on a huge advertising revenue stream to cover
(or almost cover) the costs of network programming and fatten the
profit margins at the owned affiliates. To keep that revenue stream
flowing, broadcasters must convince advertising agencies that
spending vast sums of money on television commercials is the
``only'' way to reach a mass audience. This they have done with
considerable success for the last forty years.
</P>
<P>
   But what if consumers adapt to digital television recording
systems as quickly as they did to video cassette recorders? The
first thing that happens is that Microsoft and everybody else will
get into the business of manufacturing digital television recording
systems and the price of said systems will plummet to a commodity
rate of about $199 per unit. The second thing that will happen is
that viewers will have complete control over content. If they don't
want to watch television commercials, they won't have to. The third
thing that will happen is that the network schedule (``ER'' at 10
p.m.) becomes fungible. Someone can watch the news from 9:45 to
10:07 (minus all commercials) and then watch ER in 50 minutes
(minus all commercials). Should they be interrupted for any reason,
they would simply ``pause'' the programming and return to it at
their convenience.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine for a moment that you run an advertising agency. Would
you tell your clients to sign a long-term advertising deal with NBC
or CBS, knowing that in five years as many as 60 percent of all
households might be hooked up to digital television recording
systems? The only thing you might urge your clients to buy would be
``live'' events, such as breaking news stories or sports. You
wouldn't touch the rest of it, because you would know that anyone
with a digital television recording system can ``intelligently
skip'' commercials.
</P>
<P>
   Without this river of advertising revenue, the network equation
falls apart. Network programming goes broke. The owned-and-operated
affiliates also go broke. Cable television maintains its
subscription fees, but it also takes a huge hit on the revenue
side. Only HBO, Showtime and other premium television services
would be unaffected by the new technology.
</P>
<P>
   According to people who have used ReplayTV, it is a quantum leap
ahead of the video cassette recorder and is remarkably
user-friendly. ``The adaption rate is likely to be much faster than
VCRs,'' says one industry analyst, ``partly because it's like a VCR
and partly because it's so much easier to use.''
</P>
<P>
   If ReplayTV connects with consumers, then network television and
cable television will have to completely rethink their business
models, Hollywood television production companies will have to
rethink their distribution, and syndicators will have to
re-negotiate their contracts. Without advertising, television as we
know it is unsustainable. ReplayTV is a harbinger of the end of
television advertising.

BOB BENDER IS ON TOP OF HIS GAME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By BUD WITHERS  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bob Bender is at his favorite lunch spot near the University of
Washington campus. For a couple of hours, he's Norm or Cliff from
Cheers, at a hangout where everybody seems to know his name.
</P>
<P>
   ``Regular,'' Bender advises the waitress, and soon she brings
him a plate of rigatoni and a salad.
</P>
<P>
   Nearby, there is a small gathering of thirtysomething women, a
couple of them with babies, and they're stealing he occasional
glance toward Bender. And you're not sure whether it's because he's
the basketball coach at the UW, or because, even at 40, he's not
all that far advanced from the campus heart throb he was at Duke a
decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very lucky,'' Bender is saying.
</P>
<P>
   Everybody says they're lucky. People who lose a limb in combat
say they're lucky because they weren't killed. But Bender is lucky.
Everything seems in order: A wife with an MBA from Duke, two
beautiful children _ one boy, one girl, naturally _ a life in a
gorgeous city and a job seemingly without the knifing pressure
common to his profession. What else is there?
</P>
<P>
   More than good fortune, though, perhaps this is the reality:
Maybe he's only gotten back what he's put into it. Maybe this is
what happens when you never utter an untoward word about anybody,
when you don't hold grudges, when you're willing to find out for
yourself somebody's a jerk rather than assume it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe it's the Midwestern upbringing,'' said author John
Feinstein, a Duke classmate of Bender. ``Bob was obviously taught
by his parents to be nice to people. Bob can find that nugget of
good that exists in almost all people.''
</P>
<P>
   Some 5{ 1/2 years after Bender arrived at Washington, he has
accomplished something even more remarkable than last winter's
memorable thrust into March Madness.
</P>
<P>
   For so long, the operative question on Washington basketball
was, Can anybody possibly win here? Now it's, Why couldn't those
other guys?
</P>
<P>
   He came down the elevator at the Westin Hotel the evening of
April 8, 1993, expecting to be told in the lobby by UW athletic
director Barbara Hedges that for the second time in five years, he
had lost out to John Shumate for a job.
</P>
<P>
   Bender was ready for it. As a Duke assistant coach, he once was
buoyant and full of optimism that he would get the vacant job at
Radford, a small Virginia school. Back came a written reply: ``Dear
Applicant ... ''
</P>
<P>
   There also was his attempt at the position at Southern Methodist
in the late '80s, when Shumate won out. Now, with Washington a year
removed from an ugly succession of charges and counter-charges of
racism in the program, it made some sense that Shumate, an African
American, would land the position.
</P>
<P>
   Hedges surprised Bender with a job offer. And he retreated to
the elevator, ordered a pizza for him and his wife, Alice, and went
about rebuilding one of the most destitute programs in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   The Huskies, authors of six straight non-winning seasons, were
not only bad, they were repellent. High school coaches were
alienated. Media warred with the coach. Hardly anybody showed up at
games. Nobody cared. And seemingly, nobody cared that nobody cared.
</P>
<P>
   The first thing Bender did was make it worse.
</P>
<P>
   Intent on attracting a player or two who could help the team
quickly, he recruited Derrick Croft, a guard from Skagit Valley
Junior College. Believing an NCAA rule prevented him from
off-campus recruiting for a certain period, he had Croft visit
campus.
</P>
<P>
   Then he was informed by a UW official it was an NCAA ``dead
period,'' with all recruiting prohibited. A week after he started,
he had committed an NCAA violation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm thinking, `Am I not the right person for this job?'''
Bender recalls now. ``How could I make this kind of mistake?''
</P>
<P>
   There would be more hard times. The Huskies would go 5-22 that
year. They would be 9-18 the year after. The program was creating
hardly a ripple of interest.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no pressure from the administration,'' says Ray
Giacoletti, an assistant coach on those staffs. ``But everybody was
questioning, Are we going to get this thing turned around? Bob kept
everybody focused and pushing on.''
</P>
<P>
   Even then, there was something intriguing going on. By the sheer
force of his personality, Bender kept a positive face on the
program. He had welcomed back two players kicked off the team in
the previous regime. He had retained the walk-on players. He opened
the doors to practice to the media _ not sometimes, all the time.
</P>
<P>
   He gave, and he got back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could see light at the end of the tunnel,'' he says. ``The
core was building. At the same time, we also knew the third year
that we had to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one told me that. I said that. Your third year, you should
be able to win.''
</P>
<P>
   At long last, they did.
</P>
<P>
   Lucky? You want luck? How about the day Bob Bender was a
freshman in high school at Quincy (Ill.) Catholic, playing for his
dad, Bob Sr.? He came out of the shower at the Illinois state
tournament in Champaign, fresh off a one-point loss to
Lawrenceville, and who is standing there wanting to shake hands but
Red Auerbach? Red Auerbach, the coach/deity of the Boston Celtics.
</P>
<P>
   ``He says, `Is your son really 14 years old?''' remembers Bob
Bender Sr. ```I'd like to meet him.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``I had an idea what he was like,'' says the younger Bender.
``Real crusty, matter-of-fact. It was, `Tell me I'm not good
enough. Tell me to work harder.'
</P>
<P>
   ``And that's what he did say.''
</P>
<P>
   Bender would soon know other big-name coaches. He grew to
6-foot-3, played point guard and was heavily recruited. Among those
he saw most at his games was Mike Krzyzewski, a young assistant for
Bob Knight at Indiana. Krzyzewski once saw him score 50 points in a
tournament game.
</P>
<P>
   Back then, the name Knight was magical. When he came to recruit
Midwest kids, they followed. Bender and his parents found his
honesty refreshing.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, that honesty would bury Bender. He struggled through a
freshman year at Indiana in 1975-76, a reserve on an Indiana team
that went 32-0, won the NCAA championship and is recognized as one
of the best of all time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't sense any problems with Bob,'' says Tom Abernethy, a
starting forward on that team. ``We were all focused on what we had
to do, being undefeated and all that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it was evident he was not happy. Some guys, when
they're not happy, can be very disruptive on a team.''
</P>
<P>
   Slowly, Knight was killing Bender, whose dad had not coached by
screaming. Every day, he would retreat to his dorm with his
freshman roommate, Rich Valavicius, two kids trying to survive the
most demanding coach in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Bender has always put it on himself, saying he wasn't mature
enough to handle Knight. But Valavicius, now a high school coach in
Huntsville, Ala., reveals what he and Bender what through.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got to the point _ and I think Bob had the same thing _ I
wanted to do so good for him, I didn't know whether to pass or
shoot,'' Valavicius says. ``He had my head all screwed up.''
</P>
<P>
   Well into the year, word got out that Bender and Valavicius
might want to transfer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Next thing you know, Knight calls us down to his locker room,
both of us,'' Valavicius says. ``We came in there, scared to death.
`Listen, you two s---heads. I heard you're leaving. What's all this
about?' I'd never been called a s---head before.''
</P>
<P>
   Terrified, Bender and Valavicius stammered out that no, there
was nothing to it. A little older, they might have known that
Knight blew up at everybody.
</P>
<P>
   Once, the team was sitting on a bus waiting to take them to an
NCAA regional game. Outside were Hoosier admirers, including
Knight's then-wife Nancy, and their infant son Pat, now an
assistant coach to his dad.
</P>
<P>
   SKRRK! Knight rammed open his window on the bus.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nancy!'' he bellowed. ``Get a bleeping coat on that kid!''
</P>
<P>
   Another time, Scott May, the superlative Indiana forward, had a
huge game in a one-point victory at Ohio State but the Hoosiers had
to survive a last-second missed layup by the Buckeyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just chewed out May,'' Valavicius says. ``Put his hand
through the blackboard and chewed him out.''
</P>
<P>
   The team boarded a bus, where it was halted by a passing train.
Two miles down the road was a gate where the bus could avoid the
train, but the driver waited.
</P>
<P>
   ``Knight is ticked,'' Valavicius says. ``He gets right in the
bus driver's ear and just chews him out. That man sat there and
looked straight ahead. He got 40 minutes of ass-chewing.''
</P>
<P>
   Bender returned in the fall of 1976, willing to give Indiana
another chance. Soon he realized it was no different, and he
summoned up the courage to go in and tell Knight he was leaving.
</P>
<P>
   ``You didn't go in just to see Coach Knight,'' Bender says.
``The first 15 minutes, I was just crying. It was one of the
hardest things I've ever had to do.'' But Knight was calm. He told
Bender to give it a day. Bender called his parents to tell them.
</P>
<P>
   The family spent two hours the next day with Knight. When it was
done, Bender was moving on.
</P>
<P>
   Soon afterward, Bender flew to Duke to begin the process of
school selection all over again. But Bill Foster, the coach, told
him he wasn't going to recruit him, so he spent most of his time
with the players.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wasn't there eight hours,'' the senior Bender says, ``and
he said he wanted to stay.''
</P>
<P>
   Bender immediately took to center Mike Gminski, and Foster was
recruiting a great freshman class that in 1978 would take the Blue
Devils all the way to the NCAA championship game, a loss against
Kentucky. Bender is the only player in history to take part in the
title game for two schools.
</P>
<P>
   When there was a debate over who should start at point guard
during that '78 season _ Bender or another transfer, Johnny Harrell
_ Bender made it work by accepting a role as a key substitute.
</P>
<P>
   After graduation, he got a quick look by the NBA, then went back
to Duke as an athletic fund-raiser. By 1983, he was wondering what
to do with his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I realized I'm not very good at asking people for things,''
Bender says. ``Money, favors or anything. People were complaining
about the program, and I thought, `Why am I listening to this? I'd
rather be a part of it.'''
</P>
<P>
   By then, Krzyzewski had replaced Foster at Duke, launching his
illustrious tenure there with two losing seasons. Bender sought out
Krzyzewski, who needed convincing he should hire Bender to his
staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't just hire him, I wanted to make sure he really wanted
it,'' Krzyzewski said. ``Kind of like what you put a player
through.''
</P>
<P>
   There was an interview, and a second one and a third one. Bender
and Krzyzewski had played some occasional tennis, and Krzyzewski,
the deathless competitor, didn't think Bender fought him hard
enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``I shouldn't beat you,'' Krzyzewski told Bender. ``But I beat
you all the time.'' Eventually, Bender won over Krzyzewski. He
proved a valuable link from the principals of the Foster regime to
the ascendant Krzyzewski era.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a real people person,'' Krzyzewski said. ``As a result,
the acceptance level was big with the former players. I didn't know
that would happen, but it did.''
</P>
<P>
   It was about that time that Bender, in Charlotte with friends at
the grand opening of a condominium/shopping complex, ran into Alice
Hunter, a former coed at Duke. He called her and said they would
all be going to dinner that night, and wouldn't it be a great
business opportunity to see these Duke grads?
</P>
<P>
   ``I had that little angle,'' Bender said sheepishly. ``She wound
up coming to meet us, and we had a great time.''
</P>
<P>
   She eventually moved to Washington, D.C., returned to Duke for
an advanced degree, and they dated.
</P>
<P>
   Then one night, he got up from dinner at a Greek restaurant in
Durham and phoned her father in St. Petersburg, Fla. Moments later,
on a spring evening with the dogwoods in bloom on the Gothic-style
Duke campus, Bender asked Alice Hunter if she would marry him.
</P>
<P>
   She accepted, and quickly, he was off to take the head coaching
job at Illinois State.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not luck,'' insists Kevin Billerman, the coach at Florida
Atlantic and Bender's best friend. ``He held out a long time,
looking for the right woman. He wasn't ever going to go through a
divorce.''
</P>
<P>
   It is as difficult to find someone saying anything bad about
Bender as it is these days to find players who wear short
basketball pants. Somehow, he manages to bite his tongue when he
most wants to lash out.
</P>
<P>
   Early in his Washington tenure, he lost a standout local
recruit, Michael Dickerson, to Arizona. A year later, his staff
earned a verbal commitment from another Seattle plum, Jason Terry _
and then Terry backpedaled and went to Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got to remember my past,'' Bender says. ``I had to make a
change. My gosh, how could I point a finger and say, `That's not
right?' You know what, he's a good example of what more kids need
to be able to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's won a national championship, so it's the right decision
overall. And he waited his turn.''
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, in one of his frequent conversations with Billerman,
Bender learned that Florida Atlantic had been stunned by the death
of one of its players.
</P>
<P>
   ``He called me every day for three weeks,'' Billerman said. ``He
investigated other coaches who had had someone die, and had them
call me.''
</P>
<P>
   There are those times when his parents are visiting, and
somebody will want a little chunk of Bender's time. ``The damn
phone never stops ringing,'' said his father. ``People are asking
him to do things. He doesn't have his palm out, he just goes and
goes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope his kids get to know him. I went through that, and it
was only on the high school level. And I really didn't get to watch
my three kids grow up.''
</P>
<P>
   More than one coach with an agreeable personality has found
himself out of a job for lack of discipline. But Bender tempers his
sunny side with a serious competitive streak.
</P>
<P>
   ``At Illinois State, we used to play two-on-two at lunch,''
Giacoletti said. ``Whether it was racquetball or basketball, he
hated to lose. And he wasn't going to lose.''
</P>
<P>
   What's down the road for Bob Bender? A higher-profile school
where an NCAA championship is more realistic? Does he have interest
in the NBA?
</P>
<P>
   ``None at all,'' he says. ``I couldn't coach 82 games.
Twenty-seven is draining.''
</P>
<P>
   Bender loves Seattle, a place just dispassionate enough about
Husky basketball that he and Alice can go out to places like Wild
Ginger and not be swarmed. At home, he has an infant son, and when
his 3-year-old daughter Mary Elizabeth wants to play Ariel from
Disney's The Little Mermaid, he has to be Prince Eric.
</P>
<P>
   ``His daughter,'' says Alice Bender, ``thinks he hung the
moon.''
</P>
<P>
   Bender's idyll is to spend the last years of his career at a
little school where nobody comes to interview him and he doesn't
have to speak at booster clubs or spend summer days watching
recruits at shoe-sponsored camps.
</P>
<P>
   His father scoffs at the idea. But Billerman says, ``I believe
it's something Bobby will do when he's 55 years old.''
</P>
<P>
   One place Bender apparently won't be is the University of Texas,
which courted him hard last spring before he removed his name.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I were an outsider looking in, would that be a statement I
plan on being here a long time?'' Bender asks. ``Yeah.''
</P>
<P>
   Mixing with Texas officials and major boosters, he was asked the
question: ``What do you want to do with your career?''
</P>
<P>
   Bender stopped them with this: ``I just want to be a good
person.''
</P>
<P>
   The Longhorn faithful looked at each other. They made another
hire. So _ for who knows how long _ Washington is left with Bob
Bender, merely a good person.

   Nostalgia is always big at the holidays. As the millennium
approaches, some children's books are casting an especially long
backward glance at where we've come in past centuries. What better
time to take stock?
</P>
<P>
   You'll find a couple of such titles on our list of holiday
children's books, along with others whose appeal is, well,
timeless. From good-natured silliness to sober historical
perspective, there's something for nearly everyone.
</P>
<P>
   Read on!
</P>
<P>
   PICTURE BOOKS
</P>
<P>
   _ ``The Christmas Crocodile,'' by Bonny Becker, illustrated by
David Small (Simon &AMP; Schuster, $16). Ages 4-8.
</P>
<P>
   The Christmas Crocodile doesn't mean to be bad, not really. He
just shows up under the tree on Christmas Eve with a lovely red bow
(which he eats), then innocently wreaks havoc on a twittery
Victorian family. Only a Grinch could resist this delightful romp _
written, incidentally, by a Seattle author. Comically overwrought
pictures add to the fun.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``No, David!'' by David Shannon (Blue Sky Press, $14.95). Ages
3-6.
</P>
<P>
   If this book captures the Zen of childhood mischief, it's
because Shannon was only 5, growing up in Spokane, when he wrote
the prototype. (He now lives in Los Angeles.) Here, the
fiendish-looking David tracks in mud, bangs a pot, yells, plays
with his food, even runs naked down the street as his harried
mother yells, ``No, David!'' Rest easy: It ends with childish tears
of remorse, a warm embrace and the reassuring words, ``Yes, David
... I love you!'' Recently named a New York Times Best Illustrated
Children's Book.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``To Everything There is a Season: Verses from Ecclesiastes,''
by Leo and Diane Dillon (Blue Sky Press, $15.95). All ages.
</P>
<P>
   The Dillons' artistic range is simply astounding. Here, in 16
elegant color spreads, these two-time Caldecott Medalists convey
the universality of life, death, joy and sorrow. Their artwork
draws inspiration from Egyptian murals, classical Greek vases,
medieval woodcuts, Thai shadow plays and other cultural sources _
creating the illusion that 16 distinct artists put this book
together. An afterword explains each picture's historical source.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Turn of the Century,'' by Ellen Jackson, illustrated by Jan
Davey Ellis (Charlesbridge Publishing, $17.95). Ages 5-9.
</P>
<P>
   Our kids have heard of Y2K, but what does a millennium mean?
This book takes us back 1,000 years, showing century by century how
an ordinary English or Colonial child might have lived. Jewel-toned
illustrations _ with decorative borders and cozy, happy-looking
children _ bathe this history in a rich, warm glow.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``My Nine Lives,'' by Clio (aka Marjorie Priceman) (Atheneum,
$16). Ages 6-adult.
</P>
<P>
   Clio the cat's remarkable nine lives, spanning 5,000 years, are
detailed in a scribbled, pen-and-ink journal her owner finds under
a couch. Unheralded, this feline appears to have named the
constellations, invented the sundial, sailed with Leif Eriksson and
made the Mona Lisa smile. Cleverly tongue in cheek, the ``journal''
includes an afterword that sets the historical record straight.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Look-Alikes,'' by Joan Steiner, photography by Thomas
Lindley (Little, Brown, $12.95). All ages.
</P>
<P>
   You'll be astounded at the clever little world Steiner has
created from everyday objects such as ticket stubs, cheese graters
and coin purses. In crisp photo spreads that resemble the ``I Spy''
books, Steiner has fashioned a whole village with fool-the-eye
details. Look closely: That bentwood soda-parlor chair is really a
pretzel, the hotel lamp a salt shaker and the vacuum cleaner a
razor. The book's 11 collages incorporate more than 1,000 amusing
look-alikes.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``The Disappearing Alphabet,'' by Richard Wilbur, illustrated
by David Diaz (Harcourt Brace, $16). All ages.
</P>
<P>
   Wordsmiths young and old will enjoy this witty ABC book by a
two-time Pulitzer Prize winner and former poet laureate. Droll
couplets lead us to reflect that without the letter A, cows would
be reduced to eating Hy. And if B were absent from Bat and Ball,
``there'd be no big or little leagues At All.'' Diaz's bold
computer graphics add a nice crispness, but in this linguistic
frolic, a word is worth a thousand pictures.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Squids Will be Squids,'' by Jon Scieszka and Lane Smith
(Viking/Peguin, $17.99). Ages 49-630 (in dog years).
</P>
<P>
   This duo, a sort of Dave Barry of the children's book world,
turn their demented humor to the ancient wisdom of fables. Through
parables such as ``Slug's Big Moment'' and ``Piece of Toast and
Froot Loops,'' we absorb valuable moral lessons, such as ``It takes
one to know one'' and ``He who smelt it dealt it.'' If you loved
``The Stinky Cheese Man,'' this one's for you.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Snowflake Bentley,'' by Jacqueline Briggs Martin,
illustrated by Mary Azarian (Houghton Mifflin, $16). Ages 4-8.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone knows that no two snowflakes are alike. For that we can
thank a self-taught Vermont scientist named Wilson Bentley, who
perfected a microphotography technique that captured snow crystals'
fragile beauty. There's a moral _ maybe an eccentric one, but still
a moral _ in this story of Bentley's lifelong obsession and his
dogged attempts to photograph thousands of individual snowflakes.
Azarian's richly colored woodcuts are irresistibly warm and
nostalgic.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``The Christmas Story,'' according to the Gospels of Matthew
and Luke, paintings by Gennady Spirin (Henry Holt, $19.95). All
ages.
</P>
<P>
   Spirin, who was born in Moscow on Christmas in 1948, brings his
classical training and Orthodox perspective to the story of Jesus'
birth, creating a book for the family to share year after year.
Aglow with traditional winged angels, haloed Madonna and sumptuous
borders, it is an elegant accompaniment to the Christmas story of
the King James Bible.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Tibet: Through the Red Box,'' by Peter Sis (Farrar Strauss
Giroux, $25). Ages 8-adult.
</P>
<P>
   Sis' father, a Czech filmmaker, was sent to Tibet in the 1950s
to film construction of the highway that opened Tibet to China. He
wandered, lost, for months, and experienced incredible mysteries
before meeting with the Boy-God-King in the forbidden city of
Lhasa. Sis, who heard the tale as a child, captures its dreamlike
quality with a scene-shifting mix of diary passages and present-day
narration. It's a book to savor slowly, filled with spidery script,
narrative asides and intricate, metaphorical artwork.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Circle Dogs,'' by Kevin Henkes, illustrated by Dan Yaccarino
(Greenwillow, $15). Ages 2-4.
</P>
<P>
   In the big square house live two circle dogs who run and sniff
and play until it's time to sleep. This account of their day reads
like one of Margaret Wise Brown's ``here-and-now'' stories _
simple, ``in the moment'' and full of sensory detail. Clink-clank,
clink-clank. Hear their tags? The two circle dogs wake up.
Flip-flap, flip-flap, swish, swoosh, swish, their tails wave.
Yaccarino's bold, stylized illustrations add a retro feel.
</P>
<P>
   CHAPTER BOOKS
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Soldier's Heart,'' by Gary Paulson (Delacorte, 106 pages,
$15.95). Ages 12-up.
</P>
<P>
   This dark, slender volume tells how 15-year-old Charley Goddard
comes to understand war, one battle at a time, after enlisting in
the Union Army in 1861. Always the master craftsman, Paulsen lays
out the bleak, shattering quality of war with cool fury. Though he
takes some literary license, the story is largely true.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,'' by J.K. Rowling,
illustrations by Mary Grandr &UR; gfacute &LR; e (Scholastic, 309 pages,
$16.95). Ages 9-13.
</P>
<P>
   Harry spends a miserable 11 years with wicked relatives of the
Raold Dahl variety before finding reprieve _ and his destiny _ at a
boarding school for witches and wizards. Rowling's much-heralded
debut novel spares no detail in creating a magical world of owl
messengers, invisibility cloaks, three-headed guard dogs and
broomstick acrobatics. Some of it gets a little precious and
threatens to bog down the action, but the story is highly
imaginative and offers plenty of old-fashioned, escapist fun.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Count Karlstein,'' by Philip Pullman (Knopf, 243 pages, $17)
and ``Clockwork,'' by Philip Pullman, illustrated by Leonid Gore
(Scholastic, 112 pages, $14.95). Both ages 9-13.
</P>
<P>
   Until Pullman coughs up the final installment in his ``Dark
Materials'' trilogy, we must content ourselves with these lesser
but rewarding works. ``Count Karlstein,'' a slapstick ``thriller''
first published in Britain in 1982, is jolly good fun, with
fiendish villains and bumbling heroes crossing paths in a mountain
village. ``Clockwork,'' a new effort, is a chilling novella about
an apprentice clockmaker who sells his soul and a hapless writer
who begins a story without knowing how it will end. As polished and
finely balanced as a Swiss timepiece, it reads like a cross between
James Thurber and Hans Christian Andersen.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``No Pretty Pictures: A Child of War,'' by Anita Lobel
(Greenwillow, 193 pages, $16). Ages 12-up.
</P>
<P>
   Lobel, a painter and children's book illustrator, was only 5
when she fled the Nazis with her brother and their Catholic nanny.
After years on the run, the children were captured at a Polish
convent and sent to Auschwitz and other camps. With powerful
simplicity, Lobel describes the terror and, finally, the numbness
of their struggle to survive, and their attempt to reclaim their
childhood in Sweden after the war. Illustrated with family photos,
this poignant memoir is a 1998 National Book Award finalist for
Young People's Literature.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``The Key to the Indian,'' by Lynne Reid Banks, illustrated by
James Watling (Avon Camelot, 228 pages,$16). Ages 10-up.
</P>
<P>
   In this fifth and final installment of the ``Indian in the
Cupboard'' series, Omri and his father travel back 200 years to
help Little Bear save his Mohawk people from white raiders and
prepare for an uncertain future. There's a sad and serious
undercurrent to this fantasy adventure as Omri confronts the dark
legacy of injustice created by his ancestors.
</P>
<P>
   OTHER
</P>
<P>
   _ ``The 20th Century Children's Book Treasury,'' selected by
Janet Schulman (Knopf, 308 pages, $40). All ages.
</P>
<P>
   This marvelous collection is chock-full of favorites, from
classics such as ``The Story of Babar'' to recent gems such as
``Stellaluna'' and ``The Tub People.'' Most are unabridged, though
the artwork, by necessity, is compressed. Taken individually, most
of the stories are more charming in their original, stand-alone
format. But the scope of this book is breathtaking and the
selections are right-on. Includes reading-level guidelines and
brief author bios.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``The New Way Things Work,'' by David Macaulay with Neil
Ardley (Houghton-Mifflin, 400 pages, $35). All ages.
</P>
<P>
   This updated version of the 1988 best seller features more than
80 pages of new material, including the workings of a computer
mouse, CDs, digital cameras and other electronic wizardry. Like the
original, this illustrated reference book explains the principles
behind everyday machines, from the block and tackle to the zipper,
and highlights amazing commonalities. (Betcha didn't know the
dentist's drill works on the same principle as early windmills.)
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Narnia: Complete Single Volume,'' by C.S. Lewis, illustrated
by Pauline Baynes. (HarperCollins, 524 pages, $50). Ages 8-up.
</P>
<P>
   Comprehensiveness is a mixed blessing. Heavy and cumbersome,
this fat book has vast gray plains of fine print, making it hard to
read. But, with hand-colored illustrations and bookmark, it's a
handsome gift book that delivers the seven-volume series at a
bargain price.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Stephen Biesty's Incredible Body,'' by Stephen Biesty,
written by Richard Platt (DK, $19.95, 32 pages). Ages 8-up.
</P>
<P>
   Biesty and Platt, whose books have sold 3 million copies
worldwide, take readers on a detailed journey through Biesty's
body, with cross-sections of eye, brain, heart and other innards.
Think of it as ``The Magic School Bus'' for grown-ups.

 &HT;    NAACP REJUVENATES ITS FINANCES AND FERVOR
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The NAACP, which sank into a financial and
scandal-laden morass that threatened its very existence four years
ago, is reclaiming its place as the nation's premier civil rights
organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're back. We're rested. We were always tan,'' quipped Julian
Bond, the veteran civil rights organizer who became chairman of the
National Association for the Advancement of Colored People last
February.
</P>
<P>
   Not only has the NAACP erased a once-staggering debt that
decimated staff and programs, but the 89-year-old organization has
reinvigorated its commitment to oppose hatred, racial polarization
and discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   The NAACP claims some credit for the large black voter turnout
that helped the Democratic Party narrow the GOP congressional
majority in this month's elections. And while it failed to defeat
an anti-affirmative action initiative in Washington state, the
NAACP is prepared to ``make this fight anywhere else,'' said Bond.
</P>
<P>
   ``The NAACP has reclaimed its rightful place as the voice of
people of color and others who believe in the power and the premise
that all persons are, in fact, created equal,'' said Kweisi Mfume
(pronounced Kwah-EE-see Oom-FOO-may), the former Maryland
congressman who became the NAACP's president and CEO in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, since Mfume's arrival two years ago, the NAACP has
replaced its debt with a $2.1 million surplus, rebuilt the staff at
its national headquarters in Baltimore, shaken up the staid
leadership in some of its 2,200 branches, expanded its worldwide
membership to 600,000 and established dozens of new youth and
college chapters.
</P>
<P>
   Since Bond's arrival last February, the NAACP has returned to
the fray of politics and nonviolent protests with renewed fervor
and, perhaps most important, has begun establishing ties with
organizations representing Hispanics, the soon-to-be-largest ethnic
group in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tools we used to combat white supremacy before _
organization, mobilization, coalition, litigation _ are the tools
we'll use to fight white supremacy today,'' said Bond, who helped
organize the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) in
the early 1960s. ``We're going to do the old things better.''
</P>
<P>
   This back-to-the-future strategy was evident in a recent
collaboration of Bond and Raul Yzaguirre, president of the National
Council of La Raza, the nation's largest Hispanic organization, in
attacking proposals to privatize Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   It also has been apparent in Mfume-led marches to protest the
Supreme Court's lack of minority clerks and in the NAACP programs
that rate the responsiveness of various industries to minority
customers.
</P>
<P>
   And in the wake of President Clinton's race initiative, which
tried to educate white Americans to the nature of ``white
privilege'' in the country, the NAACP is actively recruiting whites
to join its ranks , as it once did in the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many whites have thought they couldn't join,'' said Bond.
``Others have made the American assumption _ that solving racial
problems is a task for black Americans, the victims, and not
whites, the perpetrators.''
</P>
<P>
   Bond credits his predecessor, Myrlie Evers-Williams, for the
NAACP's renaissance. ``She restored integrity and honesty,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The widow of slain civil rights leader Medgar Evers took over
the chairmanship at the height of scandal and immediately began
crisscrossing the nation to convince disenchanted donors to resume
their contributions. Almost single-handedly, she erased half of the
organization's nearly $3 million debt.
</P>
<P>
   The NAACP had been rocked two years earlier when its board fired
then-executive director Benjamin Chavis for unauthorized use of
NAACP funds to settle a sexual harassment suit. Within six months
of Chavis's firing, several board members filed suit against
then-chairman William Gibson, alleging he had misused $1.4 million
in NAACP funds.
</P>
<P>
   Evers-Williams reluctantly ran against Gibson in early 1995. In
a bruising campaign that tugged at the seams of the NAACP, she won
by a margin of one vote. She then recruited Mfume, a rising
Democratic star in Congress, to take over the daily operation of
the organization.
</P>
<P>
   Mfume, in addition to helping Evers-Williams tackle the debt,
has made bridging the generation gap in the African American
community one of his top priorities, opening the NAACP to black
youths who had come to view the organization as aged and
irrelevant.
</P>
<P>
   At its October board meeting, the NAACP granted charters to
seven new youth chapters, pushing the nationwide total over 350.
</P>
<P>
   ``Failing to develop roles and responsibilities for our young
people now will certainly ensure our failure later,'' said Mfume.

MASTERS ANCHOR LATEST SELECTION OF PHOTOGRAPHY BOOKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAUL JOSEPH BROWN  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Photography's relationship with the art world has always been
dysfunctional, an arranged marriage of difficult individuals.
</P>
<P>
   Our selections of the season's most compelling photography books
are anchored by two of the still young medium's few acknowledged
masters, Jacques Henri Lartigue and Henri Cartier-Bresson, both of
whom spent long periods of their artistic lives retreating from
great photographic acclaim into unacclaimed painting.
</P>
<P>
   They also include a great painter (Edgar Degas) who was an
accomplished photographer, an inspiring photojournalist (W. Eugene
Smith) who wanted his work to be seen as art, and a surrealist
painter (Man Ray) who adapted the techniques of photography to his
varied artistic impulses.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Jacques Henri Lartigue, Photographer'' by Vicki Goldberg
(Bulfinch, 288 pages, $95).
</P>
<P>
   In 1902, Jacques Henri Lartigue began making photographs with a
camera he thought God had given him because it made him so happy.
He confidently turned the camera towards the bourgeois French world
that comfortably surrounded him.
</P>
<P>
   He photographed his nanny waiting patiently for a huge ball to
return to Earth, his cat in midleap for its ball and a family
friend name Rico Broadbent being outrun by his valet. The
photographs are elegantly composed and absolutely joyful. The
photographer was 6.
</P>
<P>
   Later he would be enticed by the fanciful, fragile contraptions
that began to fill the streets and skies of the new century;
outrageously hatted and strutting corsetted silhouettes captured
along Paris' Bois de Boulogne and biplanes, gliders, kites,
balloons and cars of all sorts, the faster the better, career
across Lartigue's plane of focus.
</P>
<P>
   Lartigue's photographs define the belle epoque, a time separated
from our own by much more than a century.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``W. Eugene Smith. Photographs 1934-1975'' (Abrams, 352 pages,
$75).
</P>
<P>
   The greatest challenge to the documentary photographer is not
access to difficult subjects. Anything and anyone can be
photographed. A photographer who can't get access should try a more
amenable subject, weddings, for example.
</P>
<P>
   The point of documentary work, the reason photographers risk
their lives and often accept poverty in the pursuit, is to make
photographs that need to be seen. Unfortunately, writers, not
photographers, edit magazines and run publishing houses.
</P>
<P>
   W. Eugene Smith was tenacious in making the photographs and
hellbent on seeing them properly published. He fought often and
hard with his editors at Life over the publication of his landmark
photographic essays, a form he pioneered and mastered, inspiring
generations of obsessive photojournalists.
</P>
<P>
   This extensive monograph includes the classic Life essays,
Smith's stunning, unpublished documentary of Pittsburgh and his
most penetrating work exposing the tragedy of mercury poisoning in
Minamata, Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Smith died in 1978 at the age of 59 with $18 in the bank.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Tete-a-Tete: Portraits by Henri Cartier-Bresson'' (Bulfinch,
144 pages, $65).``A Propos de Paris,''  &UR; cf58 &LR;  by Henri
Cartier-Bresson  &UR; cf58 &LR; (Bulfinch, 167 pages, $55).``Henri
Cartier-Bresson Europeans'' (Bulfinch, 231 pages, $60).
</P>
<P>
   At 90, Henri Cartier-Bresson is a contemporary of the Leica, the
precise instrument he has wandered the globe with capturing the
lyrical, poetic images that have earned him his reputation as
perhaps the century's foremost photographer.
</P>
<P>
   HCB, in annoying Gallic fashion, is famously dismissive ...
``About photography I know nothing.'' HCB knows everything, what
little there is to know, about photography. He simply knows, no,
feels, how to fill his viewfinder and when to open the shutter.
</P>
<P>
   Cartier-Bresson's photographs are composed rather than taken.
``I weave around the subject like the referee in a boxing match,''
he has written. His photographs celebrate the medium.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tete-a-Tete,'' a collection of Cartier-Bresson's portraits,
opens with a selection of his pencil drawings, which reveals one of
the century's true masters with a camera to be somewhat less
sophisticated with a pencil, the medium he has professed to prefer.
The photographs that follow are classics, the subjects elegantly
composed in their surroundings, the moment chosen to reveal the
subject through gesture, mood and light. Great photographic
portraits represent a successful dance between subject and
photographer. Cartier-Bresson was quite a dancer, partnering Jung,
Picasso and Matisse as well as William Faulkner, Che Guevara and
Martin Luther King Jr.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Propos de Paris'' is a collection of Cartier-Bresson's
favorite photographs of his home, a loving portrait of the City of
Light. In France, where photographers and philosophers are granted
celebrity status, Cartier-Bresson is a living treasure. This book
returns the compliment.
</P>
<P>
   In yet another entirely successful re-editing of
Cartier-Bresson's work from the 1920s to the 1970s, when he largely
gave up photography for painting, ``Europeans'' presents a gorgeous
portrait of a particularly European identity that predates the Euro
by decades. Polish and Irish and Italian priests, French and
Italian and Romanian farmers all inhabit different physical
landscapes. But framed by Cartier-Bresson's eloquent and
compassionate eye, absolutely tuned to gesture, sensitive to humor
and juxtaposition, these different nationalities reflect a common
European soul.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Passion and Line,'' photographs by Howard Shatz (Graphis,
224 pages, $50). ``Pool Light,'' photographs by Howard Shatz
(Graphis, 250 pages, $75).
</P>
<P>
   Dance is one of the photographer's most formidable challenges.
The standard photographic variables of moment, composition and
light become infinitely complex when multiplied by movement. In the
hands of a master such as Howard Shatz, dance photography can be a
startling transcendence of an immobile, two-dimensional medium.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Passion and Line,'' Shatz's command of his medium is equal
to his subject, many of the best dancers in America, gorgeously
lit, their movement captured at its peak expression.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Pool Light,'' photographer and subject trade the familiar
studio for a body temperature, strobe-lit pool, freeing the dancers
from gravity, their greatest restraint. The water, balanced to the
pH of human tears, becomes the medium upon which the photographic
compositions are executed to astonishing, dreamy effect.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``No Ordinary Land. Encounters in a Changing Environment''
photography by Virginia Beahan and Laura McPhee (Aperture, 108
pages, $35).
</P>
<P>
   Photographers tend to be solitary practitioners. The best light
comes early and late, the gear is heavy, the hours long, and the
pay typically meager.
</P>
<P>
   Beahan and McPhee have pursued a rare collaboration, dividing
the tasks and sharing the infrequent rewards, photographing
together the complex ways in which man interacts with the
landscapes in which we live. They share an eye for the paradoxes
inherent in the social landscape, where water is sometimes holy and
sometimes a resource for irrigating crops.
</P>
<P>
   Their large-format color images are at once finite and
dreamlike. In Iceland, children play in an opalescent hot springs
created by runoff from a geothermal plant. In Hawaii, a mother
cradles her infant on a red sand beach as a blue tide swirls at her
feet.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Shaking the Dust of Ages'' photographs and commentary by
Ljalja Kuznetsova (Aperture, 160 pages, $45).
</P>
<P>
   The globalization of our economy has overtaken the slim market
for documentary photography with publication of Kazakhstani
photographer Ljalja Kuznetsova's poignant collection of images of
gypsies and wanderers of the Central Asian Steppe.
</P>
<P>
   The Roma, like other indigenous cultures in the former Soviet
Union, subsisted in the benign shadow of Communist authority. When
the Soviet Union imploded, throwing off improbable independent
states like Kazakhstan, foreign investors and development followed,
putting new pressure on the Roma's nomadic ways. ``Shaking the Dust
of Ages'' is a poetic document of a marginal people in a little
known region.
</P>
<P>
   Other notable releases: `Margaret Bourke-White' (Bulfinch, $65);
``Man Ray: Photography Inside Out,''(Gingo, $65); ``Simple
Secrets,'' photographs by Walker Evans (Abrams, $25); ``State of

CHIC GOES SIMPLER IN BOOKS ON STYLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SUSAN PHINNEY  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Flea markets, fashion runways and Hollywood stars from the '30s
and '40s are just some of the factors defining style as this
century wanes.
</P>
<P>
   For the past few years, publishers have been keen on quilting,
faux painting and dressing-to-match-your-personality books. This
year, judging from dozens of offerings, how to dress and live more
simply are hot topics.
</P>
<P>
   From biographies to architecture, here are some of the most
fascinating, thought-provoking books to hit the Lifestyle desk in
1998:
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Chanel: Her Style and Her Life'' by Janet Wallach
(Doubleday, 180 pages, $35).
</P>
<P>
   In the fickle, fast-moving world of fashion, it's amazing for a
woman who has been dead since 1971 to still be a fashion force.
Gabrielle (known as Coco) Chanel championed simplicity _ little
black dresses, the sleeveless shell under a suit jacket.
</P>
<P>
   Inspired by the navy pants and striped sweaters worn by sailors
on a friend's yacht, she created classic casuals. Soft jersey suits
and deep pockets are other Chanel-isms.
</P>
<P>
   Wallach's lavishly illustrated book chronicles Chanel's rich and
famous lovers, her late-in-life comeback and the saga of her
perfume, Chanel No. 5.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Shabby Chic'' by Rachel Ashwell (Regan Books, 211 pages,
$30).
</P>
<P>
   This treasure hunting and decorating show-and-tell guide teaches
you how to shop flea markets (take a tape measure and collapsible
shopping cart), antique malls and secondhand sales.
</P>
<P>
   It gives recipes for reviving wicker, removing rust and mending
flea market apparel. Color photos show how beautifully fabrics,
dinnerware and fashions can be recycled.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``The Not So Big House'' by Sarah Susanka (Taunton, 200 pages,
$30).
</P>
<P>
   Subtitled ``a blueprint for the way we really live,'' this book
offers alternatives to the ``starter castles'' that have been
covering suburban America since the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Susanka, a Minneapolis architect, prefers quality over quantity,
a home with details that accommodate the occupants _ not just vast,
unwelcoming spaces. Her open floor plans and light-filled homes
make sense for Pacific Northwest lifestyles and an era of high
building costs.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``The Power of Glamour'' by Annette Tapert (Crown, 256 pages,
$40).
</P>
<P>
   Madonna and Nicole Kidman may be Hollywood fashion icons today,
but they're ing &UR; gfacute &LR; enues compared to Joan Crawford, Norma
Shearer and Carole Lombard _ stars who dressed like stars and
influenced millions.
</P>
<P>
   When Crawford wore a ruffled gown in a 1932 movie, Macy's
promptly sold 500,000 copies. When Crawford had accessories dyed to
match, same-color shoes and handbags became de rigueur.
</P>
<P>
   How these stars developed their personal, influential styles _
from Crawford's padded shoulders to Katharine Hepburn's passion for
pants (she hated garter belts) _ this is a gossipy good read.
</P>

   _ ``Men of Color'' by Lloyd Boston (Artisan, 256 pages, $35).
</P>
<P>
   African-American men have long used fashion as a means of
self-expression. From zoot suits and hats to oversized jeans, from
Nat King Cole and Quincy Jones to Jesse Jackson and Denzel
Washington, this book documents the effect black men have had on
fashion.

<P>
   They understand non-verbal communication and what dressing with
attitude is all about.
</P>
<P>
   This book also is filled with practical tips. Menswear designer
Jeffrey Banks, for example, gets four pages on the selection,
construction, fit and other considerations when buying pants.
Cuffs, fabrics, care and maintenance are included.

   Although 11 writers are acknowledged at the end of this tome, it
relies more on photographs than text. The entry for the late Edith
Head, legendary Hollywood costume designer, contains just a few
sentences about the sarong she created for Dorothy Lamour and her
clothes for Elizabeth Taylor. The rest of the page is an
illustration of Taylor in a white chiffon dress. In tiny print at
the bottom are the years of Head's birth and death.
</P>
<P>
   It's a reference book that's long on style, short on substance,
but very picturesque.

TROLLEY ACCIDENTS COST SAN FRANCISCO THOUSANDS IN SETTLEMENTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CHUCK FINNIE  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ When a trolley's power pole broke free and
smashed into the head of a pedestrian on a Market Street sidewalk
Saturday afternoon, it was portrayed as a freak accident. It
wasn't.
</P>
<P>
   At least four times in the past two years, including twice this
month, the city approved $242,000 in cash settlements with
pedestrians and owners of cars hit by poles, wires and falling
debris from its electrified buses, city records show.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Gescheidt, 40, of Noe Valley, remained in critical
condition Wednesday at San Francisco General Hospital after being
hit by a pole that came loose from a trolley Saturday afternoon.
The pole connects the bus to the overhead electrical wires that
power the bus.
</P>
<P>
   ``The number of incidents is way out of line, and we need an
explanation _ and fast,'' said Supervisor Tom Ammiano, who oversees
lawsuit settlements by the city.
</P>
<P>
   Even before Saturday's accident, Ammiano said he was concerned
enough that he had called a Municipal Railway representative into a
closed-door legislative session to discuss one of the settlements.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, he told me they sometimes miss the maintenance,''
Ammiano said.
</P>
<P>
   David Stumpo, the Municipal Railway chief operating officer,
said the transit agency has a vigilant program to keep the trolleys
safe and running, including monitoring and replacing parts
regularly.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do a tremendous job, not to have more instances like
this,'' Stumpo said, noting that the trolley fleet is checked
daily. Moreover, each trolley gets a thorough inspection every
2,000 miles.
</P>
<P>
   However, he added, the poles and the mechanisms securing them to
the trolley and the overhead power wires experience considerable
stress on the street and can fail.
</P>
<P>
   City Attorney Louise Renne's office produced a list of recently
settled cases arising from trolley pole and related failures,
events Municipal Railway officials have said rarely resulted in
injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has happened,'' said Alan Siegel, a Municipal Railway
spokesman, ``but not very often.''
</P>
<P>
   Stumpo conceded the nature of the mechanics of the trolley and
the city's elaborate transit electrification system posed risks to
pedestrians and motorists.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anytime you are walking nearby, you need to be aware,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   One safety precaution that may be in order, Stumpo said, is to
install protective roofing over transit islands where riders are
particularly exposed.
</P>
<P>
   A leading San Francisco plaintiffs lawyer who has sued the
Municipal Railway said the agency had responsibility to take steps
before now. She said the track record of accidents meant San
Francisco could be hit hard as a result of its latest trolley
accident.
</P>
<P>
   ``A city that is on notice about this kind of deficiency ... has
a duty to protect people and correct the problem,'' said Mary
Alexander, a past president of the Consumer Attorneys of
California.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's incident occurred just before 1 p.m. when Gescheidt
was walking alone along Market Street. The power pole came loose at
the base from a trolley and hit him in the back of the head.
</P>
<P>
   He never saw it coming, said his brother, Jack Gescheidt.
</P>
<P>
   ``My brother has a one-inch hole in his skull as a result of the
injury,'' Jack Gescheidt said, adding that the biggest danger now
was brain swelling and infection.
</P>
<P>
   A woman walking behind Gescheidt came to his rescue.
</P>
<P>
   ``She waded into a pool of blood and held her hand over his
wound, stroking his forehead until help arrived,'' Jack Gescheidt
said.

UNINSTALLER PROGRAMS CAN EASE FILE CLEANUP 
</HEADLINE>
  (gm) 
 By J.D. BIERSDORFER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. What do commercial uninstall programs do that I can't do by
myself?
</P>
<P>
   A. Although Windows 95 and 98 include an Add/Remove Programs
utility, many users believe that this function doesn't quite clear
out all the remains of uninstalled applications. Unneeded temporary
files, outdated or unused fonts, DLL's (dynamic-link library
files), old shortcuts and duplicate files can be left behind,
taking up hard drive space and cluttering your system. The fear of
deleting a file that seems to be a leftover but is actually needed
by the system frightens many users into leaving it where it is.
</P>
<P>
   There are many programs that offer to do the dirty work for you.
Uninstall programs claim to remove applications and all their
supporting files safely and thoroughly, saving the user the trouble
of rooting around on the hard disk to track down and delete the old
parts.
</P>
<P>
   Cybermedia's Uninstaller software does this by examining all the
files on your computer, then making a database of what files go
with what programs. When it's time to get rid of a program,
Uninstaller can track down all the associated files and delete
them. Quarterdeck's Clean Sweep is another popular program in this
category. Perhaps because no software is infallible, both
applications offer backup options in case a file needed by another
program is accidentally uninstalled. Macintosh users wanting a
similar utility program might try Aladdin System's Spring Cleaning
software.

NURSING AN EARLY TASTE FOR CELEBRITY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: La., Texas, Mo.)   (Eds: Please note subslug for HOSPITAL-NURSERIES)  
 (af)  
 By BARBARA WHITAKER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Shortly after the birth of Chris Shows' first child in a Monroe,
La., hospital earlier this month, he got a call from his brother in
Austin, Texas. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen her,'' Shows recalled him saying. And, although
William Shows couldn't pick the baby up, ``He ran right out and got
a print out.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With relatives scattered from Texas to the Air Force Academy in
Colorado to an off-shore oil rig in the Gulf of Mexico, Chris and
Cherie Shows had no qualms about letting a picture of their infant
daughter, Courteney Annmarie, be put on line at the ``virtual
nursery'' set up by the St. Francis Medical Center in Monroe.
Within hours of her birth, there she was, eyes still closed, pink
and fresh, as, well, a newborn baby.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While anyone with a digital camera (or a standard photograph and
scanner), a moderate amount of web knowledge and the wherewithal to
see it through could put their own newborns on line for all to see,
hospitals are making easier by giving new parents the option of
posting their babies' photographs within hours of birth. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The birth of a baby is probably the only health care delivery
service that people look forward to,'' said Bob Hammack, director
of marketing at St. Francis (www.stfran.com). ``People want to
share it.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And share it they have, going as far as giving birth live on the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Still, putting infants on line raises questions about protecting
the privacy of families, and safeguarding the security of
hospitals. To get around such issues, most hospitals that put
babies on line do not use their last names. And some try to time
the posting of the picture with the release of mother and baby. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We've never had any problems whatsoever,'' said Sandra Nalley,
a marketing specialist who helped develop the St. Francis online
nursery.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Ms. Nalley was pregnant when she started the project,
and her baby was the first to be placed in the hospital's virtual
nursery. ``There's no way for somebody to put together a name and
address,'' she said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On a few occasions, she said, when a baby identification
bracelet could be seen in a picture, the hospital used software
allowing it to blur that part of the picture. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   To many hospital, offering the ``virtual nursery'' shots is just
a natural extension of the basic photo packages that have long been
available to parents. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The birth of a child is a very important time to forge a
relationship,'' said Richard Slack, vice president of corporate
planning and marketing with Unity Health, which began offering the
online photo service about four months ago at its St. John's Mercy
Medical Center in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   The relationship to which Slack was referring was that between
hospital and patient _ or, more to the point, future patients.
</P>
<P>
   While Unity is weighing whether to begin charging for the photo
service, it sees the virtual nursery primarily as an opportunity to
build relations with new mothers and their families, a hotly sought
after segment of the medical market.
</P>
<P>
   Properly tended, those relationships will grow for years, Slack
said. He noted that many new mothers say they selected a certain
hospital or physician because their mother had used the same one.
So offering the online photos, he said, simply made sense.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had both parents and our obstetricians telling us they
thought this would be a great thing to do,'' Stack said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Relatives are often eager to see a newborn, but time constraints
and distance often make this difficult. Now, as Hammock put it,
``You've literally eliminated mileage and time.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Some people are in more of a hurry than others.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had somebody yesterday, they had not even bathed the baby
and they wanted that baby on the Internet,'' Ms. Nalley said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At St. John's Mercy Medical Center, it generally takes about two
days before a newborn's photo is up on the website
(www.unity-health.org). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Typically, the baby's picture is posted on the web just about
the time of discharge,'' Slack said. ``We're more comfortable
knowing that the baby is not at a location. If they knew it was in
the hospital, that's just another risk.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Although hospitals often post such details as birth weight time
of arrival and special messages, the babies' identities are
generally protected by using first and middle names, with only a
initial for the last name. Only the first names of the parents are
used. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Some hospitals, as well as websites specializing in birth
announcements, required pass codes to enter their nurseries. But
Slack said that when parents at St. John's were surveyed about such
measures, most said they did not feel they necessary. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At St. John's, where the service has been available about 4
months, about 25 percent to 30 percent of the parents are using it.
The service is provided through First Foto, one of the largest
companies in the country taking photos of newborns in hospitals. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While the typical package of traditional photos runs about $35
to $40, most hospitals are not yet charging parents to put their
baby in virtual nurseries, said Jim Grabowski, vice president of
infant photo marketing for First Foto, which is owned by HASCO
International in the St. Louis area. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a fresh frontier,'' said Hammack. ``From a marketing
standpoint, it offers opportunities to look at how you can bond
with the public, how you can inform the public. I think really the
only limitations people have is their imagination.''

MAYFLOWER HISTORY WEB SITE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Texas, Ore.)   (af)  
 By MICHAEL POLLAK   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Everyone knows about the Mayflower. A group of Puritans were
headed for Virginia but steered badly off course and landed far to
the north. After dispossessing the Indians, they began an annual
celebration of Thanksgiving, dressed in their strict buckles and
all-black.
</P>
<P>
   According to Caleb Johnson, just about the only truth in that
paragraph is the name of the ship. Johnson, 22, who graduated last
summer from Texas Tech University, said he created the Mayflower
Web Pages (members.aol.com/calebj/mayflower.html) to fill a need
for an authoritative online source.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been to just about all the
Pilgrim-Mayflower-Thanksgiving sites on the Internet,'' Johnson
wrote by e-mail. His conclusion: ``They are generally full of
errors.'' One of his pages, ``Message to Teachers,'' refutes much
of the information in a contemporary school lesson plan, as well as
offers suggestions for further online study.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he has done his homework,'' James W. Baker, senior
historian at the Plimoth Plantation Museum, said of Johnson. Baker
also said he agreed with Johnson about the lesson plan: ``Boy is it
sloppy. It's got all sorts of made-up facts.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, who lives in Portland, Ore., recommends the Web pages
of the Plimoth Plantation Museum (www.plimoth.org), the Pilgrim
Hall Museum (www.pilgrimhall.org) and the John Alden House
(www.alden.org). As for his own Mayflower site, besides pages on
the domestic life of the Pilgrims, the Mayflower itself and its
crew, it includes such documents as the Mayflower Compact, the
peace treaty with Massasoit, chief of the Wampanoag confederation,
books and letters written by the Pilgrims and contemporary accounts
of them.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's pages grew out of his high-school interest in
genealogy. ``I was involved in an America Online `Mayflower
descendants' message board at the time,'' he said, ``which was
constantly getting such basic questions as, `Was my ancestor John
Doe on the Mayflower?' '' Johnson, a descendant himself, created an
online Mayflower passenger list and built it up weekly, adding
historical sidelights and texts.
</P>
<P>
   The current pages go way beyond the expected genealogy and
``First Thanksgiving'' pages. Take, for example, ``Pilgrim Criminal
Records.'' (Edward Doty: dueling, breach of contract, slander,
assault, theft; John Billington: hanged in 1630 for murder, among
others.)
</P>
<P>
   Individual Mayflower pages, some linked from the Plimoth
Plantation site, take intriguing directions: Pilgrim and Wampanoag
clothing, religious beliefs, weapons of the Pilgrims, a biography
of the Patuxet Indian Tisquantum, games played by Pilgrim children
and more.
</P>
<P>
   The genealogy section includes guidance on tracing one's own
Mayflower lineage. Johson doesn't answer questions himself but his
pages provide links to the General Society of Mayflower
Descendants, several other genealogy organizations and
professionals, and public records.
</P>
<P>
   He has pages on ``Common Mayflower Genealogy Hoaxes,'' e-mail
addresses of known Mayflower descendants and a list of presidential
ancestries. (He lists seven presidents and three first ladies as
Mayflower descendants, but only one vice president who did not
later become President: Dan Quayle.)
</P>
<P>
   About those myths. For the record, Johnson says the Mayflower
Pilgrims were Separatists, not Puritans. (They all stemmed from
Calvinist roots, but there were some distinctions, Baker said in
agreement, adding that the early Puritans considered the Pilgrim
Separatists more extreme.)
</P>
<P>
   The Pilgrims did not wear buckles and did wear colorful
clothing. ``From the probate inventories of Plymouth Colony,''
Johnson writes, ``we learn that Gov. William Bradford had a green
gown, violet cloak, lead-colored suit with silver buttons and a red
waistcoat. Elder William Brewster had green drawers, a red cap, a
violet coat, and a blue suit.''
</P>
<P>
   Plymouth, called Patuxet by the Indians, was open because the
Patuxet tribe had been wiped out by a plague before the Mayflower
arrived _ except perhaps for one member, Tisquantum, or Squanto.
``In fact,'' Johnson writes, ``it appears Massasoit liked the idea
of having Englishmen neighbors and allies because it increased his
own power within the region by keeping his enemies at bay.''
</P>
<P>
   And there is no record that the Pilgrims' ever repeated their
first Thanksgiving, he writes. Baker adds that the Pilgrims'
three-day harvest festival was not a typical religious ceremony;
nor did the Pilgrims themselves call it Thanksgiving. ``I think
he's fairly accurately hit at some popular misconceptions,'' Baker
said of Johnson's Mayflower pages.
</P>
<P>
   Nuggets of information lie in the wills and estate inventories
of Mayflower passengers. One wonders what Susannah and Mary Soule
did to cause their father, George Soule, to leave them 12 pence
apiece but leave land to all his other children.

   Getting there: Most airline connections to Cayenne, French
Guiana's capital, are via Miami and either Martinique or Guadeloupe
in the French West Indies. A travel agent can discuss options.
Buses operate between Cayenne and Kourou; a ferry connects Kourou
with le Royale (Royal Island), largest of the Devil's Islands. The
boat ride takes about one hour. Organized tours are available but
can be expensive; ask a travel agent for details. (Lonely Planet
recommends contacting Takari Tours in Cayenne at 31-1969 or Carbet
des Iles in Kourou at 32-0995.)
</P>
<P>
   When to go: Carnival season _ usually in February _ is festive.
But the most comfortable time to visit is between July and
December, when a dry climate prevails. Spring can be quite rainy.
</P>
<P>
   Documents: American visitors need a valid passport; a visa is
not required for stays up to 90 days.

<P>
   Here is the recipe I followed last Thanksgiving, when it was my
turn to cook the turkey: After ordering a freshly killed bird that
weighed slightly more than a Chevy Geo, I phoned my husband at
work. In the course of a completely innocuous conversation, I may
have casually reminded him that the last fowl I roasted (in 1989)
had turned out slightly dry, not unlike sand. So once again, my
husband cooked the turkey. I highly recommend this method.
</P>
<P>
   This year, my husband informed me that after nine years, he was
too wily to fall for the same trick, so I devised an even easier
recipe: go to a friend's house for dinner.
</P>
<P>
   I was at peace with this decision until last week, when an
e-mail message from my brother announced plans to come to town the
day after Thanksgiving to begin, as he charmingly described it,
``scarfing down tons of your leftovers.'' That prompted inevitable
fantasies of some of the homey dishes I most like to cook _
tetrazzinis, curries, soups. The only problem? Each required, as a
main ingredient, the picked-over remains of a ravaged turkey. And
since everyone knows that the only (legal) way to gain possession
of a valuable carcass is to roast your own bird, I was backed into
a corner.
</P>
<P>
   So I needed a recipe of a wholly different nature, a set of
foolproof instructions for cooking turkey. What I really needed, of
course, was to consult my grandmother. Aided by her enviable
technique, dozens of perfect turkeys emerged triumphantly from a
Depression-era oven whose finicky pilot light had to be ignited
with a match.
</P>
<P>
   But my grandmother died in 1980, so I turned instead to the
Internet for help, even as part of me wondered whether it was
absurd to expect new technology to provide the old-fashioned,
Norman Rockwell-flavored comfort I sought. Was I betraying the
memory of my grandmother stirring gravy with a low-resolution
wooden spoon?
</P>
<P>
   Luckily, before I could get really worked up, I was seduced by
more than a dozen tantalizing recipes that I found on
food.epicurious.com and www.cooking.com. I flirted with various
possibilities: creating a ``maple-brined wood-smoked grilled
turkey,'' or invoking the herb rub, or even soaking my trussed
victim in a salted-water bath.
</P>
<P>
   So much choice _ that was my problem. I had found a cacophony of
competing advice. If I had had all the time in the world, I would
have loved to prepare a dozen test turkeys, refining a final recipe
from the best aspects of each technique. But with only a few days
before my brother's threatened arrival, I needed consensus. I
needed advice as unequivocal as the instructions on my
grandmother's recipes for devil's food cake or short-rib soup. I
needed, in short, a virtual grandmother, a turkey sim.
</P>
<P>
   I ended up at www.butterball.com instead. In my experience on
line, most search-engine queries garner responses that seem
semi-useful, or kind of informative or some other frustrating shade
of gray.
</P>
<P>
   The Butterball people, however, provide answers that are
unquestionably black-and-white: roast all turkeys in an open pan.
Always rub the skin with oil, not butter. Cook until the internal
temperature of the thigh reaches 180 degrees Fahrenheit. While that
should have been a relief to me, a lot of the suggestions ran
counter to the most basic turkey truths I have always embraced.
</P>
<P>
   So, joining the ranks of more than 1,600 other hesitant chefs
who sent e-mail to the Butterball experts in the past year, I
typed: ``Could I use butter? Is there any reason not to use
butter?'' Within two hours, I received an answer: ``Oil or
shortening is preferred to butter or margarine because butter and
margarine contain milk solids that can burn as the turkey roasts.''
It sounded reasonable _ even if the e-mail went on to push a $3.50
turkey-cooking video. I ignored that part.
</P>
<P>
   In rapid-fire succession, I sent other questions: Would the
recipe work on a non-Butterball bird? Does Butterball sell any
all-natural birds? In what part of the thigh should I stick the
meat thermometer? I received answers (yes, yes, thickest), each in
less than 12 hours and each recommending the purchase of the
instructional video.
</P>
<P>
   Even my grandmother could not have sounded more sure of herself.
I printed out Butterball's instructions, went downstairs to the
kitchen and got to work. Three hours after the turkey went into the
oven, I pulled it out. It tasted ... dry. Not unlike plaster.
</P>
<P>
   Had technology let me down? At first, I thought so, because when
I go on line, I have high expectations. On the surface, I might be
in search of a turkey recipe. But deep down, I am looking for a
transformative experience.
</P>
<P>
   It reminds me of the time when I was a little girl and found a
yellowed copy of a 1930s science fiction novel in my grandmother's
basement. On the cover was an imagined city where people curiously
clad in bubble helmets traveled on free-floating escalators to
onion-shaped towers. The specifics of the scene weren't important;
the promise was.
</P>
<P>
   But again and again, the Internet reminds me that it is instead
just another tool in the arsenal I use to navigate my everyday
life. It can't solve my turkey problems single-handedly.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the Internet no longer seems an intimidating,
unknown destination. It makes some commonplace tasks slightly
easier. I would rather exchange e-mail at my leisure with
Butterball's turkey experts than risk being put on hold on the
company's toll-free telephone help line, for instance.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, when I went back on line to look for a new
tetrazzini recipe, the quest felt no more or less ordinary than
flipping through a file of my grandmother's old recipes. I
realized, as I wrapped the carcass for the freezer, that there was
a comfort to that.

<TEXT>
<P>
   The hurried scribbles on miserly scraps of notebook paper are
treasures, passed from hand to grimy hand at school bus stops,
soccer practice and sleepovers. To the uninitiated their contents
are unintelligible: ``C-left, c-right, repeated four times during
game play,'' goes one making the rounds lately. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But to young game players, these hieroglyphics are prized codes,
sometimes known as cheats, that unlock hidden secrets in the
Byzantine digital world of computer and video games. Cheats can
make onscreen characters invincible (the so-called ``God mode''),
arm players with unlimited ammunition and allow entry into
concealed bonus levels or unexpected scenes.
</P>
<P>
   Some codes are just goofy _ letting a player drive a race car
upside down, for example, or giving a basketball player a big head.
</P>
<P>
   The buried treasures the codes unearth are intentionally hidden
in the games, an historical sideshow that has now become part of
the main event of game play. The scramble by game aficionados to be
first to crack the cheats of a newly released game is an
exhilarating undercurrent that helps propel retail video-game
sales, expected to reach a record $6.3 billion this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``People want to win,'' explained Al Amaloo, of Munster, Ind., a
code-cracker for the search engine miningco.com. ``They don't want
to admit their $49.95 purchase got the best of them.''
</P>
<P>
   In the cheat above, the commands _ ``C-left, C-right'' and so on
_ refer to buttons on the control panel for a Nintendo 64 game. The
player pushes the buttons in the sequence described, and the hidden
feature is revealed.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, the keystrokes are supposed enable a fish-eye view
of the game Glover. Cheats on other games require a similar
manipulation of the controls. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Cheats were originally created purely for the internal use of
game companies. They were intended as back doors allowing
programmers to skip through the games' increasingly difficult
levels when testing for software bugs. Players normally cannot
progress from one game level to the next without achieving a series
of goals.
</P>
<P>
   Now, an entire subculture exists around these
games-within-games. And a host of hidden codes has been created by
game manufacturers expressly to assist frustrated, impatient or
just plain indolent players.
</P>
<P>
   They are a godsend to neophytes and the parents of young players
reduced to tears by the layer upon layer of variables in the latest
games. Cheat areas are among the more popular portions of Internet
game sites, both those run by the manufacturers and those created
by the players.
</P>
<P>
   Among the better-known sites are: www.gamesdomain.com and
www.avault.com. But many suggestions posted by visitors turn out to
be wrong. So some sites employ code-crackers to seek out and
authenticate cheats.
</P>
<P>
   Some companies have turned to the public interest in hidden
codes as a way of making money. At one pay-per-clue site run by
Pinnacle Infotainment Inc., (www.progame.com/hotline.htm), players
can buy a pre-paid phone card to get online help and access to an
archive of 1,000 cheat codes. Or they can dial a ``900'' number.
The cost ranges between 89 cents and $1.49 a minute.
</P>
<P>
   Magazines like the 116-page Tips &AMP; Tricks, and publishers such
as Prima Publishing, both of Los Angeles, specialize in issuing
manuals devoted to the subculture. Often, they work in
collaboration with the game industry, so that the publications are
timed to coincide with game release dates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cheats are a bonus,'' Amaloo said. ``Like getting an uncut
movie. You're getting extra entertainment from your purchase.''
</P>
<P>
   Among game developers there is disagreement over whether the
proliferation of the secret codes spoils a game or increases its
longevity. It is a question of increasing importance as the
demographics of the market shift.
</P>
<P>
   The primary age of video game players in the U.S. used to be
between six and fourteen. Now, with the growing popularity of
advanced video games like Sony's Playstation and Nintendo 64, the
age of the average player has gone up.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   No one knows how older players will feel about the culture of
code-breaking that has grown around many games. As a result,
Nintendo is attempting a nuanced shift. Instead of rewarding
players with hidden tricks for simply having learned what the
cheats are, Nintendo now ties perks to performance.
</P>
<P>
   In Goldeneye, Nintendo's hugely successful spy game released
last year, cheat codes embedded in every level must be earned by
players who want to activate hidden features like the ability to
change a character's appearance or abilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Its a powerful distinction,'' said Ken Lobb, Goldeneye's
producer. ``Instead of the traditional cheat _ `I'm stuck. I don't
want to die.' _ going out and acquiring the codes is the game
within the game.
</P>
<P>
   In another Nintendo 64 name, Banjo-Kazooie, which is published
by Rareware Ltd. of England, the cheat code was purposely made
complex so it would go undetected by game players, Amaloo said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some codes spoil a game; there's no sense of accomplishment,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   While finding cheats may be a condoned among console game
players, a very different kind of cheat has been finding its way
into online computer games. Instead of simply exploiting existing
back doors, gamers are hacking into the game code and creating
their own cheats.
</P>
<P>
   Sites that host games forced to install filters on their servers
to disconnect players that have hacked into the game code,
modifying characters and functions with cheats.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gamers want to have an edge, said Laura Miele, vice president
of marketing for Westwood Studios Inc., a Las Vegas game maker
behind titles like Red Alert and Command and Conquer. ``It's an `I
got you' mentality of one-up-manship. We believe its detrimental to
the game.''
</P>
<P>
   While Westwood's programmers assist hint-guide publishers, the
company does not intentionally build cheat codes into its games.
The company makes it's stand on legal grounds, not moral ones.
``It's a matter of copyright protection from potential
knock-offs,'' Ms. Miele said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Blizzard Entertainment Inc. of Irvine, Calif, has learned the
hard way that cheats sometimes used in online games can be bad for
business. Recently, Blizzard had to contend with a backlash from
angry customers who quit playing its CD-rom game Diablo on line
after some players figured out how to rewrite code to increase
their characters' powers. Blizzard scurried to fix the software by
issuing online patches, and had to take potential cheats into
account before designing the sequel, Amaloo said.
</P>
<P>
   At Pinnacle Infotainment, of Encinitas, Calif., the main
business is selling replacement game instructions to independent
video-game retailers. But Pinnacle owner Earl Beutler begun
exploring the cheat-sales niche when he stumbled upon his
12-year-old son, Bryce, using trial-and-error to figure out how to
play borrowed games.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Bryce, in addition to filling his after-school time with
tennis and karate, is putting in a few hours each week on the
Pinnacle payroll. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   His job is to troll for code gossip on Internet game sites, in
chat rooms, in messages left by Usenet visitors and among his
friends. He tests his finds on rented games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Codes are increasing in complexity,'' Bryce said. ``They now
include allowing players to add UFOs and (to) reverse directions.''
</P>
<P>
   Bryce is one of a handful of game-players Pinnacle employs to
provide its content. Said Don A. Grammer, Pinnacles general
manager: ``Kids are really the best source.'' &QL;

   THURSDAY GAMES
</P>
<P>
   Steelers (7-4) at Lions (4-7)
</P>
<P>
   Comment: The perception of Steelers quarterback Kordell Stewart:
He is not a pocket passer and has a hard time reading defenses.
Hogwash. The reality: In his last four games Stewart has completed
72 percent of his passes and owns a 100.5 quarterback rating. He
struggled early in the season, but recently Stewart has played
well, partly because the coaching staff has opened up the offense
and he is allowed to create on the run if nothing is open. The
Steelers are feeling extremely confident after beating up
Jacksonville last week; the only reason the Lions will make it a
game is running back Barry Sanders. He will get 150 on the ground
alone.
</P>
<P>
   Steelers, 24-15
</P>
<P>
   Vikings (10-1) at Cowboys (8-3)
</P>
<P>
   Comment: Put down the turkey and sink your teeth into this game,
which could be one of the best of the season. The only thing that
puts a damper on it is that Vikings wide receiver Jake Reed is out
with back problems, putting a dent in the great receiving trifecta
of Reed, Cris Carter and Randy Moss. That just means that Moss,
instead of 150 receiving yards, could get 300. Cowboys' cornerback
Deion Sanders, a future Hall of Famer, is listed as questionable
with a toe injury, but if he plays, he would almost certainly be
matched up on Moss. How's that for a battle? The game will be won,
though, in the trenches. Tampa Bay gave the rest of the league the
game plan on how to beat Minnesota: get ahead early, and pound the
ball inside against a smallish defensive line. Dallas has a huge
offensive line and running back Emmitt Smith has averaged 97.3
yards rushing in eight Thanksgiving Day contests. But that just
means that Dallas keeps things close. Nothing can really stop this
Minnesota offense _ not a short week or Reed on the sideline.
</P>
<P>
   Vikings, 30-24.

WILD TURKEYS MAKE STORE-BOUGHT VERSIONS TASTE LIKE NOTHING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ERIC BRAZIL  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ While the carcasses of their dim-witted domestic
cousins repose _ stuffed and delicious _ on millions of American
tables as the centerpiece of Thanksgiving dinner, wily and wary
wild turkeys are flourishing throughout California.
</P>
<P>
   Theirs is one of the great environmental success stories of the
20th century _ a species rescued from the brink of extinction.
</P>
<P>
   In California, the wild turkey population was too small to
bother counting just 30 years ago. Today there are 100,000 of the
tall, long-striding birds, maybe more. They roost in 57 of the
state's 58 counties (all but urban San Francisco) and can be
legally hunted, spring and fall. And, despite their image, they are
not dumb.
</P>
<P>
   Wild turkeys are ``very stealthy, crafty and sharp,'' said Billy
Ogden, print production manager at Charles Schwab &AMP; Co. and
president of the Golden Gate Gobblers chapter of the National Wild
Turkey Federation.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've got extraordinary eyesight and hearing,'' and even
when Ogden was wearing full camouflage, ``I've had 'em spook away
when they saw my eyelids blinking,'' he said, acknowledging that he
has yet to bag his Thanksgiving turkey during the fall season,
which ends Nov. 29.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, the sport of hunting turkey is what saved the bird
from extinction. The plentiful birds at the harvest feast shared by
Pilgrims and Wampanoag Indians in 1621 had disappeared from 18 of
the 39 states in their historical range by the early 1930s. Habitat
destruction, along with meat hunting, had reduced their numbers to
about 30,000 nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   American hunters decided not to lose the traditional bird as
game. So, in 1973, they founded the National Wild Turkey
Federation, a 180,000-member organization which does for turkeys
what Ducks Unlimited does for ducks.
</P>
<P>
   Federation volunteers have given state and federal wildlife
agencies more than 100,000 wild turkey transport boxes and helped
relocate more than 145,000 wild turkeys nationwide. Federation's
Wild Turkey Super Fund has assisted with nearly 8,200 state and
national projects with expenditures of nearly $84 million.
</P>
<P>
   The effort was hugely successful in California, where the
federation pays half the salary of the state Fish and Game
Department's wild turkey coordinator. After all, wild turkeys are
not indigenous to California. They were introduced here in 1877,
transplanted wild stock captured in the Southwest and the eastern
slope of the Rocky Mountains. Now they are everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   That may please committed turkey hunters like Bob Moore, owner
of Broadway Bait, Rod and Gun in Sacramento.
</P>
<P>
   ``They fly quicker than quail,'' he said. ``They're a very
sporty bird, not easy to kill. You've gotta be patient.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, in an unthreatening environment they
domesticate so easily that they often encroach on new rural
suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   Too darn easily, as far as Emily Libarle is concerned.
</P>
<P>
   Six months ago, several wild toms began roosting in a
100-foot-tall pine tree near Libarle's house in the Sonoma County
town of Cotati. She's had no peace since then.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're awful!'' she said. ``They fly! The males roost in my
pine tree. They make the biggest mess I've ever seen. They fight
and they make all kinds of noise and wake us up at 5 a.m.,''
Libarle said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're not afraid of anything. They were fighting in one of
my flowerbeds, and I took a broom and started chasing them and it
didn't bother them _ they just kept on fighting.''
</P>
<P>
   Libarle is contemplating drastic action to end her turkey
torment. ``The pine tree is dead. I'm going to cut it down, so they
won't have a place to park,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Except for rubbing some humans the wrong way, wild turkeys
``have never been shown to interfere with anything else'' and have
had no adverse effect on California ecosystems, said Charlie Ryan
of El Dorado, regional director of the National Wild Turkey
Federation, which has 35 chapters in the state.
</P>
<P>
   They're a worry anyhow, said Emily Roberson, senior land
management analyst for the California Native Plant Society. ``We
know they're eating a lot of different things out there, but we
don't know their impact on native or rare plants or critters,'' she
said. ``They're eating something to be so successful here.''
</P>
<P>
   Wild turkeys can live to the age of five _ if they can avoid
predators like bobcats, foxes, raccoons, coyotes, skunks, hawks and
eagles. Hens lay as many as 17 eggs at a time. Toms reach a weight
of 25 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Hunters who have eaten wild turkey swear by its rich, non-gamey
flavor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Compared to it, a store bought turkey tastes like a
chalkball,'' Moore said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's delicious, the flavor is incredible; compared to it
domestic turkey is like eating cardboard,'' said Ryan, a country
boy who prefers to fillet the breast meat in strips, soak it in
buttermilk, flour it and fry it like chicken.
</P>
<P>
   No one claims first dibs on turkey drumsticks, though. They are,
ahem, athletic, just like the wild birds. Tough and stringy.

 By EDWARD R. LIPINSKI    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   A recent survey of homeowners found that there are more than 35
million fireplaces in homes throughout the United States, and that
each year homeowners light more than one billion fires in those
fireplaces.
</P>
<P>
   These statistics are not surprising; just picture the cozy
comfort of a crackling fire in the living room fireplace on a cold
winter night. But while fireplaces may be romantic, they are not
efficient. Ninety percent of the heat created in the fireplace
escapes up the chimney. The fire also pulls additional air, 5 to 10
times the amount required for combustion, from the room.
</P>
<P>
   Can anything be done to improve the efficiency of the average
home fireplace? One possibility is to add inserts that, in effect
convert the fireplace into a stove. Wood-burning inserts fit in the
fireplace and use the existing chimney (fitted with a flexible
metal liner) to exhaust smoke and combustion gases. They have
faceplates with metal or glass doors that fit across the fireplace
opening to enclose the fire. The heart of the unit is a heat
exchanger that pulls in cool air from the room, warms it, then
blows it back. Controls allow the user to adjust the level of air
going directly into the firebox and regulate the intensity of the
fire.
</P>
<P>
   Another type of insert is an enclosed, gas-fired unit. It is
completely sealed, so fresh air for the fire is drawn in through a
chimney tube while combustion gases are expelled through a parallel
tube. It also has a heat exchanger to circulate warm air into the
living room. This unit does not burn wood; the fire comes from
ignited natural gas that burns around artificial logs.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the inserts are efficient as heating units, they do
detract from the charm of the fireplace. In addition, these
modifications can be expensive and may not be worth the cost and
bother if you only use the fireplace occasionally.
</P>
<P>
   In that case, there are still some things that you can do to
make your fireplace a little more efficient.
</P>
<P>
   Adding glass doors to the face of the fireplace can help
conserve room heat at night after the fire has died down. The doors
should be kept open when the fire is burning; otherwise they will
prevent heat from radiating into the room.
</P>
<P>
   Whenever possible burn hot, blazing fires, not low, smoldering
ones. Hot fires burn the wood gases more completely and heat the
fireplace bricks so they reflect more heat into the room. Most
people have a raised grate in their fireplace. The old-fashioned
andirons are better because they allow the burning logs to fall
onto the hot bed of coals and burn more efficiently.
</P>
<P>
   Be sure to inspect and clean the fireplace and chimney every
year. Ideally this should be done in the spring, so if you discover
damage, like cracked flue tiles, there will be plenty of time for
repair work. Look into the chimney again in the fall to make sure
that squirrels or birds haven't made a nest there; installing a
chimney cap is a good way of preventing unwanted intruders from
nesting in the flue.
</P>
<P>
   Also take the time to carefully inspect the damper, the hinged
metal plate that swings down to close the flue opening. Dampers in
new fireplaces are made to fit carefully when closed so they keep
cold air coming down the chimney from entering the house. Over
time, a damper may rust and deteriorate so it no longer makes an
effective barrier against the cold air. A defective damper should
be replaced. Also consider installing a chimney-top damper. It will
help to cut heat loss when you are not using your fireplace.
</P>
<P>
   When you are ready to make a fire, start with a bed of four or
five crumbled newspaper balls. Lay finger-thick kindling in a grid
pattern on top of these. The fire will need oxygen as it burns so
keep the newspaper and kindling layers loose so air can circulate.
Finally, place three logs across the andirons. It may be tempting
to start with only one log and add others as each is burned, but a
full fire with three logs burns more efficiently producing more
heat per log.
</P>
<P>
   Before starting the fire, make sure the damper is fully open,
then heat the air in the flue to create a stronger draft. To heat
the chimney air, hold a burning torch made of rolled up newspaper
directly under the damper for a few seconds. Use the torch to light
the newspaper bed below the logs. Once the fire is roaring, close
the damper as far as it will go without restricting the flow of
smoke up the chimney.

 &HT;    Method Man, the hard core rapper from Wu-Tang Clan, shows his
soft side?

   &QR;  RAP
</P>
<P>
   ``Tical 2000: Judgement Day''
</P>
<P>
   Method Man. Def Jam. 27 tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: A-
</P>
<P>
   The rapper who ``came to bring the pain hard core to your
brain'' on his 1994 solo debut now has his sights on your soul. So,
from a safe distance, watch the self-described Ticallion Stallion
of the influential Wu-Tang Clan make apocalyptic ``Torture'' sound
funky. Another Method Man persona, Iron Lung steps up next, blowing
lyrical daggers and sense over a kazoo (``Suspect Chin Music''), a
piano plink (``Dooney Boy'') and a horn section blast (``Party
Crasher''). Finally, the guy women fell in love with on the 1995
summer song ``You're All I Need'' emerges on ``Break Ups to Make
Ups,'' an engaging, gritty glimpse of the heart of a hip-hop man.
All these characters are in two words, Method Man, the force behind
this multidimensional revelation.

   ``Live on Two Legs''

<P>
   Pearl Jam. Epic. 16 tracks.

   Grade: A-
</P>
<P>
   The irony of Pearl Jam's long hiatus from touring was that the
moody Seattle band is one of rock's great live acts, a fact
reflected in how extensively its concerts are bootlegged. ``Live on
Two Legs,'' which comes fast on the heels of Pearl Jam's
late-summer tour, is official evidence. The material plays to the
group's strengths, emphasizing frontman Eddie Vedder's nascent
flair for folkie introspections, and movingly so. Tunes such as
``Off He Goes'' and ``Given to Fly'' apply the lessons of Neil
Young, R.E.M. and Led Zeppelin in ways that suggest the rock
tradition still has a spark or two left to strike. Meanwhile, the
shreiking garage-rock blowout of ``Evolution'' proves that Vedder
still has what it takes to go ape.
</P>
<P>
   ``Moon Pix''
</P>
<P>
   Cat Power. Matador. 11 tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: A
</P>
<P>
   Prodigal Atlanta songwriter and indie-rock sweetheart Chan
Marshall (a.k.a. Cat Power) makes the grandest gesture out of
seemingly compulsive understatement. Her songs can make you feel as
if you've intruded on a private moment, and the naked, emotional
undertow makes it hard to slip back through the door. Her third
full-length album is also her best, recorded with members of
Australian punk-folk outfit the Dirty Three. Strumming guitar or
accompanying herself on piano, the vocalist is haunting; the spare,
minimalist setting heightens the intimacy and limns everything in a
kind of plaintive mystery (think of Neil Young and ``After the Gold
Rush''). Deep down, songs like ``Colors and the Kids'' and ``Cross
Bones Style'' cast their spells in the unvarnished language of
old-time spirituals.

 &HT;    Deutermann's only option? To enjoy all the thrills
 &HT;    By Don O'Briant
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   P.T. Deutermann has adjusted well to life on dry land after 26
years at sea. Since moving to Baldwin County in Middle Georgia six
years ago, the retired Navy captain has found a new career as a
successful novelist.
</P>
<P>
   His first novel, ``Scorpion in the Sea,'' sold to TriStar
Pictures for $250,000, and his third novel, ``Official Privilege,''
has been optioned to Roland Joffe, who directed ``The Killing
Fields.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The screenplay is finished for `Official Privilege,' '' says
Deutermann, 57. ``Now we're just waiting.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, he's not waiting idly. Deutermann's fifth novel, ``Zero
Option'' (St. Martin's, $25.95), a thriller set in Atlanta, hits
stores this month. The novel is a complex tale of murder and a
scheme to sell military surplus from Fort Gillem on the black
market. Unfortunately, one of the surplus items is a cylinder of
Wet Eye, a hazardous biological weapon.
</P>
<P>
   When Criminal Investigative Service agent David Stafford is sent
to investigate, he hits a dead end until he is befriended by a
Georgia mountain woman and her psychic daughter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try to put things in my books that people might care
about,'' Deutermann says. ``If you talk about a disaster on the
moon, who cares? But if you talk about committing murder, or losing
a deadly chemical weapon in Atlanta, people care.''
</P>
<P>
   Deutermann admits he has taken some logistical liberties with
his plot. ``The Army's control system is a lot tighter than I
describe it in the book. They keep track of every weapon with
serial numbers.''
</P>
<P>
   But black market activity is common, especially in wartime, he
says. ``In Vietnam, for example, you had South Vietnamese employees
driving forklifts in the Saigon warehouses. It was quite easy for
whole crates to disappear.''
</P>
<P>
   For the psychic character in the novel, Deutermann talked to
police and to psychics. ``I take the paranormal with a grain of
salt, but some cops said they would use psychics when they were
stumped. They said if the psychics say a 6-foot Scandinavian did
it, then they'll go look for a 6-foot Scandinavian. I don't know
how they do it, but the real ones can.''
</P>
<P>
   Deutermann says he's gradually moving from matters military to
mainstream fiction, with the help of his wife. ``Her general
comment is that women appreciate people books _ novels with
relationships between characters about whom you care. When she
reads my stuff, if she can't sympathize with all the characters,
even the bad guys, then I'll go back and rework it.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  WAR STORY: Talk about great timing. E. Randall Floyd's novel
``Deep in the Heart'' (Harbor House, $24.95), has caught the wave
of interest in the Civil War sparked by Charles Frazier's ``Cold
Mountain.'' Floyd's tale of a 19-year-old Civil War soldier has
sold nearly 50,000 copies since publication in late August.
</P>
<P>
   The novel is based on the true story of Wiley Nesmith, a soldier
from Wilkinson County who wrote dozens of letters to his wife
during the war. During his three years in most of the major battles
of the war, Nesmith's six brothers were killed.
</P>
<P>
   Floyd first saw the letters a dozen years ago, when Nesmith's
descendants contacted him about writing a book while he was
teaching at Georgia Southern College. Floyd told them he was too
busy at the time, but after reading the letters, he realized they
could be the basis of a deeply passionate story.
</P>
<P>
   ``The letters weren't eloquent in the usual sense,'' says Floyd,
who now lives in Augusta. ``He was just a young dirt farmer with
little education. But he wrote with such conviction and passion. He
did not like the war; all he wanted to do was do his duty and go
home to his wife.''
</P>
<P>
   Floyd originally intended to do the book as a narrative,
scholarly work, but he soon decided he would get a wider audience
if he turned it into a novel.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously his instincts were right. Floyd has been offered
paperback deals from major publishers and is negotiating film
rights. One of the people interested is Lee Murray, who produced
``Stolen Women'' for CBS television.
</P>
<P>
   Like ``Cold Mountain'' and other novels about the war, Floyd
believes ``Deep in the Heart'' has struck a chord because there was
never closure.
</P>
<P>
   ``The war never ended the way it was supposed to, especially
after Lincoln was assassinated. The idea of the Lost Cause will
never go away.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  PHANTOM REVISITED: Frederick Forsyth (``The Day of the
Jackal'') usually writes novels about assassins and war, but now
the British author has written a book about the Phantom of the
Opera. Sold to New Millennium Entertainment and scheduled for
spring publication, ``The Phantom in Manhattan'' takes the star of
the Andrew Lloyd Webber musical to New York.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  KUDOS: University of Georgia Press author Susan Millar
Williams is the 1998 recipient of the Julia Cherry Spruill
Publication Prize for her book, ``A Devil and a Good Woman, Too:
The Lives of Julia Peterkin.'' The prize is awarded annually by the
Southern Association for Women Historians.
</P>
<P>
   The book is the first full-scale biography of the Pulitzer
Prize-winning South Carolina author and plantation mistress.
Williams lives in McClellanville, S.C.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: E-mail to Gates: I feel your pain
 &HT;    (Resending to fix garble.)
 &HT;    By Stebbins Jefferson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Each morning when I read the newspaper, I look to the comics for
a bit of humor to jump-start my day. One day this week, however, I
found the best laugh in the Business section. There, I learned that
Bill Gates, the nation's richest man, has a lot in common with the
average computer dummy.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Gates is fighting an antitrust case. Like the rest of us,
he's finding out that e-mail is an unforgiving convenience.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department and 20 states are suing Mr. Gates'
company, Microsoft. They claim that to eliminate competition in the
computer software business, Microsoft embedded Internet browser
software into each Windows operating system. Microsoft's
competitor, Netscape, needs to sell its browser for the company to
grow.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, Mr. Gates is accused of trying to create an
illegal monopoly to force out competitors. He denies it. Though
Netscape may have been hurt, he says, he's just trying to improve
his product and better serve consumers.
</P>
<P>
   The case seems to hinge on intent, not consequences. That's
where Mr. Gates' own electronic words _ he writes more than 100
e-mails a day _ could reveal more than he wants the court to know.
</P>
<P>
   In January 1996, for example, he messaged top aides that
``winning Internet browser market share is a very, very important
goal.'' When asked in court what he meant by that statement, he
said he couldn't remember. In fact, the Harvard dropout who hired
Harvard graduates and made them all millionaires has trouble
answering any questions related to e-mail. He can't remember what
he was thinking when he wrote the memo or what his words meant.
Alas, he can't even remember writing on that subject at all.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, I can identify with a multibillionaire. I know well
that feeling of total amnesia about past e-mail. I must confess I
have often stood at the juncture where the extraordinary brain of
Bill Gates meshes with the ordinary minds of millions of Americans
who have discovered with much anxiety that e-mail sent is e-mail
forgotten. None of us would want to explain our e-mail in a court
under oath.
</P>
<P>
   I am barely computer-semiliterate, but I did manage to use the
e-mail system of a couple of places where I've worked. At first,
being able to send colleagues messages without fear of being
overheard on a phone was a delightful perk. No longer was it
necessary to meet a friend by the water cooler or wait until we
could go to lunch to vent job frustrations. All I had to do was
type out my critical (and brilliant) judgments and zap them into
cyberspace. If the discussion was about workplace politics, I was
discreet enough to hit the ``delete'' key after such an exchange.
Some things are private. Or so I thought.
</P>
<P>
   One day, however, I lost some important information and thought
I must have inadvertently deleted it from the computer system. Not
to worry, the computer technician told me. He found the missing
information within the hour.
</P>
<P>
   I was elated. Then panic set in. Could somewhere in the bowels
of the system be all the messages I had ever e-mailed? What, or
whom, had I written about? I had visions of a drone sealed in the
woodwork perpetually monitoring all e-mail. Would he understand
that I had no conscious intent to do harm? I don't think so, but,
then, I can't remember what I've written.
</P>
<P>
   Once, I was so incensed by a boss' directive that after a
conference with him, I went back to my office fuming. Needing to
vent, I hastily wrote an e-mail to a compassionate co-worker. I was
just beginning to cool down when the e-mail came back to me. I had
zapped it to my boss. This man, who is not known to suffer fools
gladly, returned my message with this comment: ``You obviously
intended to send this to someone else.''
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to that experience, I fully understand why the brilliant
Mr. Gates suffered memory lapses on the witness stand. I've often
wondered whether I could explain my past e-mail if asked to do so.
Thank God I never was.

 &HT;    This ``girl power'' stuff is a bit much
 &HT;    By Mary McCarty
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYT0N, Ohio _ Sisters, unite! We've got to reclaim ``girl
power.'' It's getting desperately late.
</P>
<P>
   It was bad enough when the Spice Girls commandeered the term.
Did you catch the trailer for their film? ``Is my skirt too
short?'' asks Posh Spice. When her friends answer in the negative,
she raises it.
</P>
<P>
   Girl power, indeed.
</P>
<P>
   Now cable viewers are being bombarded with the pre-pre-teen
version of girl power _ The Powerpuff Girls , which debuted last
Wednesday on Cartoon Network. It has been hailed as a breakthrough
_ girl finally achieves prime-time superhero status _ but appears
to be anything but.
</P>
<P>
   For starters, what's with the name? They're the Powerpuff Girls,
for crying out loud: Blossom, Buttercup, and Bubbles.
</P>
<P>
   And why are they ``saving the world before bedtime?'' Is it
because, typical women of the '90s, they're too busy earlier in the
day? Alas, this series is more '60s, than '90s, more throwback than
trailblazer.
</P>
<P>
   I tried to keep an open mind, however, as I watched the premiere
episodes with Teri Thompson, a University of Dayton communications
professor. She has conducted extensive research into
gender-stereotyping in cartoonland and found _ surprise surprise _
it's a boy's world out there.
</P>
<P>
   Our pretense of objectivity doesn't last long, however. Thompson
stopped the tape every few minutes in disbelief.
</P>
<P>
   Take the opening sequence: Professor Utopian, an absent-minded
professor type who looks like Rock Hudson, creates the Powerpuff
Girls in his laboratory. ``Sugar, spice, everything nice, these
were the ingredients to create the perfect little girls. . . .''
But the professor accidentally added an additional ingredient:
Chemical X.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty seconds into the show, and Thompson is already hitting
the pause button. They can't be powerful if they're just girls?
They need that extra ingredient, Chemical X. And how did that
particular letter happen to occur to them?
</P>
<P>
   The Powerpuff girls have round heads and insect-like bodies,
with oversized eyes like those poster waifs of the '60s. With the
exception of Buttercup _ a ``firecracker'' who ``kicks butt,''
according to ads _ they're always smiling, even when punching
evildoers.
</P>
<P>
   The other women in the show are either the apple-pie baking
girl-next-door, the evil, serpent-haired Seduca, or the wicked
would-be stepmother who snarls, ``From now on, you're forbidden to
use your superpowers, and must do things like normal little
girls!''
</P>
<P>
   Thompson hit the pause button again. ``Is this 1998 or what?''
</P>
<P>
   The show's message, she said, is that ``girls can be powerful _
but only if they're cute. Other than that, they're helpless or
manipulative.''
</P>
<P>
   Why worry? Isn't it all kitschy and silly and, well, just
cartoons?
</P>
<P>
   Thompson's 1994 study, conducted with then-colleague Eugenia
Zerbinos, suggests otherwise. After watching cartoons, children
were asked, ``What do boys do?'' and ``What do girls do?''
</P>
<P>
   The responses went like this: ``Boys rescue girls. Boys like to
fight and chase bad guys. Girls dress up and play with dolls. They
like to find boyfriends.''
</P>
<P>
   It matters, Thompson said, because this is what kids watch. It
matters because it shapes the way they think about gender roles.
</P>
<P>
   Hey, Powerpuff girls! Would you really like to save the world
before bedtime? Fire your scriptwriters. While you're at it, fire
all the producers and marketers who think the Spice Girls and their
ilk are proper role models for pre-teens.
</P>
<P>
   Now, that's what I'd call girl power.

 &HT;    `Doctor Dolittle', from musical to movie, the two have almost
nothing in common
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Doctor Dolittle'' (PG-13) _ This raucous but uninspired
Eddie Murphy vehicle has almost nothing to do with the old Rex
Harrison musical. Murphy is John Dolittle, a busy doctor who has
neglected his wife (Kristen Wilson) and his two daughters. One day,
all kinds of animals start pestering him vocally _ often with crude
body-function humor. Despite the zing of some nuttier moments, the
lame, must-spend-time-with-kids plot keeps dragging the movie to
the ground. Priced to buy: $19.98. Grade: B-
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Sliding Doors'' (R) _ In this tepid romantic comedy, Gwyneth
Paltrow plays a modern Londoner who lives two parallel lives. In
one, she discovers her boyfriend John Lynch is unfaithful, and
builds a new life. In the other, she doesn't find out, and
continues her unhappy relationship. Both lives involve John Hannah
as a too-good-to-be-true cuddly soulmate. Good idea, but both of
Paltrow's characters are shallow and reactive, and the movie never
achieves the whimsy or romance it needs to sell its gimmick. Grade:
C+
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Artemisia'' (R) _ Valentina Cervi plays 17th-century painter
Artemisia Gentileschi, who broke through cultural barriers,
becoming one of the first respected female artists. The fact that
Artemisia accused her paining mentor (Miki Manojlovic) of sexual
assault unfortunately leads the movie into speculative territory,
turning an interesting character study into something closer to
cliched romance. In French with subtitles. Grade: B-

 &HT;    Three CDs no charm for `Egypt'
 &HT;    By Steve Dollar
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bever underestimate a mogul's ego. Or three, in this case
(Jeffrey Katzenberg, Steven Spielberg and David Geffen). In their
over-the-top bid to out-Disney Disney, DreamWorks has unloaded not
one, not two, but three separate albums tied to its big holiday
animation feature, ``The Prince of Egypt.'' It's your basic
biblical epic, with all the broadly drawn emotional moments and Old
Testament sagas you'd expect from a high-tech Judeo-Christian theme
park.
</P>
<P>
   One CD would have sufficed. And it's not the original
soundtrack. Though it's nothing special, the album does at least
boast a historic studio summit meeting between pop divas Whitney
Houston and Mariah Carey. ``The Prince of Egypt (When You
Believe)'' will be with us for a while, an octave-leaping version
of MTV's ``Celebrity Death Match'' that should satisfy fans of both
singers. There's also a grand finale featuring a ``We Are the
World''-style cast of gospel, country, pop and Hollywood stars
wailing and warbling. The disc is more entertaining when it doesn't
try so hard: Steve Martin and Martin Short romping through a
laundry list of ancient deities on ``Playing With the Big Boys,''
or vocalist Ofra Haza embodying Middle Eastern culture on ``Goodbye
Brother.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the two albums of music ``inspired by'' the movie, the
``Inspirational'' title is more successful. The prevailing
religious themes make more sense in a gospel format. CeCe Winans
steals the show with an impassioned ``The River,'' and Jars of Clay
evoke Nirvana (of all things) on ``Everything in Between,''
illustrating the diverse range of performers who can fit under the
same banner. Contemporary soul-stirrers such as Brian McKnight,
Take 6, Kirk Franklin and Shirley Caesar all rock the house. The
only clunker is rock video evangelist Carman, who is such an
astounding self-parody that he's impossible to listen to with a
straight face.
</P>
<P>
   But then there's the ``Nashville'' version, boasting songs so
clumsily or exploitatively ``uplifting'' that it sinks to the level
of kitsch. Truck stop jukebox hero Red Sovine _ or gravel-throated
penitent Johnny Cash _ could pull off this kind of melodramatic,
heart-on-the-sleeve stuff, but hearing Clint Black deliver
something called ``Slavery, Deliverance and Faith'' is simply
painful. The presence of Music City all-stars such as Wynonna, Pam
Tillis, Mindy McCready and Vince Gill only makes matters more
depressing.

 &HT;    Some people! They're organized, within their budget, finished
with their list _ and ready for post-holiday bargains
 &HT;    By Marylin Johnson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ While many of us will be out early Friday fighting the
masses in the malls, some organized souls have already wrapped up
their holiday shopping. A few have even finished addressing their
Christmas cards.
</P>
<P>
   Don't you just hate 'em?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sooo stressful to put things off,'' says Denise O'Connor,
42, of Alpharetta, Ga., who shops year round for 39 people so she
can ship her overseas Christmas gifts in July and mail out-of-town
presents by Nov. 1. ``As the holidays approach, I want to be able
to bake cookies, volunteer at church and go to parties,'' says the
stay-at-home mother of Sean, 12, and Caroline, 9. Come Dec. 26,
however, she'll be back shopping _ grabbing up bargains that might
be marked down by half or more.
</P>
<P>
   Nutritional food saleswoman Deborah Kumpitsch, 31, also is
poised to start shopping for Christmas of 1999. But first she'll
wrap the presents for the 19 people on this year's list while
watching football this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not compulsive,'' insists the Marietta, Ga., resident, who
finished her Christmas shopping in mid-September. ``It's a
challenge to have the shopping done.'' The payoff? ``I don't have
to deal with mall traffic or parking, and I can spend money that I
saved by buying throughout the year on myself and my husband at the
after-Christmas sales.''
</P>
<P>
   For Atlantan Cherie Pentecost, 51, an administrative assistant
with AFC Enterprises, shopping for 365 days extends the Christmas
spirit throughout the year. And it gives her the luxury of choosing
thoughtful gifts. Early this year, she visited Amsterdam,
Netherlands, and bought a friend a piece of pottery that she
collects. Pentecost also presents friends with quilts and
decorative home furnishings that she has sewn throughout the year.
</P>
<P>
   Year-round shopping has its perks. But the best reason for doing
it? ``You never have a huge debt in January,'' says O'Connor.
``It's budgeted over the entire year.''
</P>
<P>
   Our intrepid shoppers have strategies that might be helpful to
the shopping-impaired who want to mend their procrastinating ways:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Everyone agrees: Keep a list or diary and check it more than
once. ``I keep my diary in the car,'' O'Connor says. ``If you don't
look at it regularly, you'll forget you bought Aunt Helen a teapot
in February.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Diaries are also helpful for tracking gifts that you purchase
and give year round: hostess and graduation presents, Valentine's
Day and teacher presents, stocking stuffers. And by stockpiling
those gifts, usually bought on sale, you always have an appropriate
item for the occasion.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Another tip from O'Connor: ``By shopping sales year round, you
can give a better gift than you normally would be able to afford.''
She remembers buying a $50 Nativity set where she works that was
marked down 60 percent. As a part-time employee, she got a 20
percent store discount on the purchase and ended up paying $16.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  These savvy shoppers don't limit their gift buying to one type
of store. ``I buy gifts at Target, Old Navy, CVS and Hallmark
stores, as well as Macy's and Rich's,'' says Kumpitsch. Other
shoppers have found bargains at yard sales, flea markets, fabric
stores and outlet malls.
</P>
<P>
   Our organized shoppers also have a special place in their homes
to store treasures. If you don't designate a spot, you won't be
able to find the gifts when you want to wrap them, they warn. The
place can be a shelf in the basement, an empty closet, even under
the bed. Many pre-wrap, so the children won't discover what Santa
has brought them.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor has also streamlined the wrapping process. She uses
wrapping paper only for out-of-town gifts. ``Paper wrap and paper
gift bags are too expensive,'' she says. For her family and close
friends, she buys holiday fabric at the end of the season _ at 50
percent off _ and makes her own reusable cloth drawstring gift bags
in various sizes. She currently has between 50 and 100 bags (her
friends know to return them) and no longer has to stay up late on
Christmas Eve wrapping packages.
</P>
<P>
   Even in the O'Connor household, though, there's always one
unavoidable last-minute present to buy.
</P>
<P>
   ``My husband drives me insane,'' says Denise O'Connor.
</P>
<P>
   Jim O'Connor waits until Christmas Eve to buy her gift.
</P>
<P>
   Our readers share their shopping tricks and gift-giving ideas.
It doesn't matter whether you're buying for next Christmas or just
getting started on this year's list:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  You don't have to be first in line. ``Hit Kmart, Wal-Mart or
Target the day after Thanksgiving around 9:30 or 10 a.m.,'' says
Brandice Abrams of Decatur, Ga. ``Believe it or not, the things you
want will still be there and you won't have to fight the crowds
when the doors first open.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Keep a gift-giving diary. Even if you don't shop year round,
diaries can still help frazzled shoppers keep track of gifts
they've purchased, says expert shopper Denise O'Connor.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Change your shopping philosophy. ``We have a rule in our
family: Gifts must be something to do, not something to have,''
says Donna Valentine, who lives in Atlanta. Her list might include
tickets to the movies, the theater or symphony, or a gift
certificate to a wine bar or for an in-line skating lesson. Another
suggestion: Make a donation to a charity in a friend's name.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Look for sales. ``Clearance racks at off-price stores such as
T.J. Maxx and Marshalls offer significant reductions,'' advises
Linda Jenkins of Marietta. She also suggests that you start buying
for the next Christmas right after the last one, when retailers are
trying to get rid of fall-winter items to prepare for spring
merchandise.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Don't hesitate if you see something you like. ``Buy it when
you see it,'' advises Deborah Kumpitsch of Marietta, Ga. ``The item
won't be there when you go back.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Make it fun _ and wear comfortable shoes. As part of a family
tradition, Elizabeth L. Murphy of Roswell, Ga., and her daughter go
to the mall the day after Thanksgiving every year. ``We look
around, getting ideas and enjoying the bustle of the crowd. We wear
our Christmas sweatshirts and jeans and sometimes spend the entire
day.''

HITTING THE VIRTUAL SLOPES ALL YEAR ROUND 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Mich.)   (af)  
 By VERNE G. KOPYTOFF   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Snow skiing in cyberspace has certain advantages over the
traditional winter pastime of sliding down a powdery slope that may
be booby-trapped with moguls, rocks and ice. Carving turns among
the hundreds of Internet sites that are devoted to the sport is no
more chilly than room temperature, and unlike waiting in most
chairlift lines, downloading a Web page can take just a few
seconds.
</P>
<P>
   On-line ski information includes equipment reviews, resort news,
club announcements and ski-area jobs. As can be expected, interest
in ski sites on line seems to increase sharply as temperatures drop
in the fall, ski Web site operators say.
</P>
<P>
   Some skiing fanatics, like Eric Winkelman, a financial
consultant and investor from Glen Arbor, Mich., visit the sites
even when the slopes are covered with summer flowers. He spends
between one and two hours a day on his computer to feed his
``skiing addiction,'' reading ski travel articles and gear
analysis, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Payne, general manager of the Times-Mirror Interzine
mountain group, whose sites include Skinet.com and
Snowboarding.com, said the winter sports sites got 10 times as many
hits in summer as in winter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a vicarious substitute for not being on the hill and
making turns,'' Winkelman said of his forays on the Web. ``It's a
way to keep your mind involved in the sport after April or May. It
makes the pain of not skiing that much more easier to take.''
</P>
<P>
   To some, skiing is as much a social event as a sport. Indeed,
many skiers communicate with one another in dozens of online chat
rooms and bulletin boards, which range in content from hopeful (``a
snowy winter predicted'') to critical (``skiing is too
expensive'').
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who is concerned about sensory deprivation while
scrolling through ski sites need not worry. Web pages are typically
garnished with images of skiers gliding through waist-deep powder,
plunging down perilous chutes and spinning in the air.
</P>
<P>
   The text is often just as adventurous. Reflecting the surfer
attitude that some skiers have adopted, one site recently referred
to some of its amateur contributors as ``righteous'' and another
directed readers to a fitness article with the line, ``Are you fit
enough to be phat?''
</P>
<P>
   Do not expect that adventurous attitude to translate into much
critical writing. On many sites, feature stories, especially about
ski resorts, read as if they had been written by a publicist.
</P>
<P>
   People who are looking for practical information about skiing
have no shortage of choices. For example, www.skimaps.com features
hundreds of trail maps (though many are slightly unfocused), and
www.skicentral.com, perhaps the most complete links directory on
the Web, offers access to hundreds of resorts' Web sites. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   WWW.SKINET.COM &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Scrolling through what this site has to offer is like riding
every run at Aspen, given its scope and the quantity of information
to digest. In addition to original ski news, travel articles and
resort information, it offers online versions of the sport's two
most popular magazines, Ski and Skiing.
</P>
<P>
   Over all, the site is probably the most comprehensive ski
destination on line. It is a good starting place for those wishing
to sample what the Web has to offer on the sport.
</P>
<P>
   The Frequently Asked Questions section is particularly strong,
with suggestions on how often skis should be waxed, when to
purchase a new pair of skis and how long poles should be. Even
experienced skiers can learn something.
</P>
<P>
   The content includes the newsy (like information on the recent
fires at Vail) and the statistical (lift-ticket prices for nearly
800 hills). Some content is relatively commercial, like lists of
dates and locations for ski shows and hotel packages.
</P>
<P>
   The magazines in the Newsstand tend to include features that are
longer and less time-sensitive. For example, a recent story in Ski
magazine focused on how nonskiers could occupy their time while
vacationing at a ski resort.
</P>
<P>
   Another recent story in Ski was about a company that uses Global
Positioning System transmitters to keep track of where skiers are,
how fast they are going and how much vertical drop they cover each
day. ``Ski braggarts beware,'' the article said.
</P>
<P>
   Ski and Skiing look similar on the Web, with stories about
travel, gear and health. One difference is that the online version
of Skiing offers a column in which an expert answers readers'
questions about things like how to remove a lift ticket off one's
jacket easily.
</P>
<P>
   But don't cancel your subscriptions to Ski and Skiing just yet.
On-line readers have access to only a limited number of articles,
which have already been in print for at least a month. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   WWW.COMPLETE-SKIER.COM  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   England may not be blessed with the world's best ski resorts,
but it is home to one of the best ski instruction sites on line. It
also includes news, instructional articles and a search engine for
looking up resort information.
</P>
<P>
   The Complete Skier, based in London, offers detailed advice on
how to slide downhill with aplomb, teaching maneuvers like the
basics of a wedge turn or the proper navigation of moguls.
</P>
<P>
   The site says its pages ``describe all the skills alpine skiers
need to tackle the slopes with confidence.'' For the most part, it
lives up to that claim. A department devoted to teaching skiers how
to use ski poles (``the most misunderstood and misused piece of
equipment''), for example, runs for two pages. Step-by-step
photographs are accompanied by often insightful explanations (
``imagine you are holding the steering wheel of a bus'').
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   A particularly welcome feature is a section for intermediate
skiers, who do not get much attention on the Internet. The lessons
include swing turns and the tuck position. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Much of the site is actually an annotated, online version of
``The Complete Skier,'' a 332-page book published by BBC Books, and
the book is advertised throughout the site with no concession to
subtlety.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from instruction, there are general tips on fitness and
skiing with kids (``there is no reason why children should not
start skiing as soon as they can walk properly''). Other features
include ski news, ``best of'' travel lists, job listings, snow
reports and links to online magazines.
</P>
<P>
   Over all, the site is a good stop for people who are looking for
coaching but are unwilling to sign up for ski lessons. But there is
no guarantee that improving your technique is any easier by way of
the Internet than with a live teacher. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   WWW.HYPERSKI.COM  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There are few references to snowy weather or slushy conditions
at this site.
</P>
<P>
   Every day, it seems, brings blue skies, trackless powder and a
helicopter waiting to take skiers back to the top of the mountain.
</P>
<P>
   Hyperski, a monthly online magazine for skiing and snowboarding,
offers articles geared toward accomplished skiers and their less
experienced admirers.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent issue, stories focused on the Jackson Hole ski
resort in Wyoming, the coming World Cup racing season and whether
skiers need to ingest electrolytes (in sports drinks) to avoid
fatigue.
</P>
<P>
   A story about budget helicopter skiing in Alaska perhaps best
reflected the overall testosterone-rich tone of the site.
</P>
<P>
   In it, the author told of jumping off cornices and hiking along
ridges. ``Dan launched off a drift and came down leaning too far
forward,'' the author wrote about a skiing companion. ``Faceplant
followed by a roll, and he just kept on trucking. Said he hardly
even felt it.''
</P>
<P>
   One departure from this theme is an article by Warren Miller, a
filmmaker and skiing humorist.
</P>
<P>
   Miller poked fun at the inflated language that you can find in
some ski resort brochures, like a claim of a ``hot-water swimming
pool adjacent to lodge.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Reality will reveal a Jacuzzi large enough for a cocker
spaniel to swim laps in,'' Miller said. ``But unless you get into
the hot water within 30 minutes of when they remove the cover,
there isn't any hot water.''
</P>
<P>
   For consumers, the site offers an archive of mostly useful
articles about ski equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Examples include ``Parabolic Skis _ a Professional's
Evaluation,'' ``Choosing Recreational Skis for Kids'' and ``Ten
Commandments of Boot Fitting'' (``Try ski boots on with ski socks.
No cotton.'').
</P>
<P>
   People who are looking for information to help them decide which
ski resort to visit may find that the resort section is more
convenient than most.
</P>
<P>
   It offers not only links to snow and weather reports but also
travel articles previously presented on the site to give a better
sense of a resort's atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   While Hyperski boasts that it is ``becoming the most
comprehensive ski magazine on line,'' the reality is more modest.
Nevertheless, the site does offer an interesting assortment of
features. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   WWW.GOSKI.COM &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This site has built its reputation by providing a timely
inventory of ski conditions at nearly 2,000 resorts around the
world. But after browsing through the weather and snow-depth
reports, visitors will find a large quantity of news and
information on resorts and gear that is difficult to find
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Much of that information comes from readers, who send in reviews
about ski equipment and travel destinations. These comments, which
seem generally well informed, are among the few critical opinions
on line about the ski industry.
</P>
<P>
   In a review of the Hunter Mountain resort in New York, for
example, a writer said: ``Hunter is no good because the lift
tickets cost $42. The park has terribly long lift lines and is
solid ice by the end of the day. Other than that, the skiing is
fairly good.''
</P>
<P>
   The news department also offers some interesting reading,
including ``Facts on Snow Fatalities'' and ``Avalanche Information
Center.'' Fear not, however; the site reports that bicycling and
swimming are by far more dangerous than snow skiing.
</P>
<P>
   For those seeking even more intellectual material, there is a
series of articles titled ``Everything You Ever Wanted to Know
About Skiing the World.'' It contains stories about skiing trends
and history, from the debut of the sport 4,000 years ago to the
prediction that resort towns may prohibit cars in the future.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the site offers fairly traditional articles about
ski resorts and equipment advice. One departure is a section called
People, in which a writer addresses the ``Truth About the French''
(``no one has a more undeserved reputation about their character'')
and provides a list of useful French phrases.
</P>
<P>
   The writing at Go Ski is among the best found at ski sites on
line. The site also does a worthy job of reporting material that is
beyond the typical fare of most of its competitors.

 &HT;    NAACP REJUVENATES ITS FINANCES AND FERVOR
 &HT;    (Resending for those who need it.)
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The NAACP, which sank into a financial and
scandal-laden morass that threatened its very existence four years
ago, is reclaiming its place as the nation's premier civil rights
organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're back. We're rested. We were always tan,'' quipped Julian
Bond, the veteran civil rights organizer who became chairman of the
National Association for the Advancement of Colored People last
February.
</P>
<P>
   Not only has the NAACP erased a once-staggering debt that
decimated staff and programs, but the 89-year-old organization has
reinvigorated its commitment to oppose hatred, racial polarization
and discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   The NAACP claims some credit for the large black voter turnout
that helped the Democratic Party narrow the GOP congressional
majority in this month's elections. And while it failed to defeat
an anti-affirmative action initiative in Washington state, the
NAACP is prepared to ``make this fight anywhere else,'' said Bond.
</P>
<P>
   ``The NAACP has reclaimed its rightful place as the voice of
people of color and others who believe in the power and the premise
that all persons are, in fact, created equal,'' said Kweisi Mfume
(pronounced Kwah-EE-see Oom-FOO-may), the former Maryland
congressman who became the NAACP's president and CEO in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, since Mfume's arrival two years ago, the NAACP has
replaced its debt with a $2.1 million surplus, rebuilt the staff at
its national headquarters in Baltimore, shaken up the staid
leadership in some of its 2,200 branches, expanded its worldwide
membership to 600,000 and established dozens of new youth and
college chapters.
</P>
<P>
   Since Bond's arrival last February, the NAACP has returned to
the fray of politics and nonviolent protests with renewed fervor
and, perhaps most important, has begun establishing ties with
organizations representing Hispanics, the soon-to-be-largest ethnic
group in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tools we used to combat white supremacy before _
organization, mobilization, coalition, litigation _ are the tools
we'll use to fight white supremacy today,'' said Bond, who helped
organize the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) in
the early 1960s. ``We're going to do the old things better.''
</P>
<P>
   This back-to-the-future strategy was evident in a recent
collaboration of Bond and Raul Yzaguirre, president of the National
Council of La Raza, the nation's largest Hispanic organization, in
attacking proposals to privatize Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   It also has been apparent in Mfume-led marches to protest the
Supreme Court's lack of minority clerks and in the NAACP programs
that rate the responsiveness of various industries to minority
customers.
</P>
<P>
   And in the wake of President Clinton's race initiative, which
tried to educate white Americans to the nature of ``white
privilege'' in the country, the NAACP is actively recruiting whites
to join its ranks , as it once did in the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many whites have thought they couldn't join,'' said Bond.
``Others have made the American assumption _ that solving racial
problems is a task for black Americans, the victims, and not
whites, the perpetrators.''
</P>
<P>
   Bond credits his predecessor, Myrlie Evers-Williams, for the
NAACP's renaissance. ``She restored integrity and honesty,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The widow of slain civil rights leader Medgar Evers took over
the chairmanship at the height of scandal and immediately began
crisscrossing the nation to convince disenchanted donors to resume
their contributions. Almost single-handedly, she erased half of the
organization's nearly $3 million debt.
</P>
<P>
   The NAACP had been rocked two years earlier when its board fired
then-executive director Benjamin Chavis for unauthorized use of
NAACP funds to settle a sexual harassment suit. Within six months
of Chavis's firing, several board members filed suit against
then-chairman William Gibson, alleging he had misused $1.4 million
in NAACP funds.
</P>
<P>
   Evers-Williams reluctantly ran against Gibson in early 1995. In
a bruising campaign that tugged at the seams of the NAACP, she won
by a margin of one vote. She then recruited Mfume, a rising
Democratic star in Congress, to take over the daily operation of
the organization.
</P>
<P>
   Mfume, in addition to helping Evers-Williams tackle the debt,
has made bridging the generation gap in the African American
community one of his top priorities, opening the NAACP to black
youths who had come to view the organization as aged and
irrelevant.
</P>
<P>
   At its October board meeting, the NAACP granted charters to
seven new youth chapters, pushing the nationwide total over 350.
</P>
<P>
   ``Failing to develop roles and responsibilities for our young
people now will certainly ensure our failure later,'' said Mfume.

RX: STATEHOOD 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, November 29, 1998)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID WARSH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Puerto Rico has been in the news recently. The descendents of
Theodore Roosevelt are lobbying for a posthumous Medal of Honor for
their sire. (Roosevelt himself liked to put it this way: ``The
bravest man I ever knew was the black sergeant who followed me up
San Juan Hill.'') San Juan Hill is in Cuba, of course, but the
outcome of the Spanish American War was to cede the island of
Puerto Rico to the United States under the terms of the Treaty of
Paris _ on Dec. 10, 1898.
</P>
<P>
   What better timing than that for the plebescite two weeks from
today (11/29) that will determine whether the citizens of Puerto
Rico choose to seek statehood among the United States?
</P>
<P>
   The vote is the brainchild of Governor Pedro Rosello, who saw
that the island economy was going nowhere fast. For many years,
Puerto Rico had been considered a model of economic development in
the post-war world _ the ``fifth tiger,'' as economists William
Baumol and Edward Wolff called it in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   But by 1996, when Rosello was re-elected to a second four-year
term, it was clear that something had gone badly wrong. Despite
bouyant job growth in the states, the Puerto Rican economy was
stagnating. By then, Rosello and experts in economic development
had indentified a surprising villain.
</P>
<P>
   A little background: The United States claimed the Philippines
and Puerto Rico after its war with Spain in 1898 because it felt it
should take something for its trouble _ it was the fashion among
nations. For a time the Pacific archipeligo and the easternmost of
the major Caribbean islands looked suspiciously like colonies.
</P>
<P>
   The Jones Act of 1917 conferred US citizenship on Puerto Ricans.
In 1950 Congress created a special commonwealth status for it,
Guam, and the Northern Mariana islands, establishing procedures to
draft and adopt constitutions resembling those of the states.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1950s and 1960s, ``Operation Bootstrap,'' directed by
the planning agency Fomento (meaning ``promotion'' in Spanish,) did
all the things that planning agencies did in those days: built
industrial parks, targeted ``winners'' and ``losers'' among local
businesses, and offered tax breaks to US industries. For a time,
the strategy worked as well as anything else: the economy grew at
an annual rate of 6.5 percent between 1959 and 1974.
</P>
<P>
   The productivity shocks of the 1970s _ the oil price hikes in
particular _ hit Puerto Rico hard. The top-down, subsidy-driven
planning continued, with few good effects. The unemployment rate,
always high relative to the 50 states, hit a depression-level 22
percent in the 1980s. Income per capita in Puerto Rico is $8,100,
less than a third of the $25,660 level that is the US average.
</P>
<P>
   What is stalling Puerto Rico's growth? Local politics and strong
local unions surely are part of the answer _ the effects of a
hundred years of dependency. The public sector employs a third of
the work force _ more than double the US average. Efforts at
privatization have gone nowhere. And restrictive work rules have
raised costs and discouraged investment.
</P>
<P>
   But an even more pernicious mechanism was discerned by in the
early 1990s by, among others, development consultant J. Tomas
Hexner, in an obscure provision of the US tax code known as Section
936. Hexner had specialized in the development of East Pakistan in
the 1960s, before it was reborn as Bangladesh; he knew an exploited
economy when he saw one.
</P>
<P>
   The offshore tax subsidy found in Section 936 of the US tax code
dated as far back as the 1920s, Hexner discovered; initially it had
been intended to spur labor-intensive manufacturing on the island
that otherwise would not have located there.
</P>
<P>
   But after World War II, the advantage of the lowest labor costs
shifted abruptly to Asia. The hefty tax breaks offered by 936
attracted capital-intensive industries like pharmaceuticals and
electronics to Puerto Rico instead. The cleverest corporate tax
attorneys in Washington went to work to re-engineer, for purposes
of maximizing the profitability of the latest designer molecules, a
tax law intented to stimulate the manufacture of baseballs and
baseball gloves. Complementary Puerto Rican incentives were devised
and shephered into law by well-connected lobbyists as well.
</P>
<P>
   The result by the late 1980s was the emergence in Puerto Rico of
a giant tax shelter for drug companies. They transferred patents
and other intangibles into their San Juan filing cabinets, and
record profits out _ with very little correspondinging increase in
real investment except in the sophisticated financial institutions,
world class hotels, and thriving service sector.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, little new indigenous industry of any sort has
appeared. Domestic capital formation has failed to take off; the
share of investment in the economy fell from 29 percent of gross
domestic product during the 1960s and 1960s to 14 percent in 1994.
In short: a disaster.
</P>
<P>
   Section 936 came under scrutiny in the early 1990s, not because
of any concern for its ill-effects on Puerto Rico, but because of
congressional concern with a balanced budget. The discovery that
the Treasury was foregoing up to $4 billion a year in taxes led to
a decision to phase it out in the next few years _ thus depriving
Puerto Rico of the subsidy of its high-end service industries, and
forcing a sweeping re-examination of policies toward economic
growth. The end of the subsidy to the Gucci-clad crowd put
statehood firmly on the docket.
</P>
<P>
   True, Puerto Rico still looks good compared with other Caribbean
islands. But its performance is downright crummy compared with the
United States _ barely half that of Mississippi, which, like South
Carolina, was steadily pulling ahead. When a young Chilean
economist named Fernando Lefort studied Puerto Rico's convergence
with the United States _ or lack thereof _ for his PhD thesis at
Harvard University a few years ago, he found it was the lack of
clear-cut political integration, more than any other single factor,
that was holding back Puerto Rico.
</P>
<P>
   Were Puerto Rico to become a state, Lefort argued, the
convergence effect _ the same forces on whose strength Mississippi
is rising _ would guarantee Puerto Rico a higher rate of growth,
and its citizens higher incomes.
</P>
<P>
   Hence the complicated discussion of statehood that has taken
place among Puerto Ricans throughout the 1990s. To judge from polls
and the local press, support for maintaining its commwealth status
has been dwindling, even though Puerto Ricans don't pay federal
income taxes under the status quo. A small but dependable faction
of voters apparently continue to favor outright independence. The
pro-statehood New Progressive Party of Governor Rosello appears to
be gaining.
</P>
<P>
   The vote is scheduled for Dec. 13. More than 80 percent of the
eligible voters among Puerto Rico's 3.8 illion citizens are
expected expected to turn out; more than half of them are expected
to vote for statehood. The referendum binds no one, not even the
government of Puerto Rico. But remember this: no group of citizens
in American territories yet has organized to seek statehood _ and
failed to get it.

THE WEBPAD: A WIRELESS INTERNET APPLIANCE 
</HEADLINE>
  (gm) 
 By PETER H. LEWIS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from
magic,'' the science fiction writer Arthur C. Clarke observed.
Inevitabl}, wags have added corollaries like, ``Any sufficiently
advanced magic is indistinguishable from technology,'' and my
favorite, ``Any sufficiently advanced technology or magic is
ijdistinguishable from a rigged demo.''
</P>
<P>
   The mother lode of rigged demos is the annual Comdex computer
trade show, which was held last week in Las Vegas, itself a city
based on illusion, artificial enhancements and suspension of
rational belief. Computer and software companies come from around
the world to show off their new products, even if the products are
not quite ready for market and even if the product is simply a
rigged demonstration intended tk show what the developer hopes to
create if only the engineers and programmers can get the thing to
work eventually, within budget.
</P>
<P>
   At Comdex in Las Vegas, one should always peek behind the
curtain when someone is doing a demo. (And one should never take a
card in blackjack when the dealer's up card is a 4, 5 or 6, but
that's another story.)
</P>
<P>
   Imagine my surprise, then, when the Cyrix Corp. demonstrated a
wonderful prototype product called the Webpad, and there were no
curtains or hidden wires anywhere to be found.
</P>
<P>
   The Webpad, which is expected to be available snmetime lext
summer, is a battery-powered, wireless computer about the size of
an Etch-a-Sketch toy, or, fkr those who never had an Etch-a-Sketch,
about the size of a very thick magazine. It uses radio waves to
browse the World Wide Web, send and receive e-mail and perform
other Internet tasks, all channeled wirelessly through a receiver
attached to a regular personal computer.
</P>
<P>
   This three-pound Internet appliance is to Web browsing what a
cordless phone is to telephony, a portable device that lets people
wander through the house or office without being tethered by a
wire.
</P>
<P>
   One of the knocks against electronic media _ the computer
versions of books, newspapers, magazines, letters, and so on,
enhanced with interactivity, animation and perhaps sound and video
_ is that because they are viewed on a computer screen, they are
not as portable as paper.
</P>
<P>
   Some people, for example, are reading this column while seated
at the breakfast table. It would be awkward, not to mention rude,
to have a personal computer at the table. But the Webpad, with its
10.4-inch active matrix screen, is small and light enough to find a
home between the corn flakes and the coffee, yet big enough to show
a full screen of information.
</P>
<P>
   It can serve up stokk quotes and financial research from the
easy chair in the den, football statistics from the sofa in front
of the television set and perhaps evan a bedtime story from the
bedroom. It allows people to read the morning electronic newspaper
even while sitting in the smallest room of the house.
</P>
<P>
   It does so by maintaining a radio-frequency link with a
conventional computer elsewhere in the house through a base station
attached to a special card that plugs into the desktop computer.
The main computer can be 300 to 500 feet away, depending on the
architecture of the house. Unlike infrared wireless computer
connections, the radio waves, at a frequency of 2.4 gigahertz,
penetrate walls and floors easily. (So the Federal Communications
Commission will certainly sant to test the Webpad to make sure that
it does not interfere with the neighbor's electronic devices.
Imagine the fun if every time you click on Yahoo, your neighbor's
garage door opens.)
</P>
<P>
   The Webpad is useful primarily because it can be left around
doing nothing and picked up when it is needed. If the price can be
driven down"quickly through mass production _ the folks at Cyrix
anticipate that the first units will cost around $500 _ one can
envision having two or more Webpads scattered around the house.
</P>
<P>
   Each pad, like a cordless phone, will have to be dropped into a
recharging base periodically to keep the batteries from dying.
</P>
<P>
   The recharging base is likely to have Universal Serial Bus
connection ports for a keyboard and a mouse. When the user strays
from the base station, mouse functions are replaced by tapping on
the touch screen with a stylus, and the user can tap out simple
e-mail messages and responses by pecking characters on a virtual
keyboard on screen. The pad itself has built-in speakers and a
microphone, which suggests that voice recognition and transcription
are possibilities someday.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the Webpad is useful only when its host computer
somewhere else in the house has a live connection to the Internet.
And the faster that connection is,"the less waiting the Webpad user
will endure. That is why the Webpad makes the most sense for people
who have a high-speed, always-on connection to the Internet, of the
sort just beginning to be offered by cable companies (cable modems)
and phone companies (DSL, or digital subscriber lines).
</P>
<P>
   If the personal computer is ever to achieve equil status in the
home with the television, the telephong and other household
appliances, it will have to have a persistent connection. We have
come to expect a dial tone as soon as we lift the telephone
receiver, and we will eventually come to expect a Web tone when we
pick up a computer.
</P>
<P>
   The Webpad will be a dud if the owner has to dial up America
Online, fight off busy signals and tie up the family phone around
the clock just to have a portable Web browser. Certainly the
Internet will not reach its full potential until it is avqilable
instantly at the click of a mouse (or, in the case of the Webpad,
the flick of the stylus.)
</P>
<P>
   So the Webpad is the sort of device, I suspect, that Internet
Service Providers may somedcy offer free, or at low cost, as an
enticement to get their customers to sign up for persistent
high-Speed access.
</P>
<P>
   At Comdex last week, MCI Worldcom announced that it would begin
offering DSL service before the end of the year in New York,
Boston, Washington and other major cities and that America Online
and Earthlink would begin trials of the new DSL service by the end
of the year.
</P>
<P>
   There are several different types of DSL service. The most
common one is ADSL, or asymmetrical, which means that bits coming
from the Internet to the user (downloading) travel at a higher
speed than bits going from the user to the Internet (uploading).
Depending on what level of service the consumer chooses, and how
far away the telephone company's central office is, the upstream
speeds range from 64 Kbps (about 64 kilobits per second, or 64,000
bits per second) to 384 Kbps, and downstream from 384 Kbps to 768
Kbps.
</P>
<P>
   Prices for consumer DSL service will be set by the phone
compinies and the ISP's, but MCI Worldcom executives said they
expected the monthly cost to be $40 to $60. The advantages are much
faster connection speeds (as mqch as 25 times the downloading speed
of a standard 28.8 modem), a persistent connection (the Internet is
always ``on'') and the elimination of the need"for a second phone
line (one teen-ager can talk on the phone while another surfs the
Web).
</P>
<P>
   With such a connection, the Webpad would become very handy.
</P>
<P>
   Cyrix, which makes microprocessors, is unlikely to make the
Webpad itself. Rather, it will licenre the basic design to computer
makers.
</P>
<P>
   One can envision Webpads that include a telephone, allowing
users to make and receive voice calls while browsing the Internet
cordlessly.
</P>
<P>
   Or perhaps Microsoft will start making Webpads that incorporate
its newly announced Clear Type screen technology, another prototype
technology that Microsoft asserts will someday make"text on
computer screens as legible as text on paper. Microsoft's chairman,
William H. Gates, said Cleartype technology would be incorporated
into Windows 98 and other Microsoft products beginning next year.
</P>
<P>
   If Microsoft's demo can be translated into a working product,
devices like the Webpad will be useful not only as wireless Web
browsers, but also as portable electronic books.

`TOOLS OF THE EARTH': COMPOSTING, WELL, PHILOSOPHICALLY 
</HEADLINE>
   (editors: publication notes at end of review)  
 (bl)  
 By CHRISTOPHER LEHMANN-HAUPT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The attraction of Jeff Taylor's new book, ``Tools of the Earth:
The Practice and Pleasure of Gardening,'' is that it appears to be
a sequel to his previous book, ``Tools of the Trade: The Art and
Craft of Carpentry,'' which told you more than you were likely to
know about the hammer, the handsaw and other basic tools, and
pleasantly less than you wanted to know.
</P>
<P>
   But although the format of the new book is the same, with each
of its two-dozen chapters devoted to some basic gardening
implement, ``Tools of the Earth'' is not what it appears to be.
Instead of giving you the essentials on, say, the shovel, the hoe,
the watering can and the rake, each chapter careens off in an
unexpected direction.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, in ``Cloche: Glass Houses,'' in addition to
suggesting ways to build what the author defines as ``a removable
womb that is placed temporarily over transplants out in the
garden,'' he establishes that his wife, Joy, is the family member
in charge of their garden. In ``Garden Trowel: Joy in Mudville,''
Taylor describes how he and his wife first met.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Secateurs: The Flower People,'' he tells how his father
``passed away at home'' and how his rural Oregon community
celebrated the ``wedding'' of two members ``renewing their vows.''
In ``Pitchfork: Savage Garden,'' he explores the difficulties of
rearing a 13-year-old daughter. And in ``Rake: The Challenge,'' he
describes the trials of trying to quit smoking.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor, a professional carpenter and columnist for This Old
House magazine, apparently intended his new book to be a change of
pace, a combination of autobiography and Thoreauvian meditation on
the gardening seasons in the Pacific Northwest. But his approach is
not sparklingly original. After all, how much more is there to say
on the pleasures of resting in a hammock, or the spinal wear and
tear of shoveling or the therapeutic benefits of cultivating your
own garden?
</P>
<P>
   And the few passages that do seem unusual _ like a discussion of
the technique of exterminating slugs, or a meditation on the
pleasures of gardening while naked _ are not particularly well
written. In fact, it would take an E.B. White to write appealingly
on such offbeat subjects. It is neither cruel nor insulting to say
that Taylor is no E.B. White when it comes to this particular sort
of thing. Precious few writers on rural subjects are.
</P>
<P>
   Now and then Taylor deviates into offering useful or curious
information. He seems informative on the art of composting: ``The
trick, I believe, is complete aeration,'' he writes, ``not a
perfect mix of carbon and nitrogen.''
</P>
<P>
   He informs us that copper repels slugs. They ``can crawl over a
razor blade, but not a bucket lip if you wrap some copper wire
around the top,'' he writes. ``Slugs hate the electric taste of
copper, and the very sight of a bucket.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Do not cut braided string when its taut,'' he warns. ``Six
feet of it will come unraveled. Pinch a loop between finger and
thumb and cut there.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A good hoe should  &UR; slice &LR;  weeds, like a Ginsu knife,'' he
surprisingly tells us. ``This means a hoe must be sharp; not just
pretty sharp, as with the painted bevel-edge you find on
hardware-store tools, but incredibly, fantastically,
molecule-cleaving sharp, the blade first shaped with a file and
then honed for an hour or so with a whetstone.''
</P>
<P>
   But whatever practical advice Taylor has to offer gets
overwhelmed by his lamentations over what he sees as the
deterioration of the environment. His pleasure in buying a new
motorized tiller is swamped by his guilt over ``adding a little
more pollution to plague the world.''
</P>
<P>
   His chapter on the humble watering can turns into a complaint
about declining water resources, while his instructions on how to
prune trees lapse into an ululation over deforestation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The future has definitely arrived, and its name is Dystopia,''
he mourns, but the inanity of his outlook can be seen in his
announcement that the period of World War II ``must have been an
incredible time to be alive'' because ``those years were the last
time in American history that this nation actively practiced
conservation of raw materials.'' To which you want to shout back
that many people found it an incredible time to be alive simply
because they were surviving it.
</P>
<P>
   In the book's opening paragraph, Taylor announces: ``after
years, now I can grow a tomato. That was my original, my  &UR; only &LR; 
goal in becoming a student of gardening.'' In his final chapter,
``Harvest Basket: The Answers of Autumn,'' he complains of having
``too many tomatoes.'' He concludes: ``Picking and processing
tomatoes was great fun for the first few days, when we were fresh.
Now it reminds me of school, when the hours dripped like ketchup
from the bottle and all eyes were glued to the clock.''
</P>
<P>
   This excess and poor planning is a measure of all that has gone
wrong with ``Tools of the Earth.''

   ``It's never too late to have a happy childhood!'' suggests a
colorful magazine advertisement from Lionel, the world's best-known
manufacturer of toy trains. And between Thanksgiving and Christmas,
tens of thousands of relatively inexpensive electric train sets
will be bought by parents and grandparents, ostensibly for boys and
girls who will never see an actual New York Central steam engine
belching black smoke.
</P>
<P>
   But in a sign of the times, in addition to starter sets for
children age 8 and older that cost as little as $100, the really
big kids (read: grown-ups) will also be carrying home Christmas
locomotives in a wide range of prices that are so accurately
detailed and so crammed with high-tech electronics and sound
systems that their realism is nothing short of amazing. Some of
those engines cost as much as $1,500, and that may not include any
rolling stock.
</P>
<P>
   This year's train purchasers will probably be people who
remember the mythical holiday mornings when father and son played
engineer on a circle of track running around the Christmas tree,
uncoupling and coupling the boxcars and caboose and dumping a
flatcar load of logs on a make-believe siding.
</P>
<P>
   Lionel obliges this nostalgia with engines and freight or
passenger cars that have changed little since the 1940s. The trains
still run on two-and-one-quarter-inch-wide, three-rail ``O gauge''
track that was adopted back in 1915, the middle rail providing the
AC power. The locomotives and cars are large and substantial,
perfect for small and careless hands, unlike the small model trains
that run on HO (half-O) tracks. The steamers smoke when you squirt
an oily concoction down the stack, and a simulated air whistle (or
electronic horn in the case of a diesel) sounds when you push a
button on the transformer.
</P>
<P>
   But the venerable toy-train maker, which was founded in 1900 by
a 24-year-old named Joshua Lionel Cowen, has some serious
competition these days. An upstart company, MTH Electric Trains,
says it has captured 50 percent of the $100 million O-gauge market
since 1993 by making more prototypical trains, and Lionel has had
to fight back. One of the ways to fight is with technology.
</P>
<P>
   And Lionel has responded with a digital attack, in terms of
sound, special effects and a computerized command center that
allows much more control of what the trains do and how many trains
you can run at once.
</P>
<P>
   Traditional toy-train controllers use variations in the power
supplied to the track for limited control of a locomotive. Increase
the power and the train speeds up; decrease the power and the train
slows down; interrupt the power and the engine changes direction.
</P>
<P>
   No longer. In 1995 Lionel introduced the Trainmaster Command
Control System, which turns the entire track layout into an antenna
for a hand-held remote control that looks just like a television
remote-control device. Digital signals that tell a train what to do
are transmitted from the controller to a base unit, sent over the
tracks and picked up by a receiver in the engine. The system, which
uses five microprocessors, enables an operator to run two or more
trains independently of each other as well as control such things
as couplers, ``animated'' cars (a giraffe's head pops up and down
in a hole in the roof, for example), switches and a variety of
layout accessories.
</P>
<P>
   At least two competitors have adopted the Lionel train-control
system. Lionel has also introduced a microprocessor-controlled
motor that promises smoother running at low speeds and more power
for hauling a long freight train than with its legendary Pullmor
motor.
</P>
<P>
   And then there are the special effects, which are optional in
some midpriced trains. Steam locomotives, for example, come with
microprocessor-controlled, CD-quality digital sound: authentic
whistles and bells; steam puffing and smoke chuffing that is
synchronized to the speed of the engine; squealing brakes on
curves; radio chatter between engineers and train dispatchers and
freight yard or passenger station effects, including the
conductor's ``All aboard!''
</P>
<P>
   All of the audio effects are squeezed onto a tiny ROM (read-only
memory) chip that holds about 20 seconds of sound. Two separate
boards are used, one for the ROM and microprocessor, the other for
the amplifier and power supply. In the case of steam locomotives,
the sound system is placed in the spacious tender, which on real
trains was filled with coal and water. The latest innovation is
infrared communication between the main control board in the
locomotive and the sound system.
</P>
<P>
   Microprocessors are also found in railcars and trackside
operating accessories. The newest version of Lionel's classic
Aquarium Car, which also has a radio receiver controlled by the
remote device, features singing whales swimming past back-lit
rippled-glass tank windows and the sound of sloshing water when the
car is in motion. ``I really got a kick out of it and so did my
kids,'' wrote Martin Eibeck, a Pittsburgh toy train hobbyist on
Compuserve's Train Net forum.
</P>
<P>
   Lionel is not alone in producing computerized devices that
delight kids of all ages. MTH offers a 1950s drive-in with a Chevy
and a Thunderbird that pull up and are served by roller-skating
carhops. With real diner sound, of course.
</P>
<P>
   ``Technology has been the savior of toy trains,'' said Brad
Fisher, a train enthusiast in Bellefonte, Pa. ``If there is going
to be a future to this hobby, we need to draw in younger
participants. Look at their entertainment choices: video games,
computers, digital music. The modern sound systems have had the
greatest impact. They make today's trains seem so real.''
</P>
<P>
   However, not everyone is enthralled with all the new technology.
``I get a bit annoyed with the constant chuffing sounds and the
whine of the diesels,'' said Roger Fry of Bedford, Texas ``I either
turn the volume down or put it to sleep.''
</P>
<P>
   Opinions also differ on the prodigious smoke output. ``Too much
of a good thing,'' said Joe Marchione of Absecon, N.J. ``It's great
if you have a wide-open space, but in my train room, you need
oxygen after two minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   One thing is for sure: these are definitely not your
grandfather's toy trains.

</P>
<P>
   History doesn't record when a toy train first ran on a track
around a gaily decorated fir tree in an American living room, a
scene that soon became engraved in our holiday tradition. But it
probably happened in the early 1890s and the brightly painted
tinplate locomotive, imported from Germany or England, would have
been powered by a clockwork motor or even live steam. In 1896, a
now-forgotten electrical supply company in Ohio name Carlisle &AMP;
Finch became the first U.S. electric-train maker when it sold a
polished-brass trolley powered by wet-cell batteries.
</P>
<P>
   That toy may have inspired young Joshua Lionel Cowen, who was
mechanically inclined and fascinated by the world's newest marvel _
electricity. In 1901 he produced an open-top, battery-operated
railcar that he sold to New York City merchants as window dressing.
His idea: the circling train, carrying small items of merchandise,
would bring customers into the store. It did, but a lot of them
wanted one of the electrical toys for themselves. And a railroad
empire _ the Lionel Lines _ was born.
</P>
<P>
   In a few years, Lionel's rather crude toy trains were being
powered by transformers that converted 120-volt household current
to a safe 16 volts, and while the company experimented with an
electronic-control system after World War II, the technology to run
electric trains didn't really change much until the Trainmaster
Command Control was introduced.
</P>
<P>
   More realistic, die-cast steam locomotives appeared in the late
1930s, but prototypical detail was slow to come to O-gauge trains
until the early 1990s, when a Lionel consultant named Mike Wolf
began to develop very realistic trains. Wolf went on to found MTH
(for Mike's Train House).
</P>
<P>
   The variety of O-gauge trains that are available today from
Lionel, MTH and other manufacturers like K-Line, Williams, Weaver
and Atlas is unprecedented. They range from a 32-inch-long model of
the most powerful steam engine ever built _ a 24-wheel monster (the
Yellowstone) that hauled ore from Minnesota iron mines to the port
of Duluth _ to the gas-powered doodlebug that carried passengers
and freight on little-used branch lines back in the 1920s.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Chris Smithson, a spokesman for MTH Electric Trains in
Columbia, Md., said that Wolf wants the company to produce replicas
of every steam engine, every diesel, every freight car ever made.
And Bob Grubba, director of engineering for Lionel Corp. in
Chesterfield, Mich., said that a dozen or so newly tooled
locomotives would be on the shelves in his company's familiar
orange-and-blue boxes over the next year. MTH even makes a New York
City subway train that rattles over the D Line from 205th Street in
the Bronx to Coney Island in Brooklyn, with the speaker blaring as
it announces stops at Yankee Stadium, Columbus Circle, Rockefeller
Center, Times Square, Herald Square, Chinatown and Prospect Park.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Brown, a toy train hobbyist in Falls Church, Va., told
cyberengineers on Compuserve's Train Net forum that the sound
effects ``brought back fond, almost tearful memories'' for his
wife, a New Yorker. But MTH's MTA set could be improved, Brown
said, by covering the sides of the four cars with graffiti.
</P>
<P>
   Smithson said that MTH tries to find the builder's blueprint for
all of its locomotives. ``Diesel manufacturers like General
Electric are still in business, but a lot of steam-engine
blueprints are out there, too,'' he said. ``And if the actual
engine exists, we'll go out and take pictures.'' Some details like
steam pipes will be three-dimensional on the high-end scale-size
models, which are 1/48th actual size, but will be molded into the
cast-aluminum boiler or plastic shell of semiscale locomotives in
the less expensive Rail King line.
</P>
<P>
   But Lionel has also introduced a locomotive called the Phantom
whose futuristic profile and Halloweenish sounds will never be seen
or heard on a real railroad. The model has created a lot of
controversy on toy train discussion groups. Traditionalists hate
it. Kids love it and demand one of their own.
</P>
<P>
   Like MTH, Lionel is going for sound verisimilitude. Recently
Grubba was packing up his digital recording equipment for a field
trip in the South to capture the sounds of real locomotives for the
next generation of Lionel trains. ``The Tennessee Valley Authority
has a Fairbanks-Morse Trainmaster,'' he said. ``There aren't many
of those left running. Then there's a Hudson in Chattanooga.''
</P>
<P>
   The genuine locomotive sounds and other effects will be mixed at
the state-of-the-art California studio of the singer Neil Young, an
investor in the latest reincarnation of Lionel, which has had
several owners in recent decades. But he's not the first hugely
popular vocalist to be a toy-train enthusiast. Frank Sinatra built
a full-size version of a plastic Lionel freight station on his Palm
Springs estate to house an elaborate 12-by-24-foot layout and
cabinets full of trains from early tin-plate to modern days. You
could say he was the chairman of the board of his own railroad.

BURYING THE PAST: SLAVE DESCENDANT LETS EX-MASTER'S KIN USE
CEMETERY 

</HEADLINE>

c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRAIRIE LEA, Texas _ Two men, one black and one white, stand
sentry-still, lost in reflection as they contemplate the fading
name on a granite tombstone in a backroads cemetery.
</P>
<P>
   The black man, Herman Harris, whose family owns the cemetery and
surrounding farmland, comes to the point.
</P>
<P>
   ``There lies your great-great-grandfather, the man who brought
my folks from Alabama as slaves,'' he tells the white man. ``Right
there _ mmh-mmh-mmh.''
</P>
<P>
   That Harris is friends with Addison Flowers Jr., the descendant
of the slave owner, is poignant. But the circumstance that brought
them here on this crystal-clear autumn day is more poignant still.
</P>
<P>
   They met last June when an ailing Flowers arrived unexpectedly
at Harris' doorstep to ask permission to have his cremated remains
scattered over the old family cemetery.
</P>
<P>
   Harris, 46, an administrator &UR;  &LR; at a nearby private prison,
recalls the encounter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was at the house getting ready to go to the Luling
Watermelon Thump parade when somebody knocked at my door,'' Harris
said. ``I thought, `Who's going to bother me now?' I went to the
door and this man said, `I'm Addison Flowers.' Oh, no. I knew
exactly who he was. I was shaking. I was overcome by a spiritual
feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   Flowers, a 50-year-old water-wastewater plant technician from
Houston, had no qualms about asking a favor of someone who might be
angry about historic injustices.
</P>
<P>
   ``I figured there were two answers they could give me: yes or
no,'' he said. ``I got the answer I wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   Prairie Lea, a community of 250 people in south-central Texas,
is about 145 miles west of Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Both Flowers and Harris agree that a warm friendship has grown
out of that meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``What his great-great-grandfather used to be doesn't mean
anything,'' Harris said. ``We can't help what happened 140 or 150
years ago ... Some people might have animosity over this type of
thing, but I don't. ...Who knows, if old Addison Johnson hadn't
brought us here as slaves, we might not own this property today.
</P>
<P>
   ``This man (Flowers) came to visit me. That was good. It was an
epiphany.'' &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Not much is known about Addison Johnson, the man buried in the
cemetery now owned by descendants of the slaves he held. He was
born in Virginia, founded a number of Baptist churches, lived in
San Augustine, then apparently raised cotton on the banks of the
San Marcos with the help of an undetermined number of slaves.
</P>
<P>
   He died in 1877 at age 64 to become, as his epitaph puts it,
``Another gem in the savior's crown, another soul in heaven.'' His
wife, who died in 1912, is buried at his side.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel pretty certain that he did not own a large number of
slaves,'' Flowers said. ``He was not a wealthy man.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the slaves was Henry Johnson, patriarch of what was to
become the Harris family.
</P>
<P>
   The freed slave and his descendants _ a long line of farmers and
preachers _ were buried in a separate cemetery near their church.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently in the early 20th century, the prominent McKean
family purchased the Johnson farmstead _ almost 300 fertile acres
in Guadalupe County across the San Marcos River from this tiny
Caldwell County community.
</P>
<P>
   During World War I, Harris' grandfather, Sam Harris, and other
members of his family operated a dairy for the McKeans.
</P>
<P>
   In 1936, the McKeans asked the Harris family to run the old
Johnson farm. Harris said his family's relationship with the
McKeans was one of mutual respect, even in a time and place marked
by lingering racism.
</P>
<P>
   ``The McKeans didn't care if you were black or white if you
worked,'' Harris said. ``My folks were hard-working, humble,
church-going people.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1946, the McKeans offered to sell the land to the Harris
family. ``They wanted my grandfather and his sons to own it,''
Harris said. ``They knew the story of us having worked that
property (as slaves). ... This wasn't a handout, it was a helping
hand.''
</P>
<P>
   Members of the extended family pooled their savings and were
ready to use veterans land program benefits available to younger
members who had served in the military. But the family still lacked
the $1,000 down payment necessary for the purchase.
</P>
<P>
   To raise the money, the family traveled to Kerr County to pick
pecans.
</P>
<P>
   The farm, costing $13,600, was jointly purchased by Sam Harris'
two sons. Today, it's owned by Herman Harris and his cousin, Seguin
City Councilwoman Maxine Harris Stokes.
</P>
<P>
   In 1956, oil was discovered on the Harris farm, and today the
land is the site of about 60 producing wells.
</P>
<P>
   Flowers said he is pleased with the Harris family's good
fortune.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tables,'' he said, ``have turned.'' &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
DIAGNOSED WITH PARKINSON'S DISEASE &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Reared in Katy _ about 25 miles west of downtown Houston _
Flowers said he long had known of his ties to Addison Johnson, who
moved to the Guadalupe County farm from San Augustine in 1851. But
he only occasionally visited the area of the old farmstead and
never had met members of the Harris family.
</P>
<P>
   Only when he was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease, a
progressive brain disorder that leads to loss of muscle control
and, sometimes, dementia, did Flowers begin to think of eternity
and the disposition of his mortal remains.
</P>
<P>
   Although treatment in some cases can minimize Parkinson's
symptoms for long periods, Flowers said he had witnessed his
father's slow decline from the disease. Like his father, he said,
he expects someday to ``just give up the will to live.''
</P>
<P>
   Flowers said the main reason he sought out the Harris family was
revulsion at the prospect of being buried in East Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``My ancestors had enough good sense to get out of East Texas,''
he said, ``and I don't see why I should go back. My wife is from
Apple Springs and she wants to be buried in deep East Texas where
the trees don't fork. Where you can call `Bubba' and five people
will answer. Myself, I want my ashes scattered at the old family
cemetery. I just don't have any use for pine trees or most of the
people who live under them.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond his distaste for East Texas, Flowers said he is eager to
meet Addison Johnson on ``resurrection morning.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Three people have been named after him _ me, my father and his
uncle _ and nobody knows why. I figured that if I were as close to
him as possible, at the resurrection, I could ask him some
questions. I'd like to ask him what he did that was so special that
we were named for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Flowers alludes often and without apparent emotion to his
disease, although his comments sometimes bring conversations to an
awkward halt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm already deteriorating,'' he said. ``There are times when I
can't take care of myself.''
</P>
<P>
   At one point, Flowers handed his ``business card'' to one of
Harris' relatives.
</P>
<P>
   It read:
</P>
<P>
   ``Addison Flowers Jr. Gentleman, scholar, master of seven dead
languages, defender of The Faith, Country and Freedom, unweaned
male child, lover of women and other objects of beauty, teller of
tall tales, dragon slayer, rescuer of damsels in distress.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The next time you get one of these cards,'' Flowers said,
``there will be a date on the bottom and you will know that I'm
dead. It's been a good life _ so far.''

BETTY FRIEDAN SAYS CHILD CARE IS NOW THE KEY ISSUE FOR WOMEN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, Nov. 29)   (Filed in ``w'' and ``l'' categories)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JUDY HOLLAND  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As the grande dame of feminism, Betty Friedan
helped lead women into a work world of better pay and improved
access to jobs and promotions.
</P>
<P>
   Now, at 77, this grandmother of seven says child care is the
next challenge for women.
</P>
<P>
   Feminists ``will not be able to declare victory until the
raising of children is seen equally as a man's responsibility as
well as a woman's,'' she declared in a recent interview.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. society is too ``mother-centered,'' in Friedan's view.
``Issues like child care are seen as women's issues and the
explicit assumption is that the mother is guilty if she goes to
work or school. Everything is the mother's job. But it should be a
combination.''
</P>
<P>
   Friedan says the single greatest need for women these days is a
national child-care program. This is one of her frequent topics as
she travels around the global lecture circuit.
</P>
<P>
   Friedan, who founded the National Organization for Women and was
its first president from 1966 to 1970, is critical of the
organization in its present mode.
</P>
<P>
   NOW ``lacks the proper leadership'' and should focus on trying
to make child care and parenting less daunting for working women,
rather than fighting for issues such as gay rights. Friedan coined
the term ``lavender menace'' in the 1970s when criticizing NOW for
adding lesbian issues to its agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Although Friedan doesn't mention the current NOW president by
name, her obvious target is NOW president Patricia Ireland. Under
Ireland's direction, NOW has focused on such issues as violence
against women, sexual harassment, abortion rights, family planning
and lesbian and gay rights.
</P>
<P>
   Ireland responds to the criticism by arguing that the feminist
movement ``is a movement that opposes oppression'' in any form.
From that vantage point, child-care issues ``are too narrow a focus
for the feminist movement,'' says Ireland, who goes out of her way
to praise Friedan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Betty has an extraordinarily important role in the history of
this wave of the women's rights movement and its current
campaigns,'' Ireland said. ``I would not relegate her to history,
she is very much an instigator and an active leader.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Ireland says Friedan only helped one segment of
American women. She ``gave voice to a particular constituency,
which was women like her, women who had been full-time moms and
wives and who had a disquiet that they had no name for. And it was
and is an important constituency. It gave a identity to the
burgeoning feminist movement.''
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Ireland describes herself as ``a full service''
feminist, dedicated to a broad range of issues including lesbian
rights, ``which to me, is a core value.'' She also says child care
should not be the top priority for women. Instead, it should be
getting equal pay at a time in which they earn 74 cents on the
dollar compared to men.
</P>
<P>
   Friedan, whose father was a wealthy merchant, describes an
affluent childhood in Peoria, Ill., in which her mother ``rang a
bell'' if she needed something.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Ireland, Friedan says the battle for women's rights is
just about won and says ``it's just a matter of time'' before women
reach full equality.
</P>
<P>
   Friedan is now the same age as veteran astronaut John Glenn.
Although she had her second heart valve replacement last year,
Friedan is going full blast, spending her mornings writing in her
large sunny living room in the Wyoming, an ornate apartment
building in the racially diverse Adams Morgan section of
Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   She fills her days and nights with lectures, panels, writing and
hobnobbing with the intellectual elite; she appears to relish her
role as a historic symbol for women's rights.
</P>
<P>
   Her living room is furnished with exquisite antique furniture,
brightly colored modern paintings and an oil portrait of herself
decades ago with longer, darker hair _ and with the books that
helped make Betty Friedan a household name.
</P>
<P>
   Friedan's most famous book, ``The Feminine Mystique,'' published
in 1963, helped spark the fight for equal rights and opportunities
for women. After producing other books on women's rights, she
broadened her repertoire in 1993 with ``The Fountain of Age,''
about how people will grow older with increased vigor and
creativity.
</P>
<P>
   Ben Wattenberg, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise
Institute who has known Friedan for many years, says she is an
``idea-preneur'' and an ``institution,'' whose book on aging ``is
worth its weight in gold.'' He says Friedan exemplifies how people
are increasingly growing older with vigor.
</P>
<P>
   Friedan's daughter, Emily, a pediatrician in Williamsville,
N.Y., said her mother always had an immense amount of energy, but _
referring to her mother's frenetic schedule _ adds: ``Some of us
think she's running, that she's trying to keep one step ahead of
the grim reaper.''
</P>
<P>
   Divorced for nearly three decades, she has two other grown
children, Jonathan an engineer in Philadelphia, and Daniel, a
Rutgers University physicist in Princeton, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Friedan goes out to lunch and dinner almost every day she's at
home in Washington, and she often attends social events or lectures
at clubs where she is a member, such as the Cosmos Club, the Arts
Club of Washington or the National Press Club.
</P>
<P>
   A small woman with wispy white-grey hair and a penchant for
offbeat clothing, she is often approached by middle-aged or elderly
strangers who stop to thank her for her role in the feminist
movement.
</P>
<P>
   While she doesn't cook, she is apt to invite friends over for
cocktails in her dining room, where she keeps a well-stocked bar on
a large mirrored antique sideboard.
</P>
<P>
   Friedan is a die-hard fan of President Clinton, and praises him
for policies that have helped women, such as expanding the earned
income tax credit for lower income families so they can use the
money for child care.
</P>
<P>
   These days, in her lectures and writing, she is casting out
broad intellectual nets in search of solutions to the dilemma of
how to strike a better balance between work and family.
</P>
<P>
   She has been cautious to include men as well as women in her
discussions of how to lighten the parenting load on working
mothers.
</P>
<P>
   ``A person with her history and visibility is capable of drawing
attention to ideas and can really exert influence,'' said William
Galston, a fellow at the Brookings Institution, a Washington think
tank. ``She is playing a leading role in a policy game.''

BETTY FRIEDAN SAYS CHILD CARE IS NOW THE KEY ISSUE FOR WOMEN 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As the grande dame of feminism, Betty Friedan
helped lead women into a work world of better pay and improved
access to jobs and promotions.
</P>
<P>
   Now, at 77, this grandmother of seven says child care is the
next challenge for women.
</P>
<P>
   Feminists ``will not be able to declare victory until the
raising of children is seen equally as a man's responsibility as
well as a woman's,'' she declared in a recent interview.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. society is too ``mother-centered,'' in Friedan's view.
``Issues like child care are seen as women's issues and the
explicit assumption is that the mother is guilty if she goes to
work or school. Everything is the mother's job. But it should be a
combination.''
</P>
<P>
   Friedan says the single greatest need for women these days is a
national child-care program. This is one of her frequent topics as
she travels around the global lecture circuit.
</P>
<P>
   Friedan, who founded the National Organization for Women and was
its first president from 1966 to 1970, is critical of the
organization in its present mode.
</P>
<P>
   NOW ``lacks the proper leadership'' and should focus on trying
to make child care and parenting less daunting for working women,
rather than fighting for issues such as gay rights. Friedan coined
the term ``lavender menace'' in the 1970s when criticizing NOW for

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Twilight on the Brooklyn Bridge. A new moon has risen
on silent wings as the setting sun envelops the harbor in a golden
embrace.
</P>
<P>
   It is the time of day that Ingo Maurer, arguably the world's
Merlin of light, calls ``l'heure bleu,'' the bittersweet moment
when, unwilling to yield to darkness, the city summons forth light.
</P>
<P>
   The hour is also a feeling. ``Light is immaterial,'' he will
tell you, walking briskly among the pylons, wool scarf cascading
behind him. ``You grab it with your mind, your soul, your heart. I
think of it as a friendly ghost that surrounds us.''
</P>
<P>
   At times using little more than a bulb, the designer, from
Munich, Germany, has spent the past three decades capturing the
emotion of light in physical form. A sense of wonder is always
there: a fly alights on a three-dimensional hologram of a light
bulb (1977); for Kokoro, part of a new series, a quaking red heart,
made of pulled and folded paper, curls longingly around a tiny bulb
encased in wire.
</P>
<P>
   In this season of light, it is appropriate that Maurer, 66, is
the subject of ``Projects 66: Campana/Ingo Maurer,'' an exhibition
of his designs opening Friday at the Museum of Modern Art. The show
also features the work of the young Brazilian furniture designers
Fernando and Humberto Campana, who make handcrafted furniture from
cotton rope, garden hoses and other offbeat materials.
</P>
<P>
   In an era of aggressive Darth Vadar-like lighting, Maurer
celebrates lightness in joyful creations that at times seem more
like living creatures than objects. The son of a fisherman, he grew
up on an island on Lake Constance in southern Germany, and a part
of him, despite his worldly demeanor and a mane of silver hair
tucked fashionably behind his ears, remains the little boy
suspended over the bow of his father's fishing boat, peering into
the dappled reflections.
</P>
<P>
   Maurer's career has coincided with technical revolutions in
lighting, especially low-voltage tungsten halogen, which he has
exploited to the hilt for its minimalist qualities. But the essence
of his designs springs from what he calls ``hasard,'' the French
word for ``chance'' _ unexpected moments when light makes a sensual
impression. It can happen on the Brooklyn Bridge, or walking
through an olive grove and seeing the play of light when the wind
flickers the leaves. For him, it often happens in winter, when the
sun is low and alights on particles of dust, illuminating the
suspended movement in ``a kind of dancing.''
</P>
<P>
   Such ``sense impressions,'' as he calls them, can percolate for
years before Maurer, who has no formal academic design training and
began as a typographer's apprentice, finally translates them into a
design. ``I wait until the moment comes,'' he explained, his
conversation frequently interrupted by gestures. ``I don't force
it.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea for Ya Ya Ho (1984), perhaps his most influential and
copied design, was born on a New Year's Eve in Haiti. In this
graceful lighting system, which, like many of his designs, lets the
owner decide the final configuration, tiny halogen bulbs become
miniature tightrope walkers, suspended from cables stretching from
wall to wall. Radical in that it floats light in space with nearly
invisible structure _ achieving lightness quite literally _ it was
inspired by this memory: ``We came out into this little piazza, and
there were two strings running across it, with one huge glass light
bulb trying to fight the morning sun. I was so thrilled, because
the bulb had no socket, and was soldered straight onto the wire. I
could have stood there forever,'' he said, his ebullience emitting
wattage.
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, he began designing Ya Ya Ho, an arduous
technical challenge that took two-and-one-half years and almost
left him bankrupt. (The loan officer said, ``Why don't you do
something rustic?'')
</P>
<P>
   ``Light is a very psychoactive material, if you can call it a
material,'' he said, as the bulbs of the Brooklyn Bridge were
beginning to make light. ``It can be tender, or determined and
strong. I can't think of a dull moment of light.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, Maurer has drawn inspiration from rigatoni pasta
and Alexander Calder. In his Munich studio, nicknamed the
``designery,'' he frequently experiments with found objects, most
famously a bunch of red plastic stork legs spied at Woolworth's
(the salesclerk wouldn't sell him legs without bodies, so, he
confesses, he stole them). ``I was immediately excited about those
legs,'' he recalled, still charged up. ``When I held them in my
hand, I knew exactly what I was going to do!'' The result was
Bibibibi, a charming avianlike lamp that looks ready to cross the
road.
</P>
<P>
   His Porca Miseria (``Damn It!'' in Italian) is an explosion of
broken dishes in which rays of light escape through skewed, broken
silverware and porcelain. More ``a burst of fury than a
chandelier,'' in the words of the Modern's associate curator Paola
Antonelli, it mimics Maurer's love of slow-motion implosions in
movies like ``Zabriskie Point.'' It was originally designed for the
sterile kitchen of a sprawling palazzo. ``People with a Borghese
attitude make me nervous,'' he said, somewhat conspiratorially.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   For Maurer, the essence of beauty remains a single light bulb,
the perfect meeting, he says, of poetry, industry and design. At
once strong and fragile, the bulb has been a leitmotif, from his
First Bulb lamp (1966), a Pop Art bulb-within-a-bulb to the recent
Edison hologram, in which 2,250 individual images of a light bulb
were bonded onto an acrylic cylinder, fulfilling his 20-year dream
of ``making light from a nonexisting light bulb.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a sense impression of a light bulb that, by hasard,
filled the hollows of his life and ultimately changed its
direction. In his early 30's, having spent three-and-one-half years
working as a graphic designer in San Francisco, he was lying on a
mattress in a cheap Italian pensione while on vacation, when his
mind drifted to the image of a naked light bulb, ``an impression of
light'' from his childhood. He remembered the bulb suspended from a
window his father had cut in the wall between the bathroom and the
anteroom. He began sketching a design on the mattress and went to
Murano, Italy, the glass-blowing center, to recreate it.
</P>
<P>
   One of the more unusual aspects of Maurer's career is that, in
contrast with most designers, he goes it alone, designing,
manufacturing and distributing his own products (he also
manufactures the work of others he finds interesting). Though
committed to risk creatively _ ``If you don't take risks, you never
know yourself'' _ his independent status rose not from confidence,
he said, but from the insecurity he felt as a young man who went to
work at age 15 after his father died. (His father, an inventor by
avocation, created a ham smoker that, in the hands of Maurer's
three brothers, became the foundation for a large company.)
</P>
<P>
   ``I was not a trained designer,'' he said, somewhat reluctant to
talk about it. ``I was an insider and an outsider at the same time.
So I preferred to go through my own torture.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, observes the English designer Ron Arad, a frequent
collaborator, ``His poetry doesn't die when it goes into
production.''
</P>
<P>
   For their work at the Tel Aviv Opera House, Arad recalled,
Maurer spent almost a year designing an inverted chandelier for a
huge egg-shaped cavity in the foyer. The day before the building
opened, Maurer ``decided it was kitsch, a gigantic piece of
jewelry, and replaced it with a single light bulb.''
</P>
<P>
   Though there is no Maurer style, his lighting _ you can't really
call many of his designs lamps _ is playful and modest, bringing
spaces alive without taking them over. He clings to humor and
lightness, he says, in part as a reaction to his native Germany.
``It's a heavy country,'' he observes. ``It is almost as if,
through my work, I am reaching for oxygen.''
</P>
<P>
   His studio, home to a 65-member design and engineering team, is
located in a converted laundry building on the Kaiserstrasse, the
Greenwich Village of Munich. Beyond design, the team comes up with
the technical wizardry to realize his ideas, including
never-before-seen sockets, bulbs, wiring and dimmers. Three years
ago, ``after living in sin for 23 years,'' as he put it, he married
Jenny Lau, whom he describes as ``the column of my enterprise,'' in
a Las Vegas wedding chapel on her 50th birthday. (Ms. Lau is the
computer wiz; he doesn't touch them.) He has two daughters from a
previous marriage, and he seems genuinely proud to announce, is a
grandfather three times over.
</P>
<P>
   Like a grandfather, he enjoys giving pet names to his objects,
calling his latest family, or tribe, of paper lights the MaMo
Nouchies _ now on display at Moss, a SoHo design store, starting at
$735, and the Museum of Modern Art Design Store _ ``Ma'' is for
Maurer, ``Nouchies'' for Isamu Noguchi and the ``Mo'' for Dagmar
Mombach, a friend who developed a special technique for dyeing
paper _ a material prized for its soft ``quieting'' light _ and
pulling and wrapping it in a way that reconfigures the fibers.
Maurer reveres paper; like light, it is endlessly variable.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, Maurer has gotten more involved with ``urban
scenography,'' creating light environments within buildings and,
most recently, the Munich subway system, for which he has created a
series of lighted handmade-aluminum domes within the stations to
give people a ``safe, comfortable, taken-care-of-feeling.'' At the
furniture fairs in Milan, Italy, and Cologne, Germany, his
environments have become latter-day equivalents of 1960's
happenings that draw as many as 10,000 viewers to villa courtyards
or bridges across the Rhine. He is designing a long, golden
floating aluminum ribbon for a Neo-Classical palazzo in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't capture light, he insists, but merely observes it. At
sunset in a desert near Cairo, a place he goes to unwind, he
recently saw a spectacle he will never forget: thousands of empty
plastic bags filled with air blowing in the wind. ``They were going
bufff!... bufff!... from side to side,'' he said rhapsodically,
recreating the motion, ``thousands of them making waves, waiting
for the breeze. Oh, it was wonderful! As far as I could see there
were bags filled with light'' _ light, a riddle that never ends.

<P>
   The elaborate layouts that replicate real railroads in real
places in great detail are typically the province of modelers using
small-scale rather than traditional-size (O-gauge) trains, which
are approximately 1/48th the size of the prototypes.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the yearbook ``Great Model Railroads '99,''
published by Model Railroader Magazine, features a layout of the
old Boston &AMP; Maine Railroad's West Hoosic Division, which ran from
North Adams, Mass., to Bennington, Vt., as it looked in the 1950s.
The scale is HO (or half-O), and one inch on the model locomotive
equals 87 inches on the real thing. Smaller yet are N-scale (1:160)
trains that are decidedly not toys.
</P>
<P>
   The 22-by-26-foot B&AMP;M layout, created by Lou Sassi, includes a
high trestle, a stone-arch bridge, the Hoosac Tunnel and actual
buildings along the route, as well as trains that look like they've
been around the track more than a few years. As Chris Smithson, a
spokesman for MTH Electric Trains, said: ``No HO modeler with
self-respect would run an engine right out of the box. If they
didn't totally rebuild it, they'd weather it.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Lionel has introduced a Warhorse line of trains covered
with fake grit from smoking locomotives. Real trains rarely got
weekend baths.
</P>
<P>
   Newcomers or returnees to O-gauge railroading, on the other
hand, are usually content with building a layout that fits on a
4-foot-by-8-foot slab of green-painted plywood, adding a few
preassembled or snap-together plastic structures like a village
train station, a water tower, an engine house or a church.
</P>
<P>
   Catalogs from Lionel and MTH offer a number of track schemes for
a basement-corner layout as well as accessories. But if the urge to
run a larger and more realistic railroad strikes, the hobbyist can
turn to 3D Railroad Concept and Design from Abracadata
(www.abracadata.com). &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The program, for both Windows and Macintosh computers, lets the
user imagine a layout, add structures and scenery and run virtual
trains to test the design. The CD-ROM includes a comprehensive 3D
library of actual products, from trains to trees, from 60
manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   Abracadata also has a nifty computer game for make-believe
railroaders with no room for a toy-train layout. 3D Railroad Master
for Windows 95 and 98 puts you in the cab of a diesel engine with
realistic controls to adjust speed, change the train's direction,
blow the horn and hit the brakes to avoid game-ending derailments.
</P>
<P>
   The rumble of the train over the tracks is realistic if tiresome
after a time, and thankfully the pop background music can be turned

NEW BIOGRAPHY REWRITES MARGUERITE DURAS' HEROIC STATURE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ALAN RIDING   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ As writers often do, Marguerite Duras used her life as
raw material for her novels. More unusually, her literature then
took over her life to the point that a fictional character called
Marguerite Duras assumed control. The real Duras may have written
her books, but increasingly she lived in an imaginary world of her
own making. Unless, of course, she was merely playacting, which was
possible.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, she framed the basic question _ Who was Marguerite
Duras? _ that confronted Laure Adler when she set out to write the
first biography of Duras published in France since her death at 81
in March 1996. Not that Duras thought the question worth exploring.
Her biography, she said, already existed in her fiction. Unless she
had something to hide, which proved to be the case.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, on the sensitive topic of her response to Germany's
occupation of France in World War II, Duras portrayed _ and perhaps
believed _ herself to have been more heroic than the record
suggests. She remembered her time in the Resistance and ``forgot''
her earlier work with the Germans. And it was far from the only
occasion when her memory was selective.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the end of her life, she believed in the legend that she
had invented of her life,'' said Ms. Adler, 48, a historian by
training who now works as an editor at a French publishing house.
``She hid all the clues to her life, but with sincerity. She simply
did not want to remember certain things. In fact, she no longer
knew who she really was. Everything she created in her books became
truer than the life she had really lived.''
</P>
<P>
   During seven years of research and writing, then, it was Ms.
Adler's task to separate not lies from truth, but fantasy from
reality. For two years, she was able to listen to and interrogate
Duras, who by then was resigned to publication of the biography.
But perhaps because Duras was ailing, or perhaps because she was
quietly sabotaging the attempt to discover her, these interviews
often added to Ms. Adler's confusion.
</P>
<P>
   ``At times, I thought I was going crazy,'' the biographer
recalled during an interview on a balmy fall evening in a Left Bank
hotel. ``If I had known it would be that difficult, that she would
follow me night and day, even in my dreams, I would not have
embarked on the project. But once I had started, I could not stop.
I had to reach my destination, which was to find out if Marguerite
Duras truly existed as a woman or was the legend she had created.''
</P>
<P>
   What helped keep Ms. Adler going was a strong emotional bond
established with her subject in the late 1970s. At the time,
disconsolate over the loss of a child at birth, Ms. Adler stumbled
across Duras' novel ``The Sea Wall,'' which she said gave her ``the
will to live.'' She wrote to Duras at her Left Bank apartment on
the Rue de Saint-Benoit to thank her. and a friendship was born.
</P>
<P>
   Until then, before Duras became a best-selling author with ``The
Lover'' in 1982, Ms. Adler had read none of her books. ``Duras was
very loved by a very small number of loyal fans who were almost
like a sect,'' Ms. Adler said. ``I always had the impression that
she was very distant, very complicated and very narcissistic.''
</P>
<P>
   Even among female writers, Duras was not heralded.
</P>
<P>
   ``The aura of Simone de Beauvoir prevented Duras from existing
as a literary and intellectual force,'' Ms. Adler said. ``And in
pure literature, Marguerite Youcenar prevented Duras from taking
her natural place. Frankly, I don't think I would ever have entered
Marguerite Duras' imaginary world if it had not been for my special
circumstances.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, by the time she decided to write Duras' biography, Ms.
Adler felt she knew her subject well. Yet when she began her
research by reading all of Duras' books in chronological order,
starting with ``Les Impudents,'' published in 1943, she encountered
various styles and different worlds, ``the many writers who were
Marguerite Duras,'' as she put it. She also sensed that not all of
Duras' life was to be found in her books.
</P>
<P>
   She therefore traveled to Vietnam, where Duras was born and
reared and where her teen-age romance with an older man, recounted
in ``The Lover,'' took place. There Ms. Adler met people who had
known not only the lover in the story (``who was not as handsome as
she described him,'' Ms. Adler noted), but also Duras, her mother
and her older brother. And from this she put together a melancholic
picture of the young Duras.
</P>
<P>
   ``She lived an almost martyrlike childhood, her father dead,
without the love of her mother, disdained, humiliated, frequently
beaten by her mother and brother,'' Ms. Adler said. ``None of this
appears in her books, but I think it is one of the keys to
understanding her work. She wrote in order to suffer less, to purge
the pain and suffering she had known.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, when she moved to Paris to study law and political
science at 18, Duras felt liberated. She had a considerable sexual
appetite, Ms. Adler notes in her French-language biography,
``Marguerite Duras'' (Editions Gallimard), and she moved
comfortably in leftist intellectual circles. After graduation from
the Sorbonne, she married the writer Robert Antelme and found work
as a secretary in the French Ministry of Colonies, staying there
for a year after Germany occupied France in 1940.
</P>
<P>
   In uncovering what she calls Duras' ambiguous response to the
occupation, Ms. Adler also broke new ground. In her 1985 book, ``La
Douleur,'' later published in the United States as ``The War,''
Duras portrays herself as part of a French Resistance group headed
by Francois Mitterrand, who was France's president from 1981 to
1995. But like Mitterrand, who worked for the collaborationist
Vichy regime in 1941 and 1942, Duras joined the Resistance only in
mid-1943.
</P>
<P>
   More significantly, for one year beginning in July 1942, Ms.
Adler recounts, Duras worked for the Book Organization Commission
as secretary of the bureau that controlled paper supplies and, as
such, determined which books were published or censored. Many
authors were banned, but others depended on the whims and tastes of
the book commission. And there, Ms. Adler says, ``Marguerite in
effect decided.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Adler leaves open the question of whether, by working under
German orders, Duras was a collaborator, but she was disturbed by
the novelist's unwillingness to discuss the issue. ``Marguerite
waved away with her hand a question that irritated her,'' she
writes. ``She did not remember why or how she found herself in the
commission and pretended to give it no importance.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Another strange episode occurred in the summer of 1944 when
Antelme was arrested for work in the Resistance and, in hopes of
obtaining her husband's release, Duras befriended Charles Delval, a
Frenchman working with the Gestapo. Before Antelme was deported to
Germany (he survived the war and returned home emaciated one year
later), Duras and Delval were seen together so often that there was
speculation that they were having an affair.
</P>
<P>
   Yet after Paris was liberated in August 1944, Delval was seized
and interrogated by Mitterrand's Resistance group. In ``La
Douleur,'' Duras describes how she tortured him, a fact that she
later repeated in interviews, although no one apparently witnessed
her doing so. Certainly, Duras' fierce testimony against Delval
during his trial for collaboration helped persuade the court to
sentence him to death. ``Historians today believe that he did not
deserve to have been killed,'' Ms. Adler said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, what Ms. Adler calls ``a hallucinatingly bad novel''
was unfolding. Even before Antelme was arrested, Duras had taken a
young writer, Dionys Mascolo, as her lover. Yet after Delval's
arrest and during his trial, Mascolo had an affair with Delval's
wife, Paulette, with whom he had a child, born after Delval's
execution. Later, Mascolo returned to Duras, with whom he also had
a child, Jean.
</P>
<P>
   After the war, Duras joined the French Communist Party and,
while she was later expelled as part of a Stalinist purge, she
remained a committed leftist and participated in the May 1968
student movement. ``She ran through the streets like a gamine,''
Ms. Adler said. ``She participated in demonstrations, she moderated
meetings at the Sorbonne, she really believed that the revolution
would happen on the morrow.''
</P>
<P>
   By then, although still not a public favorite, Duras was a
prolific novelist, playwright and screenwriter (she wrote
``Hiroshima Mon Amour'' for Alain Resnais) while her personal life
included a succession of lovers.
</P>
<P>
   Then, from 1980, Yann Andrea Steiner, a homosexual 40 years her
junior, became the love, though not the lover, of the last 16 years
of her life. He encouraged her to publish ``The Lover'' and, as her
heavy smoking and drinking took an increasing toll on her health,
he also nursed her.
</P>
<P>
   ``She invented him even before they met,'' Ms. Adler said. ``She
had received letters from him and she created an image of him. When
they met, she turned him into this image.'' Steiner helped Ms.
Adler with her biography and when he read it, she recalled, he had
only one complaint: ``When I wrote that he slept in Marguerite's
bed, he said that was impossible because she talked and talked and
talked.''
</P>
<P>
   Unusually for a biography, Ms. Adler is also present in her
book, as if leading the reader through her research and discoveries
and frustrations. ``I felt this was more honest because there are
times when I do not know what is true or false, even what she has
told me,'' the author explained. ``I do not pretend to know the
truth about her. I have been re-reading some of her books and I
realize that I still have not fully understood her.''
</P>
<P>
   So, Ms. Adler was asked, does she like Duras less now that she
knows her better?
</P>
<P>
   ``No, a lot more,'' she said without hesitation. ``There were
times when I cried with rage at her violence, her egoism, her
spitefulness. I didn't like her ambiguity in the war. And I
couldn't stand the way she proclaimed herself to be a genius. But
she was also immensely courageous because she took the risk of
looking deep inside herself. She knew she was self-destructive, but
her writing saved her from madness. And that's what makes her a
great writer. In a memorably pure style, she speaks to us all.''

FORCE'S EIGHTH NHRA TITLE STOPS CLOCK ON MIDLIFE CRISIS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHN STURBIN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Twenty years ago, when John Force launched his NHRA Funny Car
career, his goals were as simple as arrive-and-survive.
</P>
<P>
   And smile for the camera.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first went to a race I wanted to do a burnout like Don
Prudhomme and Tom McEwen,'' said Force, rattling off the names of
his straight-line heroes. ``I wanted to stage, so somebody could
take my picture. I never thought about winning.''
</P>
<P>
   Seventy victories and eight championships later, Force has
established himself as the National Hot Rod Association's marquee
driver and its most marketable personality. Rising stars Gary
Scelzi (Top Fuel), Ron Capps (Funny Car) and Jeg Coughlin Jr. (Pro
Stock) spent 1998 positioning themselves to carry the NHRA into the
next century.
</P>
<P>
   Still, if professional drag racing hopes to narrow the
popularity gap enjoyed by NASCAR's Winston Cup Series, it will do
so riding along with ``Brute'' Force at 320-plus mph.
</P>
<P>
   But for how much longer? Force, 49, said recently he is five
years away from considering retirement. Force wistfully hints that
he is going Top Fuel racing one of these days, just like four-time
Funny Car champions Prudhomme and Kenny Bernstein.
</P>
<P>
   Force certainly found it tougher to win NHRA finals during 1998.
He won three, 10 fewer than during his blockbuster 1996 season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a year where I'm fighting every minute,'' said Force,
who clearly was upstaged by Capps' five victories for car owner
Prudhomme. ``The fans know I'm slugging. They know a time will come
when I can't win.''
</P>
<P>
   That partly explains why Force is so proud of his eighth
championship. It is the most in Funny Car history but two fewer
than the 10 compiled by retired NHRA Pro Stock champion Bob
Glidden, drag racing's winningest driver.
</P>
<P>
   But Force's eight titles are one more than the seven won by
Richard Petty and Dale Earnhardt in Winston Cup, and ample fodder
for debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``To win the eighth title is a notch on the ladder, because
we're racing NASCAR,'' said Force, who has won all of his titles
during the 1990s. ``I know you can't compare Earnhardt or Petty
with me, but we can say we did something for NHRA Winston Drag
Racing. To have a stat where we did something like Earnhardt and
Petty, it's an accomplishment. It's like \Rwinning\S driver of the
year. It moved drag racing a notch on the ladder with NASCAR. It
was something for all of us. That's something I wanted to do.''
</P>
<P>
   For those with short memories, Force was voted driver of the
year in 1996 _ the first time a drag racer had won that prestigious
honor in its 30-year history. Force since has said that any number
of NHRA drivers _ from Glidden to Prudhomme to Bernstein to Shirley
Muldowney _ could have/should have won the award before he did.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just there at the right time,'' said Force, whose
off-beat personality and the NHRA's trademark fan accessibility
have proven a perfect match. ``If you let me out there by myself,
the stands would be empty. Yeah, I sell more stuff \Rsouvenirs and
collectibles\S than anybody, and I am a big name. But I ain't
carrying the sport. A lot of people say that, but I don't want to
allow myself to think that.''
</P>
<P>
   Force admittedly has an edge in one aspect of contemporary
motorsports _ corporate bucks and the technology money can buy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Castrol puts a ton of money in this car,'' said Force, driver
of the GTX Ford Mustang. ``You also have got to have the right
team, and I teamed up with the right guy in \Rcrew chief\S Austin
Coil. He is a genius in the sense that he creates his own
technology. I have Bernie Fedderly backing up Coil, a guy that ran
his own team and won championships. I have hired the right
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Even with that imposing support network, Force knows the clock
is ticking on his productive days inside the cockpit. Whether it be
in a Funny Car or Top Fueler, nobody outruns Father Time at
midlife.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like to talk about my age because then the sponsors
say, `What, he's getting too old,''' Force said. ``You've only got
to drive for five seconds, so a driver can last out here a long
time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am going to go until the graveyard. This is what I do. I
don't have any other life.'' \Ntagtop:John Sturbin, (817) 390-7408.
THE BUZZ IRL
</P>
<P>
   Arie Luyendyk's days of racing at Texas Motor Speedway in Fort
Worth are over. Luyendyk, winner of the inaugural and controversial
True Value 500K night race at TMS in June 1997, plans to retire
after the 1999 Indianapolis 500 on May 30. That means he will not
participate in the third annual True Value 500K, the first race
after the Indy 500, on June 12. Luyendyk's only appearance in the
1999 Pep Boys Indy Racing League Series will be at the Indianapolis
Motor Speedway, where he will drive for team owner Fred Treadway
for a fourth consecutive year. A two-time Indy 500 champion,
Luyendyk does plan to attend other IRL events as a team consultant
and sponsor spokesman. Luyendyk, a vigorous 45, said his decision
to retire was influenced by family considerations. He and his wife,
Mieke, have four children. The oldest, 17-year-old Arie Jr., is
competing in Formula Ford 1600s. ``The timing is right for me to
stop,'' said Luyendyk, who has won four IRL races, including one in
each of the league's three seasons. ``I want to help my son with
his racing. Fortunately, I'm able to retire on my own terms, and I
don't think there could be any better place to do it than at the
Indianapolis Motor Speedway.'' Luyendyk's 14 Indy 500 starts
include victories in 1990 and 1997, and more than $5.2 million in
earnings at The Brickyard alone. ...
</P>
<P>
   Luyendyk's legacy at TMS, of course, revolves around his
postrace protest of Billy Boat's victory in that inaugural True
Value race. Luyendyk stormed into Victory Lane, where he was
promptly slapped in the head and knocked to the ground by team
owner and four-time Indy 500 champion A.J. Foyt. But after an
all-night audit by the sanctioning U.S. Auto Club, Luyendyk was
declared the winner. ...
</P>
<P>
   IRL officials have hired the firms of Wieden &AMP; Kennedy and
Golin/Harris International to oversee its latest advertising and
public relations efforts. The IRL's so-called ``strategic marketing
plan'' will incorporate advertising, marketing and promotion on
many levels, including TV, print, the Internet, point-of-purchase
and event-site activities. Golin/Harris, which includes an office
in Dallas, lists McDonald's, DaimlerChrysler, Michelin and Texas
Instruments among its clientele. Wieden &AMP; Kennedy has worked
globally with Nike, Microsoft, Coca-Cola, Miller and ESPN.
CART
</P>
<P>
   Several CART FedEx Championship Series teams have begun
off-season preparations and testing for the 1999 season.
Newman/Haas Racing unloaded its first 1999 Swift on Tuesday at its
Lincolnshire, Ill., base. Delivery of the third-generation,
American-built Swift was more than a month earlier than in the
previous two off-seasons. Christian Fittipaldi is scheduled to test
the Kmart Swift/Ford on Dec. 14-16 at Sebring (Fla.) International
Raceway. Teammate Michael Andretti is not booked to turn a wheel on
the Texaco Havoline Swift/Ford until mid-January. ...
</P>
<P>
   PacWest Racing kicked off the testing season last week, when it
became the first Champ Car team to run the 1999 Reynard chassis.
Mauricio Gugelmin spent three days shaking down a Reynard at
Sebring, logging 600 trouble-free miles on his Hollywood PacWest
Mercedes. ``We kept it simple, but looked at a lot of things,'' the
Brazilian said. ``At least I know I have a car that I can use the
brakes to attack corners, rather than a car that wants to attack
me.'' ...
</P>
<P>
   Team KOOL Green's Paul Tracy spent two days testing Firestone
tires at the Miami-Dade Homestead (Fla.) Motorsports Complex's
1.502-mile oval last week. Tracy ran 226 laps on the second day in
a 1998 Reynard/Honda. The team is scheduled to receive its first
1999 Reynard around Dec. 6, and Dario Franchitti plans to test it
Dec. 11-12 at Homestead. ...
</P>
<P>
   Team Rahal's Bryan Herta (Shell Reynard/Ford) and Max Papis
(Miller Lite Reynard/Ford) are scheduled to test their 1999 chassis
at Firebird International Raceway outside Phoenix next week.
World of Outlaws
</P>
<P>
   A Sprint Car powered by a Mopar (Chrysler) engine never has won
a race in the Pennzoil World of Outlaws Series. That stat should
change in 1999, the first season of a recently announced multiyear
sponsorship agreement between Team Mopar and the Kinser Racing
father/son duo of Karl and Mark Kinser. Karl Kinser has won 15
series championships as a car owner, most recently in 1997. Gary
Stanton, who has campaigned a Mopar-powered car on the tour since
1996, will handle the engine-building duties. ``This new motor has
everything in the right place, and we think it's got a ton of
potential,'' said Mark Kinser, who finished 93 points behind cousin
Steve Kinser in the 1998 WoO driver's championship. ...
</P>
<P>
   Steve Kinser's 1998 Outlaws title, his first since trying the
Winston Cup ranks in 1995, did not come in typical ``King of the
Outlaws'' fashion. Kinser logged his second-lowest victory total
during a full Outlaws season with six, but bagged his record 15th
title on consistency. In 65 ``A'' Main events, Kinser finished in
the top-five 42 times and in the top-10 in 58 races. \Nname:_ Len

FAST LAPS
What off-season?
</P>
<P>
   Texas Motor Speedway will play host to several test sessions
during the first two weeks of December.
</P>
<P>
   Of most interest will be a Goodyear tire test involving NASCAR
regular Jeff Burton, winner of the inaugural 500-mile Winston Cup
race in Fort Worth in April 1997. The sessions on Dec. 8-9 will be
the first time a Cup driver has run full speed on the 1.5-mile
trioval since it was reconfigured and repaved after last spring's
water-marred Texas 500.
</P>
<P>
   Burton, driver of the No. 99 Exide Batteries Ford Taurus, is the
Roush Racing teammate of Mark Martin, who won last spring's Cup
race at TMS.
</P>
<P>
   Firestone kicks off the month with tests of its Pep Boys Indy
Racing League tires on Dec. 1-2. The tests will feature Plano's
Greg Ray, who recently signed a five-year contract as lead driver
for Team Menard.
</P>
<P>
   The IRL also has scheduled a test for five drivers looking to
secure their racing licenses for 1999. Three-time Indy 500 champion
Johnny Rutherford of Fort Worth and IRL regular Scott Goodyear are
scheduled to work with Ryan Newman of the U.S. Auto Club Silver
Crown series; Tony Elliott, USAC Sprint Cars; Jay Drake, USAC
Midgets, and Jac Haudenschild and Greg Hodnett of the Pennzoil
World of Outlaws Series.
</P>
<P>
   And A.J. Foyt Enterprises, home to reigning IRL champion Kenny
Brack and 1998 True Value 500K winner Billy Boat, tentatively has
scheduled a test for Dec. 10-11.
</P>
<P>
   All tests are closed to the public.
Last words
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm the oldest driver in the IRL, so I'm like a senior
citizen. I can do what I want.''''

</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Ga., Calif.)   (af)  
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   America Online made headlines this week for its deals with
Netscape and Sun Microsystems for $4.2 billion. Now the online
giant has made another deal, one that could net its new customers
... 50 cents?
</P>
<P>
   In a program it will roll out on mid-December, AOL (www.aol.com)
said it had authorized an online incentive company, Cybergold Inc.
of Berkeley, Calif., to pay 50 cents to every person who downloads
and installs AOL's chat software, called Instant Messenger.
</P>
<P>
   The program allows users to simultaneously send and receive
messages to one another through the Internet, without signing up
and paying for full AOL service.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, there is a catch. After a Web surfer downloads and installs
the software, Cybergold will place the 50 cents into a Cybergold
account. However, that money (which comes from fees paid by AOL to
Cybergold) can only be redeemed when the person accumulates $5 in
Cybergold credits. That means he or she must participate in other
Cybergold promotions (www.cybergold.com).
</P>
<P>
   One such program, for example, pays $5 for joining for a certain
period of time the Disney Blast online service. Nat Goldhaber,
chief executive of Cybergold, said the idea behind his marketing
concept was to provide ``an incentive to tell people that it makes
sense to pay attention.'' Translation: he wants to buy Web users'
attention.
</P>
<P>
   But why would AOL want to spend 50 cents to attract people to a
free service? The more chat-hungry surfers AOL attracts, the bigger
its user base _ which the company says is already at 35 million
people. And the more people who sign up, the more AOL can charge
advertisers who want to reach those users.
</P>
<P>
   Sounds like it might be worth holding out for 75 cents.
</P>
<P>
   Bell South has taken a page from the Lilliputians' book. Or a
pager, rather.
</P>
<P>
   In keeping with the theme in electronics of making
communications devices ever smaller, while cramming more functions
into them, Bell South is selling what it calls the Interactive
Paging Service.
</P>
<P>
   Well, gadget heads, it's not just a pager. That would be too
easy. It's also a device for sending and receiving e-mail. The
receiving part is obvious, but the sending is trickier, especially
given the diminutive size of the device.
</P>
<P>
   The 3{-inch tall by 2{-inch wide pager includes a tiny Qwerty
keyboard that lets a user send messages via wireless pager. The
keys do not lend themselves to penning a novel, but they get the
job done for messages, insisted John M. Kampfe, spokesman for Bell
South Wireless Data, a New Jersey-based subsidiary of Bell South
Corp. in Atlanta. ``You can type pretty quick with a little
practice,'' Kampfe said.
</P>
<P>
   The $359 pager can send messages to a telephone, where they can
be retrieved in the form of digitized voice mail. A second feature
permits two users of the pager to send e-mail instantaneously to
one another, with an interesting twist.
</P>
<P>
   If one user sends a message with the pager, he will know the
moment it is received, and also the moment it is opened by the
recipient. This, as Kampfe noted, may make it possible to know when
someone _ say, a boss or significant other _ isn't giving you the
time of day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now you know when you're getting blown off,'' he said. ``This
is positive acknowledgment to the max.''
</P>
<P>
   Next Tuesday , the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Los Angeles is
holding a conference called ``Internet 2000: Promise and Peril,''
designed to address privacy, free expression and hate on the Net _
and how to reconcile these ideas.
</P>
<P>
   One fact that is not in dispute, said Rabbi Abraham Cooper,
associate dean of the center, is that hate speech on the Net is on
the rise. In late 1997, the center found some 600 sites promoting
racism and bigotry on the Web. In a new study to be released in
January, the center found more than 1,000.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper said one new tactic of the hate-site promoters was to
target children with animation and games, like the site that
encourages children to play a Doom-like game in which the object is
to shoot Jews and African Americans.
</P>
<P>
   The Rabbi said that the typical antidote to such hate speech was
free speech, which lets the rational ideas compete with irrational
ones. But he said that antidote did not always work in cyberspace,
since a Web page promoting hate doesn't leave room for the
proverbial ``other side of the story.''
</P>
<P>
   To further illuminate the issue, and find ways to combat online
hate speech, the center on Tuesday will convene a roundtable with
business and legal luminaries, including Raymond Smith, chief
executive of the Bell Atlantic Corp., and Myer Berlow, senior vice
president of America Online. Later in the day, the conference will
address how teachers and schools can deal with these issues.
</P>
<P>
   The center's Web site, www.wiesenthal.com, will provide audio
from next Tuesday's events. &QL;

   Major news organizations may wince at first glance at the latest
figures on the decline in popularity of their online sites.
</P>
<P>
   According to Media Metrix, an online research company that
compiles monthly figures Internet usage, in October, MSNBC
attracted 5.1 million unique visitors, down from 6.4 million in
September.
</P>
<P>
   CNN dropped to 4.6 million from 7.1 million; USA Today to 3.3
from 3.9 and The New York Times site to 1.6 million from 1.8
million.
</P>
<P>
   Did the nation suddenly become less interested in the day's
events? Only temporarily, according to Doug McFarland, senior vice
president of Media Metrix.
</P>
<P>
   McFarland says the declines seem so large only because they
follow a sharp rise in September, fueled by the publication of the
Starr report and other revelations about President Clinton and
Monica Lewinsky. More generally, the researcher said that the
recent historical data consistently showed that news site
popularity correlates very clearly with news events.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a pattern we have seen very, very consistently for three
years now,'' he said, adding, ``I try not to get into
prognostication, but I predict when we get the November data, the
traffic will be up because of the election.''
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of journalists, techies and salesman descended upon
Las Vegas recently for a sensory overload of a convention
experience known as Comdex. A research consortium believes there is
a much better way to have such a meeting of the minds, one that
makes it possible for visitors to never leave their homes.
</P>
<P>
   Last weekend, that consortium, Contact Consortium, a nonprofit
group based in Santa Cruz, Calif., that promotes the development of
online communities, held what may be the largest-ever virtual
conference. Called Avatars '98, the convention, appropriately, was
designed as a meeting place for individuals and companies
interested in virtual worlds, and the avatars _ those little online
pictures and animated stand-ins for real people _ that populate
them.
</P>
<P>
   In the three previous years, the Avatar conference was held
in-person in convention halls, but this year, the group decided to
``put our money where our mouths are,'' according to Bruce Damer,
director of the Contact Consortium (www.ccon.org).
</P>
<P>
   Some of the vestiges of the conventional convention remained.
Visitors signed in at the group's Web site, then proceeded to troll
a massive virtual convention hall, rubbing shoulders with other
avatars and stopping at virtual booths, which looked,
appropriately, like animated three-dimensional booths. Damer said
the convention site was modeled after the Sand's Convention Center
in Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   To interact, the avatars could wave to one another, and speak by
typing their conversations onto the screen.
</P>
<P>
   In all, 4,000 people attended the 24-hour event, Damer said.
Alas, he does not expect the concept to ever totally replace the
in-person version, which enables colleagues, friends and
prospective business partners to press the flesh, not the mouse.
``They wear me out,'' Damer said, ``but I love them.''
</P>
<P>
   A good video game player needs good hand/eye coordination. But
one company contends it particularly favors good right-hand/eye
coordination.
</P>
<P>
   LefKey International, (www.lefkey.com) a Massachusetts company,
is hoping to revive the idea of the left-handed keyboard, aimed at
game players of that persuasion. The idea is not new, but never
caught on, according to LefKey's president, Mark Giordani, who said
he was negotiating deals with major catalog companies to carry the
keyboard (along with the company's left-handed mouse).
</P>
<P>
   So what makes the $129 keyboard left-handed? Nothing too fancy.
Principally, the number pad and Insert, Home, etc. keys are moved
to the left side, ostensibly allowing southpaws to use their
strongest hands on the arrow keys and number pad, from whence many
action games are controlled. Perhaps this will work well for
left-handed accountants too.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It was Veterans Day, and as Harold Leventhal ducked
into Carnegie Hall through a rear door and followed a yellowish
strip painted over an Indian red floor, you got the feeling he had
been here before.
</P>
<P>
   ``Harold!'' boomed a voice from the back of what's officially
known as the ticket office office, ``How are you? You're looking
great. Today's your day, Harold. You're a veteran, a veteran
promoter.''
</P>
<P>
   As Leventhal was quick to remind him, he actually is an Army
veteran, with a memorable stint in the Signal Corps in India in
World War II. But if anyone in American music qualifies as a
veteran promoter, it is Harold Leventhal, who began as a song
plugger for Irving Berlin, survived the blacklist with the folk
singing Weavers, put on Bob Dylan's first concert hall date and has
been bringing artists to places like Carnegie Hall for nearly half
a century.
</P>
<P>
   He is pretty much down to one event a year, two Thanksgiving
weekend concerts that began with the Weavers around 1960, then
featured Pete Seeger and for years now have featured Arlo Guthrie,
with Seeger as a guest this year at Carnegie. The concerts on the
Friday and Saturday after Thanksgiving keep adding new generations.
This year they include Seeger's grandson, Tao Rodriguez, and
Guthrie's children, Abe and Sarah.
</P>
<P>
   But pushing 80, Leventhal remains a living history of
20th-century music from the big-band era through the folk revival,
when he managed or promoted concerts for such artists as the
Weavers, Seeger, Theodore Bikel, Judy Collins and Joan Baez and
handled the business affairs for Woody Guthrie as he began to show
the effects of Huntington's disease, the degenerative illness that
finally killed him in 1967. He now spends much of his time managing
the Woody Guthrie archives with Guthrie's daughter, Nora.
</P>
<P>
   ``Harold's a remarkable person, totally honest with a great
sense of humor,'' said Seeger, who pays tribute to Leventhal in the
program notes for the Thanksgiving concert. ``He did something
extraordinary for the Weavers. He stuck his neck out and had faith
in us when others wouldn't. You might say he had faith in America,
too.''
</P>
<P>
   Leventhal never much went beyond the artists and ethos of the
folk era, but he doesn't feel he missed much, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got some calls from rock groups,'' he said without much
interest. Prodded for examples, he cites ``A trio. I can't recall
the name. Stills was one of them.'' It was Crosby, Stills and Nash.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I wanted to stay where I was comfortable and stay with
people I thought were making a good contribution. I never felt
comfortable in the rock world. The behavior. The whole scene. It
wasn't my style.''
</P>
<P>
   Leventhal's style mixes liberal politics, the Bronx of the
Depression years and the laid-back sensibilities of the folk era.
Wearing a gray sweater vest and sky blue turtleneck over his Santa
Claus physique, he has the look of a frizzy Jewish Buddha and the
ability to drop remarkable names casually, the way Mel Brooks'
2,000-Year-Old Man does.
</P>
<P>
   Leventhal was born in Ellenville, N.Y., in 1919, the youngest of
five children of immigrant parents, his mother from the Ukraine,
his father from Lithuania. His father died of the flu eight weeks
after Leventhal was born. The next year the family moved to the
Lower East Side, his mother working as a janitor in the building
where they lived, and then to the Bronx in 1933.
</P>
<P>
   Without a record player in the house, music was not a big part
of his youth, except for an occasional trip to the Yiddish theaters
on Second Avenue. But his older brother, Herbert, got a job with
Irving Berlin, and Leventhal followed him there, soon working as a
song plugger, taking Berlin's songs to big bands like Harry James'
or singers like Dinah Shore, then staying out schmoozing until 2 in
the morning at Lindy's and other nightspots. A favorite memory is
pairing Frank Sinatra with Benny Goodman as a one-night fill in.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow he found a way to transplant those skills to India when
he served there as a corporal in the Signal Corps.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most charismatic man I ever met was Nehru,'' he allowed in
talking about his World War II days. A photo of the two hangs in
his office. ``Handsome. Debonair. Gracious in his manner. A very
impressive man.''
</P>
<P>
   It turns out India's first prime minister also gave him a letter
of introduction to take to Gandhi.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first day I met him was a Thursday; he doesn't talk on
Thursday,'' Leventhal recalled. ``I wrote him a note, and he wrote
on it I should come back the next day, which I did. The first thing
he wanted to know was how Paul Robeson was. I didn't know much
except to say that as far as I knew he was OK. We had several
talks. He wanted to know about Truman, who had just become
president. He was very inquisitive about that. It was all a unique
experience for an Army corporal.''
</P>
<P>
   After the war he gravitated back to the music business and one
night in 1949 found himself in Greenwich Village listening to the
Weavers, who were unknown at the time. Folk music was the most
distant of commercial backwaters at the time, but he liked the
members, their politics and their music and soon signed on as their
manager.
</P>
<P>
   It was the most important liaison of his career.
</P>
<P>
   The Weavers _ Pete Seeger, Fred Hellerman, Lee Hays and Ronnie
Gilbert _ were the first commercial successes of the folk revival
of the 1950s and '60s. And their members, particularly Seeger,
became some of the most prominent targets of Sen. Joseph McCarthy's
investigations and the blacklists that followed.
</P>
<P>
   The Weavers were dropped by their label and went from
million-selling artists to commercial pariahs. But they stayed
together, outlasted the McCarthy era and in the end prevailed.
</P>
<P>
   Seeger recalls that Leventhal pushed them to do concert dates
during their darkest days. He was turned down by Town Hall but
managed to book them at Carnegie Hall and sold out in 1955 as the
McCarthy era was at its peak, Seeger said.
</P>
<P>
   Leventhal's laconic voice gets an uncharacteristic bite when he
talks about those days.
</P>
<P>
   ``These were people to be admired, for their music and for
facing up to the blacklist,'' Leventhal said. ``I'm proud to have
been part of it and proud that we never succumbed to any of the
pressure.''
</P>
<P>
   As folk music became more commercially successful, most of the
artists made their way to his office. There, he has a poster with
his trademark, ``Harold Leventhal Presents'' at the top for Bob
Dylan's first concert hall date, at Town Hall, April 12, 1963.
Tickets were $2, $2.75 and $3.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, he came to New York looking for Woody Guthrie, and
he had to come here to find Woody,'' he said. ``He was a nice
fella, tried to imitate Woody in his speech and his dress. To tell
you the truth, he just struck me as another singer coming on the
scene. The Town Hall concert didn't sell out. I also had him in
small halls in Westchester and Philadelphia. He never packed them
either.''
</P>
<P>
   A personal favorite was Phil Ochs, one of the earliest of the
artists dubbed the Next Dylan, who became a mainstay of the folk
and protest songs, then turned to drugs and drinking and committed
suicide in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was obsessed with being bigger than Dylan and then with
being a cross between Dylan and Elvis,'' he said. ``It was a shame.
I admired him in the early days, and then it was as if everything
got thrown off balance.''
</P>
<P>
   There are a few recent copies of Rolling Stone on a couch, but
Leventhal's office has the feel of history more than commerce, with
posters and programs from a half century of concerts, shows and
movies he produced or co-produced. One memorable wall has four
signed pictures of him with Irving Berlin, Benny Goodman, Frank
Sinatra and Peggy Lee.
</P>
<P>
   Leventhal tends to dote on the favorites, Seeger, the first
Weavers concert at Town Hall, Jacques Brel and the Weavers film for
which he was a co-producer, ``Wasn't That a Time.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we played a very positive and meaningful role in the
culture of the country,'' he said. ``You take Woody Guthrie. His
music is more popular today than when he was living. So much of the
music today is so self-centered. It's all about people's personal
problems and almost none of it's about the problems of humanity.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that everything was quite so memorable.
</P>
<P>
   He peered over at the framed Playbill for the Joseph Heller play
``We Bombed in New Haven,'' for which he was a co-producer in 1968.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bombed in New York, too,'' he said.

DONALDSON-CLINTON (Phoenix) - Celebrity newsman Sam Donaldson has a
confession to make: ``I've got to come absolutely clean . . . I
have been wrong about Bill Clinton all along,'' Donaldson told the
Valley Automobile Dealers Association Wednesday. ``I have been
wrong, wrong, wrong.'' Donaldson's mea culpa came in a speech that
touched on a debate raging in newsrooms across the country: Whether
the line between journalists and commentators is blurring too fast
and too much. By MICHAEL MURPHY. Story will move in the ``A''
category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
SHOPPING (Undated) - Retailers have candidly dubbed Friday ``Black
Friday'' _ the day when stores hope to start moving out of the
``red'' and into the ``black.'' Venturing out to the malls on what
is one of the busiest shopping days of the year is not for the
shopping-challenged. Parking trauma, pushy purchasers and long
lines to see the big guy (that would be Santa) can squelch even the
most heartfelt inclinations for peace on Earth _ not to mention
goodwill towards your fellow man. Heading out on your gift-buying
adventure with a budget and a strategic plan of attack, however,
just may save your sanity. It's also likely to lessen the damage
done to your pocketbook. By ANNE M. SPITZA. Story moved in the
``L'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
LEIBOWITZ-COLUMN (Undated) - The story ran small in ``The Arizona
Republic,'' but my disgust was anything but. I read it three times,
not for its content, but for the directive that story positively
shouted. It's a simple mandate, a twist on Shakespeare. Let's kill
all the pollsters! They slaughtered politics first, see, then
barraged us with useless trivia. Now they've turned dangerous, as
this nasty little story shows. By DAVID LEIBOWITZ. Story moved in
the ``K'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
BROPHY (Phoenix) - Brophy Prep. The name rings with history and
tradition, with an upper-crust cachet and a promise of academic
excellence. Now celebrating 70 years since its founding, the
all-boys high school is the preeminent secondary school in Arizona,
boasting that 99 percent of its graduates go on to college. With a
cadre of loyal students and alum, instilled with Jesuit teachings
of ethics and community service, Brophy College Preparatory has
managed to carve out a lofty niche for itself. With PHOTOS. By BOB
GOLFEN. Story moved in the ``L'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
NOTARO-COLUMN (Undated) - It didn't hit me that he was serious
until he brought the box home. ``Look,'' my husband said, lifting
the lid and exposing two matched bright and shiny shoes. ``They're
new!'' ``Those look like running shoes!'' I balked. He took a deep
breath and shot me a look. ``They are running shoes,'' he said,
shaking his head. ``I told you I'm going to run that marathon with
some people at work. We're a team!'' I never believed him. How
could I? We're not even people that walk very fast. By LAURI
NOTARO. Story moved in the ``L'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
MONTINI-COLUMN (Undated) - I'd like to pause, now, at the very
beginning of the season in which we celebrate ``peace on earth and
good will toward men,'' to let each and every one of you know, from
the bottom of my heart, for which I personally thank God. By E.J.

JESUIT TEACHINGS PROMINENT IN BROPHY HIGH'S MISSION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB GOLFEN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Father Anton &UR; Renna was rattling around his empty
classroom, rain pounding the courtyard outside the open windows.
</P>
<P>
   The room was filled with the mossy smell of the rare all-day
rainstorm, mingled with the scent of damp, ancient plaster in the
70-year-old building, one of the original structures at Brophy
College Preparatory.
</P>
<P>
   ``They call this Renna weather,'' the Jesuit said, stroking his
gray goatee as he recalled his upbringing in Spokane, Wash.
</P>
<P>
   Renna's classroom was empty, but filled with life _ the
charismatic presence of the 64-year-old teacher; his ever-changing
collection of artwork, posters and models that decorate every
available space; and perhaps the lingering spirits of three
generations of boys taught in this room.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good to be here,'' he said. `'It really is good to be
here.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Academic excellence
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Brophy Prep. The name rings with tradition, an upper-crust
cachet and a promise of academic excellence. Now celebrating 70
years since its founding, the all-boys high school is the
pre-eminent secondary school in the state, boasting that 99 percent
of its graduates go on to college.
</P>
<P>
   Brophy's distinctive, mission-style main structure, punctuated
by its huge chapel tower, has stood on Central Avenue in Phoenix
since 1928. It was founded by the Society of Jesus on a $250,000
grant and a 25-acre site, then north of Phoenix, from Ellen J.
Brophy in memory of her late husband, William Henry Brophy.
Originally, it was envisioned as a Jesuit high school and college,
though that ambitious scheme was soon scaled back.
</P>
<P>
   Today, with a cadre of loyal students and alumni, instilled with
Jesuit teachings of ethics and community service, Brophy has
managed to carve out a lofty niche for itself.
</P>
<P>
   Renna has been teaching seniors at Brophy Prep for 34 years,
longer than anyone, and some consider him to be the embodiment of
the place, of what students, teachers and alum enigmatically call
the Brophy experience. Or simply, the Brophy magic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've heard that, and I would like to think that's the case,
though I'm not really sure I know what it means,'' the priest said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But this is my home and my life. This is not my job, it's not
my business, it's not something I'm paid to do. It's my daily
life.''
</P>
<P>
   That's a typical remark from faculty members, whether Jesuit
brothers or lay teachers, said Don Morgan Jr., class of '91 and at
just 25 years old, the director of alumni relations. His father was
also a Brophy grad, class of '65.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all struggle so much to explain that magic that is
Brophy,'' Morgan said. ``My dad always told me so much about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``You almost have to experience it to understand why people call
me once a week who graduated in the '50s. They ask me how the teams
are doing, if Father Renna is still teaching English.''
</P>
<P>
   The teachers and administrators enjoy a special closeness and
friendship with the students, Morgan added, which fosters feelings
of community and the sense of loyalty.
</P>
<P>
   School vice president Adria Renke believes that the Jesuit
system of teaching fosters the sense of purpose associated with
Brophy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Justice, dignity, social conscience _ that's why people come
back,'' Renke said. ``It's not a touchy-feely school. It's a school
of the spirit.''
</P>
<P>
   Al Lyding of Phoenix, class of '62, is one of those who keeps
coming back, most recently to take Father Renna out to lunch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I took two classes from Father Renna,'' said Lyding, a
Stanford University graduate and commercial real estate developer.
``He's just sort of a unique person. It's been a worthwhile
relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   Lyding's three sons went through Brophy, two of them graduating
from college and the other still attending.
</P>
<P>
   `'All three were baptized by Father Renna, all had senior
English with Father Renna, and all three got A's in English in
college.''
</P>
<P>
   Students say that Renna's classes are engaging and entertaining,
filled with his intelligence, dry wit and tall tales.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a natural born ham, and I have a captive audience,'' Renna
said. ``I just enjoy them a lot. And they've done a lot for me.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Sense of community
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When the students speak of Brophy, the word ``community'' comes
up often. School spirit, loyalty and closeness with the faculty
help create those feelings, they say.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brophy has a real sense of community,'' said Rusty Kennedy, a
junior who's a Phoenix native and a member of the school golf team.
``Everybody looks after you and your well-being. You have the
feeling that the teachers really care.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Edward A. Reese, president of Brophy, said the bond
between teacher and student is critical to Brophy's Jesuit mission.
</P>
<P>
   ``The magic of the place: I think this is characteristic of
Jesuit schools that there's a feeling of belonging,'' Reese said.
``What the kids typically say is that the teachers are friendly
here, the teachers are our friends, the teachers care. That
translates out to love.''
</P>
<P>
   Morgan offers an anecdote telling of the student/faculty bond,
the teaching of values and how discipline is applied on an
individual basis.
</P>
<P>
   It seems that a teacher caught a student red-handed altering a
classroom attendence report, penciling in his buddy as present
instead of absent, Morgan said. But instead of sending the offender
to the dean for punishment, the teacher took him aside and spoke to
him, explaining the problem and the possible consequences.
</P>
<P>
   And that was it. No discipline report, no jug (as detention is
called at Brophy and other Catholic schools). At the end of the
school year, at the final Mass, the student stood up before his
class and told how the teacher's brief talk served as revelation.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said that if he'd been sent to the dean and given jug, it
wouldn't have meant as much, and he'd probably would have done
something like it again,'' Morgan said. ``But because this teacher
took the time to talk to him, it made all the difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Another factor that bonds the teachers and students is Brophy's
mission to involve all in community service. Using the Jesuit
slogan, ``Men for Others,'' as its guiding principle, Brophy tries
to instill the notion that those who are fortunate enough to attend
Brophy should be willing to give back to the community. Juniors are
required to complete 60 hours of community service, but the members
of every class are involved in going out and helping others.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kids who walk out of here walk out with a social
conscience,'' Morgan said. ``Every kid who goes here, these boys
donate 2,000 hours (total) of community service a month. I defy any
school anywhere to match that.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the places where Brophy students perform volunteer work
are the Arizona Recreation Center for the Handicapped; homes for
the elderly such as Chris Ridge Village and the Phoenix Living
Center; St. Vincent de Paul: Phoenix Dining Room; Veterans
Administration Hospital; the Loyola Project tutoring program;
Crisis Nursery; and Habitat for Humanity. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Great Depression troubles
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Though it was founded 70 years ago, Brophy celebrates its 50th
graduating class this year. The school went broke during the
Depression and closed down in 1935. Brophy reopened for a class of
freshmen boys in 1952.
</P>
<P>
   Now adjacent to Brophy is Xavier College Preparatory for girls
and St. Francis Xavier Elementary School, both operated by the
Phoenix Catholic Diocese separately from the Jesuit-run Brophy.
</P>
<P>
   There have been about 7,000 graduates of Brophy, Morgan said,
which seems like a low number until you consider that the
graduating seniors once numbered in the dozens. There are now 1,190
students attending ninth through 12th grades, drawn from 109
elementary schools throughout Arizona. About 60 percent of the
students are Catholic.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, Brophy has more applicants for the freshman year than
it can fill. The entrance requirements are high, and along with
good grades and entrance-test scores, applicants have to write an
essay about why they want to attend Brophy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good problem to have,'' Renke said of about being able
to choose the best students from a sea of applicants. ``But we hate
to turn them away.''
</P>
<P>
   Recently, Brophy's faculty, staff and alumni were embroiled in
conflict and disunity as the new administration of Reese, Renke and
principal Edwin J. Hearn Jr. took over the reins of the school two
years ago from an administration that had been in place for more
than a decade. There was resistance to some academic and policy
changes, some personality conflicts and the resignation of several
faculty members.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan said he believes the situation has been overblown, that
much of the problems revolved around rumors and accusations such as
that the school would go coed or that the dress code would change
radically. Neither happened. In any case, he added, the conflict
seems to be largely resolved, with few staff members harboring bad
feelings. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Traditional values
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Barone, a professor of education at Arizona State
University, was himself taught at a Jesuit prep school in New
Orleans, and said he knows firsthand about the classical education
and traditional values taught behind the walls at Brophy.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you compare their curriculum to the curriculum of most
public schools, there's that emphasis on classical languages, the
traditional disciplines,`` Barone said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It certainly does have a reputation for being an excellent
school. I get this from students that I've had who went there,
basically impressions that I've gathered over the years. It's a
place where they're very serious about education and they execute
it very well.''
</P>
<P>
   Barone also noted the Jesuit emphasis on leadership and values
as something that is held apart from the academic life, but just as
critical, calling it ``an emphasis on certain kinds of values, kind
of a hidden curriculum that emphasizes a different way of looking
at the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Barone shrugs at Brophy's tout of 99 percent of its graduates
going to college, calling it relatively easy to accomplish when you
get to hand-pick the student body. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Seeking a new image
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Though Brophy boasts of its students as among the best
academically, the faculty and staff are working hard to dispel its
image as an elite institution for well-off families.
</P>
<P>
   The tuition is steep, about $5,200 a year, with financial aid
offered to those students in need who show the requisite academic
merit. The school says that no one with the desire and ability to
go to Brophy will be turned away.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jesuit schools were established to teach the
lower-middle-class Catholics,'' Renke said, adding that the school
seeks out the best students, then tries to make sure they can
attend Brophy, whether their families can afford it or not.
</P>
<P>
   ``As for the rap that we're just a rich kids' school, that's the
biggest myth,'' Renke said. ``We take that rap all the time, but a
third of our kids typically is on financial aid.''
</P>
<P>
   Morgan said the school is giving out $800,000 in student aid
this academic year, supported by grants and alumni gifts. None of
the scholarships are athletic, all based on academics, he added,
trying to defuse another persistent image.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Morgan noted that Brophy has had plenty of fiscal turmoil of
its own over the years. The 20 years of being closed down was not
by choice but because of money.
</P>
<P>
   ``Originally, we (the school) were not in the black until my
freshman year of Brophy in 1988,'' he said. ``When my dad was here,
they had to sell St. Christopher medals to help pay the power
bills. The perception that Brophy was always a wealthy school was
always a little bit off.''
</P>
<P>
   An ambitious building plan to expand Brophy's facilities and
modernize the classrooms has been drawn up, but the money to
construct it has been slow coming, probably meaning that the
construction, once it's begun, will take many years to complete. &QL; 
 &QL; 
No women, please
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The question often comes up: When will Brophy succumb to a
changed society and finally admit female students? Not likely
anytime soon, comes the answer.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan noted that Brophy and Xavier share some classes, allowing
the male and female students to interact with each other as well as
take classes together.
</P>
<P>
   Renke, whose daughters attended Xavier, said part of the
tradition of Brophy involves the concept of turning young boys into
young men.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the tradition of this particular school,'' the vice
president said.
</P>
<P>
   There have been changes over the years. Father Renna recalls
that when he arrived 34 years ago, the teachers were Jesuits and
the only woman on campus was a secretary.
</P>
<P>
   ``And there was a football coach, Coach Novak, who eventually
had his sons and grandsons go through here,'' the priest said. ``As
time's gone on, we're fewer Jesuits. We have some women teachers
now, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Father Renna represents the continuum of Brophy, the
dedication and teaching skill, the need to bring a sense of values
to the classroom. He's one of the things that haven't changed in a
generation, to the point that a recent postcard sent out to the
school alumni had on it a photograph of Father Renna in his
classroom. On the top of the picture, it says, ``Some things never
change . . .''
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole thing about this place, even the place itself has a
certain something about it,'' Father Renna said. ``It's been a
remarkable experience for me. I know this, I'm at the right place.
This is it. God's been good to me.'' &QL;

A VILLAGE EVOLVING SEARCHES ITS SOUL 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By TRACIE ROZHON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TUXEDO, N.Y. _ It is difficult to reconcile the watercolor
renderings of pert Dutch-roofed houses and sprawling Tudor
apartment complexes with the rocky forest that rings the very
private enclave of Tuxedo Park. But if developers and town
officials have their way _ and it appears they are close _ Tuxedo,
with its population of 3,000, may quadruple in size over the next
decade or two. Bulldozers and blasting caps will arrive in the next
few years, and this sleepy town _ with its scattering of vacant
shop fronts _ will get the development it has dreamed of and
dreaded for the last 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   In Tuxedo, 40 miles northwest of Manhattan, two private
developers are planning several thousand units of housing,
including shingle-style cottages by architect Robert A.M. Stern.
The town and its inhabitants _ those of the gated Tuxedo Park, as
well as homeowners of more modest means in the rest of the township
_ are struggling to bring order to the new subdivisions, which they
worry will clog the main route through town, overcrowd schools and
overburden the sewers. But few of the townspeople vow to stop the
developers cold.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's their land,'' said Mary Yrizarry, chairwoman of the
Tuxedo Conservation and Taxpayers Association, alluding to the
developers of both Tuxedo Reserve (a partnership that includes
Related Cos. in Manhattan) and the corporation known as Sterling
Forest LLC. Together, they own about 4,500 bucolic acres. Their
formal applications to build are stacked in the basement of the
Tuxedo town hall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, people who own property have certain rights,'' said Susan
Goodfellow, the mayor of Tuxedo Park, an incorporated village of
325 families within the larger township of Tuxedo. ``You work with
them.''
</P>
<P>
   That is what Tuxedo is trying to do. By Dec. 22, the town will
produce its latest master plan for growth. Town Supervisor Kenneth
Magar said the plan will call for a population increase to
``between 10,000 and 12,000 people.'' While the possible
quadrupling of population ``might shock some people,'' Ms.
Goodfellow said, ``it's better than the 28,000'' called for in an
earlier master plan.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed developments, including 1,620 units planned for
Sterling Forest, about three miles north of the town center, show
clustered housing _ around a new village green in the Stern
version, around two golf courses in the other _ leaving broad
swaths of undeveloped land.
</P>
<P>
   While many residents praise the concept of small lots near town
greens, now endorsed by a national planning movement known as New
Urbanism, they want the developers to pay for whatever problems
they cause. The Tuxedo Reserve developers say they will
``mitigate'' _ developer-speak for pay to make amends _ any damage,
but haven't always specified how.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Yrizarry commended the developers' pledge to protect ``the
most sensitive area _ a beautiful little lake in a protected
valley.'' But there is the question of the steep slopes. ``I don't
see how they can help blasting,'' she said. Town officials agree.
</P>
<P>
   The urge to develop around enclaves like Tuxedo Park _ one of
the country's first subdivisions when it was conceived in 1886 as a
retreat for wealthy deer hunters _ is part of a trend to graft
development onto towns, rather than around suburban shopping
centers. After years of building subdivisions on cheap land in the
middle of nowhere, or around a vast mall, developers have finally
got the message: build a better village (near an existing village
with cachet), and people will flock to it.
</P>
<P>
   Since Forest Hills Gardens was created in Queens, New York City,
in 1915 as working-class housing and was promptly snapped up by
wealthy homeowners, Americans have shown a yearning for
stucco-and-half-timbered village life _ especially next door to a
railroad station. Their wishes were largely ignored for decades.
</P>
<P>
   Enter Stern, master of nostalgic villas and shingled bungalows.
</P>
<P>
   An earlier version of the Tuxedo Reserve development, which
called for 2,400 units, received a preliminary approval from the
town in 1991. But this year, a newly elected town board demanded
far fewer apartments and town houses _ and fewer units overall.
</P>
<P>
   The developers responded last year by bringing in Stern and
lowering the density to 1,747 units, while increasing open space
from 66 to 77 percent. There are plans to donate land for a school,
to build housing for the elderly and to sponsor small-town
retailing. (One cheerful rendering shows a butcher shop and a store
selling cider, across from a cafe.) Stern hopes his plan will
relieve what he calls ``a general sense of pessimism'' in the town.
</P>
<P>
   No one questions that for a decade the town has stopped growing.
The pharmacy moved out five years ago; the hospital folded in 1995.
An antiques shop moved out last week.
</P>
<P>
   This week, Magar said the Tuxedo Reserve developers had agreed
to lower the number of units to 1,383. If they reduced that number
to 1,300, the town supervisor said, he would endorse the plan, and
he said an informal poll of the town board showed that it would
pass.
</P>
<P>
   The other developer in the wings, Sterling Forest LLC, plans to
build its 1,620 housing units farther away from the center of
Tuxedo, on 2,250 acres held back from 15,800 acres of Sterling
Forest that were deeded to New York state in February. But the
Sterling Forest development, for those older than 55, is less
controversial. ``Housing for older people is perceived to be
tax-positive: they don't have kids in the schools, and they don't
use up a lot of town services, like police,'' Magar said.
</P>
<P>
   In his Tuxedo Reserve plan, Stern, now the dean of the Yale
School of Architecture, has created different-size lots with
$140,000 two-bedroom apartments and $700,000 ``estate size'' homes.
The designs would be regulated by guidelines issued by the
developers.
</P>
<P>
   After reviewing the Tuxedo Reserve brochures and press releases,
Tony Hiss, whose book ``The Experience of Place'' explores the ways
communities are coping with urban sprawl, said the developers'
stated goals _ to bring jobs and businesses, to increase the tax
base and to improve the quality of life _ ``generated a lot of
questions.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the developers have increased the percentage of open
space, Hiss called the new figure ``really quite low.'' In Carmel,
Calif., he said, a new planned development on land-grant property
preserves 90 percent of the open space.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would ask whether there is a permanent fund to care for the
forest and wildlife,'' he said. ``How will the developers mitigate
the impact on traffic? If the new town does attract further
development, what would be its effect? And if it will attract new
jobs, will they be permanent?''
</P>
<P>
   The developers argue that their revision _ not yet public but
summarized for this reporter _ addresses many of these concerns and
that others _ like what to do about traffic _ are still to be
worked out. They term the percentage of open space high. ``In most
master-planned communities, it's the opposite _ two-thirds to
three-quarters is developed,'' said Glen Vetromile, who is managing
the project for Related Cos. The people of Tuxedo, he added, ``are
doing a lot of soul-searching right now about what they want to
be.''
</P>
<P>
   They will continue to search. A hearing on the new plan is
expected in February, Magar said. Construction, which could start
late next year, will more likely begin in 2000, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the groups plan to keep monitoring the projects.
</P>
<P>
   ``We won't give up,'' Ms. Yrizarry vowed, ``until the last road
goes in and the last house is put up.''

 &HT;    For the holidays: Christmas music
 &HT;    By Steve Dollar, Sonia Murray, Richard L. Eldredge, Shane
Harrison and Russ DeVault
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jingle bells, y'all. The market for holiday-themed music floods
this time each year, as CD shelves swell with mirthful hit-making
by pop stars, both vintage (Bing Crosby) and newly minted ('N
Sync). It can get confusing, so here's a handy guide to some of the
more noteworthy and, occasionally, avoidable yuletide releases:
</P>
<P>
   POP
</P>
<P>
   ``The Complete Decca
</P>
<P>
   Christmas Songbook''
</P>
<P>
   Bing Crosby. MCA.
</P>
<P>
   44 tracks (2 CDs).
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   Your grandfather's Christmas album. This double-disc collection
gathers seemingly every tinsel-draped tune ever recorded by Der
Bingle for the Decca label. It's pretty hard to resist, right down
to the cover shot of Crosby smoking a pipe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Christmas Caravan''
</P>
<P>
   Squirrel Nut Zippers.
</P>
<P>
   Mammoth. 10 tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   A yuletide offering as nutty and unique as the act's other
recordings. Concentration on hip original compositions such as
``Hot Christmas'' set it a notch above.
</P>
<P>
   ``Merry Christmas . . .
</P>
<P>
   Have a Nice Life!''
</P>
<P>
   Cyndi Lauper. Epic/Sony.
</P>
<P>
   11 tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   File this under: Santas just wanna have fun. An original, nicely
executed effort with Lauper reteaming with ``Time After Time''
composers Rob Hyman and Eric Bazilian to create some fun new
holiday-themed tunes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Christmastime''
</P>
<P>
   Michael W. Smith. Reunion.
</P>
<P>
   12 tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: C-
</P>
<P>
   The saccharine and overblown orchestration on Smith's holiday
offering is one spoonful over the line. Some traditional yuletide
tunes manage to hold up to the onslaught, but a little restraint
would've made this much more joyous.
</P>
<P>
   ``Home for Christmas''
</P>
<P>
   'N Sync. RCA. 14 tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: C
</P>
<P>
   An 'N Sync Christmas is very much like 'N Sync on any other day.
The quintet's vocals on this collection of romance-minded (``In
Love on Christmas'') original songs are tolerable, yet thin. The
only thing you'll get after listening to these yearnings is your
teenage daughter's need to have this under the tree. CLASSICAL
</P>
<P>
   ``A Gala Christmas in Vienna''
</P>
<P>
   Placido Domingo, Sarah Brightman, others. Sony Classical.
</P>
<P>
   20 tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   An all-star blowout with the Vienna Symphony mixes-and-matches
operatic figures with Christmas' greatest hits. For anyone who
always wanted to hear Placido Domingo sing ``Santa Claus Is Coming
to Town.``
</P>
<P>
   BLUES
</P>
<P>
   ``12 Songs of Christmas''
</P>
<P>
   Etta James. Private Music.
</P>
<P>
   12 tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B-
</P>
<P>
   Always regal and classy, the only drawback here is James'
decidedly dull musical choices. Does the world really need another
serving of ``The Little Drummer Boy?'' Rum-pum-bummer.
</P>
<P>
   GOSPEL
</P>
<P>
   ``Christmas With Shirley Caesar''
</P>
<P>
   Shirley Caesar. Myrrh. 11 tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: C
</P>
<P>
   Rare is an inspirational album where Shirley Caesar's voice is
simply not enough. This is that exception. Caesar's clipped
phrasings from opener ``Hark! The Herald Angels Sing'' to the more
inspired ``O Christmas Tree'' somehow make even this gospel legend
sound uncomfortable singing his praise.
</P>
<P>
   Rythm and Blues
</P>
<P>
   ``Christmas With Babyface''
</P>
<P>
   Babyface. Epic. 10 tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   Santa Babyface glides into these traditional covers bearing
unexpected jazz stylings. But the real treat is when he settles
into his usually likable soul on this album's standout, ``I'll Be
Home for Christmas,'' with jazz/gospel a cappella group Take 6.
</P>
<P>
   COUNTRY
</P>
<P>
   ``Breath of Heaven''
</P>
<P>
   Vince Gill. MCA. 11 tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: A
</P>
<P>
   Both religious and secular tunes get a nicely relaxed treatment
from Vince Gill, one of Nashville's premier vocalists and pickers.
He plays it pleasantly on tunes from ``Winter Wonderland'' to ``O
Come All Ye Faithful'' and even avoids turning ``Blue Christmas''
into a downer.
</P>
<P>
   BLUES-ROCK
</P>
<P>
   ``What's in That Bag?''
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Leavell. Capricorn.
</P>
<P>
   13 tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   Keyboardist and Macon-area resident Chuck Leavell, just off the
road with the Rolling Stones and set to rejoin them for an arena
tour opening in January, somehow found time to collect personal
favorites and turn them into one of the season's most eclectic
releases. The glue that holds the package together is three parts
Leavell's keyboard artistry and one part his gruffly bluesy vocals.

   For the holidays: Boxed Sets
</P>
<P>
   By Steve Dollar, Shane Harrison, Doug Hamilton, Bo Emerson Russ
DeVault, and Kathy Janich
</P>
<P>
   One of the staples of the holiday consumer binge, boxed sets of
CDs devoted to a particular artist or style of music make for
impressive ``oooohs'' and ``ahhhhs'' once the gift-wrapping comes
off. Record companies love them because the collections usually
recycle previously released _ or, at least, previously paid for _
recordings, and can sometimes generate a fresh burst of interest in
their subject. Fans love them because, well, what fan wouldn't want
a snazzily packaged survey of a favorite rock singer or jazz
guitarist, with a small novel's worth of critical notes and
interviews, and the songs remastered with the latest digital
gewgaws?
</P>
<P>
   Here's a glance at a batch of recent boxed set releases, with
tips about what makes each unique (or not):
</P>
<P>
   POP
</P>
<P>
   ``Transistor Blast''
</P>
<P>
   XTC. TVT. 51 tracks. (four CDs).
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B-
</P>
<P>
   Retail price: $44.99
</P>
<P>
   Bonus factor: Many previously unreleased performances.
</P>
<P>
   A gathering of live recordings from a band that was never fond
of performing live might seem an iffy proposition. Two of these
discs are concert recordings from 1978-79 and a powerful set at
London's Hammersmith Palais in December 1980, when the band's pop
confections still had a punky edge. After calling a halt to
roadwork in 1982, the trio still made live-in-the-studio
appearances on radio, including John Peel's popular BBC show. The
other two discs document those sessions from 1977-89. Entertaining,
if less than essential.
</P>
<P>
   ``Judy''
</P>
<P>
   Judy Garland. 32 Records. 66 tracks. (four CDs).
</P>
<P>
   Grade: A
</P>
<P>
   Retail price: $76.97
</P>
<P>
   Bonus factor: Includes a 95-page booklet, a 32-minute video from
her 1960s TV show and duets with the likes of Barbra Streisand and
Count Basie.
</P>
<P>
   If you think Judy Garland is defined by ``The Wizard of Oz,''
think again. This collection takes us over the rainbow and back
again, from her vaudeville beginnings at age 7 to a dramatic London
gig in 1969, months before her death at age 47. Don't miss ``Zing!
Went the Strings of My Heart,'' sung flawlessly by Judy at age 13.
What made Garland great is all here: her versatility (we get jazz,
blues, show tunes and more); her energy; her vulnerability. Judy
Garland didn't hide her emotions, she sang them. Lucky for us she
shared her best and worst of times.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Look of Love''
</P>
<P>
   Burt Bacharach. Rhino.
</P>
<P>
   75 tracks. (three CDs).
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   Retail price: $49.98
</P>
<P>
   Bonus factor: Splashy packaging, song-by-song annotation and a
stunning variety of artists, from Dionne Warwick to Elvis Costello.
</P>
<P>
   It would take a remarkably consistent career not to show some
cracks over the course of a 75-song retrospective. While this
exhaustive set makes clear that songwriter and arranger Burt
Bach-arach is a pop visionary, the architect of a sound
unparalleled in its plushness and sophistication, it also reveals
brief but serious lapses into cheesiness. Bacharach's best songs,
including ``Walk on By'' and ``I Say a Little Prayer,'' performed
by his muse, Dionne Warwick, sway with a swinging '60s breeziness
that's sorely lacking in today's radio fodder. His worst, say, ``Me
Japanese Boy I Love You'' by Bobby Goldsboro or Christopher Cross'
``Arthur's Theme,'' could be the piped-in Muzak on the elevator to
hell.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guilty: 30 Years
</P>
<P>
   of Randy Newman''
</P>
<P>
   Randy Newman. Rhino/Warner Archives/Reprise. 105 tracks. (four
CDs).
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   Retail price: $59.97
</P>
<P>
   Bonus factor: A disc of demo recordings; booklet with acerbic
asides on various titles.
</P>
<P>
   Subtitle this compilation of Randy Newman's greatest hits and
most sanguine obscurities the sentimental journey of a misanthrope.
One of the most original songwriters to emerge in the 1970s,
Newman's wickedly skewed views on the human condition lent teeth to
music-hall Americana and West Coast soft-rock formula
(``Rednecks,'' ``I Love L.A.''), amply documented here. That gave
way to the soundtrack work (``Ragtime,'' ``Toy Story''), which is
the least interesting aspect of a long-overdue collection.
Completists should be delighted, however, to finally have ``Gone
Dead Train'' _ Newman's contribution to the ``Performance''
soundtrack _ on CD.
</P>
<P>
   ROCK
</P>
<P>
   ``Tracks''
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Springsteen. Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   66 tracks. (four CDs).
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B-
</P>
<P>
   Retail price: $69.97
</P>
<P>
   Bonus factor: Material previously available only on bootlegs.
</P>
<P>
   An ultimate keepsake for any hard-core fan of Bruce Springsteen,
the expansive ``Tracks'' covers the long arc of the singer's career
_ from his nascent ``street poet'' phase heralded by ``Mary Queen
of Arkansas'' to the mature, Woody Guthrie-influenced populist of
``The Ghost of Tom Joad.'' Compiled by Springsteen and cleanly
remastered, the songs offer a parallel perspective on the Boss'
indefatigable rock classicism and New Jersey grit. Perhaps
predictably, the 1970s outtakes are the most fun, but gems are
scattered throughout.
</P>
<P>
   ``The John Lennon Anthology''
</P>
<P>
   John Lennon. Capitol. 93 tracks.
</P>
<P>
   (four CDs).
</P>
<P>
   Grade: C+
</P>
<P>
   Retail price: $72.97
</P>
<P>
   Bonus factor: Outtakes offer listener that ``fly on the wall''
sensation.
</P>
<P>
   Anthologized to the nth degree, all things Beatles-related seem
to spring from a bottomless vault. But with this latest box it's
hard to imagine there's much meaningful fodder left in the John
Lennon archives. It's a nice one to have, with extensive
supplementary texts by Yoko Ono and critic Anthony DeCurtis, and
all kinds of amusing and revealing audio verite snippets that range
from studio outbursts to candid home recordings. But there's too
much of only passing interest to anyone not a committed fan. Seek
out the John 'n' Yoko reissues on Rykodisc first, then investigate
this.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nuggets: Original Artyfacts
</P>
<P>
   From the First Psychedelic Era,
</P>
<P>
   1965-1968''
</P>
<P>
   Various artists. Rhino.
</P>
<P>
   118 tracks. (four CDs).
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   Retail price: $59.97
</P>
<P>
   Bonus factor: CD version of an out-of-print LP anthology
quadruples its size.
</P>
<P>
   This new ``Nuggets'' is a marvelous, overgenerous slab of folk
history, an amped-up version of the 1972 Lenny Kaye-produced
garage-sale double album, with more junk and treasure. Documented
here is that '60s flowering of American can-do when home-grown
rockers cranked out pop just as stupid and good as the previously
dominant British Invasion brand. Not every greasy teen started a
garage band in 1965, but after listening to this, it sure seems so.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sho' Nuff''
</P>
<P>
   The Black Crowes. American.
</P>
<P>
   56 tracks (five CDs).
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   Retail price: $49.97
</P>
<P>
   Bonus factor: Extra tracks on band's four albums; fifth CD is
five live cuts.
</P>
<P>
   If you've got the four studio albums by the Atlanta-born Black
Crowes, it's difficult to justify the purchase of the cleverly
packaged box unless you're a completist or want to give a friend
the gift of the band's gutsy blues-rock. There are two bonus tracks
on each of the four albums, but what's really new is the five live
cuts from 1995 concerts in New York's Beacon Theatre.
</P>
<P>
   COUNTRY
</P>
<P>
   ``The Complete Country &AMP; Western Recordings: 1959-1986''
</P>
<P>
   Ray Charles. Rhino.
</P>
<P>
   92 tracks. (four CDs).
</P>
<P>
   Grade: A-
</P>
<P>
   Retail price: $49.97
</P>
<P>
   Bonus factor: Classy booklet boasts extensive notes, interviews
and photos.
</P>
<P>
   What pop pleasures trump the sheer soulful splendor of Ray
Charles singing ``Busted,'' with a sassy horn section swinging
behind him, or pledging ``I Can't Stop Loving You'' with the
uncanny timing in his phrasing underscored by a diaphanous chorus?
None. Not a flipping one. As this box testifies, yet again,
Charles' 1962 album ``Modern Sounds in Country &AMP; Western Music''
was revolutionary. That and subsequent C&AMP;W-themed volumes are
featured here. Surprisingly, the 1980s duets (with Merle Haggard,
George Jones, Willie Nelson and others) outlast some inherent
corniness to sound better with age.

<P>
   JAZZ
</P>
<P>
   ``The Complete Blue Note Sessions''
</P>
<P>
   Herbie Hancock. Blue Note.
</P>
<P>
   54 tracks. (six CDs).
</P>
<P>
   Grade: A-
</P>
<P>
   Retail price: $102.97
</P>
<P>
   Bonus factor: Some unreleased alternate takes; good historical
booklet.
</P>
<P>
   Before he became the visionary funkateer of the '70s
(``Chameleon'') and '80s (``Rockit''), Herbie Hancock was nearly
the most gifted jazz pianist of his generation. Like saxophonist
Wayne Shorter, his colleague in Miles Davis' great 1960s quintet,
Hancock was brilliant at an early age. His series of Blue Note
albums (collected here, with some alternate tracks and
contributions to others' albums) offer complex, sophisticated and
bracingly hip perspectives and a little future shock: Tunes such as
``Watermelon Man'' and ``Cantaloupe Island'' suggest that Hancock
always had a killer pop instinct lurking behind a serious guise.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Complete Bitches Brew Sessions''
</P>
<P>
   Miles Davis. Columbia/Sony Legacy.
</P>
<P>
   21 tracks. (four CDs).
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   Retail price: $69.97
</P>
<P>
   Bonus factor: Two discs full of unreleased tracks; detailed
booklet.
</P>
<P>
   When Miles Davis recorded ``Bitches Brew'' at the end of the
1960s, he drew a line in the sand. After he embraced the electric
textures, group improvisations and studio editing techniques the
album flaunted, he never looked back. Purists howled, but the
trumpeter was mapping previously uncharted terrain, a frontier that
is now a populous province. The birth of ``jazz-rock'' can now be
heard as a forecast of ambient sound-craft and the seething,
propulsive exploration of a million disc jockeys. Part of an
immaculate campaign of Davis reissues, the box is generous with
bonus tracks that are less essential than you'd hope.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Classic Quartet: Complete Impulse! Studio Recordings''
</P>
<P>
   John Coltrane. Impulse!
</P>
<P>
   63 tracks. (eight CDs).
</P>
<P>
   Grade: A
</P>
<P>
   Retail price: $89.97
</P>
<P>
   Bonus factor: A ``works in progress'' disc of outtakes that
offers a peek at
</P>
<P>
   Coltrane's creative process.
</P>
<P>
   After his death, in 1967, at age 40, the tenor and soprano
saxophonist became a secular saint: a touchstone for legitimacy and
stature sought by ecstatic outsiders and swinging neo-boppers
alike. This monolithic box shows why: Coltrane led one of the
single greatest bands of all time. With pianist McCoy Tyner,
drummer Elvin Jones and bassist Jimmy Garrison, the so-called
``classic'' quartet made music of delicacy, drive and divine
passion. These studio sessions, which span 1961-65, offer
everything from ballads to ballistics and beyond.
</P>
<P>
   ``Empire''
</P>
<P>
   Tim Berne. Screwgun.
</P>
<P>
   20 tracks. (five CDs).
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   Retail price: $55
</P>
<P>
   (post-paid from 104 St. Marks Ave., Brooklyn, NY 11217)
</P>
<P>
   Bonus factor: Funky low-budget package includes a tasty recipe
for vegetable stew.
</P>
<P>
   Wynton Marsalis wasn't the only wunderkind trying to redefine
jazz in the early 1980s, nor was his the only meaningful path. By
1981, saxophonist Tim Berne had already released five albums on his
own Empire label, bridging the so-called ``loft jazz'' scene that
fostered a fugitive avant-garde of the 1970s and the so-called
``downtown'' music scene that would arise in the '80s. Four of
these expansive, open-structured sessions are reissued for the
first time on CD, part of a rich chapter in the secret history of
pop culture during the Reagan era _ and groovy testimony to the
virtues of artistic pluck.
</P>
<P>
   CLASSICAL
</P>
<P>
   ``25 Years''
</P>
<P>
   Kronos Quartet. Nonesuch. 106 tracks. (10 CDs).
</P>
<P>
   Grade: A-
</P>
<P>
   Retail price: $99.97
</P>
<P>
   Bonus factor: A wealth of previously unreleased pieces; nifty
booklet.
</P>
<P>
   Hipper than your average chamber group, the Kronos Quartet has
aggressively promoted the music of living composers while reveling
in a bit of rock-star flash. The quartet is notorious for covering
Jimi Hendrix's ``Purple Haze,'' but it's also introduced the work
of Philip Glass, Terry Riley, John Adams and a number of Asian,
African and Eastern European composers to a wider audience. The
outfit's anniversary box is a stylish recap, eclectic,
investigative and fun.

 &HT;    SHE SAID: Let us give thanks for a feast cooked by somebody else
 &HT;    By Maureen Downey
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ In Bo's family, conversation served as the centerpiece
of the Thanksgiving table. In my Irish-Italian family gatherings,
the conversation never went much beyond ``pass the turnips'' or
``more gravy, please.''
</P>
<P>
   Our Thanksgiving menu today amounts to a midnight snack in
comparison to my New Jersey clan's button-popping smorgasbord.
There are more of them, so the collective effort is far more
sumptuous.
</P>
<P>
   But it's less the numbers than lack of time that's the real
hurdle to stuffing the turkey and the guests in my household. I
wish the Pilgrims had held off until March to express their
gratitude.
</P>
<P>
   Thanksgiving coincides with the end of recreation league soccer,
the beginning of basketball and the onslaught of holiday choirs,
Scout service projects and Christmas plays. The choice is whether
to costume a pageant shepherd or dress the big bird.
</P>
<P>
   With school reports suddenly due, I'm scouring the Internet with
my fifth-grader for images of American alligators instead of baking
pies. The potatoes go unpeeled as my 7-year-old
geometrician-in-training and I identify triangles, hexagons and
octagons in the neighborhood skyline.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, we solved the problem by buying a ready-made
Thanksgiving dinner from a caterer. Granted, a roast turkey that
came out of a cardboard box instead of a hot oven didn't taste or
smell the same.
</P>
<P>
   It was much, much better.
</P>
<P>
   HE SAID: Eat whatever you want: Traditions all start somewhere
</P>
<P>
   By Bo Emerson
</P>
<P>
   c. 1998 Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Because of time and distance and our busy modern
lives, my extended family can't assemble and enjoy our traditional
Thanksiving celebration, which revolves around eating, drinking and
arguing.
</P>
<P>
   We've tried fighting with each other long-distance, using
conference calls and Internet chat rooms, but it's just not the
same.
</P>
<P>
   Since Maureen won't argue with me during off hours, I've had to
improvise. Now my siblings and I, spread across Georgia,
Connecticut, North Carolina and South Carolina, pursue our own
holidays. It's not the same as the good old days, but not bad.
</P>
<P>
   Laurie will be cooking, Lucy crafting, Ellen sculpting, and
brother John, a man after my own heart, celebrating in a more
meaningful way:
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to kill a bird by hand,'' says John, the South
Carolinian. ``It used to be a turkey, when they were more plentiful
in the Columbia area, but due to urban sprawl I have to use
whatever I can get my hands on: a pigeon, a robin, a titmouse,
whatever.''
</P>
<P>
   John is joking a little bit, because, like me, he finds
Thanksgiving and bad football and Pilgrims depressing. ``All I can
think of is those guys freezing to death.''
</P>
<P>
   So John has unhitched Thanksgiving from its dubious historical
moorings and made it into a ``nonsectarian blowout.''
</P>
<P>
   Maureen and I have done much the same. Our meal, for example,
doesn't conform to the traditional pattern, since each child gets
to pick one dish. This year's feast will include egg rolls and
Jell-O pudding.
</P>
<P>
   Traditions never suffer from a little rewriting.

 &HT;    Maybe it sounds like ESPN, but CNBC's buzz is all biz
 &HT;    By Drew Jubera
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Few things are less telegenic in a made-for-TV world than the
opening each business day of the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   It is deadly, deadly stuff. At exactly 9:30 a.m., Monday through
Friday, the head of the exchange and a few guest suits ring a bell
from a platform above the trading floor. Often they toss in
something goofy, to recognize a newcomer, or as part of, like, a
theme. You'd have to be there. It's the Wall Street equivalent of a
ceremonial first pitch, an act so unmemorable not even C-SPAN
trains a camera on it.
</P>
<P>
   But CNBC does. Each morning the gimlet-eyed cable network that's
shattering TV's business news conventions with its eccentric blend
of financial insight and workaday loopiness counts down to the
opening bell, shows it being rung, then analyzes it with the wry
skewering the tradition invites.
</P>
<P>
   ``A bunch of basketball coaches are trying to kill traders on
the floor with orange objects,'' anchor Mark Haines deadpanned one
morning as four coaches joined the NYSE chief in tossing out toy
basketballs to celebrate the start of the college basketball season
in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people should wear those hats, and some people
shouldn't,'' Haines observed another morning as the opening-bell
guys donned black British bowlers to welcome a London-based company
to the exchange. The bowlers sat jauntily on some heads and settled
far below the ears of others, who looked like they'd just come to
the exchange from a drunk tank.
</P>
<P>
   CNBC might be the clearest signal yet that the Information Age
has entered its Era of Attitude. It is hard to imagine a drier
prospect for a TV network than programming 14 1/2 hours a day with
the likes of business mergers, quarterly earnings reports and the
gyrations of the Dow. But CNBC _ all business by day and all talk
by night _ has infused the button-down, proper-attire-required look
of traditional business coverage with the irreverent spirit of
``Dilbert.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as ESPN's ``SportsCenter'' captures the wisenheimer esprit
of sports fans, so has CNBC's business coverage adopted the prickly
irony that percolates beneath many of those dark suits on Wall
Street. Amid its business boilerplate, CNBC has the unscripted,
behind-the-scenes feel of a TV show about a TV show, like ABC's
``Sports Night.''
</P>
<P>
   Cameras catch guys at their desks while they're still on the
phone, or putting viewers on hold while they peck at a computer for
a name they can't remember. Coats come off and sleeves roll up. We
hear what sounds like the between-cubicle banter that goes on in
any high-rise shop (anchor to reporters on a split screen,
following a story about a wine conglomerate: ``Why don't you and
Bauman drop over later. I have some Night Train and Thunderbird,
and I have a very good date on that.'' Reporter: ``Good date?''
Anchor: ``Yeah. Thursday.''). A retired pro football player once
e-mailed Haines to say he watched CNBC's business coverage because
it reminded him of the locker room during his playing days.
</P>
<P>
   That's just what CNBC has in mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to watch `SportsCenter' (on ESPN) and say, `Man, if
there was any way to do that with a business format, you'd have a
real blockbuster,''' says Matt Quayle, producer of ``Squawk Box,''
a kind of daily stock market pre-game show from 8 to 10 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``So when I was putting the show together, that's what I was
thinking about. While business news is very serious and there's a
lot of money at stake, there are times you have to play by the
rules and other times when you can have fun.''
</P>
<P>
   CNBC reporters are called by nicknames such as ``the Kahuna,''
``the Brain'' and ``the Bond Babe.'' Sound effects and props
sometimes appear when certain companies are mentioned: Cheesy disco
is cued when music compilation giant K-Tel makes news; a can of
Spam appears when Hormel's name pops up.
</P>
<P>
   Noon's ``Power Lunch'' might feature whatever stock watcher Joe
Kernen (the Kahuna) is eating at his desk; the other day it was
split pea soup. He spooned it up while lamenting how reporter David
Faber (the Brain), seated at a desk across from him, wasn't named
this year's sexiest man by People magazine. Kernen theorized it was
a Time-Warner conspiracy, since Time-Warner owned People and CNN, a
CNBC rival. It was like he forgot he was on TV.
</P>
<P>
   When someone later mentioned actor Marky Mark, Kernen ruminated
he'd like to be Dirk Digler, the porn star role Mark played in
``Boogie Nights.'' On the day that wine story broke, anchor Liz
Claman, called by a co-anchor ``the news yenta,'' noted that she
loved wine _ as long as it came in a box. ```Just a Box of Wine,'
'' Kernen mused of an old Grateful Dead tune. ``Love that song.''
</P>
<P>
   Executive producer Kevin Magee explains the ad-libbed punchiness
that often infects his talent: ``It's because we're on so damn
long. For 14 1/2 hours, you can't fake anything. Every quirk of
personality comes out _ good, bad or indifferent.'' ``Business news
is just too dry,'' adds Kernen, 42, a coatless, self-mocking former
stockbroker who's one of CNBC's most popular personalities. ``If
you can do it and amuse yourself, you're probably going to amuse
others.''
</P>
<P>
   This mix of iron and irony works. The network's business day
ratings in October averaged 290,000 households, up 34 percent over
last year. And like the Weather Channel during hurricane season,
the numbers explode when the market turns extreme. On Aug. 31, more
than one million homes watched CNBC after a battered stock market
closed _ the most in the network's nine-year history. The previous
high was in October 1997, when the Dow nose dived 554 points. CNBC
had its highest business-day average ever the next day _ when the
market roared back.
</P>
<P>
   Who watches? Pros and market junkies and retirees, for sure, who
get a kick eyeballing a stock ticker crawling continuously across
the screen, or who tune in to glean something insiderish from
CNBC's impressive parade of CEO and analyst interviews.
</P>
<P>
   But there's also a wider audience out there than there used to
be _ an audience that includes people like . . . you. More women,
more Gen X'ers, more regular Joes and Jills looking to make a
better buck from their mutual funds than their parents did with
passbook savings. They want to be both educated and entertained.
With almost half the country now in the stock market, either as an
active investor or with a retirement fund, CNBC recognizes, as
Georgia State University economic guru Donald Ratajczak says of
televised business coverage, ``they better add a little life to it
or it gets deadly dull in a very short period of time.''
</P>
<P>
   But rather than force color on corporate America's charcoal gray
image, Ratajczak says CNBC actually reflects it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Go into the trading floors of large financial centers and
there's always somebody joking around. There's that humorous vein
in that type of audience, and these guys capture it pretty well.
They don't take things very seriously. They're always saying things
like, `Wow, look at that deal. Why in the world are they doing
that?'
</P>
<P>
   ``(Louis) Rukeyser (host of PBS's long-running ``Wall Street
Week'') has his own sayings and uses plays on words _ that isn't
what you get on the trading room floor. And (CNN's) `Money Line'
with Lou Dobbs is a little bit too straight. They're trying to
loosen it up, but that effort's more in their promotions than on
the show. On CNBC, they take their coats off, just like what you
see in the trading rooms.''
</P>
<P>
   How much does Ratajczak watch?
</P>
<P>
   ``More than I need to.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the wackiness,'' agrees Sheryl Spiva, 38, a Cobb
County-based regional manager for Charles Schwab investments. ``It
puts an interesting spin on what I look at from a very sterile
approach every day. I come home from work and pull out my little
stepper and say, `OK, what's going to entertain me while I'm going
through this boring stuff.' And I end up on CNBC.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know clients respond to what they hear there,'' Spiva adds.
``It demystifies (the market) so it's not so intimidating.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They kid around, which is good,'' says M.J. Nathanson, a
retired salesman and business owner who spends most days watching
CNBC and checking his investments on the lobby computer at the
Cumberland-area Schwab office.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just can't listen to this stuff day in and day out, hour
after hour, without it. The use of humor when people are making or
losing millions lets you know they're reporting what's really going
on.''
</P>
<P>
   While ESPN's ``SportsCenter'' has become TV's gold standard for
the info-soaked Era of Attitude, it doesn't always travel well.
Sports shows on both CNN and Fox blatantly imitate ESPN's yuk-it-up
air, and come off loud and silly by comparison.
</P>
<P>
   CNBC is virtually by itself in adopting this tone with business
news. The closest over-the-air equivalent is public radio's
``Marketplace,'' a breezy half hour each weeknight that alternates
between nuts-and-bolts reporting and offbeat features.
``Marketplace'' came to the same conclusion as CNBC.
</P>
<P>
   ``The democratization of the stock market means you have to
reach out to more people,'' says senior editor and host David
Brancaccio. ``There was something about the old way of reporting
business news that said this is people's retirement money you're
talking about, it's not to be taken lightly. I just reject that. If
I'm not having a good time doing this, people are going to tune me
out and listen to rock music.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're cool. I admire them,'' Brancaccio adds of CNBC and its
place in today's ticker-driven culture. ``The question is whether
10 years from now when kids in high school are going to a
1990s-theme dance, will they go dressed as CNBC anchors and
brokers?''
</P>
<P>
   CNBC succeeds where others fall flat because what you see is
pretty much what it is. Most of the dozen or so on-air people have
known each other for years; three of them went to college together.
They project a been-there, seen-that savvy that steps just this
side of cynicism; an in-this-together attitude that makes hedge
funds and bond yields accessible to pros and newcomers, men and
women, Gen X'ers and Gray Panthers.
</P>
<P>
   Plus they're funny, even though they don't look funny, which
makes them that much funnier.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very loose, very comfortable with each other. It's a
cliche, but we're kind of like a family,'' says anchor Sue Herera,
on-air since CNBC's 1989 debut. ``It creates an almost intimate
relationship with the viewer.''
</P>
<P>
   They all have their groupies. Herera says she gets wedding
anniversary and birthday cards from viewers; after a recent speech
in Milwaukee, a longtime fan exclaimed during dinner to the
currently-blond Herera, ``I knew you when you were a brunette!''
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `Thank you for that,''' Herera recalls.
</P>
<P>
   Haines says the kind of office-mate connection CNBC establishes
with viewers is either there or it isn't. A show can be tweaked
with graphics and production values, but this sort of on-air byplay
can't be contrived without looking . . . contrived. In a
phoney-baloney medium like TV, nothing plays like the real thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The chemistry that's developed between the people here just
evolved,'' says Haines. ``Management isn't smart enough to think
this stuff up _ which is true of almost all successes that happen
on TV.''

49ERS PLAN TO TAKE THURSDAY OFF 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN CRUMPACKER  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA CLARA, Calif. _ A couple months ago, when the weather was
mild and so was the opposition, Steve Mariucci was recognized in
this space for his humanitarian approach to coaching in the NFL. He
gave his players extra time off to rest and heal up from the hurt
inherent in playing the game.
</P>
<P>
   The players loved it, of course, and responded by playing well
in the early going. What a great guy this Mariucci is, they said.
Swell fellow. Don't change a thing.
</P>
<P>
   Then the 49ers hit a wall along with the arrival of autumn. In
the last four games they are 2-2, a month of play characterized by
spotty performances on both sides of the ball. It's no accident
that during that time the Atlanta Falcons beat them and moved into
the lead in the NFC West.
</P>
<P>
   Now comes word that Mariucci, Gandhi in an Italian suit, will
give his players Thanksgiving off. For what? Certainly not for
stalwart play. This is a team that needs work, not more down time
on the old La-Z-Boy.
</P>
<P>
   Just listen to one of the principals: ``We need to play
better,'' Steve Young said. ``We're playing decent football, but
we've got to play better. ... We have set a tremendous standard. We
have set the bar up high and demand that we meet it. We're very
vigilant. We work hard to keep that bar high.''
</P>
<P>
   Then they should continue to work to keep that bar high instead
of spending time in one.
</P>
<P>
   Mariucci's rationale is that this is a ``long'' week, in that
the 49ers don't play again until Monday night against the New York
Giants. Getting in normal practice days on Friday and Saturday for
a Monday night game is the same as working on Thursday and Friday
in preparation for a Sunday game, he said.
</P>
<P>
   If you're Mike Shanahan in Denver, you give the Broncos
Thanksgiving off. If you're Denny Green in Minnesota, you give the
Vikings Thanksgiving off. If you're Ray Rhodes in Philadelphia, you
give the Eagles Thanksgiving off and every day thereafter and start
over again in July.
</P>
<P>
   If you're Steve Mariucci in Santa Clara, you keep drilling the
49ers, even on a day devoted to the overconsumption of turkey, that
noble bird. Have the boys come in for 90 minutes of crisp work in
the late morning, then send them off to their families and friends
to enjoy the rest of the day in some overheated room bloated on
turkey and stuffing and the glut of items curiously referred to as
``all the trimmings.'' (Where I come from, trimmings is what you
get when you mow the lawn.)
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Rice made news this week for speaking out about his team's
inconsistent offense and his desire to be more involved in it, like
he was in the loss to Atlanta, when 19 passes were aimed in his
direction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe my standards are too high,'' Rice said. ``I'm not just
looking forward to going to the playoffs. I want to win the whole
thing. Right now the team has been up and down and I don't think we
have the team (to do it). We've got to get the job done, and it's
not happening right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Funny, but that sounds like someone who thinks his team should
be working to get better instead of taking another day off, even if
it is Thanksgiving. There's nothing like a little physical activity
to sharpen the old appetite.
</P>
<P>
   When George Seifert was the coach in these parts, paranoia
overcame humanity and the 49ers practiced on Thanksgiving, even in
the 14-2 years. The players got their work in from 10-11:30 in the
morning then departed for the holiday. Nobody complained, although
fullback Tom Rathman used to holler at reporters for wasting time
watching practice on Thanksgiving when they should be at home with
their families.
</P>
<P>
   (Note to Tom: Ever hear of holiday pay? Double-time-and-a-half,
baby!) It's too late, though. The schedule has already been posted
in the locker room. There's an icon of a turkey on Thursday with
the note ``players off.''
</P>
<P>
   That's too bad. The 49ers need the work. At 8-3, they will be a
playoff team but their stay in the postseason may be like jumping
in an icy lake: in and out.

<P>
   Jennifer Rahel Conover of Fort Lauderdale, Fla., found ``the
most priceless gift'' for her husband, Ted, recently, just by
surfing the Web, she said. For several years, she had worked
through alumni associations, the Department of Veterans Affairs and
regional newspapers to try to find David Granger, a college friend
of Conover and a fellow World War II veteran.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was almost afraid that this Dave Granger, whom I'd never
met, might have died,'' she said. ``Otherwise I was sure someone
could have helped me find him.''
</P>
<P>
   Then she typed his name into phone directories she found on the
Alta Vista and Metacrawler search engine sites and found Granger's
phone number and address in Mesa, Ariz. The old friends hope to
meet face to face next year. Granger, who lost touch with Conover
several years after they graduated from the University of Miami,
said he felt a sense of ``awe that they could find me.''
</P>
<P>
   The Internet is full of stories of people who once were lost but
now are found: high-school sweethearts reuniting, college roommates
catching up on old times, people who need transplants finding lost
blood relatives.
</P>
<P>
   With ``people finders,'' the search engines that serve as giant
phone books, it's easier than ever to find and be found, and that's
good news. Mostly.
</P>
<P>
   But what if you don't want to be found? What if a friend you
served with in the Pacific was the house guest who wouldn't leave?
Or your old boyfriend with a drinking problem still thinks you are
the hero of his own country-and-western song? Do people finders
interfere with the desire for life, liberty and the pursuit of
anonymity?
</P>
<P>
   The news is mixed. Most people finders are no better than
telephone books. Sometimes you can't even find yourself or people
you know. But some can be eerily productive _ and potentially
damaging.
</P>
<P>
   People finders come in a variety of shapes and sizes; many of
them are found on search engine sites and other Web portals.
Besides phone numbers, some provide fax numbers and e-mail and
home-page addresses, and some may eventually offer pager and
cellular phone numbers.
</P>
<P>
   People finders are popular. In September, Switchboard logged 6.8
million visitors, Infospace 3.5 million, and Anywho 1.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   These electronic directories can be easier to use than directory
assistance or the white pages of a phone book, as their databases
do not require surfers to know the full name of the person they are
seeking.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Anywho lets you type in partial names that begin
with or end with certain letters or syllables _ or that rhyme with
certain syllables. Wild-card letters are allowed at Whowhere on
Lycos; for example, you can type in Franc(star)s if you cannot
remember how Francis or Frances spells his or her name. That site
also provides searches for e-mail addresses, government officials
and people in foreign countries.
</P>
<P>
   Some people finders offer lots of bells and whistles. Searchers
with Java-enabled browsers can type a surname into Whowhere.com and
see, on a rotating globe, the location of all the Carmen Sandiegos
in the world. Anywho can connect you directly by phone to a person
you found in a search (if you use a dial-up Internet connection,
you'll need a second phone line for the call).
</P>
<P>
   But for some people who value their privacy, these services may
make it difficult to get and stay lost. Many sites provide Web
surfers with a map to your house and listings of nearby neighbors,
hotels, restaurants and even post offices. (Yahoo's People Search
actually puts a big red star on the map in front of your house.)
</P>
<P>
   That degree of detail is a little alarming if there are
cyberstalkers who want to know where you live. Conceivably, a
stalker could get a person's name with a search based on an e-mail
address, then find where the person lives.
</P>
<P>
   Switchboard.com, which also includes e-mail addresses in its
search results, was the last of the people finders to include
neighborhood maps, said David Gersh, director for business
development at the company, in Westborough, Mass. ``It was a
Catch-22 for us, it honestly was,'' he said. ``We were concerned
about privacy. Talking to users, we found people were split about
wanting maps associated with their own house, but they definitely
wanted maps of other people's houses. It was a competitive
disadvantage to us not to provide maps.'' The company decided to
show a person's street but not the exact location of the person's
house.
</P>
<P>
   To test the effectiveness _ and the potential intrusiveness _ of
people finders, Christopher Dillingham, an adjunct professor of
communications at the University of Central Florida, tried to find
personal information on line about his former colleagues at the
Deland, Fla., police department. He described the search in an
article on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most, if not all, state laws make it a crime to maliciously
publish an officer's address,'' Dillingham said. ``Most states also
have confidentiality clauses that allow officers exceptions from
public record requirements.''
</P>
<P>
   But Dillingham was able to find everyone he searched for,
including five former supervisors, and their addresses, maps to
their homes and, in some cases, their phone numbers through simple
searches on American Directory Assistance.
</P>
<P>
   Generally, a lot of personal information about someone can be
made public on line legally _ what's legal can vary from state to
state. If a phone number is unlisted, Dillingham said, there are
still many other places, like utility-company and delivery-service
databases, that may make it available.
</P>
<P>
   The majority of data searched by the people finders comes from
phone books that a handful of companies collect and either scan or
retype into one huge database. Info USA, based in Omaha, has 350
workers who type in, verify and update information. It says its
database includes 11 million businesses, and it is compiling a
directory of 110 million households. (According to updated United
States census figures from August 1997, the total number of
households in the country is 109.8 million, and many of them have
unlisted phone numbers or no phone service at all, though others
have multiple lines.) The company calls all the businesses in its
yellow pages at least once a year to verify information.
</P>
<P>
   The only way an unlisted phone number can get into Internet
people finders, said Lauren Bigelow, director of content
development for Alta Vista, is if it was published in an old
directory before it was unlisted and if that old directory is used
as part of the database. People with unlisted phone numbers can
create an electronic listing for themselves on different people
finders that simply lists their e-mail addresses or business
affiliations.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But people who want to protect their privacy must still search
out all the people-finder databases they are listed in and ask to
be removed, said Susan Scott of Truste.org, a group that promotes
privacy rights on line and offers a seal of approval for Web sites
that protect users' privacy.
</P>
<P>
   Dillingham said people concerned with privacy should use
alternate addresses, like post office boxes, when filling out any
document that is a public record, like a driver's license
application. They should also tell businesses that they do not want
their personal information distributed or sold, he said. Someone
who really does not want to be found can get a phone number under
another name, he said.
</P>
<P>
   While people can remove their listings from most people-finder
directory pages, public records, like bankruptcy filings, are
increasingly becoming available on line and can be used _ often for
a price _ to track down those who may leave few other traces. Such
public documents record marriages, convictions, real estate
purchases, bankruptcies and deaths.
</P>
<P>
   ``More and more courts are putting their records on line so you
can go and pull up a claim for free,'' said Chris Sherman, a Web
search guide at the Mining Co. (www.miningco.com), the
human-powered search engine site, adding that such records can be
very easy or very difficult to see, depending upon the
jurisdiction.
</P>
<P>
   He said knowx.com appeared to be the easiest site to use for
records searches, and added that such searches could also be done
at subscription databases like Lexis-Nexis (www.lexisnexis.com) and
West Publishing (www.westpub.com). One site, 1-800-U.S. Search
(1800ussearch.com), does background checks for $139.
</P>
<P>
   Safeguards are in place to help keep pranksters from changing
other people's listings. At Switchboard and Lycos, you can change
your listing via e-mail once you have a password. Anywho, which
powers people finders at the Excite, Webcrawler and Infoseek
portals, requires you to place a call from the number in question
to change your directory listing.
</P>
<P>
   Switchboard, Alta Vista and Lycos offer the electronic
equivalent of Caller ID, a service called either Knock Knock or
Who's There, which allows searchers to send queries to people who
do not list their e-mail publicly. The site acts as the
intermediary, relaying a message to the person found, who can
either refuse the query or respond to it.
</P>
<P>
   People concerned about their privacy should also be careful
about making public postings on line that could come back to haunt
them, Ms. Scott warned.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to be very careful now where you decide to post your
personal information in a public forum,'' she said, pointing out
that bulletin boards and chat lines could be searched, even by
potential employers.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you were part of a chat room when you were in college, and
10 years later _ who hasn't changed in that amount of time? _ let's
say you're going to apply for a job,'' she said. ``It may or may
not be you, it may be somebody with the same name, or it may be
something you totally regretted in your life, and you're not the
same person now.''
</P>
<P>
   Looking to the future, Sean White, chief technology officer at
Lycos, predicted that directories would focus less on information
and more on people. ``If I wanted to contact you and you have five
e-mail addresses,'' he said, ``you would be able to say, `Here's
the primary one I want this mail going to,' or you could say on a
particular day, `I'm on vacation, and here's how I want it to be
handled.' '' The people finder would route your e-mail for you.
</P>
<P>
   Sherman, of the Mining Co., said there was no good one-stop way
to find people on line. ``A lot of times, the easiest thing to do
is call the reference library in whatever city you think the person
might be living in,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He is looking forward to the centralization of the portals, he
said, when the search scene will become more unified. He expects to
see more consolidation of databases. ``Yahoo bought Four11.com, and
Lycos bought Whowhere,'' he said. ``Hopefully, they'll all have an
agreement, and form one standard or directory.''
</P>
<P>
   In Florida, the Conovers are looking forward to meeting Granger.
``Ted has talked about him for years, and I have done my best to
locate him for the last five or six years,'' Ms. Conover said.
``I'd almost given up.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Tuesday morning saw the return of the Terror, at
Christie's on Park Avenue. Not since the Revolution have so many
highly valued French heads rolled. Billed by the auction house as
``the most valuable and important collection of European furniture
ever to come to auction,'' the French &AMP; Co. sale of largely
18th-century furniture from aristocratic collections, including
Versailles itself, was something of a blood bath.
</P>
<P>
   Promoted by a lavish $50 hardcover catalog _ 316 glossy pages
for 81 lots _ the sale, estimated at $30 million, realized less
than half of that: $12,962,868. Twenty-seven lots failed to sell,
including the biggest star: a lacquered commode with a heavily
documented claim to the 18th-century royal inventory at Versailles.
Estimated at $4 million to $6 million, it was bought in by the
house at $3.6 million, a face-saving figure that doesn't reflect an
actual sale.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Lord Hindlip, chairman of Christie's International,
brought his hammer down on the last lot on the block, it was more
guillotine than mallet. With scant bidding, the 10 a.m. sale ended
at 11:30.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year's `sale of the century' flopped,'' said Leon Dalva,
a New York dealer in 18th-century French furniture after the
auction. ``It was obvious there were no bids.''
</P>
<P>
   What happened?
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't the market that made a mistake,'' said Dalva, who
spoke with the grave generosity of a man who has seen justice done.
``It was a marketing mistake on Christie's part.'' Based on the
auction house's breathtaking estimates, experts familiar with the
fine furniture market agreed that Christie's was attempting to cut
out the middle men _ influential dealers like Dalva _ and go
straight for that handful of cake-eating collectors who might
swallow the prices.
</P>
<P>
   If true, it was a strategy, based on the current auction scene's
successful capture of the public's imagination, that might have
worked with Vincent van Gogh _ his self-portrait sold at Christie's
last Thursday for $71.5 million, nearly three times its estimate _
but not with furniture.
</P>
<P>
   At Tuesday morning's sale, only collectors bought. But not
enough materialized. And the dealers _ furniture sales' bread and
butter _ largely boycotted the high bidding.
</P>
<P>
   With seven lots estimated at more than $1 million each, there
could still have been the excitement that sets records. Instead,
one indisputable factor set the sale up for a fall: The very
beautiful goods were tired. As inventory for French &AMP; Co., one of
New York's oldest and most prestigious art and antiques dealers,
the furniture had never not been for sale. Serious buyers were
dully familiar with its international sales' records for the last
30 years. The top lots were public figures.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not goods from a family; it was bought for French &AMP; Co.
to sell,'' said Bernard Steinitz, a Parisian dealer, who
nonetheless spoke of the pieces fondly, like cousins encountered at
large family weddings. The collection had also recently been
shopped in London as a group, to no avail at the asking price.
</P>
<P>
   Christie's gambled instead on cachet and provenance.
</P>
<P>
   Since it was established in 1840, French &AMP; Co. has done business
with the best names in the game: J.P. Morgan, William Randolph
Hearst, the Fricks and the Rockefellers, among others. Martin
Zimet, the current chairman, entered the field by buying the firm
in 1968, after being asked to assess it for Goldman Sachs &AMP; Co. His
son, Henry, who has recently taken the helm, made the decision to
divest the company of its decorative arts and concentrate on
paintings.
</P>
<P>
   There were suggestions on Tuesday among attendees that French &AMP;
Co.'s prestige was no longer potent enough to power the prices that
Christie's had hoped for.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to freezing prices and a low glow on the sale's
name, there were doubts about provenance that dogged certain
pieces, including the high spot _ the so-called ``Dauphine's
commode,'' previewed at Christie's in Paris in September. The
lacquered chest has a bold black stenciled ``No. 1343'' on the
back, which is consistent with an 18th-century royal inventory
number from the collection at Versailles. Christie's said it
discovered the mark _ previously unrecorded _ during an examination
of the piece in New York. The French antiquarian establishment
questioned its authenticity loudly in the Parisian press.
</P>
<P>
   Alistair Clarke, a senior vice president and head of European
furniture for Christie's in New York, said the controversy
convinced the auction house to submit the mark's ink to laboratory
testing, which revealed that the ink was not new. Versailles (and,
Wednesday, the Louvre) said the commode was what Christie's
presented it to be. ``It's a bit of sour grapes,'' said Clarke, who
suggested that French dealers may have known the stencil was there
and ignored it to allow the royal patrimonial piece to legally
leave the country with a foreign buyer.
</P>
<P>
   None of this made for a happy ever after here in the New World.
The Dauphine's commode found not even a chevalier on Tuesday.
Instead, the sober room of pinstriped suits and soft, chic
sportswear watched with cunning dispassion as Hindlip introduced
the kingly lots. It seemed, at times, like the reverse of spending.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   At the outset, Hindlip leapt forward across the podium to reel
in the bids as if he knew that the big fish were headed towards the
bottom. By midsale, he was crisply closing the door, with a sharp
tock of his gavel, like a rap on the knuckles to recalcitrant
children.
</P>
<P>
   There was some distress about condition, too; in particular, the
excessive re-gilding on many pieces, including a pair of sunny
console tables, estimated at $300,000 to $500,000, that sold for
$299,500.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fresh, like a Baci,'' said Giovanni Bucchi, a New York gilder
and conservator, while previewing the pieces, referring to the
Italian candies. ``If you bit into it, you would get stuff on your
teeth.''
</P>
<P>
   Clarke was necessarily philosophical Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've all been disappointed before, life goes on,'' he said,
implying also that dealers conspired to strangle the sale. ``It was
breaking ground for a furniture sale.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There haven't been many pieces in this bracket sold
recently,'' he pointed out. ``To say the estimates were too high is
unfair. I think there was a lot of jealousy about the sale in the
market.''
</P>
<P>
   The silver lining of the event, as Andree Corroon, a Christie's
assistant vice president called it, was the performance of the
English furniture, which was treated well by buyers. One chest, the
Lonsdale Langlois commode, took an international auction record for
an English commode, at $2,532,500.
</P>
<P>
   There was wide speculation, which Clarke would not confirm, that
Christie's made a guarantee of money to the sellers against sale
results. If so, Christie's owns a great deal of French furniture.
</P>
<P>
   ``Christie's will talk turkey now,'' said Dalva, the New York
dealer, who said he intended to make offers on some of the lots.
</P>
<P>
   Minutes after Hindlip's last ``thank you,'' Steinitz, the
Parisian dealer, bearded like Midas, was in a tete-a-tete with
Clarke, as they walked arm in arm out of the sale room.

A SONG IN YOUR POCKET 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Telephones used to be more predictable. They were generally
tethered securely to a wall, and when they rang, well, they rang.
Today, telephones are adrift, floating like dandelion seeds
throughout the environment, and they don't ring. They warble.
</P>
<P>
   Lately, the cunning little mobile phones that people like to
carry _ the ones that also send e-mail and receive stock market
quotations _ have been emitting more elaborate sounds. During a
recent lunch in a Berlin restaurant, for instance, one of my
companions suddenly had what sounded like an especially squeaky
Brandenburg concerto emanating from his pocket. It was his mobile
phone.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the Finnish company Nokia and the Swedish company
Ericsson sell phones that offer a wide selection of programmed
musical rings _ from a Scott Joplin rag to ``Auld Lang Syne'' _ but
you don't hear these melodic snippets very often in the United
States. Not yet, anyway. In some European countries, where upwards
of 40 percent of the population is equipped with a mobile phone
(compared to 23 percent here), there is greater need for a
distinctive ring. At least, that's the simple explanation.
</P>
<P>
   The very newest mobile phones allow owners to program favorite
tunes or original compositions. The brightly colored Ericsson CF
768 is packaged with a chart that assigns musical notes to each
button on the key pad, and explains how to produce sharps, flats
and rests.
</P>
<P>
   Following instructions found on an independent Web site run by a
21-year-old Australian computer programmer (www.nogi.net), a
repository of hundreds of songs specially arranged to be played on
the Ericsson, I punched in a tinsely version of Herb Alpert's
``Tijuana Taxi.'' It's an arduous process, and at the end, I felt
strangely satisfied, as if I had mastered a piano etude.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond helping mobile-phone owners to pick out their ring in a
crowd, the individualized, anthemic sound is a way of humanizing a
technological device. ``A cellular phone is a personal product,''
reasoned Gary Dorfner, a senior product line manager for Ericsson.
``You want to create an affinity with the users, so they say, `Hey,
this is my phone.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Ben Rubin, who teaches a course called Sonic Design at New York
University's Interactive Telecommunications Program and who has
designed a system that would replace the electronic bleeps of the
New York subway's turnstiles with more pleasing musical sounds,
doesn't think the music played by mobile phones is any kind of
improvement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to hear the `William Tell' Overture when my phone
is ringing,'' he said. Rubin does, however, concur with the
Ericsson marketers about the significance of distinctive rings. ``I
want my ring to be short, quiet, complex and uniquely mine,'' he
declared, ``an expression of my taste.''
</P>
<P>
   Rubin believes that the existing sounds are ``too primitive to
fulfill my desires.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But then, he hasn't heard the latest from Finland.
</P>
<P>
   ``The annoyance of ringing mobile phones in public places has
been discussed a lot in Finland,'' said two Nokia technologists,
Seppo Helle, a user-interface software designer, and Outi
Kortevaara, an audio specialist, who replied jointly to questions I
sent to them by e-mail. ``The issue may be here more acute since
Finland currently has the largest mobile phone penetration in the
world _ over 50 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   Nokia is about to introduce a mobile phone, the 9110, with rings
that Helle and Ms. Kortevaara say are ``softer and cleaner,'' due
to improved speaker technology. It will, they add, produce natural
sounds, not cheap electronic imitations.
</P>
<P>
   Helle sent along a file of two dozen surprising new ringer
noises. Some are musical: a classical guitar piece, played on a
real guitar that retains much of its natural resonance, and an
intentionally fuzzy rock guitar solo. Some are funny: a human voice
imitating the b-r-r-ring of a telephone ring. Undoubtedly these
sounds, refreshing on the first listen, will quickly become a form
of noise pollution. But all of them _ with the possible exception
of a long, horsy laugh _ are far less irritating than any existing
ring.
</P>
<P>
   One more thing: Dorfner spoke to me from his own cellular phone.
He told me he had adjusted his phone to emit ``a quiet little
beep,'' because he was attending a gathering of Ericsson
executives. If everyone in the room had their ringer programmed to
play ``Stairway to Heaven'' or the theme from ``Star Wars,'' well,
you can imagine.

<P>
   Manhattan is transformed. The potholes are gone, as are the
cabdrivers who don't know that the Bronx is up and the Battery's
down. Nobody is trying to sweep the place clean of corruption or
sin. The women are free and easily available.
</P>
<P>
   The Coney Island cooch shows still feature girls who can pick up
hand-kerchiefs with their teeth. The eccentrics are benign and even
the bores walk in grace, which makes them good company.
</P>
<P>
   Manhattan is an uproarious, singing, dancing time-out city,
where nothing is impossible and the future is without limits, at
least for a single day.
</P>
<P>
   That is something of the effect of George C. Wolfe's
exhilarating new production of ``On the Town'' at the Gershwin
Theater. If you don't leave this show with an enhanced awareness of
the meaning of joy, take out your cell phone immediately: beep your
therapist.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the Town'' is the seminal 1944 musical that, arriving the
year after ``Oklahoma!,'' demonstrated that ``new'' in the American
musical theater need not mean simply pastoral. Here is a love
letter to Manhattan as the biggest, craziest beehive on earth.
</P>
<P>
   More important, ``On the Town'' introduced Broadway to the
prodigious talents of Leonard Bernstein, the composer; Betty Comden
and Adolph Green, who wrote the book and lyrics, and Jerome Robbins
as a choreographer, rather than as the dancer he was in several
Broadway shows before he joined Ballet Theater.
</P>
<P>
   The original collaborators, led by the director George Abbott,
took only six months to get ``On the Town'' written and on its
feet, using as their inspiration the Robbins-Bernstein ballet,
``Fancy Free.'' This revival has been somewhat longer en route,
beginning with the Joseph Papp Public Theater production in Central
Park in the summer of 1997, which received mixed reviews.
</P>
<P>
   The initial intention had been to transfer the Central Park
production to Broadway intact. When the principal Broadway
producers withdrew, Wolfe, the Public Theater's producer as well as
the show's director, decided that the Public would go it alone. A
risky decision, considering the reported $5 million budget.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, a couple of choreographers have come and gone, and
several of the principals have been replaced. During the preview
period, there were the usual downbeat rumors attending any new
production that elects to take its shakedown cruise in the middle
of Times Square.
</P>
<P>
   Then, 10 days before the scheduled Nov. 19 opening, the first
night was put off three days. At the same time, it was announced
that Joey McKneely, who received a Tony nomination as the
choreographer of ``The Life,'' was being brought in to fine tune
the major dance routines designed by Keith Young, the show's
choreographer of record, who is making his Broadway debut with ``On
the Town.''
</P>
<P>
   You might think the coroner should be called. Not at all.
</P>
<P>
   The news this morning: Wolfe has, indeed, worked a miracle. He
has located the essence of the show that eluded him in the park,
and cast it with spirited young performers who can sing, dance and
levitate at will. ``On the Town'' is on its way. Not in a very long
time have you heard a score as richly complex and romantic,
combined with a book and lyrics that are so gloriously bright,
witty and off-the-wall.
</P>
<P>
   If you think you know the show because you have seen the 1949
movie, directed by Stanley Donen and Gene Kelly, you are in for a
major surprise. All that you probably remember about the movie is
the opening number in which Kelly, Frank Sinatra and Jules Munshin
sing Bernstein's ebullient ``New York, New York'' while capering
across the Brooklyn Bridge, atop the Empire State Building and
around Rockefeller Center and other postcard sites.
</P>
<P>
   It's a superb bit of filmmaking, but after that, the film is
very different from the show. Because Louis B. Mayer, the MGM
studio head, thought the original score either too esoteric or too
``suggestive'' (a favorite adjective of the Legion of Decency, the
Roman Catholic censorship group), the only other Bernstein music is
essentially used for background.
</P>
<P>
   Discarded by Hollywood are the rambunctious comedy numbers and
some of the most beautiful and haunting melodies Bernstein ever
composed, among them: ``Lucky to Be Me,'' ``Lonely Town'' and
``Some Other Time.''
</P>
<P>
   ``On the Town'' is a mysteriously bewitching show, originally
conceived and staged in its own time and place, about three wildly
energized sailors unleashed in wartime New York on a 24-hour pass.
Wolfe has made no attempt to update the material or give it the
benefit of hindsight. Yet it plays today as if it had been written
last week, not as a piece of nostalgia but as living literature.
</P>
<P>
   The show is dated by its wartime period, but its blithe manners,
which are those of a cockeyed fable, are timeless. That it can
still refresh, surprise and bring you close to tears (both of
helpless laughter and sweet melancholy) is because it's so resolute
in the way it avoids kitsch.
</P>
<P>
   For each of the three sailors at the heart of the adventure, a
lifetime is compressed into this single day, no encounter is by
chance and every connection has meaning. At the beginning of the
show, Gabey, Chip and Ozzie emerge, as if uncaged, into the
intoxicating light of New York; at the end, they disappear back
into their ship. Blackout. The end. Maybe curtains.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing of this sort is ever acknowledged overtly, certainly not
by the sailors themselves. They are too intent on seeing the sights
and meeting women as quickly as possible to worry about what comes
after. They have no pasts that are recollected and no futures that
are foreseen. They exist entirely in the present tense,
unencumbered.
</P>
<P>
   The unspeakable is obliquely defined in the gorgeous score, in
lyrics that can be elegantly discreet (listen to ``Some Other
Time'') and in the choreography. But, except for one brief, quite
lovely pas de deux and a more extended, less successful dreamlike
ballet, the dances are more intent on expressing soaring spirits
than anything remotely resembling angst.
</P>
<P>
   Gabey (Perry Laylon Ojeda) is the romantic one. He falls
obsessively in love almost as soon as he touches land. The woman:
Miss Turnstiles, nee Ivy Smith (Tai Jimenez), the celebrated (he
assumes) subway girl-of-the-month, whose poster he sees. In this
show in which miracles never cease, he finds her at Carnegie Hall.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Chip (Jesse Tyler Ferguson), a skinny, red-headed fellow with a
bendable frame, is more or less captured by the robustly
proportioned Hildy Esterhazy (Lea DeLaria), who drives a cab. He
wants to visit the Hippodrome and buy a ticket to ``Tobacco Road,''
because that is what his father did in 1934, though both landmarks
have now vanished. Hildy's purpose is seduction; they can talk
later.
</P>
<P>
   Ozzie (Robert Montano), who has gone to the American Museum of
Natural History thinking it was the Museum of Modern Art, finds his
soul mate in Claire DeLoone (Sarah Knowlton). She is an
anthropologist drawn to him initially because he looks so much like
the prehistoric man that is her life's study. Both Ozzie and Claire
share a weakness: each seethes with sexual desires they can't
easily suppress.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. DeLaria, the discovery of the show's Central Park
production, is bigger and better than ever on Broadway, where,
three times at the performance I caught, she came close to
arresting the show and leaving the audience numb with pleasure: in
``Come Up to My Place'' and ``I Can Cook Too,'' both sung to the
elusive Chip, and as one member of the quartet that tears up the
stage in Act II with ``Ya Got Me,'' in which the friends attempt to
cheer Gabey, whose Ivy has somehow been misplaced.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. DeLaria is a big, assertive stage personality with the
implacable presence of the young Ethel Merman. She can sing
sweetly, she can scat and she can belt in a way to test the
capacity of most sound amplification systems. She is also genuinely
funny. She would seem to be every inch and ounce a star.
</P>
<P>
   The other members of the sextet of leading performers are also
immensely appealing: Ferguson, who is sly, knowing and very funny
as Ms. DeLaria's cooperative victim; the lantern-jawed Montano and
the sweet-voiced, model-pretty Ms. Knowlton; and Ojeda, who
delivers two of the show's best numbers (``Lonely Town'' and
``Lucky to Be Me'') and Ms. Jimenez, a former principal dancer with
the Dance Theater of Harlem and a charmer as Ivy Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Note also the splendid Mary Testa, who appears as Ivy's
heavy-drinking, quite severe vocal coach, and Jonathan Freeman as
Claire DeLoone's mild-mannered fiance, a judge. He trails Claire
through much of the show, patiently picking up the nightclub tabs
left by her and her new-found pals.
</P>
<P>
   When, as it must, the worm turns, it's deliciously expressed in
the convoluted lyrics of a quintessential Comden and Green comedy
number, ``I Understand.''
</P>
<P>
   The choreography is a vast improvement over what was seen in the
park, where the high point of one number was the sight of Miss
Turnstiles being pushed around the stage as she huddled on a
footstool. The dancers now dance. They fill the stage with movement
that soars, though without affecting the mind or emotions.
</P>
<P>
   Robbins's ballet was not only the inspiration for the show; he
was also an integral part of the team that put it together. I
didn't see the 1944 production, but I can't imagine that his
artistry could be duplicated by anyone else. The
Bernstein-Robbins-Comden and Green collaboration was something very
special.
</P>
<P>
   The most spectacular asset of Wolfe's Delacorte production was
the park itself and the New York skyline, which dominated Adrianne
Lobel's set design. At the sun's setting on a soft summer night,
``On the Town'' seemed to have come home.
</P>
<P>
   There is no way to reproduce that feeling in a theater, even one
as vast as the Gershwin. The show looks good and moves efficiently
without ever astonishing the eye, which Paul Tazewell's costumes
often do.
</P>
<P>
   The Gershwin's sound system is something else. It is, of course,
a necessity, but it is also a compromise. One can recognize good
voices from bad and, when seated in the orchestra, one has no
trouble telling which members of the cast are singing. That is a
definite plus. Yet a price is paid: the voices take on a metallic,
bionic edge.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that a new choreographer was working on the dances,
virtually right up until the opening night, explains, I assume, a
certain looseness in the show's pacing. This, I also assume, will
be corrected as the run progresses.
</P>
<P>
   And progress it should. ``On the Town'' has become a classic,
but it clearly hasn't grown old. As it celebrates a very particular
time and the marvelous muddles of its exuberantly inchoate
characters, it also celebrates life itself. Sometimes, a day is all
there is.

WHAT TO DO ABOUT YELLOW POURED FLOOR 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, November 29, 1998; normally moves Friday)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER HOTTON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I have poured floors. In the bathroom the poured floor has
yellowed. How can I get rid of that yellow stain? Can I put ceramic
tiles or even resilient (vinyl) tiles on that floor?
</P>
<P>
   IRGINIA TURNER, Kingston, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Poured floors were popular 20 to 30 years ago, and eventually
went out of favor. The floor was made by combining tiny colored
flakes, with clear vinyl that was poured in place.
</P>
<P>
   To answer your questions: no way, yes and yes. It is unlikely
that you can reduce that yellow stain. White or light-colored vinyl
may develop yellow stains, which I think are chemical, not
physical. Floor people have no solutions, to my knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, you can put vinyl tiles over the floor; use peel-and-stick
tiles. You can also install ceramic tiles with a thin-set mortar or
adhesive.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My son is finishing his basement, installing a plasterboard
wall, but he also wants to have it plastered. A plasterer said he'd
seal the plasterboard and then skimcoat. Another said this won't
work. What can my son do now?
</P>
<P>
   ALLEN KRAUSE, Northborough, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. I'd go along with the man who said a skimcoat will not work
over sealed plasterboard. It might work, but it is too iffy, in my
opinion. A skimcoat is designed to go over Blueboard, a special
plasterboard with a rough, sandpapery surface, which the skimcoat
clings like crazy.
</P>
<P>
   I suggest your son have the plasterboard seams taped and covered
with joint compound (also covering the nail or screw heads). If he
really wants a skimcoat, he can put Blueboard over the plasterboard
or take off the plasterboard and put Blueboard on.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Miguel Mitchell of Rockport, Mass.to tell us of a grave error
the handyman made in suggesting ways to clear a drain of mortar
that was spilled into the drain. This question was asked by G.A. of
Windham, N.H.
</P>
<P>
   The handyman suggested using muriatic acid, which would attack
the mortar without harming the drain. He also said that nonenzyeme
Drano might also work.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Mitchell, visiting scientist and chemistry lecturer at
Northeastern University, wrote that the handyman described
``nonenzyme Drano'' as an acid. ``Actually, the active ingredient
in Drano is sodium hydroxide, a very powerful base,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If someone decided to combine Drano with muriatic acid to
clean pipes, they would be in grave danger. Strong acids and bases
react violently. In combination with muriatic acid, Drano would
erupt into a spray of superheated, corrosive steam. Let your
readers know that Drano is not an acid and should never be combined
with muriatic acid.''
</P>
<P>
   Excellent point, Dr. Mitchell, and appreciated by the handyman.
At least the handyman did not suggest combining the two materials.
In fact, one should never combine two chemicals designed to do the
same thing.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I had a rubber roof put on a flat garage roof; it is OK after
four years except for a gouge about 2 inches wide and 4 inches
long, as if made by an animal trying to get in. Where can I get a
patch to cover this roof? The installer went out of business. And
how best can I glue on a patch? I have used a special glue in
repairing wet suits, but I just don't know where to find a patch.
</P>
<P>
   ARTHUR ROSENBERG, West Newton, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. As a temporary fix, cut a piece of roll roofing and secure it
with phenolic vinyl (PhenoSeal, a widely available adhesive caulk).
Even an old inner tube would do. You can try any lumber store or
possibly a roofer willing to cut you off a piece. A roofer is
unlikely to do a small job.
</P>
<P>
   Short of that, does anyone know where rubber roof material in
small amounts can be bought? The handyman would like to know. So
would Arthur Rosenberg.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I have a see-through fireplace that converted from a
one-hearth unit, so there is a hearth facing one room and another
facing another room. It smokes like crazy. Would a flue booster
work? We put in glass doors so that only one side is open, without
success. A contractor suggested sealing the floor and the
foundation.
</P>
<P>
   PHYLLIS LEVINE, Boxford, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. A flue-booster, a fan at the top of the chimney, more
accurately called a draft booster, might work, but you still need
more air for the fire to burn well without smoking. For starters,
open a window in the room to provide more air. If that works, fine,
except you will freeze your tush off; so, provide the fireplace
with its own air; install a PVC duct from outdoors to in front of
the fireplce.
</P>
<P>
   See-through fireplaces, even one built from scratch, do not work
very well. Conversions are worse. Sealing the floor and the
foundation will make things worse, because the fire is trying to
pull air from house and basement.
</P>
<P>
   Your best bet is to provide the fireplace with its own air, and
if necessary, put in a draft booster. And, brick up one of those
openings.
</P>

WINDSTAR'S A CLASSY VAN, BUT IT'S A CROWDED CLASS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)  
 (For release Sunday, November 29, 1998; normally moves Friday)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN R.WHITE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   You can't lead by playing catch-up. Nowhere is that more evident
than in the auto business _ especially in the Van Wars. At
Chrysler, they figured that out a long time ago. At Toyota and
Honda, they just figured it out. At Ford, as innovative as that
company can be, they're still a little slow off the mark.
</P>
<P>
   The '99 Windstar might have been the van leader, if the other
guys had stood still. But the other guys didn't, which puts Ford
about even with Chrysler overall, a tad behind Honda, perhaps,
thanks to that company's innovative interior design _ more than a
tad if Honda Odyssey manages to equal Windstar's five-star safety
rating.
</P>
<P>
   What's really funny about it all, is that Ford had the jump on
everybody way back when _ that's funny as in ``odd.'' At Ford, it's
probably not a laughing matter.
</P>
<P>
   Back in the mid-'70s, Ford's Hal Sperlich had a vision _ a
front-drive minivan. Henry Ford II didn't share the vision; Hank
the Deuce wanted no part of front-drive minivans or front-drive
anything else just then. Sperlich insisted; Ford resisted. Sperlich
lost the argument and his job at Ford, found gainful employment
with a foundering Chrysler Corp., where he also found the
front-drive K-car in the works, a perfect platform for his vision.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhat later, Lee Iacocca, too, after a split with Henry II,
left Ford to take over the sinking Chrysler ship and engineer its
rescue and recovery _ but the minivan wasn't Iacocca's baby, and
neither was the K-car, even though he promoted both of them as only
the master pitchman could. It is one of those sad facts of history
that the quiet work of the inventive genius often fades from memory
while the lingering echoes of the pitchman are etched in the public
consciousness.
</P>
<P>
   Chrysler's desperation and Sperlich's vision gave birth to a new
kind of vehicle and a whole new market _ and Chrysler owned it. It
took two decades for a serious challenge to Chrysler minivan
dominance to manifest itself, and the struggle for van sales is
giving the consumer a splendid array of choices. The leadership is
not clear _ the top manufacturers all offer roomy vans with
innovative seating, lots of cupholders, two sliding doors, and
reliable engines. On top are Chrysler, Ford, Honda, and Toyota, not
necessarily in that order, and right there is the somewhat smaller
Mercury/Nissan joint venture. Far back is everybody else.
</P>
<P>
   Honda's Odyssey would seem to be the current leader, based on
innovative interior design _ a disappearing seat, flat load space,
and a spare tire conveniently inside under the floor, plus the
almost mandatory twin sliding doors. But Ford Windstar has a
five-star crash rating, Toyota Sienna offers the cachet of Toyota's
impeccable reputation for reliability, and, of course, Chrysler has
all that experience and seats that roll on wheels _ and the biggest
chunk of the market. General Motors offers redesigned versions of
its ``Dustbuster'' collection in Pontiac, Chevy, and Oldsmobile
flavors, and General Motors has a reputation for ... a long history
of blunders.
</P>
<P>
   Your columnist has been happily tooling about in a 1999 Ford
Windstar SEL, a $30,415 vehicle with lots of doors, a 3.8-liter V-6
engine, plenty of standard features, and a few extra trinkets that
boost the tab to $32,850 _ plus, of course, the $580 delivery tab.
If you can make do with one door less and a 3.0-liter V-6, you can
buy the Windstar and its five-star crash rating for $18,375 plus
delivery, still very well equipped with such as 4-wheel antilock
brakes, AM/FM stereo, power steering, 4-speed automatic
transmission, tachometer, two power outlets up front, and lots of
other bits _ but no AC at the base price. In between are three
other levels of refinement.
</P>
<P>
   The SEL is a virtual palace on wheels with leather, CD player,
extra interior lighting, an extra power outlet in the rear of the
vehicle (very convenient for campers and outdoor lovers, probably
the least likely group to buy a van this fancy), message center
with trip computer and compass, automatic headlights, etc. In
addition, the tested model had the trailer package (no serious
trailers need apply, but small boats and campers are fine), the
backup warning system, and the optional side air bags _ front bags
are standard, of course.
</P>
<P>
   The backup warning system sounds an intermittent beep when there
is an object behind you and you are in reverse gear. The closer you
get, the faster the beeping. Close to within eight inches, and the
beep becomes a steady tone. I loved it for the up-close warning,
but the thing was sensitive enough that it picked up things on the
sidewalk across the street as I backed out of the driveway _ one
doesn't need a warning at that long a range.
</P>
<P>
   On the road, it is very nice to drive, but its 150-horsepower
V-6 tends to creep a bit; speed control on the interstate is
advised _ provided you can manage to stay awake. Acceleration is
good, the ride softish, the road manners and handling quite good _
not quite as crisp as the Honda Odyssey, not afflicted with the
annoying understeer of the Olds Silhouette sampled a while back.
</P>
<P>
   Controls score well for convenience _ nice AC/heater controls
(front and rear), fair radio controls (although too many of them,
and a bit too closely packed), convenient placement of window and
door-lock switches. The power side doors operate either by pulling
on the handle to start a door in motion or by electric switches
over the windshield _ which has a lockout function to disable the
other controls _ buttons in the B-pillars, exposed when the doors
are open, will serve as an alternative closing mechanism.
</P>
<P>
   The glove box is small, but there's lots of storage in this
model, bins, a drawer, a cargo net. It's the overhead storage array
that got me. At the brow of the windshield is the first
compartment, hiding a fold-down wide-angle mirror for unobtrusively
checking the rear passengers _ it doesn't interfere with the
rear-view mirror. Then comes a flip-down coin holder, a flip-down
eyeglass compartment, and last, a flip down something-or-other with
a Velcro lining. The array ends with an overhead map light.
</P>
<P>
   Windstar SEL is elegant, versatile, quiet, comfortable, and this
sample delivered 22.2 miles per gallon _ not bad for a living room
on wheels. It's safe to say that Ford has pretty well caught up _
but leap frog, not catch-up, is the winning strategy.
</P>
<P>
   How to choose a van? Well, there isn't a whole lot separating
the top contenders from one another. Start by selecting the
features you absolutely must have, then the things you'd really
like to have, then make the important choice: a dealer or dealers.
It's among dealers where the significant differences are to be
found.

 Skiers must beware lightning in winter
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Lightning isn't just a summertime worry for golfers, boaters,
and hikers. It can also be a winter hazard for skiers.
</P>
<P>
   A new study documents two examples from the Colorado slopes.
</P>
<P>
   In Vail, one skier, a 38-year-old man, was struck by lightning
just after getting off the ski lift, and died. In Breckenridge, a
ski patrol member was struck while on the way to a rescue. He
briefly lost consciousness and the lightning burned the corneas of
his eyes, but he survived.
</P>
<P>
   While a winter lightning storm is rarer than a summertime one,
it can be more dangerous, according to the study's authors, led by
Michael Cherington, a Denver lightning specialist.
</P>
<P>
   In winter, a lightning storm's warning signs can be less obvious
and its electrical charge more powerful, said the study in the
British Journal of Sports Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Winter lightning usually occurs during the falling of snow
pellets _ a mixture of ice crystals made up of supercooled cloud
droplets and bigger ice particles, and typically smaller and
spongier than hail, according to the authors.
</P>
<P>
   The study and an accompanying commentary recommend that when
such conditions exist, skiers, and snowboarders should take
appropriate shelter _ that is, not under a tree.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; Women's arrythmia risk said to be greater
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Women are at higher risk of experiencing a rare but potentially
fatal heart rhythm disturbance after taking a widely prescribed
antibiotic used to treat everything from urinary tract infections
to acne, according to a new study.
</P>
<P>
   Out of 346 reports of cardiac arrhythmias associated with
erythromycin between 1970 and 1996, 58 percent of them occurred in
women and 32 percent in men. Gender was not specified in the the
remaining 10 percent of reports made to the Food and Drug
Administration, said the study in the current issue of the Journal
of the American Medical Association.
</P>
<P>
   Differences in the number of prescriptions written for women and
for men did not account for the gender difference in the arrhythmia
reports, write the researchers from Georgetown University Medical
Center.
</P>
<P>
   Neither did the researchers think differences in reporting drug
side effects to the FDA explain the higher number of cases
involving women. Reports to the FDA are made voluntarily and thus
could underestimate the number of women experiencing arrhythmia
after taking erythromycin, the study said.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers said their findings confirm a gender difference
in drug-induced arrhythmia that has already been found in studies
of another class of drugs, a type of heart medication. They
theorize that female sex hormones may play a role in susceptibility
to the arrhythmia.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; Study calls for earlier diabetes screenings
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Blindness and other complications from a common form of diabetes
can be reduced by as much as 35 percent if people are screened for
the disease starting at age 25, rather than at the currently
recommended age of 45, according to a new US study.
</P>
<P>
   The benefits can be even greater for people at highest risk of
diabetes, including blacks and those who are severely overweight,
write the researchers from the US Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention, in the current issue of the Journal of the American
Medical Associaiton.
</P>
<P>
   Using a complex computer model, the researchers calculated the
costs of an early, one-time screen during a routine doctor's visit,
and the benefits of quicker detection of so-called Type 2 diabetes.
However, the model did not factor in the costs of repeated
screening or patients' inability to comply with treatment. Type 2
diabetes, once known as adult-onset diabetes, is usually treated
with changes in diet and pills.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers acknowledge that private insurance companies may
not have the financial incentive to cover an earlier diabetes test,
which can cost from $28 to $106, depending on the test. That's why
they recommend that government insurers, like Medicare and
Medicaid, consider adopting the earlier screening.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; Smoking found to fail as a weight-loss aid
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The notion of smoking to lose weight does not appear to be true,
finds a new study of 4,000 young adults, aged 18 to 30.
</P>
<P>
   Those who smoked or began smoking during the seven years of the
study did not shed pounds. And while black smokers appeared less
likely to gain weight with age, whites who smoked appeared just as
likely as non-smokers to get heavier as they got older.
</P>
<P>
   But the study in the Journal of Consulting and Clinical
Psychology did find that people who quit gained more weight than
those who kept smoking or never smoked at all, with an extra 9 to
15 pounds attributable to quitting.

 &HT;    Wall Street represents big divide over opposing views
 &HT;    By Staff reports
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The long 1990s bull market has: (A) Been a boon to
Main Street thanks to the ``wealth effect''; or (B) ``Encouraged
the tricksters'' and ``will leave many individuals wrecked upon the
shoals of greed and improvidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Those drastically different perspectives come from the December
editions of Smart Money and Harper's Magazine.
</P>
<P>
   In Smart Money, Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist James B.
Stewart credits the bull market with rescuing financially troubled
Quincy, Ill., a ``microcosm of the U.S.'' that he said has changed
more in the past 10 years than in the previous 50.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest and most prosperous city in Illinois in the 19th
century, with its Mississippi River commerce, Quincy's downtown by
1990 ``looked like Beirut,'' the mayor told Stewart.
</P>
<P>
   But the opportunities and money generated by the 1990s bull
market boosted individual and family businesses. Now, even the
downtown ``is looking up.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Although certain of the town's economic problems remain
unresolved, there is agreement that the decade has rescued Quincy
from what seemed like a slow slide into oblivion.'' Stewart writes.
</P>
<P>
   If that's true, it's in spite of Wall Street, contributing
editor Ted C. Fishman writes in Harper's.
</P>
<P>
   Most people probably assume financial markets play by the rules
of supply, demand and the Securities and Exchange Commission, and
that ultimately, ``fortune favors the lucky and the smart and the
diligent,'' writes Fishman. ``The idea, simply, is wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Although stock exchanges and brokerages are famously bullish
on American free-market capitalism, (for an individual) to
participate in the markets is necessarily to play by the house
rules _ unfair, inefficient and closed,'' he concludes.
</P>
<P>
   Betting on Greenspan
</P>
<P>
   The surprise cut in interest rates Oct. 15 should not have come
as a shock to anyone who is familiar with Alan Greenspan's past,
Money (December) says of the Federal Reserve chairman. ``Greenspan
is predictable, and that's good,'' it contends.
</P>
<P>
   Back on track
</P>
<P>
   Once the dominant force in business _ and politics _ railroads
have lost market share for 50 years or more. But they are on a roll
again, Individual Investor (December) reports. And the best play
for individual investors may be the companies that supply them.
</P>
<P>
   The magazine recommends Johnstown America Industries, which
makes freight cars, among other items; Varlen, which makes
precision-engineered transportation products; and Westinghouse Air
Brake, which makes a wide range of products _ including air brakes.

</P>
<P>
   ``Martin has developed successful marketing and customer service
strategies and programs for airline alliances, new branded
products, corporate identity and brand imagery, frequent flier
programs and other critical marketing activities, all of which are
very relevant to work under way at Delta,'' Reid said.

 &HT;    Santa's continuing education
 &HT;    By Patti Bond
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ In these complicated times, it takes more than a real
beard and big belly to be a professional Santa Claus.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, cheerfulness and patience and all the warm and fuzzy St.
Nick virtues count _ but the stuff that separates the Big Guys from
the elves is an intrinsic mix of wisdom and common sense. The
visions that dance in little heads can turn Santa's mall throne
into a therapist's chair of sorts.
</P>
<P>
   The wish list can get tricky, ranging from moderately delicate
(``All I want is a big dog'') to sobering (``Can you bring Daddy
back for Christmas?''). And there's always a mom or two who tells
Santa to make the kid buckle down on homework.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every year, the questions are becoming more difficult, and the
social issues are getting tougher, too,'' said Jim O'Connor,
president of Atlanta-based O'Connor Promotions Inc., a company that
places Santas in 16 shopping centers around the Southeast,
including about half of the malls in metro Atlanta. ``A big part of
our job is to learn how to react to the children's questions.''
</P>
<P>
   Social quandaries aside, there's no room for technophobes at
Santa's North Pole distribution center, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ten years ago, the kids were talking about Barbie; now they
want to know about CD-ROMs,'' O'Connor said. ``Kids seem so much
smarter than when I started the business 14 years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Even wise old Santa needs a refresher course on his social
skills, so every year just before the holiday season, O'Connor
rallies his troop of Santas in what seems like a combination boot
camp-pep rally-support group. This year, the Santas met at Planet
Hollywood in downtown Atlanta on the second Sunday in November.
</P>
<P>
   It's somewhat unnerving at first to watch a room full of
costumed Santas roll up their red velvet sleeves and tackle the
issues of damage control. This particular group will see 250,000
children this season. With the interests of eager children, parents
and mall management in mind, O'Connor pounds home the mantra for
Santa throughout the five-hour class.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone gets treated the same, whether it's 10 a.m. or 10
p.m.,'' he says. The list of dos and don'ts is routine for the most
part. Santa always smiles, he always listens, but he never promises
anything, especially when it comes to pets.
</P>
<P>
   And here's a sobering reality check: Santa must always keep his
white-gloved hands in sight.
</P>
<P>
   With those thoughts in mind, this bunch seems to concentrate on
the never-ending duties of their timeless celebrity status.
Although Santa's beard needs a quick salon touch-up just before the
season, the pros stay in character all year long.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no off days for us. You've got to be Santa 24 hours
a day, seven days a week,'' says Tom Chapman, a retiree who works
as an usher for the Atlanta Braves. Chapman's year-round whiskers
look so realistic that even in the middle of the summer stadium
patrons sometimes even ask for a picture with ``Santa.''
</P>
<P>
   There are plenty more stories of encounters at supermarkets,
banks and on the street, but when talking about some of Santa's
more serious interactions on the job, the mood turns from jolly to
woeful.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the stories will break your heart,'' said Johnny
Hammond, who works a daytime shift at Southlake Mall in Morrow.
Hammond's blue-gray eyes well up when he talks about a visit with a
9-year-old girl and her 3-year-old brother who was struggling with
a tracheotomy. ``She was talking for him and telling me what they
wanted. But when her mother was paying for the photo, she ran back
to me and said, `What I really want is for my brother to live
another year.'''
</P>
<P>
   Interaction with parents is demanding, too. After all, Santa is
not only representing the season, he's also representing the
shopping center. ``Santa is a goodwill ambassador for the mall,''
said Sue Adamo-Carpenter, marketing director for Cumberland Mall.
And keeping the parents happy is a big part of the job, marketers
say.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I interview Santas, I'm looking for how they handle the
parents as well as the children, because they've been in line for
an hour, too,'' said Lisa Shepherd, marketing director for North
Point Mall in Alpharetta.
</P>
<P>
   Marketers are becoming more diligent in their choices of Santa,
with good reason. Last year brought a variety of stories about
Santas gone bad. In one of the most shocking examples, a man
playing Santa at a metro Seattle mall was arrested for rape and
child molestation. In New Jersey, a Santa was busted for
shoplifting, and in Brooklyn, a boy recognized a mall Santa as his
deadbeat dad. The mother and estranged husband consequently had a
tussle near Santa's throne in full view of a line of youngsters.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Santa can cause quite a stir, even when he's just taking
a bathroom break. ``Never leave the set by yourself,'' O'Connor
tells his class. ``Always take a helper with you 'cause you'll get
mobbed.'' By the end of the day, it's clear that Santa has to keep
his cool.
</P>
<P>
   It could be argued no one's more suited for the job than North
Point's Tom Sisk, a child and adolescent psychologist in the
off-season. ``There aren't too many surprises with my background,''
says Sisk, who's starting his first year as a mall Santa. ``My job
as Santa has a lot of the same specifics.''
</P>
<P>
   The first week has been fairly standard, he says. ``So far, just
a lot of requests for Barbies, bicycles and Teletubbies.

 &HT;    Don't head to the mall budget-free
 &HT;    By Vikki Ramsey Conwell
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Before you head out for the sales tomorrow, here's a
warning from Consumer Credit Counseling Service: Unless you've
already set up a holiday spending budget and prepared a shopping
list, don't go. Stay home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Heading to the malls without a concrete plan is a recipe for a
holiday hangover,'' said Suzanne Boas, president of CCCS of Greater
Atlanta. ``It's a dangerous time to be operating without a budget
because it's an easy way to let your heart rule your head. You'll
wake up in January to quite a rude awakening when the bills come.''
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally, the day after Thanksgiving marks the beginning of
the holiday shopping season. Americans hit the stores in a mad rush
for early-bird specials and discounts.
</P>
<P>
   ``This type of frenzied environment can lead people to get
carried away and spend more than they can afford,'' said Boas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all dream of the perfect holiday, complete with a pile of
gifts, but the desire to fulfill this fantasy can cause us to
forget the reality of our personal financial limits.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the National Retail Federation, consumers expect to
spend an average of $814 on holiday gifts this year, up 4.5 percent
from last year. But people generally underestimate their holiday
spending, consumer experts say, and the strong economy may coax
some into spending more than they'd planned. Also, surveys
indicate, fewer than half of Americans set up a holiday spending
budget, and many purchases are put on credit cards.
</P>
<P>
   That could mean trouble for those who are already overextended.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many people buy without thinking,'' said Andy Jacob, president
of World Wide Financial, a consumer lending company which
specializes in people with credit problems. ``They know they are
spending more money than they should, but they are into immediate
gratification. They want what they want today, and they put
themselves in a position not to be able to pay off the debt during
the year.''
</P>
<P>
   According to a recent CCCS survey, 70 percent of respondents
reported holiday spending put them deeper in debt, and 30 percent
are still paying off bills from last Christmas. Of those who admit
to overspending, 53 percent said they ``got carried away,'' 39
percent cited last-minute purchases and gifts costing more than
expected, and 33 percent claimed poor planning.
</P>
<P>
   Shoppers also need to resist the urge to throw in ``goodies''
for themselves when shopping for others, experts cautioned.
</P>
<P>
   ``Make sure you can afford it,'' Jacob said. ``It will save you
a lot of pain down the road.''
</P>
<P>
   HOW TO AVOID OVERSPENDING
</P>
<P>
   _ Write down your total debt at the top of your shopping list,
as a reminder of how much money you already owe.
</P>
<P>
   _ Don't shop in a rush. When you're pressed for time, you're
more likley to overspend.
</P>
<P>
   _ Visit the mall at less crowded times. Shop early in the week
and early in the day.
</P>
<P>
   _ Think twice before you buy. Ask yourself if the gift is
appropriate for the recipient and in your price range.
</P>
<P>
   _ Use cash when possible. Doing so forces you to stick to your
pre-set spending limits.
</P>
<P>
   _ If you're going to use credit cards, create a plan to pay off
purchases within 90 days of the holidays.
</P>
<P>
   _ Try to use the credit card with the lowest interest rate.
</P>
<P>
   _ Track your spending. As you buy, cross out the names on your
list and record the amount spent.
</P>
<P>
   _ Put off some shopping. If there are people you won't see until
after the holidays, trade gifts with them then so you can take
advantage of post-holiday sales.
</P>
<P>
   _ When you're done shopping, stop! Extra trips to the mall will
lead you to spend more money.

 &HT;    Synovus to purchase Canterbury Trust
 &HT;    By Rob Chambers
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Synovus Financial of Columbus, Ga., has agreed to
acquire Birmingham, Ala.-based Canterbury Trust, which manages $1
billion in assets. Terms of the stock transaction were not
disclosed. The deal is expected to close in the first quarter,
subject to regulatory and shareholder approval.
</P>
<P>
   The Birmingham company's clients tend to be large institutions.
Half of its business is foundation management, said Synovus
Financial spokesman Pat Reynolds. The rest is focused on employee
benefits, personal trusts and custodial services.
</P>
<P>
   The company will become a division of Synovus Trust Co. of
Alabama. Canterbury Trust was founded in early 1992. Synovus
Financial became a 20 percent owner when it bought First Commercial
Bancshares of Birmingham, which had held the stake, later that
year.
</P>
<P>
   The planned purchase of the remaining shares ``broadens our
existing Synovus Trust product offerings, which is part of Synovus'
overall plan to expand its product lines,'' Reynolds said.
</P>
<P>
   Synovus Financial, with $10 billion in assets, is the
second-largest banking company based in Georgia. It owns 35 banks
in Georgia, Alabama, Florida, and South Carolina. Synovus Financial
also owns 80.7 percent of Total System Services, a large card
processor also located in Columbus.

 &HT;    WorldTravel beginning to go places
 &HT;    By Scott Thurston
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The usual travel agency trappings _ posters of Waikiki
Beach, cruise line brochures, maybe a model airliner on a stand _
are conspicuously absent at the offices of WorldTravel Partners.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta-based WorldTravel hasn't become one of the nation's
biggest travel companies by relying on storefront franchises that
entice passersby with vacation scenes.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, it concentrates on the behind-the-scenes, high-volume
world of corporate travel management and, increasingly, Internet
bookings.
</P>
<P>
   It also concentrates on growth.
</P>
<P>
   Last month WorldTravel vaulted from No. 8 to No. 3 in the
industry through a merger with BTI Americas, a larger company based
in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   The name of the combined company remained WorldTravel, and the
home office stayed in Atlanta, in the tony Lenox Park office
complex. Annual air booking volume more than tripled to $3.3
billion, and employment jumped to 5,000 from 1,800.
</P>
<P>
   The deal capped a swift climb to the top rungs of the industry
by WorldTravel, which only a decade ago was a regional agency with
$50 million in annual air bookings.
</P>
<P>
   Now, only American Express Travel Services, an arm of the New
York financial giant, and Carlson Wagonlit, a venerable travel firm
based in Minneapolis, are bigger.
</P>
<P>
   Privately held WorldTravel has a sister company, Dallas-based
Travel Technologies Group, that develops travel software. Another
sister firm, Online Fulfillment Services, processes Internet
bookings at a center in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of our in-house technology base and entrepreneurial
style, we're a fast-moving company,'' Chief Executive Jack
Alexander said. ``Life at the millennium demands that. People want
service now.''
</P>
<P>
   The WorldTravel-BTI Americas linkup reflects a wave of
consolidation among travel management companies, which are joining
forces to build purchasing leverage and bigger client bases.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone compiling a list of the nation's Top 10 travel
management firms these days would be wise to use a pencil rather
than ink,'' Travel Agent magazine noted in a cover story on the
WorldTravel-BTI merger, which it called a ``mega-match.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We think there are going to be a handful of brands in this
industry, and ours will be one of them,'' said Danny Hood, a
WorldTravel veteran who is co-president of the merged company along
with former BTI Chief Ralph Manaker.
</P>
<P>
   ``There may still be thousands of travel agencies,'' Hood added,
``but only a few companies that will offer the global services to
handle a $100 million corporate account.''
</P>
<P>
   About 80 percent of WorldTravel's business involves corporate
travel accounts. Clients include Turner Broadcasting, Arthur
Andersen, Motorola and Dow Chemical.
</P>
<P>
   WorldTravel operates in-house travel agencies for large clients,
and it has reservation centers around the country to take calls
from smaller business customers. The company negotiates fee-based
contracts for its services, shielding it somewhat from airline
commission cuts that are making life difficult for small travel
agencies.
</P>
<P>
   One area Alexander and Hood say is primed for growth is
corporate meetings management, which they view as a natural adjunct
to the core business.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a tremendous opportunity to help companies understand,
organize and operate meetings,'' Alexander said.
</P>
<P>
   WorldTravel also is making its mark on the Internet. Online
bookings still account for only a small fraction of all travel
bookings, but growth is steep.
</P>
<P>
   Online Fulfillment, the WorldTravel sister unit, processes
bookings made through Microsoft's Expedia Travel site, among
others. Once an online booking is completed, the company handles
the back-office work and sends out tickets or itineraries.
Customers who need more service deal with its agents. Revenue per
transaction is lower than in traditional bookings, but so are
costs, because much of the work is automated.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander likens the work to credit-card processing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see ourselves as a Total Systems or First Data,'' he said,
referring to two firms big in credit-card processing. ``It's a
volume game, and those with big volume can do well.''
</P>
<P>
   WorldTravel is owned mostly by Dutch real estate investor John
A. Fentener van Vlissingen. Alexander, an accountant by training,
was working for van Vlissengen and helped engineer a 1987 buyout of
WorldTravel Advisors.
</P>
<P>
   The company bought 30 smaller agencies, picking up more business
accounts, and in 1992 put them all under the WorldTravel Partners
brand.
</P>
<P>
   By the beginning of this year, the company had grown to about $1
billion in annual bookings. But Alexander and Hood felt a merger
was needed, and BTI Americas _ the product of a previous merger _
was on the market. Its geographical strength in the Midwest
complemented WorldTravel's presence in the South and East.
</P>
<P>
   BTI Americas brought with it $2.3 billion in annual air
bookings, along with 53 franchises with an additional $600 million
in bookings. It also brought the American partnership in Business
Travel International, a global marketing alliance.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are three types of agencies: mega, super-regional and
local,'' Hood said. ``We were kind of stuck at the super-regional
level. The biggest thing the merger gave us was the size and scope
of being No. 3. That means a lot of purchasing leverage. Size
matters with suppliers.''
</P>
<P>
   Alexander said he expects some growth in the Atlanta
headquarters employment as a result of the BTI Americas deal.

FOR MILLIONS, THANKSGIVING A TIME TO SAY GRACE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIEGO RIBADENEIRA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ As millions of people gather before bountiful feasts
Thursday, blessing the meal is a cherished and longtime tradition
for many families. Thanksgiving and grace do seem to go together,
even for the unchurched.
</P>
<P>
   Though the holiday seems at times to have been reduced to
gorging and football, many families say they try to retain a sense
of why the holiday was created when the Pilgrims sat down to the
first Thanksgiving meal 377 years ago _ gratitude.
</P>
<P>
   ``Grace forces us to take a moment and hopefully think seriously
of what we have been given,'' said Patrick E. Knight, 76, who will
lead the prayer for about 10 family members who will gather at his
home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes things get so hectic we lose sight of what
Thanksgiving is all about.''
</P>
<P>
   Some, like the Sides family, have unique ways of doing that. For
years William Sides would read the story of the first Thanksgiving
and then carefully set five kernels of corn on each person's plate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a way to remind us that we were lucky that we never had
to worry where our next meal was coming from and that a lot of
people weren't so lucky and maybe we should try and think of what
we could do for them,'' said Bill Sides Jr. ``Sometimes he would
get upset if one of the children was fidgeting or someone wasn't
paying enough attention.''
</P>
<P>
   Sides is not sure what's going to happen this year when the
extended family comes together at Sides' brother's house in Acton.
His father died in February.
</P>
<P>
   But Sides does not want his dad's tradition to die. ``We won't
decide what to do until we get to my brother's,'' he said. Bill and
Michelle Young try to inject a little humor into the Thanksgiving
grace with the help of a bag of M&AMP;M's. They insert the candies
inside napkins at the table.
</P>
<P>
   ``However many M&AMP;M's you get, that's how many things you have to
say you are thankful for,'' said Michelle Young, who will spend
Thursday first at her in-law's house and then at her sister's home.
</P>
<P>
   Young, however, faces a bit of a dilemma when she goes to her
sister's. Saying grace, she said, ``is a little bit difficult
because in my family a lot of them don't believe in that. So to
break the ice, I'll typically look at my mom and dad and say,
`You're all a bunch of heathens.' And then they'll look at me and
my husband and say, `OK, you say the prayer.' And then I will and
it'll be OK.''
</P>
<P>
   Some families, like the Riveras of Worcester, say grace only on
special occasions like Thanksgiving.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  ``We all have such crazy schedules with work, school, sports
that we rarely eat together as a family,'' said Carlos
Rivera. &UR;  &LR; ``But Thanksgiving is when we put all that stress aside
and my brother comes up from New York, my sister comes out from
Boston and all the kids are together.
</P>
<P>
   ``So we go around the table and each person says what happened
in the past year they are thankful for,'' he said. ``It's just nice
to have the time to stop and reflect on that. That's sort of what
grace is for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Other families, like the Coates of Northborough, Mass., say
grace before every meal. But on Thanksgiving, she said, the family
tries to find at least one ``special way in which God has provided
or done something in our lives.''
</P>
<P>
   She and her husband, Mike, will celebrate Thanksgiving at home,
and Coates said she will thank God for helping see her family
through after her husband was laid off.
</P>
<P>
   Eden Grace, a Quaker, has a different grace practice. Because
Quakers typically worship in silence unless they feel moved by God
to speak, her blessing is usually just a silent moment before
eating.
</P>
<P>
   But her mother is a musician and not a Quaker so the family
custom is for Eden Grace to sing grace in the form of a canon in
Latin.
</P>
<P>
   Alison and Kenneth Stephenson have had the same Thanksgiving
grace tradition for seven years. They sing a grace song written by
Alison's brother-in-law, a former high school music teacher and
percussionist with the Miami Symphony Orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's wonderful because each year he adds a new verse for any
new baby or anyone else who's joined our crew,'' said Alison
Stephenson who will be hosting about 15 guests in her home.
</P>
<P>
   Imani Smith's grace tradition may have to change this year. Her
grandfather, who always sits at the head of the table, has said
grace for years, but he may not this year because his daughter _
Smith's mother _ died of a heart attack in February.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mom was the one who always influenced us to make sure we
got together on Thanksgiving as a family,'' said Smith. ``And now
she's gone and it's going to be hard on my grandfather. I would
like to do the grace as a tribute to him and to her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I'll tell God that the table looks different this year
because we're missing someone who was so important to us,'' she
said.

ZOLAK REVVED UP FOR HIS BIG CHANCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ Scott Zolak is going to ask if he can borrow
Drew Bledsoe's Porsche this week. After all, starting quarterbacks
drive Porsches.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, if Zolak does replace the injured Bledsoe Sunday and
beats the Buffalo Bills, he might be able to afford his own.
</P>
<P>
   The decision on who plays quarterback for the Patriots probably
won't be made until Bledsoe takes the practice field Friday. But it
may not be made until game time. And there's always the possibility
that Bledsoe starts, is unable to play effectively, and Zolak comes
off the bench.
</P>
<P>
   If Zolak plays well in Bledsoe's place, he may set himself up
for a nice contract _ if not here, then somewhere else _ when he
becomes an unrestricted free agent at the end of the season. Zolak,
who hasn't started a regular-season game since Oct. 1, 1995,
wouldn't have much competition in the market, because it'll be a
lean year for free agent quarterbacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not thinking about that yet,'' said Zolak Wednesday. ``I
still don't know if I'll play.
</P>
<P>
   ``Depending on how I play, there might be a difference in what
I'm driving. I'm not thinking about that, though. It's a crucial
situation and we're 6-5 and fighting to make the playoffs. It's a
crucial game and I don't want to let these guys down. If I don't
prepare as the guy, I'd just be cheating myself and the team.''
</P>
<P>
   Coach Pete Carroll said he will have three active quarterbacks
on the roster Sunday and he also re-signed Northeastern's Jim
Murphy to the practice squad Wednesday so Murphy could work on the
scout teams and play Doug Flutie's part in practice.
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe, who fractured the index finger on his right hand in two
places while directing the game-winning drive against the Dolphins
Monday night, said Wednesday, ``It's a little sore, a little
swollen. I really won't know what the scenario is until Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll wait and try to throw. If I can hit what I'm aiming at,
I'll play. If I can't hit what I'm aiming at, I won't play. It's
pretty simple.''
</P>
<P>
   Simple, but complex.
</P>
<P>
   If Bledsoe can't play, Zolak has to step in cold and try to get
down the timing with receivers he normally doesn't throw to as the
second-string quarterback. He'll be put into the Patriots' new
spread-out formation, which seemed perfectly suited for Bledsoe.
</P>
<P>
   Zolak is much more mobile than Bledsoe, so should we expect him
to run more?
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going with the same offense,'' said Zolak. ``I can throw
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Carroll said: ``We will adjust some. Zo hasn't played football
in a long time. We have a feeling that Zo has an understanding of
the things we need to get done.''
</P>
<P>
   Zolak had lots of support from his teammates Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't think of anyone else I'd rather have step in there
than Scott,'' said middle linebacker Ted Johnson. ``He's a fiery
guy and I know he can lead us. We'll throw our full support to
Scott and help him any way we can. But I think the team feels good
with Scott.''
</P>
<P>
   Zolak said he's in every game mentally. He has been to every
practice for eight years. But he knows the situation. He may be
asked to replace a man who threw for 423 yards and pulled out one
of the gutsiest games of the season on ``Monday Night Football.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to go out there and play loose, like I always do, and
be myself,'' said Zolak.
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe, too, has rarely missed a practice, but Wednesday he
walked around the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first time I've had to deal with a broken
finger,'' said Bledsoe. ``I've always been fortunate because QBs
tend to bang their hands against helmets and pads, but in this case
(defensive tackle Shane Burton) happened to have his hand where I
was releasing the ball and I stuck my finger in his palm, and there
you have it.''
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe came to the sidelines, wondering whether he could go
back out and help the team. His finger was numb. He was throwing
the football with four fingers.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what made the decision so difficult,'' he said. ``It
wasn't a situation where it hurts and you stay in the game. I just
didn't know if I could throw the ball accurately to help us. I felt
I needed to go to the sidelines, but it was a dilemma.''
</P>
<P>
   If on Sunday his finger felt the way it did at the end of the
Miami game, could he play?
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' he said. ``I don't think so.
</P>
<P>
   ``If on Friday it's close, then we'll wait until game time.
We'll evaluate it Friday and then again at game time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was fortunate and the team was fortunate that some of those
(passes in the Miami game) weren't intercepted. If I can't throw
with precision, then Scott will come in and play.''
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe will experiment with different splints; he had a mold
taken of his finger Monday. One tough aspect will be taking snaps.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I don't play, it's not over,'' said Bledsoe. ``Scott is a
very good quarterback and Scott will come in and give us a good
effort and he'll win the game for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Zolak has the same confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eight years in the league and I've been through the mill
watching this kid (Bledsoe) play and working with him,'' said
Zolak. ``I go through it mentally in practice. That's what I get
paid to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``You definitely want to play, but I know my role the last six
years. We have a good relationship. There are a lot of starters and
backups who don't get along. He's the man here. He's the franchise
guy here. I just have to go out and do what I get paid for.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a strange juxtaposition Wednesday. Zolak strapped on his
helmet. Bledsoe was on the stationary bike. At one point Bledsoe
was about to start work on his running when Carroll called him over
to watch the first-team warmups.
</P>
<P>
   All the while, Bledsoe kept his hand, with the finger wrapped
and in a splint, tucked in the pocket of his warmup sweater.
Earlier in the day, when Steve Grogan presented him with the Miller
Lite NFL Player of the Week award, Bledsoe shook Grogan's hand with
his left hand.
</P>
<P>
   Everything indicates that Bledsoe will likely miss a game for
the first time since October 1995. And that the season on the brink
will rest on the 6-foot-5-inch, 230-pound frame of Scott Zolak.

CONNECTICUT LEADERS AGREE TO USE SURPLUS TO BUILD STADIUM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TINA CASSIDY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Governor John Rowland and Connecticut legislative leaders
Wednesday agreed in principle to use some of their state's budget
surplus to help fund the New England Patriots stadium, proposed for
downtown Hartford.
</P>
<P>
   Officials also scheduled debate on the plan for Dec. 15, when
the General Assembly would be called back for a special session to
vote on the memorandum of understanding that Patriots owner Robert
Kraft signed with Rowland last week to move the National Football
League franchise from Foxborough, Mass. in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   The publicly-funded stadium project, including infrastructure
improvements, would cost $350 million. Connecticut's budget surplus
for fiscal 1999, which ends June 30, is currently estimated at $171
million, a spokesman for Rowland said.
</P>
<P>
   While the state ended last year with a $610 million surplus,
budget experts said the fiscal year could end with at least a $300
million surplus, in which case $50 million could be set aside for
the stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The state would issue bonds for the rest of the project, Rowland
said Wednesday, after a meeting with House and Senate leaders.
</P>
<P>
   So far, lawmakers have not earmarked the surplus for other uses,
such as a rebate to taxpayers. Wednesday, they agreed in principle
to set aside any amount necessary to supplement the state's
expected $250 million bond issue for the stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``That should alleviate some of the concerns of the members of
the Legislature who are concerned about borrowing,'' said Dean
Pagani, a spokesman for Rowland. Borrowing ``was a little bit of an
issue in the last governor's race, but not an overwhelming issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in Boston, state representatives and Governor Paul
Cellucci said they were surprised by statements that House Majority
Leader William Nagle made in Wednesday's Boston Globe, saying there
is a ``willingness to at least talk'' with Kraft.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish they said that last summer. We might have been able to
work it out,'' Cellucci said of the Legislature's failure to
resolve differences in House and Senate proposals, separated by $13
million. ``If, in fact, the House is willing to do that, it's good
news. But, depending on what Connecticut does now, it might be too
late.''
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci said he did not know what to make of Nagle's comments
and sounded resigned to the idea that the Patriots will leave if
Connecticut lawmakers approve the lucrative plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a convention center we will start building next year
that, in terms of the economic impact ... will dwarf the economic
impact of the Patriots,'' Cellucci said.
</P>
<P>
   Representative Jo Ann Sprague, a Republican, said she was one of
the many House members who made their concern about the team
leaving known to Massachusetts Speaker Thomas M. Finneran, Nagle's
boss.
</P>
<P>
   ``Apparently he has spoken to the speaker,'' Sprague said. ``I
was very pleased. It looks like there's some room for coming back
to the table again if all things don't go well in Hartford. I know
the members and our constituents have let the speaker know that
we're concerned.''
</P>
<P>
   But Nagle's offer to renegotiate with Kraft did not seem to
rattle confident Connecticut lawmakers. They're sticking to their
original mid-December date to reconvene for a vote on the deal,
under which Kraft agrees to build a hotel next to a proposed
convention center and move the team, corporate offices, and
training facilities there.
</P>
<P>
   ``The view from here is the state of Connecticut has a deal to
negotiate exclusively with the Patriots till the end of the year,
and, if things don't work here, all bets are off,'' Pagani said.
``And clearly the Legislature in Massachusetts is going to do
whatever it feels is in the best interest of Massachusetts. But the
same thing is happening down here.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Pagani said that Nagle's statements did not put any
pressure on the Hartford deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anybody's looking at it as a race,'' Pagani
said. ``We feel we're in a good position to close the deal. All
that's left is a vote in the Legislature.''
</P>
<P>
   Reached at home Wednesday, Nagle said it was too early to
discuss alternative stadium proposals, which he hinted at in the
earlier interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's always moveable pieces in those things,'' Nagle said.
``But it's too early to say. ... The public perception is the door
is shut and locked and nailed shut. That isn't the case.''

   WHITE-HOUSE _ WASHINGTON _ A day in the life of the White House
begins an hour before midnight when Susanna McGuire rubs her coded
photo ID across the electronic scanner at a wrought-iron gate,
punches in a personal number, then enters under the gaze of a
uniformed Secret Service agent. An ambitious young press aide who
will spend the night clipping papers for President Clinton's
morning news summary, McGuire is one of hundreds of human cogs who
make the White House a perpetual motion machine _ running day after
day, decade after decade, president after president. Unique in the
world, the building where the president lives and works is among
the most recognizable symbols of American democracy. It is a home
and a museum, a fortress and a bureaucracy, a playground and a
monument and a backdrop for TV newscasts. It is a place permeated
with the temptations of power, of course, but also blessed with the
virtues of community and continuity. (Dart, Cox News Service 3500).

PINOCHET CASE TO SPUR OTHER INQUIRIES, OBSERVERS SAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By COLUM LYNCH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Life will never be the same for the world's
aging dictators whether or not General Augusto Pinochet stands
trial in Spain for genocide.
</P>
<P>
   Human rights advocates and legal scholars said the decision
Wednesday by Britain's highest legal authority to deny immunity to
the former Chilean ruler will encourage governments and courts
around the globe to take a new look at old political crimes.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling also signaled a growing willingness among national
courts to embrace the notion, long enshrined in international law,
that perpetrators of genocide or crimes against humanity can be
prosecuted anywhere in the world.
</P>
<P>
   France, Germany, Italy, Belgium, and Switzerland, among others,
have begun to seek Pinochet's extradition for murdering citizens of
their countries during Chile's ``dirty war.'' The phrase refers to
more than 3,000 political opponents whom Pinochet is charged with
murdering between 1973 and 1990, when he left office.
</P>
<P>
   Also, lawyers in the US Department of Justice have begun to
consider the extradition of Pinochet in connection with the 1977
assassination of exiled Chilean socialist Orlando Letelier and his
American associate, Ronny Moffit.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has clearly broken the ice,'' said Kenneth Roth,
executive director of Human Rights Watch. ``This decision will give
future tyrants pause before they embark on a path of mass murder.''
</P>
<P>
   The divided ruling by Britain's five Law Lords within the House
of Lords rejected arguments that a British law shielding foreign
heads of state from prosecution applies to former leaders for
crimes against humanity. Britain's Home Secretary, Jack Straw, is
expected to decide on Dec. 2 whether to extradite the 83-year-old
former Chilean strongman.
</P>
<P>
   ``The British court essentially ruled that torture is not part
of the job description,'' said Robert O. Weiner, an expert on
international law at the Lawyers Committee for Human Rights.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since the Nuremberg war crimes trials were established to
try Nazi war criminals, national courts have possessed the
authority to prosecute war criminals and oppressive dictators,
according to experts. But they have rarely exercised it.
</P>
<P>
   Weiner said this case alerts judges around the world to pursue
charges against other alleged war criminals. ``There is the
potential under American law to try extraterritorial crimes,''
Weiner said. ``Whether they will use that power is a matter of the
justice department and the courts.''
</P>
<P>
   Pinochet was arrested in London during a visit for medical
treatment. He was detained by British authorities after a Spanish
Judge, Baltasar Garzon, requested his extradition to stand trial in
the murders of Spanish citizens in Chile during Pinochet's reign.
</P>
<P>
   The pursuit of Pinochet signals a ``new era of enforcement''
against past and present war criminals, Louise Arbour, the chief
justice of the UN war crimes tribunals for Rwanda and the Balkans,
said in a recent interview.
</P>
<P>
   She cited the arrests last summer in Kenya of Rwanda's former
Prime Minister on charges of genocide and the hunt by NATO troops
for indicted Bosnia war criminals Radovan Karadzcic and Ratko
Mladic as the most recent examples.
</P>
<P>
   ``The intiative of Spanish Judge Baltasar Garzon to ask for
Pinochet's extradition would have been unthinkable not so long
ago,'' added Mary Robinson, the UN High Commissioner for Human
Rights. ``Both were made possible by a turn in the tide of
international law.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite enthusiastic reaction from the human rights community,
the Clinton administration response to Wednesday's decision was
muted.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been informal discussions in the Justice Department
as to whether there is a legal basis to indict him under US law and
seek his extradition,'' said White House spokesman David Leavy.
``But Pinochet's current status is an issue for the British and
Spanish judiciaries to work out and it would be inappropriate for
us to comment.''
</P>
<P>
   Alfred Rubin, professor of international law at the Fletcher
School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University, was critical of
Wednesdaythe decision. He thinks the extradition of Pinochet to
Spain would be ``a step we would all live to regret, not just the
supporters of Augusto Pinochet.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no reason why Judge Garzon cannot ask the United
States to extradite Henry Kissinger,'' Rubin said. ``After all,
Kissinger was involved in the overthrow of Salvador Allende by
Pinochet. And if Nixon were still alive, there would be no reason
why Spain, or Cambodia, could not ask for his extradition.''

AIRLINE'S SECURITY DEVICES WORKING, FAA SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS C. PALMER JR.  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The Federal Aviation Administration said Wednesday that
passenger security devices at AirTran Airways at Logan airport are
working properly.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA tested the airline's metal detector and other security
machines after an ex-security supervisor's allegations of faulty
equipment appeared in the Globe.
</P>
<P>
   FAA regional spokesman James A. Peters said federal law
prohibits disclosure of information about the failure of airport
security devices, or about investigations involving failure.
</P>
<P>
   But Peters said on Monday that the FAA was taking seriously the
claims of Thomas M. Ross, a former security supervisor with the
company that conducts passenger security screening for AirTran
Airways, formerly known as Valujet.
</P>
<P>
   Ross said that three different security devices at Terminal D at
Logan airport had intermittently flunked FAA tests since
mid-August. He said he notified both the FAA and the Massachusetts
Port Authority and nothing was done.
</P>
<P>
   The security screening for AirTran is done by a company called
Globe Aviation Services, which employed Ross until recently. Globe
Aviation executives did not return phone calls from a reporter.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for AirTran in Orlando, Fla., said this week that
the company also had not been able to reach Globe Aviation about
the alleged problems. Cara Maruskin, the spokeswoman, said the
company had not been notified by the FAA that its equipment had
failed tests in August and again in October.
</P>
<P>
   However, Peters, FAA spokesman for the New England region, said,
``We would notify them of what we found, right away, absolutely.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Peters could not confirm that the devices failed, as Ross
noted in his logs and charged in his letters, he did say that the
FAA was investigating. He would not give details.
</P>
<P>
   Peters said that after the Globe article appeared on Tuesday new
tests were done.
</P>
<P>
   ``The equipment is working, and it is up to FAA standards,'' he
said. ``And we will continue to monitor that.'' Though Peters said
the FAA requires airlines to repair broken security equipment
immediately, Ross said that had not been done in the case of
AirTran.
</P>
<P>
   Ross said Wednesday that he was sending copies of all of his
documentation to the inspector general of the U.S. Department of
Transportation. He said he was also sending the material to the
president of Globe Aviation Services, which does security for
Northwest Airlines as well as AirTran.

STARR MAY NEED ANOTHER 2 YEARS BEFORE ENDING CLINTON
INVESTIGATIONS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN C. HENRY 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ At least another 18 months, possibly two years,
will be needed by independent counsel Kenneth Starr to wrap up his
investigations of President Clinton, a Starr spokesman said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Although Starr has reported possible impeachable offenses to
Congress, his spokesman Charles Bakaly said the investigations have
not ended and decisions have yet to be made about whether to seek
criminal charges against Clinton for trying to conceal his affair
with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Bakaly said it would be improper for prosecutors to discuss
potential indictments, but agreed it would be ``fair to conclude''
that Starr still has the option of seeking indictments against
Clinton or others who might have been involved in trying to
cover-up his affair with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   And if charges are filed against Clinton, either after he is
removed from office by Congress or when his term expires in early
2001, Starr's operation would remain in business even longer.
</P>
<P>
   The prospect of two more years of Starr's investigation ``will
send chills down the spines of most taxpayers because it appears
(Starr and his staff) are out to set an unassailable record for
independent counsels,'' said White House spokesman Jim Kennedy,
referring to the $40 million spent so far by Starr to investigate
Clinton. ``It's like the nosy house guest who doesn't leave.''
</P>
<P>
   During a breakfast meeting with reporters, one of several public
appearances by Starr and his spokesman this week, Bakaly said the
independent counsel expressed concern that his investigation of
Clinton ``has been made so personal'' by the president and his
supporters.
</P>
<P>
   Bakaly said that Starr, a former federal appeals court judge and
solicitor general during the Bush administration, was widely
respected when he was appointed in August 1994 to take over the
investigation of Clinton's Arkansas business dealings.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Starr ``has been transmogrified into something
else,'' Bakaly said, contending the White House has portrayed the
investigation as a personal battle between Starr, who receives low
marks in public opinion polls, and Clinton, whose job performance
ratings have been near an all-time highs during the sex scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Starr ``does not believe he's out of tune with the American
people,'' Bakaly said. ``He recently expressed frustration with the
effect of the (White House) stonewalling strategy'' and expressed a
``frustration, a concern that people can lie and perjure themselves
and get away with that.''
</P>
<P>
   Starr took over the investigation of Clinton's Arkansas business
dealings known as Whitewater after Robert Fiske was forced out as
head of the inquiry that began in January 1994. During the past
four years, Starr's mandate has been expanded to include possible
misuse of FBI files, the death of White House counsel Vincent
Foster, the White House travel office firings and the Lewinsky
matter.
</P>
<P>
   In early September, Starr sent Congress a 453-page report filled
with salacious details alleging that Clinton lied under oath,
obstructed justice, tampered with witnesses and abused the power of
his office in an effort to cover up the 15-month affair he and
Lewinsky acknowledge they engaged in at the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Appearing last week before the House Judiciary Committee, which
is conducting an impeachment investigation of Clinton, Starr said
the FBI files and travel office cases had yielded no impeachable
offenses against the president. Starr also said he had found no
impeachable offenses in the Whitewater business deals. The Foster
case was closed 13 months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Still awaiting prosecution by Starr are Susan McDougal, who has
been charged with obstruction of justice and criminal contempt for
refusing to talk to a federal grand jury, and former Deputy
Attorney General Webster Hubbell, who was indicted a third time
earlier this month on perjury charges.
</P>
<P>
   The charges against McDougal and Hubbell stem from their
involvement in Whitewater, and both are considered key to
uncovering any wrongdoing by Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if everybody came in tomorrow, the office would be in
existence for a minimum of one and a half to two years,'' Bakaly
said during a breakfast meeting with reporters.
</P>
<P>
   While Starr could step down and let someone else complete the
inquiry and oversee remaining prosecutions, Bakaly said, ``my
feeling is that he is committed to making the prosecutive
decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   Before Starr steps down, he is required by law to submit a
report to the three-judge panel that appointed him, detailing his
investigations of Clinton's Whitewater involvement, the travel
office, the FBI files and the Lewinsky matter.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, before the office headed by Starr can close,
litigation fees must be negotiated with lawyers for people drawn
into the investigations. The law allowing appointment of
independent counsels allows for reimbursing some legal fees for
targets of the inquiry if the prosecutor finds they were not
involved in wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence Walsh, the independent counsel who investigated the
Iran-Contra scandal, was appointed in 1986. His inquiry did not end
until March 1994, and the final bills from the office were not
settled until well into 1995, when the tab topped $47 million.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation of abuses at the Department of Housing and
Urban Development, which began in 1990, ended earlier this month
after a run of more than eight years. &QL;

WINDSTAR'S A CLASSY VAN, BUT IT'S A CROWDED CLASS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)  
 (For release Sunday, November 29, 1998; normally moves Friday)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN R.WHITE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   You can't lead by playing catch-up. Nowhere is that more evident
than in the auto business _ especially in the Van Wars. At
Chrysler, they figured that out a long time ago. At Toyota and
Honda, they just figured it out. At Ford, as innovative as that
company can be, they're still a little slow off the mark.
</P>
<P>
   The '99 Windstar might have been the van leader, if the other
guys had stood still. But the other guys didn't, which puts Ford
about even with Chrysler overall, a tad behind Honda, perhaps,
thanks to that company's innovative interior design _ more than a
tad if Honda Odyssey manages to equal Windstar's five-star safety
rating.
</P>
<P>
   What's really funny about it all, is that Ford had the jump on
everybody way back when _ that's funny as in ``odd.'' At Ford, it's
probably not a laughing matter.
</P>
<P>
   Back in the mid-'70s, Ford's Hal Sperlich had a vision _ a
front-drive minivan. Henry Ford II didn't share the vision; Hank
the Deuce wanted no part of front-drive minivans or front-drive
anything else just then. Sperlich insisted; Ford resisted. Sperlich
lost the argument and his job at Ford, found gainful employment
with a foundering Chrysler Corp., where he also found the
front-drive K-car in the works, a perfect platform for his vision.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhat later, Lee Iacocca, too, after a split with Henry II,
left Ford to take over the sinking Chrysler ship and engineer its
rescue and recovery _ but the minivan wasn't Iacocca's baby, and
neither was the K-car, even though he promoted both of them as only
the master pitchman could. It is one of those sad facts of history
that the quiet work of the inventive genius often fades from memory
while the lingering echoes of the pitchman are etched in the public
consciousness.
</P>
<P>
   Chrysler's desperation and Sperlich's vision gave birth to a new
kind of vehicle and a whole new market _ and Chrysler owned it. It
took two decades for a serious challenge to Chrysler minivan
dominance to manifest itself, and the struggle for van sales is
giving the consumer a splendid array of choices. The leadership is
not clear _ the top manufacturers all offer roomy vans with
innovative seating, lots of cupholders, two sliding doors, and
reliable engines. On top are Chrysler, Ford, Honda, and Toyota, not
necessarily in that order, and right there is the somewhat smaller
Mercury/Nissan joint venture. Far back is everybody else.
</P>
<P>
   Honda's Odyssey would seem to be the current leader, based on
innovative interior design _ a disappearing seat, flat load space,
and a spare tire conveniently inside under the floor, plus the
almost mandatory twin sliding doors. But Ford Windstar has a
five-star crash rating, Toyota Sienna offers the cachet of Toyota's
impeccable reputation for reliability, and, of course, Chrysler has
all that experience and seats that roll on wheels _ and the biggest
chunk of the market. General Motors offers redesigned versions of
its ``Dustbuster'' collection in Pontiac, Chevy, and Oldsmobile
flavors, and General Motors has a reputation for ... a long history
of blunders.
</P>
<P>
   Your columnist has been happily tooling about in a 1999 Ford
Windstar SEL, a $30,415 vehicle with lots of doors, a 3.8-liter V-6
engine, plenty of standard features, and a few extra trinkets that
boost the tab to $32,850 _ plus, of course, the $580 delivery tab.
If you can make do with one door less and a 3.0-liter V-6, you can
buy the Windstar and its five-star crash rating for $18,375 plus
delivery, still very well equipped with such as 4-wheel antilock
brakes, AM/FM stereo, power steering, 4-speed automatic
transmission, tachometer, two power outlets up front, and lots of
other bits _ but no AC at the base price. In between are three
other levels of refinement.
</P>
<P>
   The SEL is a virtual palace on wheels with leather, CD player,
extra interior lighting, an extra power outlet in the rear of the
vehicle (very convenient for campers and outdoor lovers, probably
the least likely group to buy a van this fancy), message center
with trip computer and compass, automatic headlights, etc. In
addition, the tested model had the trailer package (no serious
trailers need apply, but small boats and campers are fine), the
backup warning system, and the optional side air bags _ front bags
are standard, of course.
</P>
<P>
   The backup warning system sounds an intermittent beep when there
is an object behind you and you are in reverse gear. The closer you
get, the faster the beeping. Close to within eight inches, and the
beep becomes a steady tone. I loved it for the up-close warning,
but the thing was sensitive enough that it picked up things on the
sidewalk across the street as I backed out of the driveway _ one
doesn't need a warning at that long a range.
</P>
<P>
   On the road, it is very nice to drive, but its 150-horsepower
V-6 tends to creep a bit; speed control on the interstate is
advised _ provided you can manage to stay awake. Acceleration is
good, the ride softish, the road manners and handling quite good _
not quite as crisp as the Honda Odyssey, not afflicted with the
annoying understeer of the Olds Silhouette sampled a while back.
</P>
<P>
   Controls score well for convenience _ nice AC/heater controls
(front and rear), fair radio controls (although too many of them,
and a bit too closely packed), convenient placement of window and
door-lock switches. The power side doors operate either by pulling
on the handle to start a door in motion or by electric switches
over the windshield _ which has a lockout function to disable the
other controls _ buttons in the B-pillars, exposed when the doors
are open, will serve as an alternative closing mechanism.
</P>
<P>
   The glove box is small, but there's lots of storage in this
model, bins, a drawer, a cargo net. It's the overhead storage array
that got me. At the brow of the windshield is the first
compartment, hiding a fold-down wide-angle mirror for unobtrusively
checking the rear passengers _ it doesn't interfere with the
rear-view mirror. Then comes a flip-down coin holder, a flip-down
eyeglass compartment, and last, a flip down something-or-other with
a Velcro lining. The array ends with an overhead map light.
</P>
<P>
   Windstar SEL is elegant, versatile, quiet, comfortable, and this
sample delivered 22.2 miles per gallon _ not bad for a living room
on wheels. It's safe to say that Ford has pretty well caught up _
but leap frog, not catch-up, is the winning strategy.
</P>
<P>
   How to choose a van? Well, there isn't a whole lot separating
the top contenders from one another. Start by selecting the
features you absolutely must have, then the things you'd really
like to have, then make the important choice: a dealer or dealers.
It's among dealers where the significant differences are to be
found.

DEMONSTRATORS PLAN RETURN TO PLYMOUTH 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds.:   All names are cq)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CINDY RODRIGUEZ  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A year after Native American demonstrators clashed with police
in Plymouth, Mass., sparking accusations of police brutality, an
estimated 1,000 demonstrators will return Thursday, hoping to
balance the town's ``propagated myth.''
</P>
<P>
   While Town Manager Eleanor Beth welcomes the demonstrators, the
Police Department plans to have all of its 100 officers on duty _
just in case.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope nothing happens,'' said Lt. Kevin Fahy.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, police arrested 25 demonstrators after they refused
to leave. Some witnesses said police used excessive force. Several
demonstrators, dubbed the ``Plymouth 25,'' filed lawsuits against
the town.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Plymouth settled with the United American Indians of
New England, paying the organization $135,000 _ most of which will
be used to educate people about indigenous history _ for dropping
the lawsuits. In turn, the town dropped charges. Police were upset
about the settlement, which they say implies wrongdoing on their
part last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's going on in Plymouth is that they're making a lot of
money off this false representation of Thanksgiving,'' said
Mahtowin Munro, a Lakota Indian who lives in Eastern Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pilgrim's Progress,'' the town's annual Thanksgiving tribute
will draw hundreds to watch 51 townspeople dressed as Pilgrims _
clutching Bibles and muskets _ walk from Plymouth Rock, through the
town Square, to the Church of the Pilgrimage.
</P>
<P>
   The 10 a.m. event will end long before a noon ``Day of
Mourning'' demonstration begins, during which an estimated 1,000
demonstrators will speak out about issues affecting Native
Americans. Munro said the Thanksgiving myth, that Pilgrims were
kind to Indians, is just one of many issues that will be discussed.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the settlement allows the United American Indians of New
England to demonstrate every Thanksgiving, but asks organizers to
notify the town about how many people they expect and the march
route, said Beth.
</P>
<P>
   She said the town was glad to settle.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they had filed multiple civil suits, it would've cost the
(town's) insurance company a great deal of money,'' said Beth. ``We
worked really hard on this settlement.''
</P>
<P>
   Beth said $100,000 was put in escrow with the American Civil
Liberties Union, until the Native American organization has filed
incorporation papers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the fact that everyone sat down and talked will go a
long way toward making it a peaceful day,'' Beth said.
</P>
<P>
   Munro says she wants peace, too, but hopes to wake Americans up
to historical facts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The US was built on the theft of native land, the genocide and
enslavement of native people, and the kidnapping and murder and
enslavement of people of African decent, who built this country,''
Munro said. ``That's not pretty.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not interested in making people feel guilty,'' she
continued. ``We just want people to know the truth. Then, maybe we
can have an intelligent discussion about what's going on in 1998.''

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Inclement weather will affect parts of the Northeast on Thursday
as developing low pressure lifts Atlantic moisture across the
region. Wet snow will fall in northern Maine and on the high ground
of northern New Hampshire and Vermont. The snow will accumulate
several inches in some areas. Farther south, mixed precipitation
will turn to rain in central New England as breezes from the
southeast usher warmer air into the area. Periods of heavy rain
will fall in southern New England, punctuated by rumbles of
thunder.
</P>
<P>
   Morning showers will give way to drying breezes and breaking
clouds during the afternoon in the Middle Atlantic States. Indeed,
temperatures will remain mild in the wake of the storm system, as
Arctic chill remains north of the Canadian border.
</P>
<P>
   Sunshine and warmth will cover much of the Plains and Southeast.
Expansive high pressure centered over Arkansas will prompt readings
in the 60s and 70s from the western Dakotas to North Carolina.
Meanwhile, clouds and breezes from the northwest will keep the
Great Lakes States more seasonal.
</P>
<P>
   The relentless parade of Pacific storms will plague the
Northwest as pockets of cold air aloft rotate into the region.
Spates of gusty winds and heavy rain will accompany intense showers
in coastal areas. As the showers move into the Cascades, heavy snow
will fall above 3,000 feet. Lighter showers will fall in the
valleys east of the mountains.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, the Southwest will remain mostly sunny and warm with
a few clouds in the mountains of Utah and Nevada.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: European Cold Wave
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, snow whitened parts of Capri off the coast of
southern Italy, the Mediterranean islandUs first snowfall in ten
years. Meanwhile, as much as 16 inches of snow capped Mt. Vesuvius
as an unusually cold air mass invaded western Europe on chilly
winds from the east. Closer to the center of the frigid air mass,
temperatures plunged to minus 2 degrees Fahrenheit in Moscow on
Nov. 17, prompting Russian meteorologists to declare the
mid-November outbreak the coldest in 20 years. If steering winds
shift and blow across the North Pole from Russia, the chill would
invade Canada.

HINDU NATIONALISTS MAY BE UNDONE BY THE PRICE OF ONIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl)

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW DELHI _ Indians were in a sour mood Wednesday as they voted
in elections that are most likely to weaken further the wobbly
Hindu nationalist-led coalition that came to power this year.
</P>
<P>
   Voters complained about soaring vegetable prices, crime and
endemic corruption as they left the polling booths.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're poor,'' said Lila Kumari, 48, who supports herself and
her elderly mother on her meager earnings from sewing sleeves onto
shirts. ``How can we eat?''
</P>
<P>
   Election officials will not begin counting the millions of votes
cast in the capital territory of Delhi and the states of Rajasthan,
Madhya Pradesh and Mizoram until Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   But exit polls conducted for the government-financed television
station found that Hindu nationalist governments in Delhi and
Rajasthan were being swept from power by the Congress Party, which
has governed India for most of its 51-year history as an
independent nation.
</P>
<P>
   In Madhya Pradesh, a large central state that Congress controls,
exit polling showed the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party
with a 2 percent lead. Polling experts said the margin of error
made it difficult to know the outcome until the votes had been
counted.
</P>
<P>
   In Mizoram, a tiny northeastern state, Congress was losing to a
regional party.
</P>
<P>
   Political analysts said the loss of its strongholds in Delhi and
Rajasthan would be a serious blow to the Bharatiya Janata Party. At
a minimum the voting is likely to make some of the party's partners
nervous about how inflation will affect their prospects, and more
likely to bolt the coalition. In that event, a no-confidence vote
is possible when Parliament convenes next week.
</P>
<P>
   This election was the first since the Bharatiya Janata Party won
power at the national level in May. It is also the first test of
the Congress Party's popularity since Sonia Gandhi, the
Italian-born widow of the assassinated former prime minister, Rajiv
Gandhi, became president of the party.
</P>
<P>
   For weeks Bharatiya Janata candidates, and their star
campaigner, Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee, tried to change
the prime topic of political conversation from the price of onions,
which has skyrocketed. Vajpayee often bragged about the nuclear
tests in May that made India an atomic power. But most voters did
not seem to care much. He also attacked what he described as the
long history of misrule and corruption in the Congress Party. But
voters had more immediate everyday concerns.
</P>
<P>
   In the closing days of the campaign the Hindu nationalists tried
to meet the issue of inflation head on. ``We know you paid a price
for onions for some days,'' their newspaper advertisements stated
two days before the vote. ``But the price you will pay for a
corrupt government is far higher.''
</P>
<P>
   At rallies the candidate for chief minister in Delhi, Shushma
Swaraj, reminded voters that she had sought to bring down prices
with emergency airlifts of onions from the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   But Wednesday night in an interview on television and with
defeat apparently closing in, she faulted the Congress Party for
the tone of the campaign. ``This was a Congress ploy to make this
whole election about the price of onions, ignoring all other
relevant issues,'' Ms. Swaraj said.
</P>
<P>
   The Hindu nationalists won the leadership of an 18-party
coalition this year with a promise to deliver effective government.
They have paid heavily for the perception that basic water and
electrical services have deteriorated, even as vegetable prices
have gone through the roof.
</P>
<P>
   Most voters interviewed as they emerged from the polling booths
said ``price rise'' when asked to name the most important issue.
</P>
<P>
   Triloki Chand, 23, an auto rickshaw driver, went to the polls
with his wife, Lila Wati, 21, and their 3-year-old. ``Last time we
voted for the BJP,'' Chand said, ``and prices rose too high. I
thought, `Let's try the other party.'''
</P>
<P>
   But his wife decided to stick with the Bharatiya Janata Party,
voicing the common theme that politicians are not to be trusted.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the parties are filling their own pockets, not thinking of
the people'' Mrs. Wati said. ``It doesn't matter whether the BJP or
Congress is in power.''

LEWINSKY AUTHOR CATCHES HEAT FOR BOOK ON KENYA'S PRESIDENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By IAN FISHER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NAIROBI, Kenya _ The man hired to write Monica Lewinsky's side
of the presidential scandal has become famous here in the last few
weeks, maybe even more famous than she is. And from what Kenyans
have seen, this much is clear: If she is looking for a sympathetic
ear, she probably picked the right man.
</P>
<P>
   Sandwiched between his account of the crumbling marriage of
Diana, the Princess of Wales, and the Lewinsky book, British
journalist Andrew Morton spent three years writing about another
public figure: Daniel Toroitich arap Moi, the president of Kenya
since 1978.
</P>
<P>
   The book about Moi, a mysterious figure to many people here, was
published this month. In the first few days it sold some 7,000
copies here, faster than any book before, as Kenyans rushed to read
one of the only in-depth works about their president.
</P>
<P>
   But sales are slacking off, and some Kenyans are growing angry
at what they say is Morton's relentlessly sunny story, from Moi's
boyhood in the rural Rift Valley to his rise to power to the
still-unsolved murder in 1991 of one of his top aides.
</P>
<P>
   The biography is so positive and apologetic that many people in
Kenya are confused: either Morton was paid to write the book, which
his publishers deny, or he was writing about some other Moi.
</P>
<P>
   ``Perhaps because serving his nation is now second nature, he
rarely, if ever thinks of himself before his country,'' reads a
typical sentence in the 305-page book, ``Moi: The Making of an
African Statesman,'' published by Michael O'Mara Books, the same
company that is putting out the Lewinsky book.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an odd book,'' said John Githongo, a political analyst
and columnist for The East African, a weekly newspaper that has
been running sections of the book this month, and selling a lot
more papers because of it. ``The character that is created is so
different from the one most Kenyans believe they know.
</P>
<P>
   ``For Monica Lewinsky, I think it's quite healthy,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his two decades in office, many Kenyans say their
president remains a cipher. Critics contend he is an inarticulate
throwback: one of the last African ``Big Men'' who has ruled by
opposing multiparty democracy, encouraging ethnic divisiveness and,
at a minimum, sitting back as corruption eroded the economy.
</P>
<P>
   There is a more charitable view, which Morton embraces on every
page: That for all his faults, Moi has been a friend to the West
who has kept Kenya largely peaceful as neighboring countries
crumbled into conflict. Many people believe education has improved,
and Kenyans, and their vibrant press, can mostly say what they
please, despite regular exceptions.
</P>
<P>
   As his rule nears an end _ Moi, 74, must step down in 2002 _ he
is reportedly worried about embedding the latter view into history.
</P>
<P>
   Along came Morton, who had earned millions of dollars on his
books about the British royalty, notably, ``Diana: Her True
Story,'' written in 1992 with the covert cooperation of the
princess.
</P>
<P>
   There has been much speculation, here and in Britain, about
exactly why Morton decided to take on the project and why Moi, who
has granted few interviews in his life, cooperated. A person close
to both the Moi government and Morton said the president was
concerned about his legacy and felt Morton would be sympathetic.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a feeling at State House that the president doesn't
get a fair wind,'' the person said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite speculation in the press here about exactly how much
Morton was paid for the book, the person denied that any money
changed hands. ``He looked me straight in the eye and told me in
absolutely no way was he paid by State House,'' the person said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the book's tone has done little to dampen suspicions.
``One cannot help hoping that Morton was well paid for this book,''
read a scathing review in The Times of London, ``since it will do
his reputation nothing but harm.''
</P>
<P>
   Morton, reportedly holed up in Los Angeles with Ms. Lewinsky
working on her book, could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But he has become a celebrity in his own right here, though much
of the attention has not been good. Most contentious has been
Morton's explanation of the murder of Dr. Robert Ouko, the foreign
minister who was seen as a possible rival to Moi. The death has
long hung over Moi's rule, and the killing has been linked to
several people close to the president.
</P>
<P>
   Morton singles out one of them, Hezekiah Oyugi, the security
chief, raising the possibility that Ouko had an affair with one of
Oyugi's three wives.
</P>
<P>
   Oyugi died six years ago, but his family disputes Morton's
account. One of Kenya's most respected jurists, Justice Richard
Otieno Kwach, is threatening to sue Morton over an allegation that
he and two other judges investigating the murder were regularly
entertained at Oyugi's house.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't give any of us the opportunity to rebut the
allegations,'' Kwach said. ``He just swallowed what he was given,
hook, line and sinker.''
</P>
<P>
   Kwach fumed in an interview, but then broke out into unjudicial
laughter when the subject of Monica Lewinsky's book arose.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't surprised,'' he said. ``I don't think he will be
engaged in anything better.''
</P>
<P>
   A sampling of Kenyans in Nairobi said that the book was worth
reading no matter what, simply, they said, because they know so
little about Moi's life. What they thought of the book depended
largely on what they thought of the man.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone wants to know the personal life of the president _
about why he is such a great president and what his secret is being
so powerful, great and energetic,'' said Jitesh R. Upadhyay, 34, a
bookstore owner.
</P>
<P>
   But few were so upbeat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to know how he has survived all these political
upheavals,'' said George Muturia, 26, an anthropology student who
had just bought the book. ``I'm not very optimistic. But I'm hoping
to get some clues.''

CAMBODIAN PARLIAMENT CONVENES, AMITY MASKING RIVALRIES 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By SETH MYDANS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia _ After four months of infighting, bullying
and bloodshed, Cambodia finally got its new National Assembly on
Wednesday, a smiling, bowing alliance of men who despise _ and in
some cases have tried to kill _ each other.
</P>
<P>
   It looked the part, all red carpets and roll-calls, gently
tapping gavels and statesmanlike remarks from deputies in
double-breasted suits.
</P>
<P>
   But the red-carpeted institutions of government are not the real
arenas of Cambodia's politics, where bitter rivalries seem to go on
forever and nobody truly concedes defeat. Many foreign analysts,
their hope for democracy wearing thin, said they feared that
Wednesday's show of amity would be fleeting.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, the new government _ forced together long after
the July 26 election by the moral suasion of King Norodom Sihanouk
_ looks unsettlingly like the last one, which broke apart in a
violent coup 16 months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Once again it is a coalition of battlefield enemies from the
1980s: the former communists of Hun Sen and the royalists of Prince
Norodom Ranariddh, the king's son. Once again the two parties share
the key ministries of defense and interior and split the rest
between them.
</P>
<P>
   But there is a key difference in the new arrangement that could
make it more stable: only one man is in charge this time, Prime
Minister Hun Sen, whose party won the most seats in July.
</P>
<P>
   Prince Ranariddh, whose party is the junior member of the
coalition, has been relegated to speaker of the 120-seat National
Assembly, where the clash of ambitions will be less destabilizing
than when he shared the premiership with Hun Sen, who ousted him in
the last coup.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Cambodia has seen two major events in recent months
that open a new political chapter and offer the possibility of
substantive work by the government, if it chooses to act.
</P>
<P>
   One is the collapse of the Khmer Rouge guerrillas, after more
than 30 years of fighting and mass killings. Their fading as a
serious fighting force removes an armed threat to stability, and
closes an arena of competition between the major parties.
</P>
<P>
   The communist Khmer Rouge, responsible for the deaths of more
than a million people when they held power from 1975 to 1979, have
disintegrated through defections over the past two years. Their
founder, Pol Pot, died in the jungle in April.
</P>
<P>
   The second change is the success of Hun Sen's coup in July 1997,
which routed the prince's royalist troops and crippled his
political party.
</P>
<P>
   ``It dismantled their security apparatus, dismantled their media
outlets, helped exacerbate or even create fissures within the
party, put the party at a significant disadvantage in the 1998
election and contributed immeasurably to the climate of impunity
and political repression,'' a Western diplomat said of the coup.
</P>
<P>
   The country is thus governed now by one dominant and feared
political and military power, recognized by the international
community, which will be more difficult to challenge.
</P>
<P>
   The formation of an elected government _ despite the fraud and
intimidation that marked the election _ means that Cambodia is
likely to regain its disputed U.N. seat, win eventual acceptance
into the Association of South East Asian Nations and see a
resumption of crucial foreign aid, which was suspended after the
coup.
</P>
<P>
   It brings to Hun Sen the legitimacy he has sought since he was
installed as prime minister in 1985 by an occupying Vietnamese army
and since he had to elbow his way into shared leadership with
Prince Ranariddh in 1993 after losing an election sponsored by the
United Nations.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In the parliament Wednesday, Hun Sen was wreathed in smiles as
he chatted with Prince Ranariddh and surveyed the balloting that
elected the prince speaker, as agreed on earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dominance plus legitimacy in the eyes of the international
community _ it's a position they've never been in before,'' a
foreign diplomat said of Hun Sen's party, the Cambodian People's
Party. ``In Cambodia now there are no competing ideologies, no
competing armed forces and no outside interference. This obviously
increases the chances for stability. And stability was one of the
fundamentals of the international involvement in the Cambodian
elections.''
</P>
<P>
   The other fundamental was the fostering of democracy in
Cambodia, and it is less clear that progress has been made in this
direction.
</P>
<P>
   The election itself, though marked by an outpouring of
enthusiast voters, was badly flawed by the muscle and manipulation
of Hun Sen's party. Its outcome was the result of post-election
struggles as much as of the voting itself.
</P>
<P>
   As a lesson in democracy, its message to Cambodians may have
been that real power does not yet come from the ballot box but from
feudal chieftains.
</P>
<P>
   As if to drive home this lesson, soldiers armed with automatic
weapons prevented supporters from greeting Sam Rainsy, the nation's
most prominent dissident, when he returned from abroad Tuesday to
take up his new seat in the Assembly. Soldiers on motorcycles with
clubs and electric batons whacked at several dozen supporters _
also on motorcycles _ who tried to accompany Sam Rainsy's car from
the airport.
</P>
<P>
   It is not yet clear that the people who have won power will use
it to address the real issues of poverty, economic development,
education and health care _ which are among the worst in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Hun Sen's party has control of what are described as the
``money-making ministries'' _ a reference to their potential for
corruption _ including finance, commerce, construction, industry
and planning. Prince Ranariddh's party has most of the social
portfolios, like education, health and rural development.
</P>
<P>
   Thus the prince's party can make its mark on society and boost
its future electoral prospects if it succeeds in improving social
welfare. But its prospects are severely limited: it will depend
almost entirely on funds from Hun Sen's financial ministries.
</P>
<P>
   government in Cambodia has little history of seriously
addressing issues of national welfare. Government positions are
seen primarily as good business opportunities, and much of the
foreign aid is siphoned off in corruption.
</P>
<P>
   The political agreement that produced Wednesday's coalition
includes the formation of several new ministries and an entire new
branch of government _ a 60-member Senate with only vague duties;
both are understood to be bargaining chips to sweeten the
arrangement.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are creating more ministries to make everybody happy,''
said Son Chhay, one of 15 opposition members of parliament who
represent the party of Sam Rainsy. ``They are rubbish ministries.
We see once again that this power-sharing group is only interested
in power and money. They will not solve social problems. All the
problems we see now, all the corruption, will not cease.''

U.S. EFFORT TO REINTRODUCE ENDANGERED WOLF SPECIES IS SET BACK 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ariz., N.M., Colo., Idaho)   (bl)

<P>
   DENVER _ The rapid beeping of a radio collar on the yearling
male wolf a few weeks ago signaled the end of Mexican gray wolves
in the wild _ for now, at least.
</P>
<P>
   The transmission from the collar indicated that the wolf had
stopped moving, and trackers found it dead several days later near
the White Mountain Apache Indian Reservation in Arizona. It was the
fifth rare Mexican gray wolf found dead, apparently from a gunshot,
since 11 of the animals were released into the wild in a recovery
program last spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no Mexican wolves free in the wild today,'' said Tom
Bauer, assistant regional director of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife's
Southwest Office in Albuquerque, N.M.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 11 wolves released in this inaugural year of the recovery
program, five have been killed, one is missing and presumed dead,
and five have been returned to captivity for breeding in
acclimation pens near Alpine, Ariz. One pup born in the wild is
missing and presumed dead since his mother was shot in August. One
shooting in April was accounted for when a camper said he mistook
the wolf for a coyote that was endangering his family. Necropsy
reports are expected to determine the cause of death of the other
animals.
</P>
<P>
   Since the latest killing was reported, there has been talk of a
conspiracy to eliminate the wolves.
</P>
<P>
   But Nancy Kaufman, regional director of the wildlife office,
said, ``We really don't have, despite what people want to think,
evidence of a conspiracy to kill the wolves. These killings have
sabotaged the program, they have set the program back
substantially. However, we are going forward with the program, and
reviewing our techniques and adding law enforcement.''
</P>
<P>
   The Albuquerque Journal reported that a wildlife activist had
met with an Arizona prisoner who said he had been offered $35,000
by a New Mexico rancher to kill all wolves reintroduced into the
wild. Wildlife activists say it has not been uncommon in the
Southwest for ranchers to offer a bounty for predators such as
mountain lions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know any rancher that's got the time or the money to
do this if somebody was that misguided,'' said Caren Cowan,
executive secretary of the New Mexico Cattle Growers Association.
``A radical environmental group accused livestock owners of getting
a fund for a bounty to do this, and well, it's laughable. We in no
way condone the needless and senseless shooting of animals for any
reason, and no, we don't know who's doing this.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Cowan said her organization is one a handful that has
pursued legal avenues to stop the reintroduction of the wolves, and
admitted the wolves had not been as problematic as anticipated.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not the big, bad wolf the ranchers make them out to
be,'' said Shane Jimerfield, assistant director of the Southwest
Center for Biological Diversity in Tucson, Ariz. ``The wolves have
exceeded all expectations of recovery, the only problem they are
having is with humans, not the natural environment.''
</P>
<P>
   Jimerfield said a reward of $35,000 has been offered by wildlife
organizations and the government for information leading to the
arrest of whoever is killing the wolves.
</P>
<P>
   Because the Mexican gray wolf, or ``lobo,'' as it is regionally
known, is an endangered species, the punishment for killing one is
a $100,000 fine and up to six months in prison. Ranchers brought
the animals to extinction around the end of the 18th century and
beginning of the 19th century. In the past decade, two sub-species
of gray wolf have been reintroduced in Yellowstone National Park
and wilderness areas of Idaho.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Sinapu, a group in Boulder, Colo., that supports reintroducing
wolves into the wild, filed a notice of intent Tuesday to sue
Colorado Gov. Roy Romer and his successor, state Treasurer Bill
Owens, over a longstanding statewide bounty of $2 on gray wolves
that has never been rescinded in spite of the animal's federal
status as endangered.
</P>
<P>
   ``The notice letter underscores the fact that Colorado's bounty
presents a political impediment to wolf restoration in the
region,'' said Rob Edwards, the group's program director.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt went to the remote
Gila National Forest on the border of New Mexico and Arizona to
show support for the recovery program.
</P>
<P>
   In a written statement, Babbitt said, ``We are committed to the
recovery of the Mexican wolf and the goals of the Endangered
Species Act.''

A HOLIDAY GUIDE FOR LIVING A LIE

   PHOENIX - I'd like to pause, now, at the very beginning of the
season in which we celebrate ``peace on earth and goodwill toward
men,'' to let each and every one of you know, from the bottom of my
heart, that Debi Avila of Phoenix is an undeniable, confirmable
liar.
</P>
<P>
   For which I personally thank God.
</P>
<P>
   There are many valuable lessons we learn during the Christmas
holidays. Lessons about kindness and virtue, generosity and
benevolence, charity and integrity.
</P>
<P>
   Most important of all, at least to me, is how the season teaches
us that if, by some miracle, our world were filled with nothing but
square-dealing, straight-shooting, completely honest individuals,
there would be no need for newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   That's why I'm telling you, now, about Debi Avila.
</P>
<P>
   The liar.
</P>
<P>
   Late last summer I wrote an article that began, ``The message
was recorded at 8:22 a.m. Tuesday, Aug. 4. The caller, a woman,
spoke for 30 seconds.''
</P>
<P>
   The heart of her message was: ``Mr. Montini, my name is Debi.
I'm . . . I'm dying of liver cancer, and I just I wanted to tell
you thank you very much for your articles. Now that I have so
little time, I'm thanking all the people that have done something
special for me in my life. . .''
</P>
<P>
   I'm gullible.
</P>
<P>
   I bought into this.
</P>
<P>
   I produced a sloppy-wet-kisses kind of column about how it
wasn't Debi who should thank someone like me for doing his job, but
me who should thank Debi for reminding me about what's important
and blah blah blah.
</P>
<P>
   After that story appeared, several of Debi's friends recognized
her and called my office. I was able to reach her not long
afterward.
</P>
<P>
   She told me that more than a year ago she was diagnosed with
cancer.
</P>
<P>
   In the early stages, it cost her an eye.
</P>
<P>
   Her friend, Laurie Ramirez, remembers those days. ``A lot of us
were scared to death for her,'' she said. ``But Debi, she just goes
on. She actually started collecting funny `eye ball' stuff. To make
us laugh. That's her personality. She's incredible.''
</P>
<P>
   When the cancer spread to Debi's liver, she was told she
wouldn't last six months, and to prepare for death.
</P>
<P>
   She ``retired'' from her job at a local courthouse, and began a
series of experimental chemotherapy treatments.
</P>
<P>
   She ain't dead yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Laurie says it's because I'm ornery,'' Debi told me Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   She finished her latest round of chemo early in November, and
will find out more about her condition in December.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, she's making plans for the holidays, enjoying
her family, which includes a 4-year-old granddaughter, and planning
a vacation trip with friends for February.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are things I never expected to do in my life,'' she
said. ``One of them was organizing my own funeral. But I've done
that and, to be honest, I found it liberating. After the initial
shock of hearing you have cancer, and the mourning you go through,
it was like, `Hey, it can't get any worse.' Once you accept it, it
almost sets you free.''
</P>
<P>
   She's done many of the things that most of us say we'd like to
do, but never get around to doing.
</P>
<P>
   One of them was thanking people for the little things.
</P>
<P>
   She's contacted everyone from her dog's veterinarian to Carol
Burnett (who wrote Debi a nice note in response).
</P>
<P>
   ``The two weeks after chemo are difficult,'' she says. ``But the
three weeks after that are great. I always wanted to retire young.
Now, I am. Also, before I was always worried about my weight. Now I
say, hey, I'm going to die fat. And happy. I have wonderful
friends. A great family. I'm going to enjoy every minute, no matter
how long that is, right up to the end.''
</P>
<P>
   She's come a long way since leaving that misleading message on
my answering machine in August. She's even willing, now, to finally
admit the truth.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, she has cancer.
</P>
<P>
   But she's not dying. She's living. &QL;

SONDHEIM'S `FOLLIES': THE UNCUT VERSION 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, Nov. 29) 
(bl) 
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a gorgeous, eerie moment from the new two-CD recording of
Stephen Sondheim's score for ``Follies,'' an ancient star named
Heidi Schiller (Carol Skarimbas) appears like the Ghost of Operetta
Past at the emotionally fraught reunion of a group of long-retired
Broadway showgirls. Lifting a ravaged voice that bears traces of
the ethereal ingenue she used to be, Heidi sings ``One More Kiss,''
a soaring waltz in the style of Sigmund Romberg that is so marzipan
sweet it almost makes your teeth hurt.
</P>
<P>
   As Heidi gets lost in the song, her younger self (Ingrid
Ladendorf) appears on the stage, and the two join voices to express
sentiments you would never hear in an actual Romberg love song:
``Dreams are a sweet mistake/ All dreamers must awake.'' The words
``Never look back'' send up a ripple of anxiety before the song
makes its final pivot around a quintessentially dark Sondheimian
reminder: ``All things beautiful must die.''
</P>
<P>
   The tug of war between the tune's spiraling blissfulness and the
lyric's denial of happily-ever-after is what ``Follies'' is all
about. It's also Sondheim at his most fiendishly brilliant,
lovingly parodying the past while simultaneously rebutting its
head-in-the-sand homilies.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the Ziegfeld Follies (renamed in the musical after a
fictional producer named Weismann), other follies the show
relentlessly exposes are the folly of trying to live in a
rose-colored past, the folly of fantasizing a rose-colored future
and (as always in Sondheim) the folly of trying to deny death. The
entire show, like Shakespeare's ``Midsummer Night's Dream,'' is a
visionary flash of recognition that dashes its characters' romantic
fantasies at the very moment they have been conjured.
</P>
<P>
   The story concentrates on Phyllis (Dee Hoty) and Sally (Donna
McKechnie), two unhappily married Weismann girls and their
husbands, Ben (Laurence Guittard) and Buddy (Tony Roberts), as the
couples confront their pasts in a theater that's about to be torn
down. The climactic sequence is a nightmare version of a
Ziegfeld-style extravaganza in which the characters' domestic
crises become grotesquely jolly production numbers. These surreal
star turns do more than just mock their self-deception. They
brutally address the inability of the oldtime Broadway musical
itself to deal with reality.
</P>
<P>
   Sondheim's master stroke is in demonstrating through musical
pastiche how vintage Broadway styles can be retooled to express the
bitterest of psychological truths.
</P>
<P>
   All of this is forcefully dramatized on the new ``Follies: The
Complete Recording'' (TVT Soundtrax 1030), which features the cast
of the recent, critically acclaimed production at Paper Mill
Playhouse in Millburn, N.J. Vocally and dramatically, the new
recording may not be definitive, but by including every scrap of
music written for the show, it is complete in a way no other
``Follies'' album has been. An original cast album on Capitol has
the most dramatically focused performances but omits some of the
music. The sensational 1986 ``Follies in Concert'' recording of a
Lincoln Center concert production (on RCA) generates the most
theatrical excitement with its incandescent solos by Barbara Cook,
Elaine Stritch and others. The cast album of the show's 1987 London
revival introduces a new song, a Cole Porter parody, ``Ah, But
Underneath'' that replaced the Kurt Weill parody ``The Story of
Lucy and Jessie.''
</P>
<P>
   The new ``Follies'' includes an appendix of eight numbers that
were cut from the show during various stages of its life along with
some instrumental music (all beautifully orchestrated by Sondheim's
master collaborator, Jonathan Tunick, who also conducts). And in
the liner notes, Sondheim himself describes the original purpose
and placement of each of the dropped numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Among the cut songs, the one most central to the score (and
still prominently featured in the overture) is another waltz, ``All
Things Bright and Beautiful,'' which the composer explains was the
prelude to a scene in which the former show girls actually put on a
performance for their husbands and escorts. That scene, which was
dropped, later evolved into the Walpurgis Night that concludes
``Follies.'' In the earlier version, Ben offers a bunch of
artificial flowers to Sally, the woman he wishes he had married,
and the two promise each other ``everything forever.'' Musically,
the song is a grand Ravel-influenced waltz that anticipates the
sound and style of Sondheim's ``A Little Night Music.''
</P>
<P>
   Two other songs stand out. ``Can That Boy Fox-Trot,'' written
for Carlotta (Ann Miller), the hard-bitten show business veteran
who sings ``I'm Still Here,'' matches in hilariously smutty
double-entendres anything Cole Porter wrote. The youthful love-bird
fantasy ``Who Could Be Blue?''/``Little White House,'' stands up
beautifully beside such prototypes as Rodgers and Hart's ``Blue
Room''
</P>
<P>
   As for the show's already familiar songs, the new recording
offers performances that are most notable for their dramatic
directness. Ms. Hoty's Phyllis smothers a volcanic rage under a
chic exterior and finds a perfect mixture of chilly hauteur and
wistful anger in her signature song, ``Could I Leave You?'' When
Guittard's Ben isn't being pompously grandiose (in ``The Road You
Didn't Take''), he blusters about in a state of spluttering
nostalgia. Roberts makes Buddy (in ``The Right Girl'') a harried
angst-ridden sad sack.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. McKechnie brings Sally's self-deluded romanticism down to
earth in her two big numbers, ``In Buddy's Eyes'' and ``Losing My
Mind,'' undercutting both songs' melodic elegance to express her
character's neurotic hysteria. Ann Miller, in charge of ``I'm Still
Here,'' the show's most famous song, overlooks its undertone of
savage bitterness and treats it as the friendly greeting of a
gung-ho party girl. In the same upbeat spirit, Kaye Ballard makes
Hattie (``Broadway Baby'') a warm-hearted old hoofer. Together,
these performances make for a ``Follies'' that feels very real.
What has been sacrificed is a certain grandeur.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-seven years have passed since ``Follies'' first opened on
Broadway, yet the show remains so incredibly fresh it seems almost
age-proof. In hindsight, the jolt it brought to Broadway is the
same sort of reality therapy Bob Dylan brought to folk music
several years earlier. Just as Dylan insisted that folk be broader
in its subject matter than songs of solidarity sung smugly around a
campfire, Sondheim insisted that the Broadway musical could (and
should) face reality: Boy meets girl; boy loses girl; boy gets girl
back and they live unhappily ever after. Or until they die.
Broadway hasn't been the same since.

 &HT;    Women's GT circuit hits road courses next season
 &HT;    By Kent Mitchell
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Don Panoz's American Le Mans Series involves a lot
more than racing sports cars for 10 hours.
</P>
<P>
   The latest addition is the Women's Global GT Series. The series,
featuring female drivers driving the Panoz GT-RA, starts on the
nation's road courses in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Indianapolis 500 veteran and renowned road racer Lyn St. James
has been named executive director of the series, which will feature
women drivers in equally prepared sports cars.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need a platform to highlight women as drivers,'' said St.
James.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an opportunity to bring women to the forefront on a
regular basis in a credible, viable series.''
</P>
<P>
   The series champion will have the opportunity to drive in a GT
series in the 2000 campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The Le Mans Series also added another venue, Sears Point Raceway
near Sonoma, Calif., for the July 23-25 weekend.
</P>
<P>
   One thing missing in the Le Mans series, and sports car racing
in general, will be the GT1 cars. They have been ruled out
altogether in the 24 Hours of Daytona sanctioned by the United
States Road Racing Championship. In the American Le Mans Series and
at the 24 Hours of Le Mans, GT1s such as the Panoz cars will be
included in the LMP1 _ Le Mans prototype _ category, along with
open-cockpit cars.
</P>
<P>
   GT2 will replace GT1 as the leading sports car class, and GT3s
will continue racing.
</P>
<P>
   Indy Racing League
</P>
<P>
   Pep Boys Indy Racing League champion Kenny Brack and car owner
A.J. Foyt were the biggest winners Saturday night at the league's
annual awards banquet, sharing the evening's biggest award, the Pep
Boys Million, a $1 million bonus for winning the season
championship. Brack didn't win the IRL trifecta _ he got Charlotte
and Atlanta but missed Las Vegas _ so he didn't get to share the $1
million prize with a fan, but did anyone win anything? You bet.
Brack can thank former B-52 pilot Ronald Ace of Baltimore for the
$50,000 each won after Ace's name was drawn Nov. 21. . . . Fans
will have a chance for some live Internet chat with John Paul Jr.,
(www.kecocoatings.com), 4-6 p.m. Dec. 3 and noon-2 p.m. and 4-6
p.m. Dec. 4.
</P>
<P>
   Drag Racing
</P>
<P>
   Warren Johnson of Duluth, Ga., received applause, accolades, and
a $125,000 bonus check at the NHRA Winston Championship Awards
Ceremony at the Cerritos Center for the Performing Arts in
Cerritos, Calif., on November 17. After runner-up finishes in 1996
and 1997, Johnson was crowned the Pro Stock champion for the fourth
time in the last seven seasons. The Johnsons, Warren and son Kurt
of Lawrenceville, were the only Pro Stock drivers to qualify at
every event in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   CART
</P>
<P>
   Championship Auto Racing Teams has announced its aerodynamic
regulations for the 1999 FedEx Championship Series season. The
short-track package is the same as the aerodynamic package formerly
used at superspeedway events, before the introduction of the
Handford Device and tunnel blockers. Ferrous-alloy brake discs are
required, and use of brake scoops is permitted. The minimum
race-car weight of 1,550 pounds for intermediate and short-oval
events remains unchanged.

 &HT;    Tuberville appears Auburn-bound
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ What would Thanksgiving dinner be without a big
helping of coaching speculation? Here's the latest to enjoy with
your turkey and dressing:
</P>
<P>
   _ Barring some last-minute problem in putting together the deal,
Tommy Tuberville will be named the next coach at Auburn on Friday
or Saturday. He has been telling his coaching buddies around the
country that he's going and has even called some of them for advice
on drawing up his next contract. Tuberville has been trying to keep
quiet in order to get through tonight's game against Mississippi
State on ESPN. He hasn't succeeded. If the deal with Tuberville
breaks down, Bobby Wallace of Temple is the second choice. Wallace,
who went to Mississippi State, will be on the Ole Miss candidate
list if Tuberville leaves.
</P>
<P>
   _ Tulane coach Tommy Bowden has sent word through friends that
he wants the Clemson job. Tulane will come back with a strong offer
and might invoke a $750,000 buyout clause in Bowden's contract,
which kicks in if the school draws up plans for specific facility
improvements. Clemson might have to pay a lot to get Bowden, whose
team plays its last game against Louisiana Tech tonight. Bowden
could interview as early as Friday. But our Big East contacts tell
us not to count out Virginia Tech's Frank Beamer. He's more ``old
school,'' which might be a more comfortable fit for some of the
older fans.
</P>
<P>
   _ Florida defensive coordinator Bobby Stoops was expected to
interview for the Oklahoma job Wednesday and then take his family
to spend Thanksgiving day with Florida coach Steve Spurrier and his
family. Stoops, who also is on Iowa's list, has told friends that
he is considering Oklahoma because he believes the opportunity to
win there will come quicker.
</P>
<P>
   _ Tennessee offensive coordinator David Cutcliffe is the leading
candidate to become the next head coach at Middle Tennessee State.
Cutcliffe was interested in the Kentucky job when the Wildcats
hired Hal Mumme two years ago.Phillip Fulmer
</P>
<P>
   _ Alabama could lose quarterbacks coach Charlie StubbsJeff
HortonNeil Callaway
</P>
<P>
   _ The coach grapevine has Mumme leaving town if Tim CouchBOWL
BUZZ to Miami because they already played there this season against
the Hurricanes.
</P>

   _ How about a scenario to put the Seminoles in the Rose Bowl?

<P>
   Next Sunday, an exhibition of photographs by Brassai, called
``The Eye of Paris,'' will open at the Museum of Fine Arts in
Houston. The result of 15 years of research by Anne Wilkes Tucker,
the museum's curator of photography, it is the first major museum
retrospective of Brassai's work to be held in this country since
one at the Museum of Modern Art in New York in 1968.
</P>
<P>
   There was a time, not so many years ago, when Brassai was one of
the best known and most visible photographers around. He was also
one of the great company of Central European exiles of World Wars I
and II.
</P>
<P>
   In person, he was a twinkling little Transylvanian with a magic
touch in all human relations. Born in 1899 in the ancient Hungarian
city of Brasso, he was a cosmopolitan by birth, almost, in that
Brasso had a large numbers of Hungarian, German and Romanian
inhabitants.
</P>
<P>
   As a young man he took the pseudonym ``Brassai,'' which means
``the man from Brasso.'' After the defeat of the Austro-Hungarian
monarchy in 1918, he eventually made his way to Berlin, where he
fell in with an exiled artistic elite. (Among them were Kandinsky,
Moholy-Nagy and Oskar Kokoschka.)
</P>
<P>
   From Berlin, early in 1924, he got to Paris, which was to be his
home until his death in 1984. There he lived with his wife,
Gilberte Mercedes Boyer, who after his death became a formidable
guardian of his estate.
</P>
<P>
   He endeared himself everywhere, and to almost everyone. He got
the pulse of a certain Paris, and he knew how to present it. When
the two great high-art magazines in Paris were ``Minotaure'' and
``Verve,'' he was welcomed in both of them. But he could also adapt
to more raffish milieus.
</P>
<P>
   To writers _ Americans like Henry Miller and Englishmen like
Lawrence Durrell _ he was the embodiment of an easy-going Paris in
which people could live as they pleased, and for very little.
</P>
<P>
   Before 1939, Brassai had made his name in England primarily with
his contributions to the new-style magazines _ among them
``Lilliput'' and ``Picture Post'' _ which brought a new,
fast-moving and somewhat rakish esthetic to the stately world of
English periodicals. He was also well known, then as now, for his
studies of the more disreputable aspects of Parisian night life.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, and when Carmel Snow presided over
Harper's Bazaar, he was constantly on view. (Ms. Tucker says in her
catalogue that between 1945 and 1960, Brassai appeared in more than
70 features in Harper's Bazaar.)
</P>
<P>
   But he also had an auxiliary activity. Little known at that
time, it may well be his most lasting achievement. He had won the
confidence of many of the major painters and sculptors of the day.
Among them were Pierre Bonnard, Georges Braque, Alberto Giacometti,
Fernand Leger, Henri Matisse, Joan Miro and Pablo Picasso.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did he photograph them, but he overheard what they
talked about. Thanks to him, posterity can know what they looked
like, how they lived, what company they kept and what was said
around them.
</P>
<P>
   A major document in that connection is ``Picasso and Company,''
with text and photographs by Brassai (published in 1966 by
Doubleday). Another, smaller one is ``The Artists of My Life,''
also with text and pictures by Brassai, published by Viking in
1982. The Picasso Museum in Paris is preparing an exhibition of
Brassai's photographs of Picasso and his friends for next year.
</P>
<P>
   At the time Brassai was taking those photographs, major artists
were not celebrities in today's sense. Often their neighbors did
not even know who they were. The ``photo-op'' was unknown.
Brassai's photographs have therefore a certain privacy, not to
mention an authenticity that we immediately recognize.
</P>
<P>
   It so happens that both the name and the work of Brassai have
specific echoes for me. During much of the 1950s, I was way behind
with a long-promised and largely paid-for book about Paris. Those
were easy-going times for delinquent authors, but even so I was
conspicuously late.
</P>
<P>
   When I finally gave my manuscript to my publishers, B.T.
Batsford in London, they did not scold. What they said was: ``We
have good news for you. Brassai is doing the photographs for your
book.''
</P>
<P>
   Batsford's had published the English-language version of
Brassai's ``Paris by Night.'' They had also organized his first
exhibition in London. It was natural that they should bring Brassai
aboard. Nor could I have wished for a better jacket image than his
panoramic photograph of the Place de la Concorde, with its
fountains, its obelisk, its two great town houses designed by
Gabriel, and the church of the Madeleine in the distance. Inside
the book were 42 more photographs by Brassai.
</P>
<P>
   Our joint book (if I may so describe it) did not result from a
collaboration. My work was already done. I did not meet Brassai
until late in the day, when I was deputed to ask him to make two
new photographs for the book.
</P>
<P>
   We met as strangers, therefore. On our way out to lunch I
noticed that when it came to crossing the road _ and especially at
one of those five- or six-way crossings in which Paris specializes
_ he would take me by the waist, as if I were made of blown glass.
After looking in every possible direction, he would tighten his
grip and guide me, step by step.
</P>
<P>
   What I then regarded as almost an excess of courtesy (and one
that was to mark our every outing in Paris), has been made clear to
me by Ms. Tucker in her catalogue. When Brassai's parents took him
to Paris in 1903-04, he was terrified by the still largely
horse-drawn traffic. That he would be trodden underfoot was a
matter of daily anxiety.
</P>
<P>
   The headlong gallop of horse after horse was terrifying to the
small boy. Something of that terror never left him, and for that
reason he would continually watch over his friends when crossing
the road.
</P>
<P>
   This matter apart, our relations were cloudless. Brassai was the
very spirit of mischief and good humor. His images chimed with what
I had written. The jacket, with its blue rinse, has never faded,
and the book sold nicely.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brassai: The Eye of Paris'' will be on view in Houston through
February. It will then travel to the Getty Museum in Los Angeles
and to the National Gallery of Art in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   I cannot resist remarking on the exemplary discretion with which
Gilberte Brassai, the artist's widow, has chosen to be represented
by a portrait of herself that is exactly 2\ inches high by 1\
inches wide.

 &HT;    Fort Valley's daunting task
 &HT;    By Earnest Reese
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Saturday in the quarterfinals of the NCAA Division II
playoffs, Fort Valley will become the latest team to challenge
Carson-Newman's home dominance.
</P>
<P>
   Fort Valley has the best record in school history at 11-1 and
won its first-ever playoff game last week with a 21-14 road victory
over Delta State. Next for the Wildcats will be Carson-Newman,
which defeated West Georgia 30-20 last week for its 33rd win in its
last 34 home games.
</P>
<P>
   Leading the way for Carson-Newman (10-1) is a pair of Fort
Valley natives _ running back Melvin Oates and receiver and return
specialist Jacques Rumph.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very much aware of Carson-Newman's success at home, but
we're going to show up and play,'' Fort Valley coach Kent
Schoolfield said. ``What we've got to do against them is avoid
turnovers, make some big plays and have some fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Fort Valley State's success so far has been predicated on big
plays. Freshmen James Schoolfield and Cleo Stinyard have had key
kickoff and punt returns that have led to a pair of victories.
</P>
<P>
   The Wildcats defense, led by linemen Peppi Zellner (6-foot-6,
260 pounds), Darryl Clark (6-3, 285) and Tramarcus Powell (6-3,
295), has mustered a few game-winning efforts. Fort Valley's first
touchdown this past weekend came as a result of an 84-yard return
of an intercepted pass by junior safety Jamaal Garman.
</P>
<P>
   Junior Will Mitchell, a third of the strong linebacker corps
that includes junior Jarrod Johnson and sophomore Marcus Lee of
Decatur, had two interceptions that killed Delta State drives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those guys have all played outstanding football for us all
year,'' Schoolfield said. ``But in the second half (of the Delta
State game), our quarterback was super. He must've called at least
a dozen plays on his own and made them work.''
</P>
<P>
   With the game tied 7-7 at halftime, junior quarterback Renotto
Solomon directed two second-half scoring drives. He finished
15-for-22 for 231 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Although Solomon and senior running back Bryan Holmes (899 yards
rushing) have had their moments, as have receivers Marcus Clayton
and Schoolfield at wideout spots, Fort Valley has yet to put it all
together in one game, according to its coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still experiencing some of the same problems we did
early _ in terms of consistency,'' Schoolfield said. ``We were bad
in the first of the Delta State game and pretty good in the second
half. But we haven't played team ball in all three phases _
offense, defense and special teams. Going into this game, we're
probably overdue.''

 &HT;    Full circle for Quincy Carter
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS, Ga. _ Quincy Carter attended his only Georgia-Georgia
Tech game at Bobby Dodd Stadium in 1995 as one of the Yellow
Jackets' prized recruits.
</P>
<P>
   Carter, then a senior and Parade All-America quarterback at
Southwest DeKalb, watched two quarters of the Bulldogs' 18-17 win
before leaving to dismantle McEachern High later that day in a
first-round state playoff game.
</P>
<P>
   Who was Carter cheering for? ``Tech,'' he answered with a grin
this week.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Carter will be the center of attention when No. 12
Georgia and No. 17 Georgia Tech meet in Sanford Stadium. After
accepting a scholarship to play for the Yellow Jackets in February
1996, Carter walked away from football for two years. When he
decided to return to the gridiron earlier this year, Carter spurned
his initial promise to Tech, instead choosing, of all places,
arch-rival Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know exactly why he didn't come back to Tech,'' said
Yellow Jackets punter Rodney Williams, a high school teammate of
Carter. ``There are a lot of stories going back and forth. I was
disappointed he reneged on his word. I guess he felt it was a
better place for him to get a chance to play right away. It seems
like it's worked out for him.''
</P>
<P>
   After beating out a handful of candidates to replace Mike Bobo
as the Bulldogs' starting quarterback, Carter has rewritten
Georgia's freshman passing records. In 10 games, Carter has thrown
for 2,259 yards and 12 touchdowns on 160-of-259 passing, leading
the Dogs to an 8-2 record. He also is the Dogs' second-leading
rusher, with 290 yards and four scores.
</P>
<P>
   ``Neither team would be where they are without (the
quarterbacks),'' Georgia coach Jim Donnan said, referring to Carter
and Tech's Joe Hamilton. ``Both have really kind of carried the
offense on their shoulders. As I told Quincy, you can't get caught
up in a stats game against them. You've just got to run the team.
The big thrill in this game is getting the `W.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The big thrill for Georgia Tech would be ending its seven-year
drought against the Bulldogs. Doing it against Carter, who left
them with the feeling of a jilted prom date, would make it that
much sweeter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Me and (Tech linebacker) Donte Booker, we used to see (Carter)
at the mall,'' Yellow Jackets defensive end Jesse Tarplin said.
``He'd talk about how he's coming back, not that we took him
seriously. If he had come back, it would have been a hard challenge
for him to get a (starting) spot. He probably didn't want to come
here because of that. I understand that. It's the point of him
saying he'll come back.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter, a 6-foot-3, 225-pound native of Decatur, says he wasn't
intimidated by the presence of Hamilton, who had entrenched himself
in the starting role after a strong 1997 season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It didn't affect me at all,'' Carter said. ``Just because a
quarterback was there didn't have anything to do with it. If you
really look at it, I think I came to a school with four other
quarterbacks who could be starting at any school right now. That's
four more quarterbacks I had to worry about, rather than just one.
I think I went to the hardest school to start at.
</P>
<P>
   ``Georgia was a great opportunity where they'd just lost their
starting quarterback and they were coming off a 10-2 season. With
me signing with Tech and then going to play baseball, my first
question was, `Is there still some real animosity because I left?'
I still had to worry about all those other things. I don't think
Joe played any kind of role in what school I chose.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Carter points to a soured relationship with Georgia
Tech coach George O'Leary. Former Yellow Jackets defensive
coordinator Brian Baker, who recruited Carter, left Tech six days
after Carter signed to become the San Diego Chargers' defensive
line coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kind of felt (Baker) was going to leave at the time,'' said
Georgia offensive lineman Jonas Jennings, a close friend of Carter,
who also was recruited by Baker. ``Quincy ended up signing with
Tech, but then (Baker) left.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Leary was left in the dark when Carter signed a minor-league
baseball contract with the Chicago Cubs in 1996. Carter's baseball
contract included a clause that prohibited him from playing
football for four years. When Lonnie Cooper, Carter's agent,
negotiated a deal last year that allowed him to play both sports,
Carter informed O'Leary that he was returning to football.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've only spoken to Quincy one time (since he chose
baseball),'' O'Leary said. ``That was when he stopped by my office
to let me know he wanted to get back in football.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Leary says his next communication from Carter came in the form
of a letter, informing him that Carter wanted to be released from
his letter of intent with the Yellow Jackets. Georgia Tech refused
to release Carter, but Carter eventually won an appeal to the NCAA,
which allowed him to enroll at Georgia last spring and begin
playing football this fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't really care,'' O'Leary said. ``I'm very happy with the
character of the kids I have at Georgia Tech. ... You can't harbor
hard feelings for someone you never had. My problem is the national
letter of intent and this interpretation of what a letter of intent
is. What is a letter of intent if it doesn't mean anything?''
</P>
<P>
   The schools' dispute over Carter has added more emotion to one
of South's most heated rivalries.
</P>
<P>
   ``It won't be too much for Quincy,'' Jennings said. ``He's a guy
that can obviously handle the pressure. Tech will try to get after
everyone, but I don't think there's a hit out on him or anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``I actually hope Quincy doesn't get caught up in this,'' he
said. ``Don't get me wrong, I hate Georgia. But the fact is we were
friends before, and I hope we'll be friends afterward. The rivalry
was here before us, and it will be here when we're dead and gone. I
hate the both of them (Georgia and Carter) until after the
season.''

 &HT;    Lack of migration stalls duck opener
 &HT;    By Scott Bernarde and Kent Mitchell
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Other than local wood ducks, opening weekend of
waterfowl season was pretty slow.
</P>
<P>
   Migratory ducks haven't reached Georgia yet, said Kent
Kammermeyuer, a biologist with the Wildlife Resources Division of
the state Department of Natural Resources.
</P>
<P>
   As for the renewal of duck hunting on Lake Lanier, Kammermeyer
said, ``I haven't heard a word about it.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the only shotgun heard on Lake Lanier this weekend
might have been on the committee boat of the Lanier Cup Regatta,
signaling the start and finish of the race.
</P>
<P>
   The regatta, by the way, ended early because of lack of wind.
</P>
<P>
   Accidental lunker
</P>
<P>
   It isn't a state record, but for a couple of grandparents in
their 70s, it was the fish of a lifetime, even if it was an
accident.
</P>
<P>
   Wilma Sapp, 75, and Cecil Sapp, 77, of Baxley were netting
shrimp for bait recently when they caught something a little
larger, a 63-pound black drum. The state record is 86 pounds, 8
ounces.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a lifetime first, and last,'' Mrs. Sapp said. ``I'll
never live long enough to do that again.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Sapp was handling the net when the big fish was caught.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I pulled it, I said, `I have something big.' My husband
said it was probably shells. I said, `No, it's moving.' It took
both of us to get him in. He's not pretty, but he's the biggest
fish I ever caught.''
</P>
<P>
   Champion of champions
</P>
<P>
   Larry Head of Loganville and Mike Lee of Lilburn teamed up to
win the 11th annual Georgia State Championships/Highland Marina
Invitational bass tournament last weekend on West Point Lake. The
two caught two five-fish limits weighing at total of 26.46 pounds
to win the two-day event and the first-place prize of $15,000 in
cash. They fished red clay banks in the middle of the lake with a
variety of lures. Jimmy and Jeanne Millsaps of Canton finished
second with 21.78, earning them $7,500. Allen Brooks of Acworth and
Pat Ratanjantra of Kennesaw were third ($4,000) with 20.42, and
Mike Jones and Glen Miller of LaGrange took fourth ($2,000) with
19.28.The tournament attracted 257 teams from six states, all
qualifiers by finishing in the top five in significant tournaments
held on Georgia lakes in the past year.
</P>
<P>
   A different spin
</P>
<P>
   What lifted Gary Dobyns to the second-round lead in the
Bassmaster California Invitational on Lake Shasta in Redding,
Calif., last weekend wasn't necessarily the reason he won the
tournament. Yes, his Day 2 catch of 14 pounds, 8 ounces provided
more than half of his winning total of 27-2, but it was his switch
to plastic worms on the final day that gave him enough in windy and
rainy conditions to edge Rob Vander Kooi by a mere 15 ounces. The
first two days, Dobyns had caught all of his fish, including a
largemouth that weighed 7-9, on a double-bladed (No. 4 nickel
Colorado/No. 5 gold willow) spinnerbait. He changed to plastics in
Day 3 after the spinnerbaits failed early, even though the Yuba
City, Calif., pro thought the conditions were right for the bait to
catch fish near the bank. ``It is really hard for a guy hung up
throwing reaction baits to go back to throwing a worm,'' he said.
``It just kills me to slow down and throw a worm. I absolutely hate
it. But you just have to make sure you have the five because you
never know what's going to happen.

FOOD GROUP WARNS OF GERM-CONTAMINATED TURKEYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a year of finger-pointing, accusations and
acrimony inside the Beltway, yet another target has emerged in the
capital: the traditional Thanksgiving feast.
</P>
<P>
   A private food safety group, which previously condemned Chinese
food as high in fat and movie popcorn as low in nutritional value,
is warning that turkeys may bring ``unwelcome guests'' _
campylobacter and salmonella, bacteria commonly found in poultry _
to the table.
</P>
<P>
   Caroline Smith DeWaal, director of food safety for the group,
the Center for Science in the Public Interest, noted that a study
conducted by the Agriculture Department in 1996 and 1997 on more
than 1,200 young turkeys showed that 90 percent were contaminated
with campylobacter and 18 percent carried salmonella.
</P>
<P>
   The group was founded in 1971 with a focus on nutrition and food
safety. The organization publishes the Nutrition Action
Healthletter and receives the majority of its support from its 1
million subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   Other groups are using the holiday to emphasize what government
and industry are doing to ensure safety and what cooks can do to
reduce risks. In January, after the Agriculture Department study
was completed, a new system of meat inspection was put into effect
in the nation's largest slaughter and packing plants. The new
techniques require microbiological testing to detect invisible
pathogens, which are the major cause of foodborne illness.
</P>
<P>
   The full impact of the new system will not be felt until
January, when it goes into effect in 3,000 small and medium-size
plants.
</P>
<P>
   Sherrie Rosenblatt, a spokeswoman for the National Turkey
Federation in Washington, an industry association that represents
95 percent of the nation's turkey producers, said her members
worked hard to ensure safe meals.
</P>

   ``The turkey industry has been aggressive in removing naturally
occurring pathogens,'' Ms. Rosenblatt said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Elizabeth Whelan of the American Council on Science and
Health, a consumer advocacy group in New York City, said, ``It is
unrealistic to call upon the government to police every last
bacteria.''
</P>
<P>
   To remind consumers that all food items contain naturally
occurring chemicals, the council posts a holiday menu each year on
its Web site, which lists the chemicals found in dishes, including
baked potato, pumpkin pie, cranberry sauce and, of course, turkey.
</P>
<P>
   Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman, in a statement Nov. 19,
urged cooks to be careful while preparing food. ``Everyone has a
role to play in ensuring food safety,'' he said. ``The final
critical point for preventing foodborne illness is the kitchen of
every American home.''
</P>
<P>
   The Agriculture Department lists these basic suggestions: Thaw
the turkey in its original wrapper in the refrigerator, allowing 24
hours per 5 pounds of turkey. If using stuffing, stuff the bird
loosely just before placing it in the oven. Wash hands, utensils
and surfaces often with warm, soapy water. Most important, insert
the thermometer in the thigh area, near the breast, but not
touching the bone, making certain that the internal temperature
reads 180 degrees Fahrenheit.

SPRAWLING LAVENDER

 EVERGREENS IN A HURRY

   Sprawling Lavender
</P>
<P>
   Q: While cleaning up my garden this fall, I realized that my
once beautiful four-year-old lavender plants are now beginning to
look sparse and leggy. Any suggestions?
</P>
<P>
   A: Sharpen your pruning shears, and then put it away. You are
way behind on your pruning, but hardy lavender should be pruned in
spring, when the small nodes along the branches begin to swell, but
before actual growth starts, or in summer right after it flowers,
not now.
</P>
<P>
   Pruning back about one-third to one-half the length of the
branches every year encourages branching lower down and keeps
lavender growing upright, avoiding the sprawl that comes from its
tendency to become woody and open up in the middle, after about
three years without pruning. This isn't just a question of
esthetics; sprawl can be dangerous. It leads to leaves touching wet
soil, a great point of entry for any enterprising fungus looking
for some work to do. Disease, of course, weakens a plant, making it
more susceptible to winter damage. A dressing of sand around the
base has been shown to be beneficial when growing lavender because
it warms the soil and keeps water away from the leaves.
</P>
<P>
   Spring is also the time to embrace your lavender, so just before
pruning, run your hands up through the dead leaves, letting them
fall away. You'll get that stick-garden look, but in a few weeks
the flush of new growth will show off the spring in your garden.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Fooling Hyacinth
</P>
<P>
   Q: Can you help me break a cycle of disappointment? I've tried
forcing Dutch hyacinth bulbs for winter bloom, even buying the
special glass vases, but the result is always the same _ tiny
flowers, hidden among the foliage. I give them plenty of bright
light, so why won't they come up where I can really see them?
</P>
<P>
   A: They hide because they haven't gone through a full cycle of
seasons. So give them a short winter, and they'll be ready to act
more as if it's spring. Dutch hyacinths, like many other bulbs,
need a cold period to prepare them for spring bloom. Often catalogs
and nurseries offer ``prepared'' bulbs, which have been given a
controlled temperature treatment. Unfortunately, that sounds as if
the bulbs are ready to bloom. They're not. The preparation reduces
the needed cold, dark period from at least 14 weeks at 40 degrees
to only 10 weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Without that period the flower stalks will fail to elongate and
the flowers, hidden in the foliage and much less spectacular than
they could be, will open from the top of the short stalk downward.
With a proper cool period, the stalk will grow longer and the
flowers will open in the right sequence, from bottom to top. So put
the bulbs in their forcing jars, and put the jars in the back of
your refrigerator for the right amount of time. Give them winter,
and they'll give you spring.
</P>
<P>
   Prepared Dutch hyacinth bulbs are still available from McClure &AMP;
Zimmerman, 108 W. Winnebago, P.O. Box 368, Friesland, Wis. 53935,
(920) 326-4220, free catalog.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Evergreens in a Hurry
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you have any information about the fastest-growing
evergreens?
</P>
<P>
   A: It really depends on your needs. Most requests for
fast-growing evergreens come from people who discover that the new
neighbor collects junk cars. If that's the case, then a fast grower
like white pine may not be a good choice. While it grows as much as
50 feet in 25 years, it eventually loses some lower branches,
letting the glint from those old hubcaps shine through. It is also
sensitive to salt, making it a poor roadside choice if your
community uses salt in winter.
</P>
<P>
   Is your site wet? The tall, slender Atlantic white cedar
(Chamaecyparis thyoides) will do just fine.
</P>
<P>
   Are you making a hedge? Canadian hemlock works well, but woolly
adelgid attacks mean a high-maintenance obligation.
</P>
<P>
   I know you see Eastern arborvitae (Thuja occidentalis)
everywhere, but it does make an effective, quick-growing hedge. A
handsomer version, the Western or great arborvitae (Thuja plicata),
does well from Boston and Cincinnati to Raleigh, N.C., despite the
Western connotation of its common name.
</P>
<P>
   A grouping of three to five tall, pyramidal Japanese cryptomeria
form a screen, not really a hedge, although a single specimen tree
looks better. The feathery Leyland cypress (x Cupressocyparis
leylandii) gives a more columnar screen and grows in coastal areas
from Massachusetts to Florida.
</P>
<P>
   For large, single specimens, Norway spruce (Picea abies) and
Atlas cedar (Cedrus atlantica) grow quickly when young, then slow
down.
</P>
<P>
   Spend a little time looking before you buy. Large evergreens are
a strong presence in the landscape, summer and winter. This is a
great season to go to public arboretums and botanical gardens and
look at mature examples. Do you have the room? Is it as cute at 30
feet, or at 80, as it is in a container?
</P>
<P>

NETANYAHU MAY REAPPOINT LEVY TO CABINET TO BOOST POLITICAL
STRENGTH 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By DEBORAH SONTAG   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is ready to bring
his former foreign minister, David Levy, back into his Cabinet in
an effort to shore up his disintegrating coalition and to fortify
his chances at either re-election or assembling a unity government.
</P>
<P>
   Levy, a political moderate who resigned in January after
denouncing the Netanyahu administration as aimless, said Wednesday
that he would return, though the terms are still in negotiation.
</P>
<P>
   A veteran of Israeli politics, Levy has been offered either the
Finance Ministry or the National Infrastructures Ministry, a place
in the inner circle, a role in the ``final status'' talks with the
Palestinians and a chance to lead future negotiations with Syria.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu and Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon both canceled trips
abroad Wednesday to concentrate on stabilizing the deeply divided
government. Since the prime minister signed a land-for-security
accord with the Palestinians last month, his right-wing coalition
has been in a shambles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always said I wanted to widen the base of the government,''
Netanyahu said Wednesday. ``It should reflect the wide support
which our policy has in the Israeli public.''
</P>
<P>
   Although polls have shown that Israelis broadly endorse the
peace effort, the Cabinet majority that ratified the peace deal was
shaky and the accord passed Parliament only because of opposition
support. Now Netanyahu is marshaling his resources to clear a
serious political hurdle next month _ the always-contentious budget
vote.
</P>
<P>
   It was after the last budget vote that Levy quit, scathing in
his denunciation of a ``government on a flight to nowhere.'' In
addition to criticizing what he saw as a lack of social spending,
Levy said he was disgusted by the stalemate in the peace effort.
</P>
<P>
   Now Levy says he believes the government is ``returning to a
right path.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Today there is a diplomatic process in full swing,'' he said.
``And there is a readiness to make the required adjustments in the
budget regarding social issues.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Political associates say Levy felt politically sidelined and saw
no future for his small party, Gesher. The party broke away from
Likud in 1992 to concentrate on social issues, which the major
parties, focused on the peace effort, had tended to ignore. Born in
Morocco, Levy tried to court Sephardic voters, but they were drawn
instead by Shas, the third-largest party, which wooed them with
free nursery schools, social services and rabbis' blessings.
</P>
<P>
   Levy was said to have felt particularly depressed after the
municipal elections two weeks ago, when his son lost the mayoral
election in the immigrant town where Levy began his political
career.
</P>
<P>
   ``Despair is what is returning Levy to Netanyahu,'' said Nahum
Barnea, a seasoned political observer for the newspaper Yediot
Ahronoth. ``Levy understands that his movement does not have an
electoral future.''
</P>
<P>
   With Levy rejoining the government, Gesher would return to the
coalition, adding four votes to the prime minister's razor-thin
majority in the parliament. It would likely merge back into Likud
as well. The prime minister has reportedly offered to add 500
Gesher representatives to Likud's 2,700-member central committee,
giving Gesher a significant voice in choosing candidates for
parliamentary elections.
</P>
<P>
   But Likud leaders are balking. ``There's no point in preserving
Gesher,'' said Communications Minister Limor Livnat. ``That's not
what Likud exists for.''
</P>
<P>
   Since Netanyahu returned from Washington with a peace agreement,
he has been scrambling to hold his coalition together. Political
experts agree that his government will not survive its term, which
was supposed to last until the end of 2000. But whether there will
be early elections or a unity government formed with the
center-left opposition is a matter of intense debate.
</P>
<P>
   By bringing Levy into his government, Netanyahu is trying to
prevent him from joining a centrist bloc that could draw votes from
him. Netanyahu also seems to be taking a preparatory step toward a
unity government.
</P>
<P>
   Many say Netanyahu needs a unity government not only to survive
but to carry off the thorny ``final status'' talks with the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Finance Minister Yaakov Neeman offered Wednesday to step down so
his ministry could be taken by Levy or another opposition figure.
The Infrastructures Ministry would be vacated by Sharon, who
continued as its head after he took over the Foreign Ministry in
October.
</P>
<P>
   In the last week, Sharon has been arguing publicly for a unity
government, working to fold another small party, Tsomet, into Likud
too. But Wednesday, Labor Party leader Ehud Barak reiterated his
rejection of that idea, calling for early elections instead.

BORDER PATROL TRAINEE SAVES WOMAN TRAPPED INSIDE BURNING APARTMENT 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Attn: Irvine, Calif.) 
(Eds.: Guymon is cq) 
 
By JAMES PINKERTON 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARLINGEN, Texas _ U.S. Border Patrol trainee Richard Guymon
didn't have heroics in mind when he left his new apartment before
dawn Wednesday. In fact, at 4:45 a.m. the rookie was headed to his
car to retrieve the government-issue boots he forgot to polish.
</P>
<P>
   But Guymon smelled smoke coming from the apartment below his,
and ran to investigate.
</P>
<P>
   What he found was a woman overcome with smoke who, because of
prior injuries, was trapped inside her burning apartment. After
pulling her out, he even extinguished the fire with a garden hose.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard a muffled groan for help, and I went to the window
thinking a person was talking out the window, but it was shut,''
said Guymon, 32, a native of Irvine, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   When he reached the apartment door, Guymon was met by thick,
acrid smoke. He yanked open the screen door, and found a woman
slumped against the door. Inside the apartment, he could see the
carpet and a hospital-type bed in flames, the mattress and plastic
cover putting off heavy, choking smoke.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some arms flopped out as soon as I opened the door, so I
pulled her out,'' Guymon said.
</P>
<P>
   After determining his neighbor was breathing and did not require
CPR, Guymon ran to other apartments to get someone to call an
ambulance and the Fire Department. He didn't know any of his
neighbors, since he only moved into the apartment complex two weeks
earlier after reporting to work in Port Isabel, his first duty
station.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took me, it seemed like forever, to get someone up,''
Guymon recalled. ``I just wanted someone to call 911 and get an
ambulance and get a blanket to cover her up, just to get her
comfortable until someone could come.''
</P>
<P>
   Satisfied his neighbor was out of danger and help was on the
way, Guymon picked up a garden hose and began to douse the flames.
He had them under control when Harlingen firefighters arrived.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Elliott, a spokesman for Valley Baptist Hospital, said the
49-year-old woman is in fair condition. She was being held for
observation after receiving treatment for minor burns and smoke
inhalation, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Harlingen fire officials say Guymon's actions probably saved the
woman's life, and prevented the fire from spreading to other
apartments. They are considering him for a commendation.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it wasn't for him, it would have been worse. He did the
right thing,'' said Ramon Gomez, a fire inspector for the
department's fire prevention bureau. ``She might have died. The
smoke is what kills, that's what does most of the damage to people,
not the fire.''
</P>
<P>
   Fire officials determined the fire was started by cigarettes,
Gomez said.
</P>
<P>
   Border Patrol officials were proud of their trainee.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a good thing he did, he saved a life for the
holidays,'' said Mark Butler, the assistant patrol agent in charge
of the Port Isabel station.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're glad to have an agent of his caliber. Although he's new
to this line of work, (he) is able to react in that kind of
situation. That's fabulous.''
</P>
<P>
   Guymon is thankful his neighbor, whom he had never met and still
does not know by name, was able to hang on until he could help her.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was propped up against the door, calling for help, and I
don't know how she endured it ... I could only endure it for two
seconds. It was really a choking-type smoke and you can't
breathe.''
</P>
<P>
   Guymon, homesick for his family in California and not having
time to make friends since moving to South Texas, says helping
someone has made a lonely holiday easier.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really thankful for what I have. Because I found out she's
alone, sick and is incapacitated, and now her apartment is all
messed up.'' Guymon said. ``But if she needs some help, I'm right
upstairs.''
</P>
<P>
   And while Guymon, who is single, will spend Thanksgiving Day
patrolling the banks of the Rio Grande on the 6 a.m. to 2 p.m.
shift, he and other agents will still observe the holiday.
</P>
<P>
   His supervisors say a private citizen who owns property along
the river _ grateful for the stepped-up border control _ has
invited patrol agents to drop by and share a turkey dinner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thanksgiving will not be a loss,'' said supervisor Butler.

FOR THE SOCIALIST LEADER, STRAINS IN THE COALITON 
</HEADLINE>
  (gm) 
 By CRAIG R. WHITNEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ The honeymoon is definitely over for the Socialist prime
minister, Lionel Jospin, who made this plea on French news radio on
Tuesday night: ``No impatience _ let us govern!''
</P>
<P>
   Jospin's popularity is still high, a year and a half after he
won power and shocked his conservative opponents. But after the
glory days of last summer, when Jospin seemed on top of the world,
his leftist coalition of Socialists, Greens and Communists has
begun fraying at the seams.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, Environment Minister Dominique Voynet
criticized Jospin openly for not granting residence permits to tens
of thousands of illegal immigrants who had applied.
</P>
<P>
   ``We legalized 80,000 men and women,'' the prime minister said.
``We did exactly what we said we were going to do.'' The 60,000
others, he added, would be called on to leave France ``in normal
conditions.''
</P>
<P>
   That meant he would not forcibly fly them in chartered planes
back to the impoverished African countries from which most came, as
the government of his conservative predecessor, Alain Juppe, had
done.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some of Jospin's leftist supporters have been grumbling
that it is hard to tell the difference between the two men by their
policies.
</P>
<P>
   Jospin's government also suffered a setback this fall over a
bill it had proposed to provide the legal equivalent of marriage
for same-sex partners.
</P>
<P>
   With the country's Roman Catholic bishops criticizing the bill
as a threat to the institution of the family, conservative
legislators mobilized so much opposition in Parliament that some
Socialist members abandoned the floor during a crucial vote. The
opposition carried the day on Oct. 9 and rejected the bill, leaving
Jospin to complain, ``When you have convictions, you should be
ready to defend them.''
</P>
<P>
   Jospin's Communist supporters in Parliament, meanwhile, are
increasingly restive over far more planned privatization of
state-owned industries like France Telecom and Air France than they
thought they had signed on for when the left came to power.
</P>
<P>
   And even with a Communist minister of transport in charge of the
state railway system, the railroad workers plan to close down the
system on Friday for the second time this week to push the rail
network to hire more workers as it moves to a 35-hour week a year
from now.
</P>
<P>
   Jospin's government mandated a nationwide reduction from 39 to
35 hours a week as its main job-creation measure, but only 160,000
of the more than 3 million unemployed have found jobs since he took
power.
</P>
<P>
   So he seemed eager to stake out his leftist credentials in the
radio appearance. Alluding to the deaths from exposure of nine
homeless people during a cold snap this month, despite a
cradle-to-grave welfare system the conservatives never even tried
to cut back during the years they were in power, Jospin said:
``This society, the way it was run over 10 to 15 years, is a
society where the dominant ideas were those of letting the markets
have free rein, of everybody looking after themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If we have precariousness systematically in the workplace, we
shouldn't be astonished the day precariousness comes to life in the
streets,'' he added, in a jab at French companies that have been
reluctant to hire people for more than a year at a time because
laws make it difficult to lay off permanent employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are a government of the long term,'' said Jospin, who is
said to be planning to run against Jacques Chirac for the
presidency in 2002.

`WRONG ABOUT CLINTON ALL ALONG,' SAM DONALDSON ADMITS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MURPHY  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Celebrity newsman Sam Donaldson has a startling
confession to make:
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got to come absolutely clean . . . I have been wrong
about Bill Clinton all along,'' Donaldson told the Valley
Automobile Dealers Association on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been wrong, wrong, wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Donaldson's mea culpa came in a speech that touched on a debate
raging in newsrooms across the country: Whether the line between
journalists and commentators has become too blurred.
</P>
<P>
   Donaldson, a veteran White House reporter and a fixture on ABC's
influential Sunday morning show ``This Week With Sam Donaldson and
CokieRoberts,'' acknowledged that as an on-air political
commentator, he goofed when it came to predicting Clinton's rise
and fall.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, Donaldson said the then- Arkansas governor had too much
political baggage to be elected president.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, after the GOP swept the congressional elections,
Donaldson said Clinton couldn't be re-elected.
</P>
<P>
   And in January, a few days after the Monica Lewinsky scandal
erupted, Donaldson said on ``This Week'': ``Mr. Clinton, if he's
not telling the truth and the evidence shows that, he will resign,
perhaps this week.''
</P>
<P>
   Donaldson said Wednesday he misread Clinton's tenacity and the
public's attitude about the Lewinsky affair.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been wrong about big things about Bill Clinton, and
clearly I've been wrong because I did not understand the electorate
. . . and I'm a political reporter,'' Donaldson said in an
interview after his noontime speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe the crime of perjury is serious, and I think it
should be punished, but that's my personal opinion.''
</P>
<P>
   The role of reporters-as-commentators has sparked widespread
newsroom hand-wringing about whether journalists, particularly
those in television, are galloping into a twilight in which facts
and opinions become indistinguishable.
</P>
<P>
   Donaldson said the debate is legitimate.
</P>
<P>
   But he also said the news business is changing so fast that the
old rules separating journalists from commentators often don't
apply.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like doing you-know-what against the wind to say, `Well,
we're not going to do this,' '' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, we are not only doing it, but in my estimation,
with the growth of cable channels and the people who populate them,
we are all going to be doing this.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``If I thought it was really beyond the pale, I
obviously would not do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Donaldson is one of the most high-profile newsmen to face
questions about the conflict between those who report the news and
those who make on-air political commentaries.
</P>
<P>
   Yet he is hardly alone. Roberts also dishes out opinions.
</P>
<P>
   Donaldson noted that virtually every Capitol Hill reporter this
year predicted Republicans would pick up House seats in the wake of
the Lewinsky scandal. And all of them missed the boat _ the GOP had
a net loss of five seats in the mid-term election.
</P>
<P>
   ``I acknowledge I'm wrong, but I'm in a sea of faces . . . not
just one bozo who didn't get it,'' Donaldson said.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to Clinton, the newsman said he underestimated the
president's never-give-up approach and the willingness of White
House aides to deny, stonewall and to attack critics.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I'd done the things he's accused of, I would find a hole in
New Mexico, I'd crawl into it, and I'd put a big rock there,
because I wouldn't want you to look at me, because I'd be
ashamed,'' said Donaldson, a New Mexico native.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't have any shame. He knows no shame . . . and I'm not
here to say the president should be ashamed.'' &QL;

ANNIVERSARY GALA: A NIGHT TO CELEBRATE FOR NEW YORK CITY BALLET 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 By ANNA KISSELGOFF   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the end was the beginning, as the New York City Ballet
crowned its 50th-anniversary gala on Tuesday night with an
especially festive look back at its first performance, on Oct. 11,
1948.
</P>
<P>
   There was the same triple bill of George Balanchine's ballets:
``Concerto Barocco,'' ``Orpheus'' and ``Symphony in C.'' But a
half-century later, there was also time for the mother of all
curtain calls. Nearly 250 former dancers of the City Ballet filled
the stage of the New York State Theater to take a mass bow. Those
who had been in the corps, even in 1948, led the way, lining up in
the rear as former soloists and then those who had performed as
principals massed to the front.
</P>
<P>
   Little girls from the School of American Ballet rushed to
present little bouquets to the retired ballerinas. Maria Tallchief,
certainly a charter member, stood next to Suzanne Farrell, who came
to the fore in the 1960s. Arthur Mitchell, now artistic director of
Dance Theater of Harlem, walked in solo and received a big hand.
</P>
<P>
   Mikhail Baryshnikov and Jacques d'Amboise beamed amid the waving
throng, which included present company dancers. Gold confetti
rained down as the orchestra played a loud version of ``Happy
Birthday.''
</P>
<P>
   This event had its ritualized aspect. In his welcoming remarks
from the stage, Peter Martins, the artistic director, once again
asked the audience to drink a toast. Balanchine and Lincoln
Kirstein, the company's founders, had begun the practice with a
vodka toast to Stravinsky at their 1972 Stravinsky Festival, and
the idea was since taken up at various celebrations.
</P>
<P>
   This time, each member of the audience was handed a shot glass
and a miniature bottle of vodka along with a program; all rose
readily to the occasion at the start of the evening for a
bottoms-up tribute to ``Mr. B. and Lincoln,'' as Martins put it.
</P>
<P>
   A few minutes earlier, there was a repeat performance of the
fanfare that Stravinsky wrote on the occasion of City Ballet's move
from its first home at City Center to the State Theater in 1964.
Robert Haley and Raymond Mase were splendid onstage as the
trumpeters.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the familiar, there was nonetheless something fresh and
distinctive: a tribute to Tanaquil Le Clercq. Although her career
was cut short by polio in 1956, she remains in memory as one of the
world's great ballerinas, the epitome of the ideal dancer in the
ballets of both Balanchine and Jerome Robbins.
</P>
<P>
   Because she was Balanchine's last wife, she has been considered
one of his most important muses. Yet as Robbins noted during one of
the film clips and photographs projected on Tuesday, ``Tanny could
do anything.'' She was Robbins' muse, too, as seen in a clip of
``Afternoon of a Faun,'' where drama was inherent in her movement.
A photo of her as Sacred Love in Frederick Ashton's
``Illuminations'' hinted at her mystery, visible also in a photo of
her as the doomed heroine in Balanchine's ``Valse.''
</P>
<P>
   But the essential Le Clercq came through in a film clip of
Balanchine's ``Western Symphony.'' One saw her technique and
clarity, her centered toe work. But as the dance hall girl of the
Western corral of Balanchine's imagination, she strutted on her
long legs with total wit and style. There was never a touch of
vulgarity to her swagger and flounce. She was elegance personified.
Martins presented a bouquet to Ms. Le Clercq at her seat, and the
audience rose for an ovation.
</P>
<P>
   Martins also paid tribute to Robbins, who joined the company as
dancer and choreographer shortly after its founding. ``We already
miss him,'' Martins said of Robbins, who died in July.
</P>
<P>
   As for Balanchine's three ballets, it was clear why they would
become the classics of the future, as Kirstein put it. ``Concerto
Barocco,'' set to Bach's Double Violin Concerto, and ``Symphony in
C,'' named after its Bizet score, are Balanchine's signature
pieces. ``Orpheus,'' set to a commissioned score by Stravinsky, is
not. It is an experimental work of its time (1948), a foray into
lyric theater, almost a miniature opera without words.
</P>
<P>
   ``Concerto Barocco'' (1941) may be Balanchine's greatest ballet.
It can, as in this splendid performance, evoke the spiritual side
of art and stun the eye with its basic purity. The eight women in
the ensemble started on a wonderfully frisky note, a perfect foil
for the two female principals, Yvonne Borree and Jennie Somogyi.
</P>
<P>
   Balanchine initially identifies the two women with the score's
violin soloists (Guillermo Figueroa and Jean Ingraham), but he does
not merely mirror the music's structure. How witty of him to
incorporate the khorovods, or chain dancers, of his Russian
background, although Americans have seen these patterns as daisy
chains. Other motifs bloom throughout the ballet. Symmetry is
established only to be broken. A simple hop on toe in ballet's
fifth position is taken up by the entire ensemble, always moving in
interplay with the principals.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Somogyi, swift in her scurries on toe and grand in her
leaps, contrasts with Ms. Borree, elegant and wonderfully taut in
her adagio with Nikolaj Hubbe. Unlike so many in these roles, they
brought out the differences between the ballerinas.
</P>
<P>
   Hugo Fiorato kept up a brisk tempo and gave the right serenity
to ``Orpheus,'' which included debuts by Kyra Nichols as Eurydice,
Jock Soto as the Dark Angel and Monique Meunier as the leader of
the Bacchantes, who tear Orpheus apart after he loses Eurydice and
she returns to the dead.
</P>
<P>
   Nilas Martins has come a long way since he made his debut in the
title role in 1993; his childlike fervor has been replaced by a
mature and effective image of despair. To match him with Soto, as
his guide to the underworld (actually Hermes, the inventor of the
lyre) is merely to match two similar physical types. At this point,
Martins still rounds out the movement too much and Soto lacks
tension. Whether he is seen as Orpheus' alter ego, his angel or his
parent is irrelevant when neither contrast or complement is
established.
</P>
<P>
   Isamu Noguchi's quaint phallic decor does not help much; the
feeling is that the dancers, asked to incorporate gesture into
dance movement, are not sure who they are. Ms. Meunier went over
the top as an extra-wild Bacchante.
</P>
<P>
   Balanchine's background allowed him to take whatever he had seen
in his life. The silk curtain in ``Orpheus'' recalled the curtain
that the Russian director Vsevelod Meyerhold used in the opera
``Orpheus and Eurydice.'' In ``Symphony in C,'' Balanchine's debt
was to Leo Staats, the choreographer at the Paris Opera Ballet
whose neoclassical plotless ballets he deeply admired. In 1947,
Balanchine choreographed ``Palais de Cristal'' for the Paris Opera
Ballet. In New York in 1948, it became ``Symphony in C,'' and it
was now danced with dazzle and verve.
</P>
<P>
   Miranda Weese, brilliant in the first section with Damian
Woetzel, was followed by Philip Neal and Wendy Whelan, who was
fascinating in her unorthodox and hard-edged performance. The other
fine principals were Alexandra Ansanelli, Peter Boal, Samantha
Allen and Albert Evans.

HOW HE DID `VERY BAD THINGS'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB STRAUSS 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; Blame it on Cousin Winky.
</P>
<P>
   He was the family insult comedian, the Don Rickles who came to
dinner. Cousin Winky traumatized Peter Berg when he was 6, calling
the little boy a pretty girl whenever he had a few scotch-and-sodas
in him.
</P>
<P>
   It explains a lot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really credit Winky with putting this demented streak into
my personality,'' says Berg, who plays the cranky Dr. Billy Kronk
on the television series ``Chicago Hope'' and has appeared in such
edgy movies as ``The Last Seduction'' and ``Copland.'' ``He was a
brutal guy, he'd go after anyone. But he had a big heart.''
</P>
<P>
   No one is using heart _ except as part of terms like
``heart-attack inducing'' _ to describe Berg's feature writing and
directing debut, ``Very Bad Things.'' A vicious, graphic,
remorselessly intense black comedy, it's been called, among worse
things, sick, nasty, scabrous, stomach-turning and infantile. And
those words were from critics who didn't absolutely hate it.
</P>
<P>
   Berg is not surprised by such reactions. He didn't set out to
please anyone, really, but himself. And he's already acknowledged
that he's a bit demented.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody has their own sense of humor, and this is mine,''
says Berg, who speaks softly but nevertheless projects a smoldering
air of menace. ``I like sarcasm, I like humor that kind of hurts. I
felt that as things get so outrageously horrible in `Very Bad
Things,' you could find humor in it.
</P>
<P>
   ``But a lot of times, I was scared,'' the novice director
admits. ``These scenes weren't funny when we were shooting them.''
</P>
<P>
   Among those scenes: A happy hooker in the throes of professional
ecstasy gets bloodily, well, hooked; a sibling rivalry
confrontation escalates to vehicular manslaughter; the systematic
beating to death of a grieving widow; a chain-saw wedding ... Well,
you get the picture.
</P>
<P>
   It's all the result of a bachelor party gone terribly wrong.
``Swingers'' writer-star Jon Favreau plays the groom; Cameron Diaz,
super hot coming off of ``There's Something About Mary,'' is the
ruthless, domesticity-fixated bride-to-be; and Christian Slater,
Daniel Stern, Jeremy Piven and Leland Orser are the bachelor-party
buddies who become Favreau's co-conspirators in grotesque crimes
and soul-shattering cover-ups.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm aware that there are people who are going to flat-out hate
this film,'' Berg says with a mixture of defiance and resignation.
``I know there are people who are going to be able to find many
faults with this film. There are aspects of it that, I suppose, are
misogynistic, there are aspects of it that are racist, there are
aspects of it that are anti-Semitic. I knew that while I was
writing it. I didn't censor myself in any way, shape or form.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it wasn't a particularly contrived plan. I had no agenda
as I was writing it. I just knew I wanted to make a film about a
group of people whose lives come unraveled, and this is what came
out of my subconscious. I didn't really sit down with a plan to
make a movie that bashed handicapped kids, that bashed dogs, that
bashed women. I knew I wanted to make a film that bashed everybody,
'cause that's how I was feeling at the time.''
</P>
<P>
   That somewhat twisted passion was what attracted members of the
impressively hip ensemble to the alarming project. (And drove
others away; Berg reports that Adam Sandler was originally cast as
the guilt-ridden, unintentional killer played by Jeremy Piven).
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew this wasn't for everybody, but I knew it was
well-written,'' says Favreau, who jump-started his own acting
career by writing ``Swingers.'' ``Talking to Peter was also great;
he's a smart guy who knows what he wants. I knew he would have a
strong vision for the piece, and I couldn't be happier with the
film.''
</P>
<P>
   Favreau also appreciated the story's core thematic joke.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not to get too intellectual about this thing, but I think it
does represent the anxiety a man feels when entering into
marriage,'' he says. ``I think every man feels that anxiety, to
some degree, when they say they're going to be with one woman for
the rest of their life. All of these things are manifestations of
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Berg, who will only say that ``I have a very strange marriage,''
admits that he wrote ``Very Bad Things'' in a matrimonial funk.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the time that I wrote the script, I was having a certain
amount of frustration with the institution of marriage,'' Berg
says. ``I had a little bit of internal pain as a result of those
frustrations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was mad. But at the same time, I wasn't that mad. I wasn't
hopeless; I wanted people to be able to laugh, I wanted to have fun
with my anger when I made the movie. I believe that people should
be married. My parents have a wonderful marriage that has lasted
for 37 years and, I'm sure, will last until the day they die.''
</P>
<P>
   Born and raised in New York City, Berg began acting while
attending college in Minnesota. He also directed plays and videos
there, and that's, as the old Hollywood cliche goes, what he's
really wanted to do ever since.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always knew that I wanted to create my own stories and tell
them,'' he reveals. To that end, he plans to leave ``Chicago Hope''
at the end of this season in order to concentrate more on writing
and developing films.
</P>
<P>
   ``If somebody gave me a good role, or a director who I thought
was doing something interesting called, I would act again in a
second,'' he adds. ``But I don't have a burning desire to act just
to act. (Writing and filmmaking) is where my real passion is now.
It's scary, and it's a lonely thing to do, but in the end it's a
very creatively satisfying experience.'' Must be even scarier after
some of the reviews ``Very Bad Things'' has gotten. But Berg isn't
the kind of guy who worries about what people think of him.
</P>
<P>
   Or is he?
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, I love women, I love children, I love animals,'' he
insists. And it must indeed be noted that, for all the relative
innocents victimized in the movie, the adult white males pay dearly
for their depravities, too.
</P>
<P>
   That said, a warm and cuddly Peter Berg is still a good ways
off.
</P>
<P>
   ``My next film won't be quite so sinister, but right now, I'm
mean and fast,'' he warns, then smiles. ``Wait till I have kids,
though. Then I'll make a nicer film.''

   ENTERTAINMENT &AMP; ARTS (Moved in `e' category)
</P>
<P>
   FILM AND VIDEO
</P>
<P>
   HORROCKS-FILMS (Los Angeles) _ In her latest film, ``Little
Voice,'' directed and adapted for the screen by Mark Herman
(``Brassed Off''), Ms. Jane Horrocks plays L.V. (for Little Voice),
an introverted working-class waif who holes up in her bedroom,
hoping both to escape the scalding remarks of her alcoholic mother
(Brenda Blethyn) and to recapture the comforting presence of her
late father by playing and re-playing the 33 and one-third records
from his collection of pop classics. For all her mother's seedy
boyfriend (a gold-chained Michael Caine) knows, L.V. is completely
mute. Then, as the sounds of famous female pop singers seep from
beneath her door and out the windows, he discovers that this mousy
young woman has a gift for impersonating divas. The rest of
``Little Voice,'' which opens on Dec. 4, documents his hapless
attempts to exploit L.V.'s talents _ and also shows a veteran actor
being bowled over by his younger co-star. By Margy Rochlin.
(Moved).
</P>
<P>
   BRAZIL-FILMS (Undated) _ Brazil has long been proud of its place
in world cinema. But these days the country, quite simply, is film
mad. Headlines appear on the front pages of the major newspapers
every time a Brazilian film wins an international award or an
Academy Award nomination. By B. Ruby Rich. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   FILM-CREDITS (Undated) _ IN the beginning, there was simply
``The End.'' Now, there are gaffers, best boys and Celine Dion.
Hollywood movie credits, which began as modest lists, have grown
over the years into lumbering behemoths as extravagant _ and
seemingly as time-consuming _ as the films they accompany. By
Margalit Fox. &UR;  &LR; (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   PENELOPE-CRUZ-FILMS (Undated) _ Screen beauties are hardly a
novelty, but even within the realm of celluloid sirens, the Spanish
actress Penelope Cruz elicits unusual adoration from her directors.
``She's simply gorgeous, he said helplessly,'' the director Stephen
Frears said, well, helplessly, of his decision to cast Ms. Cruz,
24, in her first American film, ``The Hi-Lo Country.'' The
Madrid-born performer plays Billy Crudup's consolation prize,
inasmuch as the woman whom the leading man really wants _ a
kittenish Patricia Arquette _ has chosen his best friend (Woody
Harrelson) instead. (The movie, set in the Southwest in the
aftermath of World War II, opens on Dec. 30.) By Matt Wolf.
(Moved).
</P>
<P>
   DANCE
</P>
<P>
   FRANKFURT-BALLET (Frankfurt, Germany) _ In Europe, the
choreographer William Forsythe is widely considered the most
important dance maker on the planet. In his own country, the United
States, his name is probably known only to a limited number of
balletgoers who have seen his works in the repertories of the New
York City Ballet, the San Francisco Ballet or the Joffrey Ballet,
or perhaps performed by a touring company from across the Atlantic.
The visit of Forsythe and the company he directs, Frankfurt Ballet,
to the Brooklyn Academy of Music for six performances starting
Wednesday marks a decade since the troupe's last appearances in the
United States. By Roslyn Sulcas. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   THEATER
</P>
<P>
   DONMAR-THEATER (London) _ A former hops brewery might seem an
unlikely source for Broadway. But the tiny Donmar Warehouse theater
in London has over time become a powerful producing entity way out
of proportion to its 251 seats. While maintaining a full level of
activity at home, the nonprofit theater has originated, in one form
or another and sometimes with outside collaborators, three highly
disparate productions currently on Broadway: ``Cabaret'' at Studio
54, which won last season's Tony Award for best musical revival;
Sophocles' ``Electra,'' with Zoe Wanamaker in the title role, now
in previews and opening on Thursday at the Ethel Barrymore Theater,
and ``The Blue Room,'' also in previews and opening on Dec. 13 at
the Cort Theater with Nicole Kidman in her Broadway stage debut. By
Matt Wolf. (Moved). Photo.
</P>
<P>
   CANBY-THEATER (Undated) _ Vincent Canby reviews George C.
Wolfe's new production of ``On the Town.'' (Moved). Photo.
</P>
<P>
   SONDHEIM-FOLLIES-CDs (Undated) _ A new two-CD recording of
theater director Stephen Sondheim's score for ``Follies.'' By
Stephen Holden. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   CLASSICAL
</P>
<P>
   MUSIC-LISTEN (Undated) _ As mechanisms of sound reproduction
improve, the day may come when one cannot distinguish aurally
between sitting in Avery Fisher Hall in New York City (where this
concert took place) and listening at home with headphones, though
that day is a long way off. And with DVD and its future
developments, the time may come when the impression of facing an
orchestra can be reconstructed. But it is hard to imagine the
technology that would allow individual watcher-listeners to use
their eyes and ears with the range of choices available in any
concert hall: to fix attention on a cellist's bowing, to scrutinize
the field. By Paul Griffiths. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   PLAYER-PIANO-CDs (Undated) _ Geneticists have their Dolly. They
also have the goods on Thomas Jefferson: the old miscegenator long
suspected, now betrayed by his own DNA. Where the progress of
science is concerned, art is rarely far behind, and now comes
Sergei Rachmaninoff, dead since 1942, walking among us again.
Telarc has released ``A Window in Time,'' a CD made from piano
rolls, and promises another in March. On the first, the great man
plays his own music and arrangements ranging from Bizet to ``The
Star-Spangled Banner.'' On the second, Rachmaninoff addresses the
significant (Chopin, Schubert, Mendelssohn) and the less
significant (Henselt, Rubinstein and bowdlerdized Bach, Beethoven
and Gluck). The music comes from a process developed by Wayne
Stahnke, who got his ideas working on the Voyager space mission for
NASA. By Bernard Holland. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   BRUCKNER-MUSIC (Undated) _ Imagine the Bruckner symphonies shorn
of sentimental piety, and you're at the starting point of a
provocative cycle emerging on CDs. Through five symphonies, Georg
Tintner, 81, a conductor born in Vienna, casts Bruckner's grand,
emotionally charged structures in a refreshing light of restraint
and proportion. Reflected back is an aura of honest affection and
with it a paradoxical exchange: a beguiling intellectual beauty
where one often finds a cloistered spirituality. By Lawrence B.
Johnson. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   ART
</P>
<P>
   JOHNSON-GEHRY-ARCH (Undated) _ Frank Gehry has changed Philip
Johnson's place in history, and both architects are the
beneficiaries. If Gehry hadn't come along, Johnson's work might
well be remembered as an emblem of a time when American
architecture lost its way. His restless rovings from movement to
movement and style to style offered giddy architectural
entertainment, particularly during his high-flying days of big
corporate commissions in the 1980s. But they demoralized many who
think that architecture should stand for something more than relish
for flirting with forms. By Herbert Muschamp. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   BRASSAI-PHOTOGS (Undated) _ Next Sunday, an exhibition of
photographs by Brassai, called ``The Eye of Paris,'' will open at
the Museum of Fine Arts in Houston. The result of 15 years of
research by Anne Wilkes Tucker, the museum's curator of
photography, it is the first major museum retrospective of
Brassai's work to be held in this country since one at the Museum
of Modern Art in New York in 1968. By John Russell. (Moved). Photo.

   TV-PIONEERS (Undated) _ Since April 1996, the Television Arts
and Sciences television Archive of American Television has been
sending video crews around the country in a race against the
actuarial clock to interview the dwindling stock of television
pioneers. The list includes not only the Berles and the
Caesar-Cocas but also the technical geniuses like Philo Farnsworth
and the unrecognized heroes of television's early years like
Charlie Andrews, whose quirky genius inspired the widely
influential Chicago School of Television that brought, among
others, Studs Terkel, Dave Garroway and Hugh Downs to national
prominence. By Jeff Kisselgoff. (Moved).

   INDIAN-JEWELRY-ANTIQUES (Undated) _ In 1955, Oppi Untracht, a
New Yorker who now lives in Finland, was spellbound by an
exhibition of Indian textiles and jewelry he saw at the Museum of
Modern Art. Since then Untracht (often with his wife, the Finnish
glass designer Saara Hopea, who died in 1984) has spent years
traveling the highways and byways of the subcontinent, studying
jewelry-making techniques and buying jewelry. His collection of
jewelry and photographs along with loans from museums and other
private collectors make up ``India: A Jewelry Spectrum,'' a
dazzling exhibition on view through Jan. 31. By Paula Deitz.

   &UR; A PLEA FOR THANKSGIVING &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Before we break bread together, let us stop for a moment today
to consider _ and cross our fingers for _ the 30-something San
Francisco screenwriter _ ``extremely fit and comely,'' by her own
description, who recently placed a Personals ad in the New York
Review of Books. Among other attributes, she's seeking:
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone who loves to play and who savors the details as we sit
across the gothic wooden table laden with sumptuous organic feasts,
our well-loved friends coming for Sunday dinners, stories and
discourse infused with sovereign thought, self-possessed rebellion,
deep compassion and shameless discovery.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps you, on the other hand, are sitting down today at a
Formica table, eating a plate of fast-food french fries with a
bunch of strangers whose thoughts aren't sovereign (perhaps even
strangers like Personals, who's clueless as to what a sovereign
thought is).
</P>
<P>
   Whatever. Seize the day, if not the drumstick.
</P>
<P>
   P.S.  &UR; Cal Fussman &LR; , an essayist writing in the latest Esquire
about alleviating the stresses of everyday life, says that an
old-fashioned food fight is a useful form of stress management.
</P>
<P>
   P.P.S. A cautionary tale, on the other hand: ``I sat down with a
book and waited for the cranberries to start popping, which they
soon did,'' writes &UR; Andrew Solomon &LR;  in the latest issue of Food &AMP;
Wine. ``It was only afterward that I noticed the words `a covered
pot. ...' My little kitchen looked like the scene of a shoot-out.''
Solomon, says the author's credit at the end of the story, is
working on a book about depression.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; HOLIDAY GIFT GIVING &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``Wearing these light, sheer colognes will take you back to a
summer day redolent of freshly cut grass, warm, loamy soil or
tomatoes ripening on the vine,'' says the copy from Gardeners Eden,
a catalog in which  &UR; Kate Hanson &LR;  dug for treasures.
</P>
<P>
   One bottle of Dirt cologne will set you back $12. A set of three
fragrances, including Dirt, Grass and Tomato, costs $30.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FLASH &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; - Susan Schwartz &LR; 's new book, ``Teddy Bear Philosophy''
(Andrews McMeel; $12.95), has some supportive words for the
formerly feathered victims of the day: ``When life knocks the
stuffing out of you, be sure to put it back in.''
</P>
<P>
   - If today's feast leaves you worried about your waistline, the
New York Times reports that figure-conscious people in New York are
ordering their bagels ``scooped,'' that is, with the inside dough
spooned out. And if that's not enough, social X-rays are ordering
their bagels with a ``deep scoop.'' Does anyone know how to bake a
crust-only bagel?
</P>
<P>
   - French fries are ordered more often than any other restaurant
dish in America, reports Rolling Stone. In 1960, the magazine
reports, the average American ate 3.5 pounds of frozen french fries
a year. In 1997, the average American ate 30 pounds of french fries
a year.
</P>
<P>
   - ow to decorate your table? Never mind &UR; Martha Stewart; &LR;  ``Nash
Bridges'' regular  &UR; Yasmine &LR;   &UR; Bleeth &LR;  gave US magazine her
Thanksgiving Day decorating tips: ``Use miniature gourds, carved
out in the middle, for candleholders. (I use a grouping of five to
seven, not just a pair).'' Adventurous homemakers might even go so
far as to use nine, or 11.
</P>
<P>
   - Forbes FYI warns about the perils of nutmeg. A man who
consumed four nutmeg kernels with a half-liter of vodka ``became
tingly all over, his heart began to race and he started
hallucinating,'' effects that lasted for 27 hours. ``Why do you
think they call it nutmeg?'' asks the magazine.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``Elizabeth invited me to partake in her private afternoon &LR; 
 &UR; delight. Sensing my apprehension, she urged me to try these &LR;

A&AMP;M QUIETLY STAYING IN HUNT FOR NATIONAL TITLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIMMY BURCH 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   They stand, quite simply, as the Northwestern Mutual Life of the
Bowl Championship Series.
</P>
<P>
   The Quiet Company. The sleeping giant in the race for the Fiesta
Bowl. The team no one north of the Red River wants to mention when
discussing potential national championship contenders.
</P>
<P>
   Don't think for a minute that the Texas A&AMP;M Aggies are
complaining about their place in college football's pecking order.
Quite the opposite, in fact.
</P>
<P>
   A&AMP;M, ranked sixth in both major polls, holds down the No. 5 spot
in the BCS rankings. The BCS computer will update its pecking order
twice more before its top two teams shuffle off to Tempe, Ariz.,
for a Jan. 4 date in the Fiesta Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   If the Aggies (10-1) win their remaining games and Tennessee
(10-0) and UCLA (10-0) stumble between now and Dec. 5, A&AMP;M will
reprise its Aug. 31 matchup against Florida State (11-1) in the
Fiesta Bowl. But this time, a national title would be on the line.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're on the outside, looking in,'' linebacker Dat Nguyen
said. ``But you can't deny it's a possibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Sure, it's a long shot. But the dominos have fallen right this
season for A&AMP;M, which heads into tomorrow's 10 a.m. contest against
Texas with a 10-game winning streak. Even better, they have fallen
in relative anonymity, which has allowed a team with a popgun
offense and a blowtorch defense to steadily climb the BCS ladder
with a minimum of pressure until the top rung has become visible.
</P>
<P>
   Even now, this week's pregame foucs isn't on the Aggies. It's on
Texas tailback Ricky Williams, who needs 63 yards to break the NCAA
career rushing record held by Tony Dorsett (6,082 yards). On Dec.
5, the lion's share of pressure in the Big 12 championship game
falls on Kansas State (11-0), which sits two spots ahead of A&AMP;M in
the BCS rankings and will be playing for its first conference title
since 1934.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just rolling along, not worried about trying to draw
people's attention,'' A&AMP;M tailback Dante Hall said. ``But we know
we've put ourselves in position for a lot of great things. We're
down to a three-game season. If we win all three, anything can
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Including a national championship.
</P>
<P>
   But the Aggies, even with victories the next two weeks, will
need some help to make their final game a Fiesta in the desert.
A&AMP;M's best hope rests with Arkansas (8-2) or Mississippi State
(7-3) upsetting Tennessee in the Southeastern Conference title game
and Miami (7-2) knocking off UCLA in its regular-season finale.
Both games are set for Dec. 5.
</P>
<P>
   A&AMP;M's odds for reaping the benefits of a season-ending,
double-upset Saturday are slim and none. But this is college
football, where strange things happen on a weekly basis. Things
like Michigan State 28, Ohio State 24. Or even North Carolina State
24, Florida State 7.
</P>
<P>
   That is why A&AMP;M coach R.C. Slocum is holding out hope that his
team can tiptoe quietly into position for a bell-ringing finish to
the 1998 season.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's still some big games left to play. With each one,
there's a chance something positive can happen to change our
position a little bit,'' Slocum said. ``But we don't have any
chance unless we win these next two games. And we're practical
enough to know none of it matters if we don't focus on the next
challenge, and that's playing Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   At college football's quiet company, they're taking it one
silent step at a time.
QUICK HITS Family ties
</P>
<P>
   Texas A&AMP;M tight end Dan Campbell, a Glen Rose High School
graduate, understands a thing or two about divided family loyalties
during A&AMP;M-Texas week.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell's cousin, Rocky Allen, was a Texas defensive end from
1986-89.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why my mom's side of the family are all big Texas
fans,'' Campbell said. ``All year, they've been coming to watch me
play and it's been, `Go, Aggies.' Now, when we play the Longhorns,
it's, `Sorry, I can't root for you.' That eats you up a little
bit.''
</P>
<P>
   Campbell, who grew up on a cattle ranch near Walnut Springs,
said he knew his cousin's school was not for him when former Texas
assistant coach Bucky Godbolt made a recruiting visit.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were some stray goats out by the creek,'' Campbell said.
``And Coach Goldbolt asked me, `What are those black deer doing out
there?' My dad and I laughed about that the rest of the night ...
Believe it or not, as stupid as that story is, it might have had a
lot to do with my decision. I knew right then that Texas didn't fit
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about his first impressions of A&AMP;M coach R.C. Slocum,
Campbell said: ``He fit in perfect. We were a match from the
start.''
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, Slocum did not misidentify any farm animals during his
visit to the Campbell ranch.
Supporting Williams
</P>
<P>
   Texas tailback Ricky Williams, the probable front-runner for the
Heisman Trophy, said he would not be bothered if Kansas State
quarterback Michael Bishop beats him out in balloting for Big 12
Offensive Player of the Year honors. A survey taken last week of
league coaches, who do the voting, indicated that could happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't agree more,'' Williams said of Bishop's status as
the league's top offensive player. ``He deserves it. He carries
that team.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas A&AMP;M linebacker Dat Nguyen, a finalist for the Butkus and
Lombardi awards, begs to differ.
</P>
<P>
   ``If that happens, that's like me winning the Butkus and being
second-team all-conference,'' Nguyen said. ``It's pretty weird. It
doesn't make any sense.''
Extra Points
</P>
<P>
   Texas linebacker Aaron Babino will replace the injured Anthony
Hicks (knee) in the lineup for tomorrow's game against A&AMP;M. Hicks,
a starter since Sept. 26, has been somewhat of a good-luck charm
for the Longhorns' defense. In games that Hicks has started and
finished, Texas is 6-0. When he has not, Texas is 1-3 ... Add the
name of Johnnie Cochran to the list of players in the Oklahoma
coaching saga. No, the former attorney for O.J. Simpson is not
among the myriad candidates rumored as potential successors to the
ousted John Blake. But Cochran may soon be the former OU coach's
representative in negotiations to sweeten his severance package
with the school. The two are longtime friends. As for the sticking
point, OU administrators say Blake is due $115,000 in base salary
for each of the remaining years on his contract, which goes through
the 2000 season. Blake seeks a deal closer to his $501,000 annual
package that also included income from radio and TV shows, as well
as a shoe contract ... Look for OU administrators to sign off on a
package in the $850,000 range for Blake's successor. That could be
enough to turn the head of Georgia coach Jim Donnan, who recently
received a new contract worth $625,000 per season. If not, it
should be enough to land the marquee name OU administrators seek if
Donnan opts to stay put ... How ground-bound is the Nebraska
offense? Wide receiver Matt Davison has 30 catches, the most by any
Cornhuskers player since tight end Johnny Miller had 31 in 1991 ...
Kansas State's David Allen has 771 yards in punt returns. That's
185 more than the next closest ``team'' in the NCAA season
statistics (Arizona, at 528 yards) ... Stung by seasonlong
criticism about a soft nonconference schedule that could be a
stumbling block to a national championship showdown in the Fiesta
Bowl, Kansas State officials recently completed their 1999 slate of
outside opponents by adding Utah State (3-8). School officials
already had dates with UTEP (3-8) and Temple (2-9), with all games
in Manhattan, Kan. Some things never change ... Texas Tech tailback
Ricky Williams (1,582) nipped Missouri's Devin West (1,578) by 4
yards to finish second in the Big 12 rushing race to another guy
named Ricky Williams. But he needed an extra 23 carries to do it.

   BOYS-BURNED (Los Angeles) _ Three 17-year-old Hart High School

BRITISH REJECT IMMUNITY IN PINOCHET EXTRADITION CASE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON - In a stunning reversal that will have implications for
despots all over the world, Britain's highest court cleared the way
Wednesday for the extradition of Chile's former dictator Augusto
Pinochet to face charges that he tortured and murdered political
opponents.
</P>
<P>
   By a 3-2 vote, the Law Lords in the House of Lords, Britain's
upper house of Parliament, overturned last month's decision by the
nation's High Court that had cited sovereign immunity in ruling
that Pinochet could not be prosecuted for the repression he
oversaw, including at least 3,000 state-sanctioned murders, during
his 1973-1990 reign.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers here acting on behalf of Spanish authorities who lodged
the warrant for Pinochet's arrest appealed the High Court decision.
They argued that Pinochet's crimes were against humanity, making
him ineligible for sovereign immunity.
</P>
<P>
   By the slimmest majority, the law lord judges decided that the
principle of sovereign immunity did not apply to Pinochet because
he had overseen grievous violations of human rights, including the
torture and murder of ordinary men, women and children.
</P>
<P>
   One of the judges, Lord Steyn, said that to allow Pinochet to
invoke sovereign immunity to escape his actions was to suggest that
Hitler could have done the same to escape prosecution for imposing
the Final Solution to exterminate Jews.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict was delivered in dramatic fashion in a hushed House
of Lords chamber full of tension. One by one, the five judges,
dressed in dull business suits that contrasted vividly with the
mostly empty red benches of the chambers, rose to render briefly
their decisions. The verdict was in doubt until the fifth judge,
Lord Hoffman, stood and broke the two-two tie, saying, ``Senator
Pinochet does not have immunity from prosecution, and I, too, would
therefore allow the appeal.''
</P>
<P>
   Lord Hoffman's terse remarks were interrupted by gasps from the
visitor's gallery, which was packed with both those who love and
loathe the former Chilean strongman.
</P>
<P>
   There was pandemonium on the streets surrounding Westminster,
where most of those gathered were Chilean exiles who hate Pinochet,
including the relatives of some of his victims.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank you, Jesus!'' one man kneeling on the ground cried
repeatedly in Spanish, tears streaming down his cheeks.
</P>
<P>
   Pinochet's reaction was said to be more subdued, as news of the
verdict ruined his 83rd birthday. He was informed of the verdict in
the North London hospital where he is recovering from back surgery,
and where he is under armed guard.
</P>
<P>
   So sure were Chilean officials that Pinochet was going to be
released that a Chilean air force jet, equipped with medical
equipment, has been waiting for a month at the Royal Air Force base
in Oxfordshire.
</P>
<P>
   It will have a much longer wait. Pinochet is due in court here
next Wednesday for an extradition proceeding here. The extradition
process could last for weeks, or even months. Spain is just one of
a number of European countries that have lodged warrants demanding
Pinochet's arrest for murder, torture and genocide.
</P>
<P>
   Home Secretary Jack Straw must now decide if Pinochet will face
an extradition hearing next Wednesday at Bow Street Magistrate's
Court. Like many of the Labor Party leaders who form the British
cabinet, Straw was in his youth a vocal supporter of Salvador
Allende, the democratically elected leader of Chile who Pinochet
overthrew in a CIA-backed coup in 1973. Allende died during the
events under mysterious circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   Acknowledging his past activism against Pinochet, Straw made the
extraordinary claim soon after Pinochet's arrest that he would not
allow his earlier political views to inform his decision on whether
to extradite - a claim that rings hollow to Pinochet's supporters.
</P>
<P>
   Immediately after Wednesday's decision, former prime minister
Margaret Thatcher, a friend of Pinochet who hosted him for
cocktails at her Belgravia home two weeks before his Oct. 16 arrest
at a London hospital, called on Straw to cancel Pinochet's
extradition on humanitarian grounds, citing Pinochet's age and
failing health. Earlier this year, Straw had cited similar grounds
in refusing to extradite Roisin McAliskey, the daughter of Irish
radical Bernadette Devlin McAliksey, to Germany to face charges for
an IRA bombing. The younger McAliksey suffering from depression
during her long detention, during which she gave birth to a child.
</P>
<P>
   But Pinochet's supporters were so sure of victory that they may
have unwittingly undermined his ability to cite his failing health
as a reason to escape extradition. Last week, apparently sure that
the High Court decision would be upheld, Pinochet's supporters said
he was healthy and ready to fly home to Chile as soon as the law
lords delivered their ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Underscoring how closely this case had been followed in the
international community, representatives from human rights groups
were here en masse for the verdict. Reed Brody, the advocacy
director for the New York-based Human Rights Watch, seemed to voice
the consensus of the groups when he said the decision was ``a wake
up call to tyrants around the world who think about embarking on
mass murder.''
</P>
<P>
   But Pinochet's supporters denounced the decision as a craven
capitulation to left-wing agitators and a violation of Chilean
sovereignty. As part of a deal approved by Chileans, Pinochet was
allowed to step down in 1990 in exchange for his freedom from
prosecution and his granting of democratic elections.
</P>
<P>
   The law lords' decision came several weeks after hearing
extraordinary set of arguments. Alun Jones, the lawyer who argued
on behalf of the Spanish authorities who want Pinochet to face
charges for killing Spanish citizens, said it was ``repugnant'' to
suggest Pinochet was entitled to immunity. He said a body of
international law developed throughout the 20th century made a
mockery of Pinochet's claim that, because Chileans accepted a deal
in which he stepped down in exchange for not being prosecuted,
other countries had no jurisdiction.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to the alleged murders by Pinochet of more than 3,000
people, including children, and disappearances of another 1,000 who
have never been accounted for, Jones said, ``It is not part of the
function of the head of state, under English or international law,
to behave like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones also claimed that some of the crimes of which Pinochet is
accused took place during and immediately after the 1973 coup he
led, before he could be considered a head of state. Pinochet's
lawyer, Clive Nicholls, scoffed at that claim, saying, ``There's no
suggestion that anyone else was head of state at this time.''
</P>
<P>
   While Pinochet is expected to recover from back surgery, the
principle of sovereign immunity that he expected to shield him
while receiving medical care here may be irreparably damaged. Some
legal observers believe it means that despots like Yugoslav
president Slobodan Milosevic or Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein would
leave their own countries at their peril.
</P>
<P>
   Pinochet's ordeal here is ironic as it is divisive.
Conservatives here view him as an old ally who helped Britain
during its 1982 war with Argentina over the Falkland Islands.
Liberals say it is outrageous that Pinochet has come here regularly
to shop and use London's great hospitals and restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   Pinochet is an avowed Anglophile and a great admirer of London,
the city that has now for almost two months been his prison. He
shopped at Burberry's, admired the city's war memorials, and said
he was most attracted to Britain because it was ``civilized.'' But
now diplomats from Chile accuse Britain of disregarding one of the
bedrocks of civilization - international law.
</P>
<P>
   Chilean officials complain that Britain has trampled on the
long-established principle of sovereign immunity. But British
officials have insisted that they acted properly when receiving an
extradition request from Spain.
</P>
<P>
   A British Home Office spokesman acknowledged that Pinochet was
traveling under a diplomatic passport when arrested, but said
immunity applies only to a serving head of state or diplomats
specifically assigned to Britain. The law lords who ruled against
Pinochet Wednesday cited similar reasoning, saying that Pinochet is
no longer a sovereign.

 &HT;    Falcons coach looking for more progress from Chandler
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Quarterback Chris Chandler did not practice Wednesday
and, although he was walking without the removable cast worn on his
sprained right ankle Monday and Tuesday, he still has a limp.
</P>
<P>
   After a practice in which 44-year-old backup Steve DeBerg and
second-year veteran Tony Graziani split time with the No. 1
offense, coach Dan Reeves was not optimistic Chandler will play
Sunday at St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was not encouraged by Chris. He didn't move well at all,''
Reeves said. ''I thought he would move around a lot better than
that. He would have to make a lot more progress before he would be
ready to practice (today).''
</P>
<P>
   Every time Chandler plants his right foot to throw, he feels
significant pain. ''It's still very sore,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   When Chandler missed the Oct. 25 game against the Jets, a 28-3
loss, DeBerg started, completing 9-of-20 passes for 117 yards and
one interception. Graziani played most of the second half,
completing 7-of-14 passes for 86 yards and one interception.
</P>
<P>
   Graziani, who is far more mobile than either Chandler or DeBerg,
has made notable progress. Against a Rams pass rush that has 37
sacks and behind an Atlanta line that has allowed 40 sacks, that's
worth considering.
</P>
<P>
   ''Chris has been a great role model for (Graziani),'' Reeves
said. ''His arm is stronger (than last year) and . . . players have
more confidence in him.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think he's going to be a good quarterback in this league.
We'll do what gives us the best chance to win, and mobility may be
a part of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Injury update
</P>
<P>
   Reeves said Tim Dwight, who has missed four straight games with
a strained medial collateral knee ligament, will probably dress out
Sunday, and return punts and kickoffs. . . . CB Ronnie Bradford is
almost certain to return to the lineup after missing two games
entirely and two additional starts because of a strained MCL.
Michael Booker, who played well in Bradford's absence, will spell
him and be involved in nickel and dime defenses. . . . FB Bob
Christian continues to cope with either stretched or pinched nerves
running from his right ear down into his right arm. He practiced
Wednesday, but was held out of contact. Whenever his head is
snapped the wrong way, he suffers numbness in his right arm. He is
listed as questionable. . . . CB Ray Buchanan missed practice with
a sore hamstring. It has been bothering him since the Nov. 15 game
against San Francisco. ''It's just precautionary, to rest it,''
Buchanan said. ''It doesn't limit me, but it gets sore. I'll
play.'' . . . S Chris Bayne (hamstring), who has missed two
straight games with a strained hamstring, practiced and is
questionable. . . . St. Louis QB Tony Banks (sprained ankle), RB
Jerald Moore (broken rib)and WR Isaac Bruce (hamstring) did not
practice Wednesday. Banks insists he'll play. Rookie RB Robert
Holcombe is likely to start for Moore, and Bruce is doubtful.
</P>
<P>
   Bonus time
</P>
<P>
   Because the Falcons are doing so well, the team will end up
paying quite a bit more after the season in incentives, and RB
Jamal Anderson is at the top of the list.
</P>
<P>
   With a career-high 1,138 rushing yards, third in the NFL, he is
62 yards away from activating clauses in his contract calling for
as much as $1.1 million in bonuses.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever money the Falcons have left under the salary cap after
the season (currently less than $800,000) can be committed to such
incentives. The team also can carry them over to next year's cap.
Often, bonuses are added onto a player's base salary the following
year.
</P>
<P>
   Extra points
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons signed QB Sherdrick Bonner to the practice squad,
where he replaced LB Malcom Hamilton after the Redskins signed
Hamilton to their active roster. The lefthanded Bonner plays in the
Arena League for the Arizona Rattlers. His coach is Danny White,
who was a backup and starting QB when Reeves was offensive
coordinator of the Cowboys from 1977-80. . . . Atlanta worked out
Albany native and former Clemson DE Brett Williams, who was in
training camp with the Cowboys. . . . The Falcons still have not
worked out all the small details in an agreement to hold training
camp at Furman University in 1999, with options in 2000 and 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Ticket talk
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons, who can sew up a playoff berth with a win Sunday,
may announce playoff ticket prices Friday or Saturday. The league
has a say in those prices, but since Atlanta has the lowest average
ticket price in the regular season at about $31, the Falcons also
are likely to have the lowest playoff tickets. Season ticket
holders will have first priority, and then fans who pay a deposit
on season tickets for next year will have next priority. Those
tickets would go on sale to the public after the middle of
December.

TEXAS EDUCATOR TO PROPOSE TOUGHER STANDARDS ON STUDENT EXIT EXAMS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By KATHY WALT 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Texas Education Commissioner Mike Moses said
Wednesday he will propose toughening the standards by which schools
are rated by adding algebra exams and continuing to raise the
minimum passing rate.
</P>
<P>
   While those measures likely would reduce the number of public
schools that get the highest ratings of ``exemplary'' and
``recognized,'' neither is likely to have the immediate impact that
another new measure will, Moses said.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning this school year, special education students' scores
on the Texas Assessment of Academic Skills tests will be included
when the Texas Education Agency evaluates school district and
campus performance. Including these students is expected to slash
by 38 percent the number of top-ranked ``exemplary'' schools and by
25 percent the number that this year got the second-highest rating
of ``recognized.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That does cause some concern for school districts,'' Moses
said. ``It looks like the number of exemplary schools will probably
fall in the neighborhood of 400 schools, and the number of
recognized schools could likely fall by that many as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Last school year, a record 1,042 campuses were rated exemplary
and 1,617 were deemed recognized.
</P>
<P>
   Although Texas schools have been administering TAAS exams to
special education students, their scores have not been calculated
in the statewide accountability system.
</P>
<P>
   TEA figures for last school year show that the passing rates of
special education students ranged from a high of 43 percent of
third- and fourth-graders to a low of 19 percent of high school
juniors trying to pass the exit level test needed for a high school
diploma.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Jack Christie, chairman of the State Board of
Education, said that Texas students also could soon be facing more
rigorous TAAS exams.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1999, I predict we will toughen the test itself'' by adding
other subjects, like social studies, science or health science, to
the battery of courses over which students in elementary school are
tested, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Moses said he will propose next week that the Algebra I
end-of-course exam be added to the accountability system and that
the minimum passing rate for schools to be rated ``acceptable''
continue to rise 5 percentage points a year until 2004, when 70
percent of students would have to pass all TAAS tests before a
school campus is considered acceptable.
</P>
<P>
   TEA spokesman Joey Lozano said it is unclear how soon those new
standards, if approved, would take effect.
</P>
<P>
   Texas has been hiking the passing rate standard for an
acceptable rating by 5 percentage points a year since 1993, when
only 25 percent of students needed to pass. When schools are rated
at the end of this school year, at least 45 percent of all students
and of all student groups must pass the test for a school to be
listed as acceptable.
</P>
<P>
   Moses said he has been talking about adding the algebra exam to
the accountability system in speeches to legislators, school
superintendents and other educational groups around the state for
the past three weeks or so. While he has the authority to continue
raising the passing rate standard for schools, legislative approval
is needed to add the algebra I exam to the mix.
</P>
<P>
   Student scores on the algebra I end-of course exam have been
disappointing ever since TEA began field-testing the exam several
years ago. Although scores have risen for the past three years,
still, only 39 percent of students passed the exam last spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we need to continue to look to see if there are other
things we want to do,'' Moses said. ``It seems as though when we
put something in the accountability system it gets a lot of
attention, which is a good feature of the accountability system.
That means that teachers and principals pay attention to those
things upon which their schools are going to be rated.''
</P>
<P>
   Making student performance on the algebra test part of the
school ratings might help raise student performance in that course,
Moses said.
</P>
<P>
   The TAAS test is at the heart of the school accountability
system. Students are tested in reading and mathematics in grades
three through eight. Fourth-graders take an additional test in
writing, and eighth-graders also are tested in writing, science and
social studies. High school students must pass an exit-level TAAS
test to get a diploma.
</P>
<P>
   School ratings are based on the percentage of all students
passing and the percentage of students passing in specific ethnic
and low-income groups.
</P>
<P>
   Despite most education officials' contention that the TAAS is
demanding and a nationally recognized program, it has come under
criticism recently from a variety of groups. Some teachers have
criticized the program, saying it forces teachers to spend a
disproportionate amount of time teaching only material covered on
the test.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, a group of out-of-state researchers, hired
by the Tax Research Association of Houston and Harris County,
attacked the test as too easy.

IMPEACHMENT CHAIRMAN SETS DEADLINE FOR CLINTON TO RESPOND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER AND LOUIS D. PALMER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Frustrated by the White House response to the
impeachment inquiry, House Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry J.
Hyde Wednesday abruptly issued a deadline of Dec. 2 for President
Clinton to say if he will present a defense against allegations
stemming from his sexual affair with Monica S. Lewsinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde, who previously said he would not invite Clinton to testify
because he did not want to ``embarrass'' him, wrote to the
president Wednesday that he will ``allow'' him or his attorneys to
present his case to the committee.
</P>
<P>
   Amid growing pressure in Congress to resolve the matter quickly,
Hyde's letter to Clinton stated, ``I am prepared to schedule your
presentation for as early as Tuesday, December 8,'' barring further
developments.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials said Clinton's legal defense team will
prepare a response to the letter, which Hyde issued on the same day
that Clinton had been expected to answer 81 questions from
committee Republicans about his relationship with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   The White House said the responses to the questions will be
provided tomorrow instead, prompting a testy reaction by Hyde.
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite repeated requests for more than a month, the White
House has yet to provide the committee with any materials that tend
to exonerate you or even dispute the evidence submitted in the
referral of the Office of Independent Counsel,'' Hyde stated in his
letter to Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   If the White House does not provide ``complete and specific
answers'' by Monday, Hyde warned, ``I have no course but to urge
the full committee to subpoena those answers.''
</P>
<P>
   A White House spokesman, James Kennedy, said Hyde apparently
knew when he wrote the letter that Clinton was expected to answer
the 81 questions by tomorrow, as aides had said he would do by the
end of the week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure what the point of his letter is,'' Kennedy said.
``As for the other issues he raises, we will respond to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Charles Bakaly III, spokesman for independent counsel
Kenneth W. Starr, said in a breakfast meeting with reporters that
the independent counsel's office is likely to remain active through
the end of Clinton's presidency in wrapping up investigations and
criminal prosecutions.
</P>
<P>
   Bakaly said Starr has not ruled out seeking criminal charges
against Clinton stemming from the Lewinsky matter after Clinton's
term ends. Starr and committee Republicans have cited Clinton's
alleged perjury before a federal grand jury as the most serious
charge against him.
</P>
<P>
   But Bakaly indicated that the perjury allegation may be hard to
sustain in court. ``Perjury is not always the easiest case to
bring,'' he said. ``Perjury cases are tough to prove.''
</P>
<P>
   At the White House, officials said Clinton will answer the 81
questions from committee Republicans without admitting he committed
any crime or impeachable offense stemming from his sexual liaisons
in the White House with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Starr, who Wednesday faced a new attack from commmittee
Democrats on his handling of the case, has cited ``substantial and
credible'' evidence in the referral he sent to Congress that
Clinton may have committed 11 impeachable offenses, including
perjury, obstruction of justice, and abusing the power of his
office.
</P>
<P>
   Starr defended his inquiry last week under cross-examination by
committee Democrats and Clinton's private lawyer, David E. Kendall.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde's letter to Clinton continued: ``The failure to provide any
exculpatory information, together with Mr. Kendall's failure to
contest a single fact in the Referral when questioning the
Independent Counsel, lead to the conclusion that the White House
does not dispute any of the factual evidence presented in the
Referral and supporting materials.''
</P>
<P>
   Hyde said Clinton's cooperation is vital if the committee is to
achieve his goal of completing its inquiry by the end of the year.
Hyde wants the panel to vote on articles of impeachment the week of
Dec. 7 and, if they pass, send them to the full House for action
the following week.
</P>
<P>
   ``The committee is reaching the critical stage of this
process,'' Hyde's letter stated. ``Time is of the essence for you
to provide any factual basis which disputes the allegations against
you &UR;  &LR; ... &UR;  &LR; Now is the time for cooperation.''
</P>
<P>
   But the committee Democrats also want answers from Starr. In a
letter, the panel's highest ranking Democrat, Representative John
Conyers Jr. of Michigan, asked Starr to answer 19 questions on
topics ranging from alleged news leaks by his deputies to their

   The questions are ``simply an attempt to clarify the factual

 &HT;    Anderson contract extension in works
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ At the request of the Atlanta Falcons, the agent for
Jamal Anderson has given team officials a contract extension
proposal that would make the five-year veteran one of the five
highest-paid running backs in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   No deal is imminent. And neither Anderson, Oakland-based agent
James Sims or Falcons general manager Harold Richardson would
discuss specifics.
</P>
<P>
   But Anderson, 26, confirmed that he and Sims have used as a
framework for their initial proposal the contracts of Denver's
Terrell Davis, Detroit's Barry Sanders, Dallas' Emmitt Smith, the
Jets' Curtis Martin, Green Bay's Dorsey Levens and Minnesota's
Robert Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Their contracts average roughly five years and $23 million,
which is believed to be in the ballpark of Anderson's proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had prepared myself mentally to play through my current
contract (and test the free-agent market),'' said Anderson, whose
contract runs through the 1999 season. ``Just in the last week or
so, this all changed. I'm just looking for what most (high-profile)
backs are getting, about five (extra) years.''
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons have multiple reasons to begin offering contract
extensions, especially to Anderson, who has become one the league's
top rushing threats with his third straight 1,000-yard season.
</P>
<P>
   He ranks ninth on the team with a salary this season of $1.2
million. The closer he gets to free agency, the more difficult it
might be to keep him. He is slated to make $1.6 million next
season.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the contracts of two Falcon starters expire after this
season and those of 15 starters expire following next season,
although the team will maintain rights to several.
</P>
<P>
   The team does not want to be in a position of having to re-work
numerous contracts next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always are interested in extending players that are
contributing and keeping them for the long run,'' Richardson said.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons are not likely to pay Anderson more than quarterback
Chris Chandler, who in September signed a five-year, $27 million
contract that included a $6 million signing bonus and an average
salary of $4.68 million over the final four years of the deal.

UMBILICAL BLOOD CAN HELP CANCER PATIENTS, STUDY SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DOLORES KONG  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Blood from a newborn's umbilical cord works at least as well as
bone marrow from an unrelated donor for patients with cancer and
other diseases requiring a marrow transplant, according to the
largest study to date of the blood's life-saving potential.
</P>
<P>
   Considering the shortage of bone marrow donors worldwide and the
difficulty in finding a close enough genetic match, particularly
for minority patients, such cord, or placental, blood is a vast
untapped resource, say the study's authors and others in the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has far-reaching implications,'' particularly for cancers
like lymphoma and leukemia, said Dr. Curtis Cetrulo, president of
the International Cord Blood Society and a Tufts University
professor, who is familiar with the study in today's New England
Journal of Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you saved all the placental blood that is now discarded in
the United States, anybody who ever needed bone marrow
transplantation could find a compatible donor,'' said Cetrulo, an
obstetrician in private practice, who is affiliated with South
Shore Hospital in South Weymouth, Mass. ``It has that potential.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Pablo Rubinstein, lead author of the study and director of
the placental blood program at the New York Blood Center, said
transplant centers are already beginning to favor cord blood over
bone marrow from unrelated donors.
</P>
<P>
   ``More and more people are realizing that this indeed has
advantages that are very helpful,'' he said. For instance,
Rubinstein said, cord blood is relatively easier to obtain than
bone marrow, it's less likely to transmit viral infections and it
poses a lower risk of serious graft-versus-host disease, a
potentially fatal complication of transplantation.
</P>
<P>
   Still, cord blood does not take the place of what is usually the
optimal situation _ a sibling with perfectly matched bone marrow.
</P>
<P>
   The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, which first
funded the New York Blood Center in 1992 to set up a cord blood
bank, welcomed the results. ``They clearly advance the field,''
said Dr. Claude Lenfant, director of the institute, in a statement,
although he cautioned the findings need to be confirmed by further
research.
</P>
<P>
   The study reported the results of cord-blood transplants in 562
patients worldwide, including four in Massachusetts, performed
between August 1992 and January 1998. The blood all came from the
New York Blood Center, which used federal funds to set up the
mechanism to take donations, type the blood and freeze it for later
use.
</P>
<P>
   Cord blood, like bone marrow, contains the stem cells that help
rebuild a patient's diseased or damaged blood system. But it
appears that those found in cord blood have a special quality,
leading to a lower risk of serious graft-versus-host disease and
allowing a less perfect match than required for bone marrow.
</P>
<P>
   While bone marrow transplant is used as part of treatment in a
variety of diseases, including solid tumors like breast cancer, the
study looked only at such blood-related diseases as leukemia.
</P>
<P>
   As with people who receive bone marrow from donors, however,
people receiving cord-blood transplants may die or suffer a relapse
of their disease.
</P>
<P>
   Severe graft-versus-host disease occurred in 23 percent of
patients in the study, while the rate of relapse for patients with
leukemia reached 26 percent at the end of a year.
</P>
<P>
   Of the four patients with leukemia who were transplanted in
Massachusetts hospitals over the last couple of years, three of
them died.
</P>
<P>
   A 44-year-old woman with chronic myelogenous leukemia died after
her disease came back, while a 50-year-old woman with the same form
of leukemia died as a result of complications from
graft-versus-host disease, said Dr. Donald Higby, chief of
hematology and oncology at Baystate Medical Center in Springfield,
Mass. At the time of the cord-blood transplants, both women had
advanced disease, and neither of them had a closely matched bone
marrow donor.
</P>
<P>
   Even with publication of the worldwide cord-blood transplant
results, Higby cautioned, ``I think there still needs to be a lot
worked out before we call it a major advance.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Eva Guinan, of Children's Hospital and Dana-Farber Cancer
Institute in Boston, said one infant who received a cord-blood
transplant died from infection. The other patient, a boy from the
Boston area, has problems with graft-versus-host-disease, but has
not seen a recurrence of the leukemia.
</P>
<P>
   The Dana-Farber is one of several medical centers involved in a
federally funded, $30 million study of cord-blood transplants, to
better understand their use. The hospital is kicking off its arm of
the study next week, according to Guinan.
</P>
<P>
   Although cord blood holds out much potential, it is difficult to
set up a system to save and preserve donated blood, as the
experience of a cord blood bank at UMass Memorial Health Care
demonstrates.
</P>
<P>
   In September, the blood bank stopped accepting donations, after
collecting, typing and freezing about 2,000 cord bloods in 18
months. The blood is still available at UMass through an
international cord blood registry, and has been used for
transplants in a number of cases, including one in Australia. But a
funding crunch forced the hospital to stop accepting new donations,
said Mark Shelton, director of public affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Several commercial cord blood banks exist in Massachusetts and
nationwide, offering parents the possibility of saving their
children's cord blood in case they develop leukemia or other
diseases later on. Rubenstein said too little studying has been
done to show that using one's own cord blood to treat leukemia
would work, and he added he doubts it would.

GASH ON ZOLAK: `DANGEROUS' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILL MCDONOUGH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   He has seen what the rest of us haven't. And Sam Gash has had a
better ``in'' than the rest of us when it comes to Scott Zolak.
</P>
<P>
   ``Zo is dangerous,'' said Gash yesterday from Buffalo, where he
and the rest of the Bills were preparing for Sunday's critical AFC
East game against the Patriots in Foxborough.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess people don't think of Zo as being dangerous,'' said
Gash, who played fullback for the Patriots from 1992-97. ``He has
the happy-go-lucky way about him, but when he is on the field,
playing the game, he plays with a lot of fire. He's a competitor.
He is always prepared to play. He studies. He knows what the game
is all about. But the thing that could bother us the most with Zo
playing is that the ball comes out in a hurry. It will be hard for
our guys (pass rushers) to get after him.''
</P>
<P>
   Gash is looking forward to this homecoming.
</P>
<P>
   ``I played there six years,'' he said, before catching himself
and adding with a laugh, ``Make that 5 1/2. I know all the guys.
They know me. We just had a great game against each other a few
weeks ago in Buffalo. There was a lot of intensity on the field
that day, and we expect it will be the same in this game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know there is a lot at stake in this game. You have four
teams fighting for the division title, and because of that, the
teams that don't win it might be left out of the wild-card race
because we will be beating each other right down to the final
Sunday of the season. I think that's when it will be decided. The
last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we will be pressing for this game. Our game plan
will be to do what we do best: run the ball. I watched the film of
their game against Miami and they did a great job of stopping the
Miami run.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the key to the game. Miami likes to run the ball,
control the tempo of the game, and keep their defense off the
field. But the Patriots won the battle of the clock and that was
important at the end of the game. The Miami defense was out on the
field in the final drive more than they have been used to, because
their offense could not control the clock with the run.
</P>
<P>
   ``This game will be like that. Both teams will try to control
the clock. Their defense is tough to run against, to try to sustain
drives. I'm sure they will come up with a couple of things to try
to disrupt (Doug) Flutie and the way he does things.''
</P>
<P>
   Gash feels this encounter has all the makings of a special game.
Flutie coming home. Drew Bledsoe injured. Four o'clock kickoff.
National television. The Bills needing to win to keep a piece of
first place. The Patriots one game behind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we all know each other's schedule the last five
weeks,'' said Gash. ``All of us will be looking at the scoreboards
to see what Miami is doing, the Jets. A team could go 9-7 in our
division and not make the wild card. Every game is important. I
don't think any team will separate itself from the pack.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a great, hard-hitting game in Buffalo. I know it was
hard going up against guys like Ted Johnson and Tedy Bruschi every
play, head to head. I think Ted is the best inside linebacker in
the league. He plays full speed all the time and when you meet him
head-on, it hurts. He's very physical.''
</P>
<P>
   Buffalo has lived by the run this year. Even though Flutie has
gotten the bulk of the publicity, the teams that have beaten
Buffalo this year, with the exception of one (the Rams), have shut
down the running game.
</P>
<P>
   The Bills come into this game averaging 138.5 yards per game on
the ground, compared with 81.9 for the Patriots, playing virtually
the same schedule. Buffalo has 76 first downs via the run to 43 for
the Patriots.
</P>
<P>
   Antowain Smith does the bulk of the work for Buffalo, averaging
3.8 yards per carry. However, the venerable Thurman Thomas, who is
not getting beat up as he did when he was the workhorse of four
Super Bowl teams, has come on strong lately in a part-time role,
averaging 4.4 yards.
</P>
<P>
   This game does not figure to come down to Flutie and Zolak; it
should be decided in the battle between the Bills' offensive line
and the Patriots' front seven on defense.
</P>
<P>
   Buffalo's defense can be susceptible to the run, but New England
does not have the rushing game to exploit that. And the Bills'
defense, featuring a surging Bruce Smith, is as tough as any in the
league on third and long, when it uses a fourth down lineman
(Marcellus Wiley) and comes after the passer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both teams have their backs against the wall,'' said Gash.
``That's why this game is going to be so much fun. A football
player lives to play in this kind of game.''
</P>
<P>
   And no one ever said that Sam Gash wasn't all football player.
</P>

ECONOMIC SCENE: PROFITS IN JOB TRAINING FOR WELFARE RECIPIENTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mich., N.Y.)  (bl) 
 By MICHAEL M. WEINSTEIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   A robust U.S. economy has provided a respite _ until the next
recession _ from the provisions of the 1996 Welfare Reform Act that
threaten to withdraw aid from millions of poor families. But now a
longer-term, if still partial, answer is slowly emerging.
</P>
<P>
   Prodded by the Welfare to Work Partnership, a nonprofit
organization run by Eli Segal, a former adviser to President
Clinton, companies are connecting with community groups to recruit,
train and hire welfare parents for entry-level jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The motive,'' says Segal, ``is the most reliable of all:
profit. Companies are finding that properly trained welfare
enrollees stay at their job longer than other recruits, cutting the
firms' recruitment and training costs.''
</P>
<P>
   Beginning in early 1997, the partnership initially signed up
about 3,200 companies to hire an estimated 135,000 welfare
enrollees for entry-level jobs. About three-fourths of the hires
are for full-time work with health benefits. The program has now
expanded to about 7,500 companies.
</P>
<P>
   The partnership's key strategy is to link companies to nonprofit
community groups, like Goodwill Industries International and
churches, that specialize in recruiting, training, counseling and
mentoring welfare parents. The idea is to provide enrollees with
the English, math and so-called ``soft skills'' _ manners and
attitude that qualify welfare recipients for an employer's own
training program. The community groups also provide counseling and
mentoring once the welfare recipient enters work.
</P>
<P>
   The initial hires were in all the expected unskilled corners:
fast-food restaurants, clerical positions, retail sales. The
obvious question is whether the partnership's strategy could be
expanded to handle any number close to the 2 million or or so women
now on welfare who will soon need jobs.
</P>
<P>
   The new wrinkle is that the partnership has pierced high-pay
white-collar jobs in industries that are expanding. Next week the
partnership will announce in New York City new commitments by banks
and other financial institutions. Therein lie the seeds of
replication.
</P>
<P>
   Take Chase Manhattan. The bank has set up three tracks for
hiring welfare enrollees. The first uses Wildcat Services Corp. to
train welfare enrollees to become bank tellers at Chase's branches,
using Chase terminals and computer programs. Chase then puts these
hires through its own two week training course.
</P>
<P>
   The distinct feature of the program is that Wildcat is training
enrollees to perform Chase-specific tasks. Carol Parry, who
oversees the program for Chase, says that her ``managers are
thrilled with their new recruits, and the welfare recipients say
they are ecstatic to be working at Chase.'' Typically, she says,
about half of Chase's new tellers leave within a year, forcing
Chase to spend between $3,000 and $5,000 to recruit and retrain a
replacement. But, so far, only about 10 percent of the tellers it
has hired through Wildcat have left.
</P>
<P>
   Chase has turned to two other nonprofit groups to train welfare
enrollees to serve as customer service representatives, answering
customer phone calls about Chase bank products, and as back-office
workers, reconciling transactions on Chase's automated teller
machines.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, Salomon Smith Barney has also turned to Wildcat to
train welfare enrollees specifically for its entry-level jobs. So
far, more than 90 percent of the enrollees that Salomon has hired
under the program remain employed two years later. Republic
National Bank, which promises a job to each graduate of its
program, trains 120 welfare recipients a year.
</P>
<P>
   Segal's point is that by expanding beyond fast food and retail
sales, the partnership strategy opens the possibility that
employers will absorb most if not all of the welfare recipients
that will flood into the labor force over the next several years.
</P>
<P>
   There is some independent evidence that Segal's optimism may be
justified. Professor Harry Holzer of Michigan State University
surveyed employers in three Michigan metropolitan areas, finding
that almost 9 percent of the their jobs over the next year would be
open to welfare recipients, even those without high school diplomas
or work experience. That number is many times the size of the
welfare population that will need work.
</P>
<P>
   There remains a serious problem of matching unemployed
recipients to willing employers _ the very task that the
partnership was set up to accomplish.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, not all the evidence is encouraging. The Holzer study
emphasizes that the employers' willingness to hire is tied to
temporarily tight labor markets and that many employers are located
beyond the reach of most welfare enrollees.
</P>
<P>
   Professor Sandra Danziger and her colleagues at the University
of Michigan surveyed women on welfare in an urban county in
Michigan early in 1997 and followed up with interviews about nine
months later. The study found that of the women who were not
already working, perhaps half were potentially hirable, especially
if they were to receive the type of counseling and mentoring
services offered by Segal's program. But many of the women
enrollees faced serious and multiple employment barriers. Some of
those barriers are physical. About a third of the women suffer from
mental problems like depression. A third have not finished high
school. Half the women lack access to transportation. The welfare
recipients suffering multiple handicaps _ about half the group _ do
not easily find work. In the study, only about 5 percent of the
women suffering from seven or more of these barriers were working.
</P>
<P>
   Its easy to list reasons why optimistic signs that
welfare-to-work programs are succeeding are just that, optimistic.
The Danziger study identifies and measures the obstacles. Sixty
years of experience under modern welfare laws proves the point.
</P>
<P>
   But it is equally valid to stress the good news. The Holzer
study says employers are prepared to hire welfare recipients. The
partnership results, though skimpy because they come from a program
still in infancy, say that promises can be translated into
permanent jobs, a mellow note on which to start the holidays.

GARTH BROOKS ALBUM SETS SINGLE-WEEK SALES MARK 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 By NEIL STRAUSS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Last Tuesday became known in the music business as
Super Tuesday after a glut of major records were released
simultaneously for the holidays by superstars like Garth Brooks,
Whitney Houston, Mariah Carey, Jewel, Method Man and Seal.
</P>
<P>
   But before the results of this Thanksgiving music battle were
announced, Brooks, the country-music titan, had already planned a
victory news conference at the Rainbow Room in Manhattan. Despite
many sales disappointments by superstar acts this year, he was
confident that his ``Double Live'' album would break the
music-industry record held by Pearl Jam for most albums sold in a
week: 950,000 copies in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   The results, announced Wednesday by Soundscan, a music-retail
monitoring company in Hartsdale, N.Y., show that his confidence was
not misplaced. Brooks far outdistanced his competitors. ``Double
Live'' sold 1.09 million copies, a figure all the more impressive
for a two-record live set that contains only three new songs. One
of many marketing schemes that helped the album's sales is that it
was sold for the price of a single CD, around $14, for its first
weeks on sale.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the multimillion-dollar campaign included screening
a live performance on closed-circuit television in 2,400 Wal-Marts
on the day the album came out, releasing seven different packages
of the album for collectors, appearing on the ``Tonight'' show,
performing a concert special on NBC and garnering headlines by
making the claim that the record would sell more than a million
copies its first day out.
</P>
<P>
   Brooks has said his goal is to sell 100 million ``Double Live''
records over time, which is more than the sales of all his previous
records combined: 82 million, in itself a record for the most
albums sold by a solo artist.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Litwak, a vice president at Trans World Entertainment, which
supplies records to more than 500 U.S. stores, credited the album's
success to Brooks' broad-based appeal and the marketing savvy of
Capitol Nashville president Pat Quigley. Although ``Double Live''
even sold well for Trans World in cities like New York and Chicago,
it was not Trans World's biggest album of the week. That honor went
to a rap album, Method Man's ``Tical 2000: Judgment Day.''
</P>
<P>
   Overall, among the other albums released last week, Method Man
came in at No. 2, selling 411,000 copies. And in the race between
the divas Mariah Carey and Whitney Houston, both of whose albums
featured the same Carey-Houston duet from ``The Prince of Egypt,''
they lost to Jewel, who sold more than both of them combined with
the third biggest record of the week, ``Spirit.'' Ms. Carey's ``No.
1's'' came in at No. 4 and Ms. Houston's ``My Love Is Your Love''
disappointed at No. 13.
</P>
<P>
   The weeks surrounding Thanksgiving are the biggest and most
crucial for the record business, and such numbers, retailers said,
pointed to a good year for sales as the business rebounds from a
period of flat sales in the mid-90s.
</P>
<P>
   Several record retailers see a trend in the success of niche
genre albums by Brooks and Method Man over those of artists who
appeal to a more broad-based audience like Jewel and Ms. Houston.
They said that one reason this was shaping up to be a successful
holiday season was that record companies catered to the diversity
of consumers this year with releases by major acts across the
board. And with new albums released last Tuesday by Metallica,
2Pac, Pearl Jam and the Wu-Tang Clan's RZA, record retailers expect
the sales surge to continue.
</P>
<P>
   Promoters File Suit
</P>
<P>
   Despite the recent success of black artist-owned labels like No
Limit and Bad Boy, few in the music business disagree with the
contention that there is a proportional lack of black executives in
the upper echelons of the business, especially at major labels. A
lawsuit filed last Friday in U.S. District Court in Manhattan
points to an even greater disparity in the music business: the lack
of successful black executives in the concert business and, even
more so, of black concert executives working with white acts.
</P>
<P>
   The suit, filed by five concert promoters from around the
country, charges 11 major promoters and booking agencies (including
SFX Entertainment, the William Morris Agency and Creative Artists
Agency) with antitrust and civil rights violations. The promoters
claim to have been locked out of promoting concerts by white acts
as well as successful black ones. They are seeking $700 million in
damages.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've worked with Michael Jackson,'' said Leonard Rowe, a
plaintiff and head of the Black Concert Promoters Association and
Rowe Entertainment, an Atlanta promoter. ``But I've never been
solicited by a white act as long as I've been in the business, and
that's 23 years. I've tried to talk to the booking agents, but they
turn a deaf ear on us every time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever you have an up-and-coming black act we get the job
and do all the work: passing out fliers in the community, putting
up posters in the restaurants,'' he said. ``But whenever that act
gets to a status where all we have to do is buy an ad on the radio
or newspaper and the concert sells out, we are eliminated. The
white promoters take those acts as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Several defendants, including William Morris, Creative Artists
Agency and SFX, either declined to comment on the suit or did not
return calls.
</P>
<P>
   But Bob Grossweiner, who covers the concert business for the
trade magazine Performance, said that the plaintiffs had a strong
case, pointing to the absence of black booking agencies and the
stranglehold of ``a family of promoters who started out in the late
'60s in the infancy of cross-country touring.''
</P>
<P>
   The pop concert business has always been an intensely
competitive one in which one or two promoters in a city are
responsible for nearly all the major concerts, in part because they
own or make exclusive agreements with concert halls and arenas.
</P>
<P>
   Such practices have come under increased scrutiny lately. This
new lawsuit joins a flurry of antitrust accusations levied at a
rapidly consolidating industry, including a Justice Department
antitrust probe into acquisitions made by SFX, a company that in
two years has spent more than $1 billion acquiring more than half
of the concert promotion business in the United States in addition
to venues in most major cities.

A SPANISH SIREN, HEADING WEST  
(FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, NOV. 29)
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
 By MATT WOLF   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Screen beauties are hardly a novelty, but even within the realm
of celluloid sirens, the Spanish actress Penelope Cruz elicits
unusual adoration from her directors.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's simply gorgeous, he said helplessly,'' the director
Stephen Frears said, well, helplessly, of his decision to cast Ms.
Cruz, 24, in her first U.S. film, ``The Hi-Lo Country.''
</P>
<P>
   The Madrid-born performer plays Billy Crudup's consolation
prize, inasmuch as the woman whom the leading man really wants _ a
kittenish Patricia Arquette _ has chosen his best friend (Woody
Harrelson) instead. (The movie, set in the Southwest in the
aftermath of World War II, opens on Dec. 30.)
</P>
<P>
   ``She decides to live with that pain,'' Ms. Cruz said of her
character Josepha's status as the patient runner-up for Crudup's
heart. ``It's worth it for her to wait. She's a very strong
woman.''
</P>
<P>
   Frears recalled how he chose Ms. Cruz. ``A tape appeared on my
desk. I went and looked at it, and there was Venus.'' As for his
verdict after the New Mexico shoot? ``She's absolutely gorgeous,''
he reiterated. ``And very, very good, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Closer to home, the Spanish filmmaker Fernando Trueba was no
less enthusiastic.
</P>
<P>
   ``She has exploded as a woman, as an actress, as everything,''
said Trueba, who directed Ms. Cruz when she was just 17 (as the
youngest daughter in ``Belle Epoque,'' which won the 1993 Oscar for
Best Foreign Film) and in her most recent film, ``The Girl of Your
Dreams.''
</P>
<P>
   That movie, which opened recently in Spain, gives Ms. Cruz her
largest role to date. She plays an Andalusian actress-singer
displaced to 1938 Berlin who becomes a reluctant plaything of
Hitler's minister of propaganda, Joseph Goebbels.
</P>
<P>
   On screen, Ms. Cruz projects an unblemished self-possession.
Sounding mostly fatigued, Ms. Cruz spoke by telephone from Madrid
during a break from work on the new Pedro Almodovar film, ``All
About My Mother,'' in which she plays a pregnant nun. ( She also
appears briefly as the painfully pregnant mother at the start of
the Almodovar's 1997 film, ``Live Flesh.'')
</P>
<P>
   ``I am a little bit tired; I'm very busy,'' Ms. Cruz said in
halting English. ``I always try to have some months between one
movie and the other. On this occasion I didn't want to say no to
these movies.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Cruz has two more films scheduled to open in the United
States this spring. In one, ``The Man With Rain in His Shoes'' _
the Spanish director Maria Ripoll's quirky romantic comedy set in
contemporary London _ Ms. Cruz dons glasses to play a budding
writer who, once again, is the jilted hero's second-best option.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am 10 minutes in the movie, maybe 15,'' Ms. Cruz said. ``I
did it because the story is very magical; she's a very sweet
character.''
</P>
<P>
   A similar sweetness relieves the lurid self-absorption of ``Open
Your Eyes,'' Alejandro Amenabar's psychological thriller. Ms. Cruz
plays Sofia, girlfriend to the narcissistic Cesar (Eduardo
Noriega), who finds his life _ or, at least, his vanity _ upended
when his face is destroyed in a car crash.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about how bad is the importance of beauty in this
society,'' Ms. Cruz said of the film, ``because it really is, and
that's something sad.''
</P>
<P>
   But what of the actress's own beauty, which may help launch her
on an international career?
</P>
<P>
   ``I can look good, and I can look ugly, if I want,'' she said.
``I don't think I am beautiful. I don't think I am perfect.''

BEIJING WILL BID FOR 2008 SUMMER GAMES 
</HEADLINE>
  (DUPLICATION NOTICE: also sent in category `s') 
(bl) 
 By ERIK ECKHOLM   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ This city announced Wednesday that it plans to bid for
the 2008 Summer Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
   In a ceremony at the Great Hall of the People, suggesting
top-level endorsement, Mayor Jia Qinglin submitted the proposal to
the head of the Chinese Olympic Committee, which is to decide in
January whether to apply to the International Olympic Committee.
</P>
<P>
   To an unusual degree, Chinese leaders see acting as host for the
Olympics as a matter of pride and international acceptance of
China's status as a great power.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think that as the world's most populous country with a
vigorous and growing economy, China should host the Olympic Games
and make more contributions to the Olympic movement,'' said Wu
Shaozu, president of the country's Olympic committee, at
Wednesday's ceremony, the New China News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
   Early this decade the Chinese government lobbied heavily around
the world for the right to have the 2000 Games in Beijing, pledging
to spend $7.5 billion to improve its creaky urban infrastructure
and even, many experts believe, timing the release of prominent
dissidents to allay criticism of the country's human rights record.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese, official and ordinary alike, reacted with dismay and
anger in 1993 when Sydney, Australia, beat Beijing by just two
votes in balloting of the International Olympic Committee.
</P>
<P>
   After China's violent crackdown on student-led pro-democracy
demonstrations at Tiananmen Square in 1989, many members of the
U.S. Congress, other Western politicians and human rights groups
had argued that it would be wrong to reward China with the
Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Although it was not at all clear that rights concerns, rather
than logistical and other factors, caused the loss, many Chinese
have borne a grudge on the matter since. Wednesday, a Chinese
Olympic committee spokeswoman said China had lost the 1993 vote
because of ``nonsports factors.''
</P>
<P>
   In the last few years China has successfully emerged from its
post-1989 diplomatic isolation and has worked, with some success,
to downgrade the role of human rights disputes in its relations
with Western countries.
</P>
<P>
   If, as expected, the International Committee receives a proposal
from Beijing, it will have to consider other problems here,
including some of the world's most dangerous air pollution and
severe traffic snarls. Chinese sports have also been tarnished by
repeated scandals involving use of performance-enhancing drugs,
though the government has vowed to clean up the problem.
</P>
<P>
   But there is little doubt that if selected, China would go all
out to make the Games a success.
</P>
<P>
   There will be ample time for Beijing and other cities to burnish
their applications. Officially, bidding for the 2008 Games does not
open until next year, with selection in 2001. Toronto; Buenos
Aires; Istanbul, Turkey; Seville, Spain; and Osaka, Japan, have
already announced that they will vie for the honor.

SHAW'S PARENT TO BUY STAR MARKETS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS REIDY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Amid rapid consolidation in US supermarket industry,
Shaw's Supermarkets Inc. confirmed Wednesday that its British
parent, J Sainsbury plc , has reached an agreement to buy Star
Markets Co., a chain of 53 stores.
</P>
<P>
   Shaw's declined further comment on a deal that gives the East
Bridgewater, Mass. chain more size to compete with Stop &AMP; Shop
Cos., New England's biggest supermarket player, but Star put the
price tag for the long-rumored deal at $490 million, including the
assumption of debt. Star Markets is based in Cambridge, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   At first glance, that would seem to be a hefty premium on the
$285 million that Henry Nasella and New York investment firm
Investcorp International paid to buy the much smaller chain of 31
Star stores in 1994. But Nasella pointed out that during the last
four years ``We almost doubled the size of the company.''
</P>
<P>
   Nasella, who began his supermarket career bagging groceries at a
Star in 1963, added that Sainsbury was ``ecstatic to buy Star, and
that's reflected in the purchase price.''
</P>
<P>
   No layoffs are likely at Star stores, said Nasella. He said he
will continue to work for the combined chains in an undefined role
for an unspecified period of time.
</P>
<P>
   The future of about 200 Star headquarters staffers is less
clear. Star's total work force numbers just over 10,000.
</P>
<P>
   Shaw's newly appointed chief executive, Ross McLaren, is
expected to run the combined chains for Sainsbury.
</P>
<P>
   Once the sale is completed sometime early next year, the Star
name could gradually disappear from the local marketplace. The
first Star Market opened in Watertown in 1915.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Star's four Wild Harvest natural food stores, the
acquisition would give Shaw's a missing piece to its geographical
puzzle in New England.
</P>
<P>
   According to company legend, Shaw's heirs feuded in the 1920s,
and to avoid a family food fight, the head of family divided his
empire, giving one son an operation based in Portland, Maine, where
the chain originated in 1860, and the other son was given a
division based in Brockton, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   To keep the peace, Boston was declared off &UR;  &LR; limits to the two
squabbling brothers.
</P>
<P>
   Whether true or not, Shaw's had no stores in Boston until
recently and only a handful of its 126 stores are located in the
city's nearest suburbs. Star stores, by contrast, are heavily
concentrated in Eastern Massachusetts within Route 128.
</P>
<P>
   Because there is so little geographical overlap, the acquisition
of Star by J Sainsbury is not expected to raise the same antitrust
concerns that became an issue when Royal Ahold NV of the
Netherlands bought Stop &AMP; Shop for $2.9 billion in 1996. Stop &AMP;
Shop is based i Quincy, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   To win approval of the Stop &AMP; Shop deal, Royal Ahold ultimately
agreed to divest some stores to satisfy critics who argued that the
merger might otherwise stifle competition and stick consumers with
higher food prices.
</P>
<P>
   As supermarket chains merge throughout the country, and Wal-Mart
Stores Inc. takes aim on on the grocery business, food behemoths
are emerging, squeezing the mid-size players such as Shaw's and
Star.
</P>
<P>
   In October, Ohio-based Kroger Co. announced plans to acquire
Fred Meyer in a $13 billion deal that will create the largest
supermarket chain in the country.
</P>
<P>
   With 2,200 stores in 31 states, the combined chain projects
annual sales of $43 billion. Six other chains, including Wal-Mart
and Stop &AMP; Shop parent Royal Ahold, had 1997 sales in the United
States of $19 billion or more. (About a quarter of Ahold's US sales
came from Stop &AMP; Shop.)
</P>
<P>
   By those standards, Shaw's and Star are small. Shaw's had 1997
sales of $2.8 billion, and Star had sales of $1.03 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't need flash cards to see consolidation is happening
in a big way,'' said Craig Faucher, editor of the Griffin Report of
Food Marketing, a trade publication.
</P>
<P>
   As big chains combine, they gain efficiencies and more buying
power with their vendors, and that means the giants can offer lower
grocery prices to consumers than smaller rivals.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, mid-sized chains now face a dilemma. To compete
with the big players, they either have to expand rapidly, often by
acquisition, or they have to put themselves up for sale.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're a mid-sized chain, you really feel under pressure to
either grow or sell,'' Faucher said.
</P>
<P>
   Besides added size and complimentary geography, Shaw's and Star
each bring something to the table for a bigger and better regional
grocery chain.
</P>
<P>
   Taking a European approach, Shaw's is skilled at persuading
customers to by its own store branded goods rather than national
brand names. If a customer buys Shaw's corn flakes instead of
Kellogg's, customers may get lower prices, but Shaw's also enjoys a
higher profit margin. &UR;  &LR; About 40 percent of Shaw's sales are for its
own brands, compared with about 20 percent for most US chains.
</P>
<P>
   Star, meanwhile, has become an expert at operating urban stores
in places other chains stay away from. One Star does business over
the Massachusetts Turnpike, another in a new Cambridge hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Besides dabbling in juice bars and in-store daycare centers and
Starbucks coffee cafes, Star has also expanded into natural foods,
which have a much higher profit margin than typical groceries _ as
much as 10 percent versus 1 or 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The deal may make sense for other reasons. Star has been running
losses of $8 million to $9 million, and allying with J Sainsbury
makes it part of a large food empire.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, J Sainsbury lost a chance to gain control of
a big Maryland-based supermarket chain to Ahold, Stop &AMP; Shop's
parent. Acquiring Star gives J Sainsbury a much needed bigger
presence in the United States at a time when the company has been
having some ups and downs in Britain.

CAPTURING THE VOICES OF OTHERS, OR BEING CAPTURED BY THEM  
(FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, NOV. 29)
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
Margy Rochlin's most recent article for Arts and Leisure was about
the actress Natasha Gregson Wagner. 
 By MARGY ROCHLIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ At first, she did only Shirley Bassey and Cilla
Black. To entertain her friends on the schoolyard back home in
northern England, Jane Horrocks would spend her lunch breaks
warbling just like the legendary British song stylists.
</P>
<P>
   As she grew, so did her repertory; eventually this character
actress, best known in the United States for her flashy supporting
role as the braying secretary, Bubble, on ``Absolutely Fabulous,''
would add the likes of Marlene Dietrich, Edith Piaf, Judy Garland
and Marilyn Monroe.
</P>
<P>
   Most often, it was she who summoned the celebrities.
Occasionally, though, they'd show up unbidden.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once, I had a confrontation with a boyfriend and I just
metamorphosed into Barbra Streisand,'' recalled Ms. Horrocks, who
at the time was just a scrawny 15-year-old with a headful of tight
curls permed to resemble Ms. Streisand's Afro from her ``Star Is
Born'' period. ``He got furious with me. He said, `Stop talking
like Barbra Streisand.' But I just couldn't.''
</P>
<P>
   In her latest film, ``Little Voice,'' directed and adapted for
the screen by Mark Herman (``Brassed Off''), Ms. Horrocks plays
L.V. (for Little Voice), an introverted working-class waif who
holes up in her bedroom, hoping both to escape the scalding remarks
of her alcoholic mother (Brenda Blethyn) and to recapture the
comforting presence of her late father by playing and re-playing
the 33 and one-third records from his collection of pop classics.
</P>
<P>
   For all her mother's seedy boyfriend (a gold-chained Michael
Caine) knows, L.V. is completely mute. Then, as the sounds of
famous female pop singers seep from beneath her door and out the
windows, he discovers that this mousy young woman has a gift for
impersonating divas.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of ``Little Voice,'' which opens on Dec. 4, documents
his hapless attempts to exploit L.V.'s talents _ and also shows a
veteran actor being bowled over by his younger co-star.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a shot where I'm looking absolutely astounded, which
was true,'' said Caine, who added that he didn't know he was being
filmed when the moment was captured. ``I mean, Jane only weighs
about 20 pounds. You have to wonder, `Where does that voice come
from?' ''
</P>
<P>
   It is no coincidence that ``Little Voice'' appears to be a dream
showcase for Ms. Horrocks: the movie is based on a play, ``The Rise
and Fall of Little Voice,'' by Jim Cartwright, an old friend of
hers who caught Ms. Horrocks' one-person variety show in her back
garden one afternoon and decided to create a theater piece for her.
</P>
<P>
   During its 1994 run, the production became one of the hottest
tickets in London's West End. Some audience members would sing
along with Ms. Horrocks as she inhabited the identities of Garland,
Monroe and Ms. Bassey. Neither on screen nor on stage, however,
were her disciples treated to Ms. Horrocks' pitch-perfect
replication of Ms. Streisand.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be honest, I just don't think she fit in with those other
women,'' said Ms. Horrocks, whose taste for musical impressions
runs toward the sadder, more broken chanteuses. ``Streisand is so
seemingly power-crazed at the moment. There's nothing vulnerable
about her that I can see.''
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the 5-foot-2-inch Ms. Horrocks is about the most
vulnerable looking creature you can imagine. She has huge, widely
spaced eyes, and even though she was wearing red lipstick and a
gray cashmere sweater set for an interview, she could still have
passed for an eighth-grader.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, she's so slender that despite seeing her polish off a
king-size breakfast of eggs, bacon and toast, the waiter at the
Four Seasons Hotel in Beverly Hills couldn't have known she was
eating for two: Ms. Horrocks is expecting a child in March.
</P>
<P>
   She has an 18-month-old son, Dylan, at home with Nick Vivian, a
screenwriter who is her boyfriend and the father of both children.
</P>
<P>
   ``Or I think so, anyway,'' Ms. Horrocks joked.
</P>
<P>
   The youngest child of John Horrocks, an electrical salesman, and
his wife, Barbara, a hospital ward aide, Ms. Horrocks grew up in
Rawtenstall, England, where the first person she learned to amuse
was herself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a spoiled brat,'' she said. ``My two older brothers
spent a lot of years not being able to stand me. So I was on my own
quite a lot, developing this vivid imagination.''
</P>
<P>
   Her Technicolor take on things continued to evolve at the Royal
Academy of Dramatic Arts and, afterward, with the Royal Shakespeare
Company. These days, it is impossible to select which of Ms.
Horrocks' creations is the most original.
</P>
<P>
   To choose her chocolate-smeared bulimic in Mike Leigh's ``Life
Is Sweet'' (1991) would be to ignore the abrasive new spin she gave
to Sally Bowles when she originated the role in her former
boyfriend Sam Mendes' 1994 revisionist ``Cabaret'' in London
(currently on Broadway, starring Jennifer Jason Leigh). And what
about the 1995 experimental version of ``Macbeth,'' in which Ms.
Horrocks showed Lady Macbeth's descent into madness every evening
by urinating onstage before a flabbergasted audience?
</P>
<P>
   ``When people lose control, it's not pleasant to watch,'' said
Ms. Horrocks, in a bit of understatement. It was an acting choice
the producers asked her to discontinue for the show's tour of
Scottish schools. In the end, the ``Macbeth'' experience made her
reflect on which sector of the dramatic arts could support her
penchant for risk. ``After that, I just sort of lost faith in
theater,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In turn, Hollywood, at least briefly, lost faith in her. At some
point after the film rights to ``The Rise and Fall of Little
Voice'' were purchased, but before the project went into
production, Ms. Horrocks was told she was being replaced by the
better-known Gwyneth Paltrow.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, she would have been very appropriate,'' Ms. Horrocks said,
in a half-playful, half-scoffing tone, about the idea of casting a
blond American goddess over the woman who made the role. ``I never
heard why Gwyneth decided not to do it. Maybe they all decided they
were being lunatics.''
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe they remembered what happened in 1994. That was the
year the Steppenwolf company in Chicago tried to put on a
Horrocks-less rendition of ``The Rise and Fall of Little Voice'' at
the Neil Simon Theater.
</P>
<P>
   ``It closed after a week,'' said Ms. Horrocks.

NBA TALKS STALL AGAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   No turkey jokes today. And no negotiations this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The NBA and its players may have to hope that they can settle
their five-month lockout with telepathy, because negotiations don't
seem to be working.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, the league announced it would forgo a planned
Saturday bargaining session because the union would not agree to
three pre-conditions. Any momentum gained from last Friday's
marathon session _ and there was some, but not a lot _ has been
stalled and no new talks are scheduled.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, NBA players will be home for Thanksgiving, which we
have known for a while, home for Christmas, which we just learned
this week, and possibly home for Martin Luther King Day, Easter,
and Memorial Day, too. The league has not announced a so-called
``drop dead date'' to cancel the season and union chief Billy
Hunter said in a conference call Wednesday that ``the odds are
against'' canceling the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think (a deal) can be achieved. If I didn't, I wouldn't say
that,'' Hunter said.
</P>
<P>
   But Hunter also said that he was not going to come to the table
after agreeing to league-dictated terms.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is quite apparent that we cannot negotiate against
ourselves or with a gun to our heads,'' he said. Wednesday ``We are
prepared to meet and all issues are up for discussion. But we will
not agree to any set of pre-conditions.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Hunter, he received a fax from NBA deputy
commissioner Russ Granik saying the union would have to accept the
league's position on timing rules, percentages, and the escrow tax
for talks to take place. Hunter referred to the fax as an
``ultimatum.'' He said he called back to say the union would do no
such thing and said that Granik told him there was no reason to
meet Saturday. The league then announced that the session was
canceled.
</P>
<P>
   The timing rule affects teams that sign free agents. The league
wants such a team to be prevented from going over the cap to
re-sign its own players, a device known as the Larry Bird
exception. ``We're not going to see Bird bastardized,'' Hunter
said.
</P>
<P>
   The other two issues relate to the overall percentage of NBA
revenues the union is willing to accept, now believed to be 58
percent. The league blew up the previous agreement because the
number exceeded 51.8 percent, an agreed-upon deal-breaker. The
escrow tax would go into effect if player salaries exceeded
whatever the final percentage figure happens to be.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the major ``breakthroughs'' have come in areas that
address potential overages, but not the figure that would trigger
the overage. That's akin to deciding that you want doors on your
new car, but haven't decided how much you can spend on the vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   Hunter also accused the NBA of playing ``mind games'' with his
constituency and trying to ``weaken our resolve'' by making it seem
a deal might be close. However, commissioner David Stern and Granik
both said after Friday's session that there was still a
considerable divide between the sides.
</P>
<P>
   Granik sees no way that play can occur in 1998, given that there
are no new talks planned and any agreement would likely be followed
by three to four weeks of training camp. NBC, which was not
scheduled to televise a game until Christmas, has lost its
ratings-monster doubleheader that day because of the impasse.
Instead, the network will show, ``It's A Wonderful Life.''
</P>
<P>
   The network does not have another telecast scheduled until Jan.
16, which gives you some idea of how important it considers the
first two months of the schedule to be. And this is from a network
that lost pro football.

COMMENTARY: WHAT RUSSIA NEEDS NOW 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By WILLIAM SAFIRE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ During the spring primary elections in Chicago in
1928, candidates were machine-gunned and bombs at polling places
terrorized voters. Desperate to prevent political violence in the
November election, the head of the Crime Commission went to the
city's most powerful gangster, Al Capone, to plead for help.
</P>
<P>
   Capone, amused and flattered, delivered. With his cooperation,
all known local gunmen of his and rival gangs were rounded up on
Election Eve. Violence was suspended long enough for peaceful
citizens to vote; ``not one election fraud,'' marveled the
anti-crime chief at the display of Capone's power.
</P>
<P>
   In Russia today, organized gangs of criminals are gunning down
reform candidates, honest officeholders and political journalists.
The country is out of the government's control, and nowhere is
political crime more violent than in St. Petersburg, heart of
Russia's democratic reform.
</P>
<P>
   In the run-up to local elections, Galina Starovoitova, Russia's
leading female advocate of democracy, was murdered by a pair of
assassins. Weapons made in America and Italy were left at the
scene. Her press aide, also shot, was able to call police and is
under heavy guard as a witness.
</P>
<P>
   The funeral this week brought together the splintered reformers
for the first time since the murder last year of St. Petersburg's
deputy mayor. Former Prime Minister Yegor Gaidar stood with the
Yabloko Party leader, Grigory Yavlinsky, to hear their onetime ally
Anatoly Chubais hurl defiance at the intimidators.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper Izvestia charged that ``not one high-profile
contract killing has been solved. Nazis, multiplying like
plague-ridden rats, encounter no rebuke.'' Another paper, Trud,
published a list of unsolved murders beneath the headline ``Under
personal control of the president'' _ deriding Boris Yeltsin's
usual assumption of command followed by no action.
</P>
<P>
   The FSB (formerly the KGB) is supposedly investigating. But the
oligarch Boris Berezovsky, surrounded by former FSB goons, charged
recently that the FSB had ordered his murder; that organization
counter-charged that the former goons now around Berezovsky had
been involved in contract killings.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin _ always dying, never dead _ has all but abdicated rule
to Yevgeny Primakov. That prime minister cannot be bothered with
political crime; he is too busy denouncing America and Britain for
daring to threaten Saddam Hussein, and sending new reactors and
technicians to help Iran become a nuclear power despite feeble
Clinton protests. (That's the old spymaster's way of thanking the
U.S. for supplying thousands of tons of free grain to starving
Russians this winter.)
</P>
<P>
   How can we help the embattled reformers in Russia? Certainly not
by pouring more monetary aid down its banking system's drain. In
Washington this week, Vladimir Gusinsky, a media baron supporting
democrats in next year's Duma elections, denied that Russia's
nouveau riche spirited some $66 billion out of the country in the
last four years. But not even an oligarch thinks an infusion of
Western money would fix the anarchy in which assassins thrive.
</P>
<P>
   Without condescension, we should offer to share with the
Russians our experience in combating organized crime. Our federal
agents and big-city cops know how mafias corrupt officials, and are
wise to the latest computer techniques in moving hot money to
foreign fronts. Some even remember how to induce rival gangs to
``go to the mattresses'' and destroy each other.
</P>
<P>
   The point to make to those Russian cops struggling to be honest
is that only a few generations ago America had to break the
underworld triangle of corrupt politicians, thieving financiers and
thugs for hire. We learned how to slice through cozy arrangements
by using an elite force recruited outside the establishment.
</P>

   In 1929, at the behest of a Chicago publisher, the newly elected
president, Herbert Hoover, sent in a team of agents to break up
Capone's violent politico-criminal empire.

   Eliot Ness of Cleveland headed an incorruptible force of a dozen

<P>
   CANCUN, Mexico _ When federal drug agents swept past puzzled
tourists this month to seize three luxury hotels that line the
powdery beaches of this Caribbean resort, it perhaps came as little
surprise that the police had found evidence linking such properties
to the biggest drug mafia in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   What was more startling were the questions that agents kept
posing about the man they suspected of being the mafia's silent
partner in the hotels. Over and over, they asked employees about
Mario Villanueva Madrid, the state governor and a member of
President Ernesto Zedillo's governing party.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're practically accusing me of being a trafficker!''
Villanueva protested, recounting how he immediately boarded a
private jet and flew to Mexico City to deny any financial ties to
the hotels and complain to some of Zedillo's senior aides.
</P>
<P>
   Despite those complaints, Mexican officials say Villanueva
continues to figure in a sweeping investigation of drug operations
in his state of Quintana Roo. But while one Mexican intelligence
report describes Villanueva as being ``implicated in the criminal
organization'' that has turned the state into one of the most
important conduits for cocaine being shipped to the United States,
the federal government has neither filed criminal charges against
him nor been able to contain his political counterattack.
</P>
<P>
   In a blunt challenge to federal officials, Villanueva has
demanded that they show what evidence they might have against him.
He has even fought publicly with leaders of Mexico's governing
party, presidential loyalists whom he and other hard-line governors
are challenging for control
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, because of Villanueva's allegiance to the old guard, the
police investigation is now much more than that: It has become an
electrifying test of Zedillo's ability to deal with challenges of
crime and politics that are multiplying in the governing
Institutional Revolutionary Party as the once-absolute authority of
the president erodes.
</P>
<P>
   The confrontation underscores both the rapid pace and
contradictory nature of Mexico's political evolution.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, most Mexican governors served at the president's
will. Messy problems in the provinces were often solved by their
dismissals, and Zedillo's predecessor, Carlos Salinas de Gortari,
forced the resignations of almost a dozen governors and
governors-elect after they ran into accusations ranging from
embezzlement to ballot theft.
</P>
<P>
   Zedillo has slowly committed himself to more modern rules of
greater autonomy for the elected leaders of the 31 states. But good
government has not necessarily followed from greater democracy. As
in Quintana Roo, the president's powers often still rest on a
criminal justice system that is deeply in crisis, and on a
political system that is still being born.
</P>
<P>
   For the time being, the federal authorities seem to be pursuing
their investigations in Quintana Roo with unusual vigor.
</P>
<P>
   They have seized several hotels worth $200 million that they
traced to the traffickers. They also shut down a private security
company at the Cancun airport that officials say the traffickers
used to safeguard drugs and even film the movements of visiting
federal agents.
</P>
<P>
   A senior Mexican official said the odds were better than even
that Villanueva would be indicted on conspiracy or other charges
after his term concludes in April. Under Mexico's constitution, a
governor cannot be prosecuted unless he is first impeached by the
federal Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just because he comes and says, `Look, I'm not guilty,' does
not mean that the thing ends there,'' the Mexican attorney general,
Jorge Madrazo, said in an interview. ``What I can't tell you is
whether I am going to indict Mario Villanueva.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   For his part, the governor insists that he is a modern leader
whose blunt speech is misunderstood in the mannerly world of Mexico
City politics. ``I am one of the few people in this country who
openly speak the truth,'' he said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   To the governor's political opponents in Quintana Roo
(pronounced ``kin-tah-nah ROW'') Villanueva is an authoritarian
masquerading as a reformer, a man who _ whatever his possible ties
to the drug trade _ has tossed political enemies in jail, set
unofficial records for corruption and fully earned the nickname El
Chueco, or ``The Crooked One.''
</P>
<P>
   As his jet banked over a stretch of rain forest to land on a
recent afternoon at Chetumal, the quiet state capital where he grew
up on the southern end of the Yucatan Peninsula, Villanueva
compared himself to another embattled politician, President
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the United States, if they want to drag you down, they
accuse you of illicit sex,'' he said. ``Whoever is not liked in
Mexico today gets accused of being a trafficker.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, as he drove through town in a Chevrolet Suburban,
Villanueva described his tenure as a period of growth that in some
ways mirrors his own rise from a poor peasant family up through the
ranks of the governing party, known as the PRI for its initials in
Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mario is an extraordinary politician,'' said Francisco Lopez
Mena, a notary who has represented him. ``He is very seductive in
his talk. He never says no.''
</P>
<P>
   As governor he has ruled with a heavy hand. After taking office
in 1993, he briefly imprisoned on corruption charges three PRI
politicians who had not cooperated fully with his election
campaign, and many other acts of petty repression have followed.
</P>
<P>
   Last December, the state police jailed an anti-government
organizer on defamation charges because he had distributed copies
of a Mexico City newspaper that carried a report about Villanueva's
purported drug ties. In July, a PRI politician had formally
complained to the federal government that the governor had ordered
gunmen to beat him.
</P>
<P>
   The governor denied that he had committed abuses. ``They want to
portray me as a man who lives outside the law, or that I am a
person that does not respect the rights of others, and it's just
not true,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Baldemar Dzul Noh, an opposition legislator in the Mexican
Congress said: ``He's very aggressive with anybody who disagrees
with him. He runs our state like a feudal plantation.''
</P>
<P>
   He and his closest friends control the state's main newspapers,
the state congress, the courts and the police. Several of his
political adversaries complained in interviews their phones are
tapped.
</P>
<P>
   By the standards of the old PRI, that kind of power was
unexceptional. But in 1995, stirrings of trouble began to attract
outside attention.
</P>
<P>
   In one case, a union leader in Cancun reported to federal
administrators that thousands of gallons of kerosene were being
diverted from the Cancun airport to refuel drug planes at
clandestine airstrips.
</P>
<P>
   A secret investigation followed, but before it could be
completed, the whistle-blower was killed in his Cancun garage.
State prosecutors eventually concluded that airport managers had
hired the assassin, according to newspaper reports that quoted the
state investigative file. But Villanueva's prosecutors never filed
charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was never any serious attempt to punish the guilty,''
said the union leader's widow, Dulce Maria Bustamante.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   Until the mid-1990s, Cancun had served Mexico's traffickers much
as other coastal resorts. It was a place to relax, to launder
profits and to take delivery of the occasional load of South
American cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   But after the police seized a tractor-trailer laden with cocaine
near Chetumal in 1995, a group of drug-enforcement agents,
including several military officers, traveled to Quintana Roo to
investigate further.
</P>
<P>
   In a secret July 1997 report to federal prosecutors, the
director of Mexico's anti-drug police, Lt. Col. Edgardo Cedillo
Gonzalez, outlined some explosive findings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Allow us to inform you that great quantities of drugs,
including cocaine, are being smuggled through Quintana Roo,
approximately four tons a week,'' states the report, a copy of
which was given to The New York Times by an opponent of the
governor. ``Among those implicated in the criminal organization is
the state governor, Mario Villanueva, alias `El Chueco.'''
</P>
<P>
   Police commanders were coordinating the drug shipments, the
report says, while the staff chemist at the local office of the
federal attorney general was employed by the traffickers to analyze
the purity of cocaine shipments. One Chetumal merchant was
routinely carrying cash bribes from the drug mafia directly to
Villanueva, the report says.
</P>
<P>
   The officer's report identifies the smuggler in charge in the
state as Ramon Alcides Magana. Mexican and U.S. officials say
Magana is a former army lieutenant and federal police officer who
went to work for the powerful trafficker, Amado Carrillo Fuentes,
as a bodyguard. He was promoted to manage Carrillo Fuentes'
operations in Cancun, shortly before pressure on the traffickers'
air routes prompted them to ship cocaine in speed boats into the
coastal marshes of Quintana Roo from Central America.
</P>
<P>
   Villanueva vigorously denied the accusations in the 1997 report,
emphasizing that enforcement of drug laws is a responsibility of
the federal government. ``We don't know what they do or where they
are,'' he said of the traffickers.
</P>
<P>
   When he first learned of the report, Villanueva said he flew
immediately to Mexico City to protest his innocence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I demand that you show me the files,'' he said he told
Madrazo, the attorney general. ``If I have something to do with
this, well, then investigate me!''
</P>
<P>
   Madrazo took the governor up on his offer. He had the special
prosecutor, Mariano Herran Salvatti, question Villanueva in detail
under oath for several hours.
</P>
<P>
   After that appearance, Villanueva told Mexican newspapers that
both Madrazo and Herran assured him that he had been cleared.
``They told me I was clean,'' he recalled, ``that there was nothing
on me.''
</P>
<P>
   But Herran told a different story.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no way that we could say Villanueva has been
exonerated, because only our investigation can determine that,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``To say he has nothing to do with drug trafficking just doesn't
correspond with what's happening.'' Herran continued, ``An
investigation with many lines of inquiry is under way, and at the
right moment the result will be made public.''
</P>
<P>
   As the investigations have broadened, the traffickers in
Quintana Roo have grown more brazen.
</P>
<P>
   Three times in the last year, officials said, Magana's gunmen
have kidnapped federal drug investigators. But when they made the
mistake of abducting an army lieutenant in a secret
narcotics-intelligence unit, they provoked a blow-torch response.
</P>
<P>
   Word of the kidnapping reached the defense minister, Gen.
Enrique Cervantes, just as the traffickers were starting to torture
the officer for information. According to officials familiar with
the incident, Cervantes flew into a fury. He sent one group of
soldiers, backed by armored personnel carriers, to surround
Magana's Mexico City home, trapping the trafficker's wife inside.
Then he sent three more planeloads of troops to Cancun, where they
started breaking down the doors of the traffickers' mansions.
</P>
<P>
   The raids turned up a trove of documents, Mexican and U.S.
officials said, including messages and notes that suggested that
state police officials had been alerting the traffickers about drug
agents' movements in Quintana Roo. The soldiers also found papers
to a car driven in Magana's escort convoy. It was registered with
the Quintana Roo police and assigned to Oscar Garcia Davila, whom
investigators identified as the leader of the lieutenant's
kidnappers.
</P>
<P>
   A year earlier, Garcia had been hired to command police
operations in Cancun and the northern part of the state only months
after he had been purged from the federal police for corruption.
</P>
<P>
   After the army's June raids in Cancun, federal investigators
announced that they had identified Garcia as Magana's security
chief, and said they had discovered a state police credential
indicating that he was still on active duty. He is now a fugitive.
</P>
<P>
   Villanueva, who still refers to Garcia by his first name, says
he knew nothing of his ties to the traffickers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did not know that Oscar was involved in that kind of
situation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the twilight of his six-year term, when most governors are
quietly preparing to retire or positioning themselves for another
job, Villanueva has been unusually busy.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, he became embroiled in a contretemps with U.S.
diplomats after the U.S. consul in Cancun complained that he had
been threatened by one of the governor's aides for complaining
about official foot-dragging in the investigation of the death of a
U.S. tourist.
</P>
<P>
   In June, Villanueva sent the state congress a package of
constitutional reforms, one of which sought to reduce the period in
which a public servant could be held accountable for crimes
committed during their time in office.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition deputies quickly dubbed it ``the impunity law.''
Faced with the prospect of an embarrassing debate that would focus
on his own political troubles, the governor quietly withdrew the
bill.
</P>
<P>
   Another attempt to safeguard his future ended in a noisy
confrontation _ this time with the leaders of his own party.
</P>
<P>
   When Villanueva encouraged several of his closest associates to
seek the PRI's nomination to succeed him as governor, the party's
national leadership blocked their candidacies. After weeks of
infighting, the nomination was finally won in a September primary
by Joaquin Hendricks Diaz, a former army officer who had been seen
as a dark horse.
</P>
<P>
   The prospect of his governorship does not bode well for
Villanueva. Relations between the two have been cool since 1995,
when Hendricks, as the PRI's state president, displayed an
independent streak that enraged the governor, several members of
the party said.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, Hendricks noticed plainclothes police officers outside his
home. Then a friend reported that the governor had ordered his
arrest.
</P>
<P>
   Panicked, Hendricks crawled into the trunk of a car and fled
Chetumal with one of his relatives at the wheel.
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, the two men reconciled. And after Hendricks won
the PRI nomination this fall, the governor expressed support for
his candidacy. But Villanueva's frustrations with Mexico City
boiled over soon afterward.
</P>
<P>
   In a rambling, late-night speech last month to Quintana Roo's
PRI leaders, he accused both the party's national president,
Mariano Palacios, and its secretary general, Carlos Rojas, for
meddling in the state's affairs. In remarks that made headlines
around the country, he demanded an apology from Palacios and a
resignation from the leader's deputy.
</P>
<P>
   Rojas shot right back. Noting that Villanueva had garbled
Hendricks' name in the speech, he insinuated that the governor was
drunk when he delivered it. ``He was not in the best of
conditions,'' Rojas told reporters. Villanueva denied the
accusation.
</P>
<P>
   Were prosecutors to recommend bringing charges against
Villanueva, it would pose an agonizing choice for Zedillo.
</P>
<P>
   Dropping the case could weaken his authority. But pursuing it
aggressively might create new turmoil in the PRI just a year before
crucial national elections.
</P>
<P>
   Villanueva said he was not worried about the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``I abide by the law, and if something wrong has been done in my
administration, I'll take responsibility,'' he said. ``If they want
to put me on trial, there are lawyers who can manage things in
courts.''

<P>
   Don't look for elves in the full-price stores this year.
</P>
<P>
   Building on a trend that started a few years ago, discount
merchandisers are winning the nation's shopping wars, cashing in on
consumers' growing appetite for bargains. And they are likely to
keep their edge right through the Christmas and Hanukkah frenzy, at
the expense of old-line department stores and some specialty
chains.
</P>
<P>
   ``Price seems to be the only thing that people are responding
to,'' said Thomas Burns, senior vice president at the Doneger
Group, a retail consulting company.
</P>
<P>
   From all indications, shoppers are not planning to spend less
this year, despite the whipsawing of the stock market and fears
that the economy may be slowing. But they are trying to stretch
what they spend a little further, and they are changing the mix,
often buying smaller, inexpensive items coupled with a few
big-ticket purchases.
</P>
<P>
   Anne-Marie Kern, armed with shopping list and credit cards,
often heads first for the Prime Outlets at Kenosha mall in
Wisconsin, halfway between Milwaukee and Chicago on Lake Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Ms. Kern, a sports marketing executive in Chicago,
picked up a pair of insulated ski gloves there for her brother,
along with some cookware and holiday wreaths. She saved about $50,
she said, making the hour's drive worth the effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``It helps with the budget,'' she said, adding that she will buy
gifts for herself later, when the post-holiday sales are in full
swing.
</P>
<P>
   Shoppers like Ms. Kern have already given discounters a lift.
Through August, Commerce Department data show, sales in discount
department stores rose 9.8 percent from the corresponding period
last year, compared with a 3.5 percent gain for conventional
department stores and a 1.2 percent decline for chain stores,
including specialty retailers like Ann Taylor, the Gap, Barnes &AMP;
Noble, Abercrombie &AMP; Fitch and Toys ``R'' Us.
</P>
<P>
   Three leading discounters, Wal-Mart, Kmart and Target, dominate
the field, accounting for 75 percent of total sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's going to be a very promotional season,'' Burns
said. ``Some of the sales are breaking even sooner than ever, even
before the decorations are up.''
</P>
<P>
   Why is discounting the nation's hottest retail story?
</P>
<P>
   Mainly it is because more and more discount chains are
transforming themselves into one-stop shopping meccas. By expanding
product offerings and adding services, they can now fill all manner
of customer needs.
</P>
<P>
   These days, ``a higher-income consumer who may shop at a
Nordstrom will also shop at a Target for basic needs,'' said
Richard Church, an analyst at Salomon Smith Barney.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have gradually realized that for certain types of
merchandise, you don't need to spend full retail price,'' Church
added. Shopping at discount stores for some basic items also
``frees up a few more discretionary dollars that they can spend in
other areas.''
</P>
<P>
   Available products run the gamut from the old standbys _ health,
beauty and personal care products, plus a smattering of small
appliances and toys _ to food and other grocery items, as well as
an expanded selection of toys, sporting goods, linens, housewares,
electronics and auto care items. Some even offer their own
store-brand labels and other merchandise they sell exclusively,
plus services like banking, vision care, shoe repair and
photography.
</P>
<P>
   Convenience and pricing make discounters popular not just with
lower-income customers, analysts say, but also with a growing
number of older, generally thrifty shoppers. And the discounters'
efforts to add to the number of trendy products lining their
shelves, like fluted goblets, candles and aromatherapy oils, is
also helping them attract customers.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>

</P>
<P>
   On her first trip last week to the Target store in the Palisades
Center mall, which opened in February in West Nyack, N.Y., Debbie
Carilli, of Larchmont, quickly loaded her cart with a trove of
holiday gift items. These included a gold-painted basket, red and
green plaid placemats, candleholders, several rolls of gift wrap
and blue dessert plates and matching mugs, decorated with snowmen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came for the dishes,'' said Ms. Carilli, who had received a
flyer in the mail.
</P>
<P>
   She has tried other shopping methods in past years, like buying
prewrapped gifts and using personal shoppers, but at Target she
said, ``The value was great.'' And she happily confided the prices
she was about to pay. The plates and a portable vacuum cleaner she
was buying for herself. But the basket, an unexpected find, and the
placemats would be included in a gift of pasta and other cooking
items that she was putting together for her father-in-law.
</P>
<P>
   The store's mix of such small items fit well with Ms. Carilli's
plans to buy ``lots of little things'' to create more personal
gifts this year. And she said that after going to Target, the first
discount store she had ever shopped in, she would definitely be
back.
</P>
<P>
   Discounters are also benefiting from a shift in spending,
analysts say. Consumers are laying out less on clothing, and the
most sought-after gifts are toys, like the latest Holiday Barbie,
Furby or Teletubbies. The newest Nintendo and Play Station game
disks are popular, and cellular phones, Palm Pilots or other
consumer electronic devices top many must-have lists.
</P>
<P>
   As John McCormack of New Hyde Park, N.Y., watched his 6-year-old
grandson, Neil Francis of Pearl River, try out the latest Nintendo
game in Target's electronics department, his wife, Eileen, was a
few feet away trying on a sweater. She had already bought a
horse-riding Barbie as a gift for Neil's 7-year-old cousin.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're just overwhelmed by the amount of stuff they have for
children,'' McCormack said of the store, adding that he and his
wife had been discount shoppers for years.
</P>
<P>
   Although they have not reined in their spending as a result of
the stock market's gyrations this year, he said: ``We like the
discount stores. I think the prices are better. We definitely buy
clothing in the department stores, but buy most other items in
discount stores.''
</P>
<P>
   Sales at stores open more than a year, considered the best gauge
of a retailer's strength, fell 1 percent at department stores in
the third quarter but rose 7.2 percent for discounters, according
to Salomon Smith Barney.
</P>
<P>
   Although discounters' growth may be slowing _ in the first
quarter, sales rose an even stronger 8.2 percent _ the convenience
offered by their vast array of merchandise will help them continue
to gain ground against traditional department stores, said Dan
Barry, an analyst at Merrill Lynch.
</P>
<P>
   Although the end of the year is a big season for discounters,
many do not rely heavily on the last-minute shopping spree to
clinch the year's fortunes. But for department stores and other
mall-based chains, Christmas often means the difference between
ending the year with a substantial profit and ending with a loss.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, despite the crowds that 11th-hour shopping promises,
many consumers are more than willing to wait out department store
executives in anticipation of those final, alluring markdowns.
</P>
<P>
   Federated Department Stores, a leading chain, takes in about 60
percent of its revenues in the fourth quarter, Church of Salomon
Smith Barney said. By comparison, Target, which is owned by Dayton
Hudson Corp., makes about 39 percent and Wal-Mart about 33 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Wal-Mart is anticipating about a 5 percent increase in sales in
the fourth quarter, said Michael Maher, a spokesman. ``Right now,
we're on track for another record quarter.''
</P>
<P>
   The addition of grocery products in Wal-Mart's ``superstores''
has drawn customers in more often throughout the year, reducing its
reliance on holiday shopping, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to lift holiday sales, this season Wal-Mart's
trademark greeters will also offer young children suggestions of
inexpensive gifts they can buy for family and friends. In late
December, Wal-Mart will also offer a gift package linked to the
movie ``Prince of Egypt.''
</P>
<P>
   At Kmart, which relies heavily on promotions to bring in
customers and makes about half its sales in the fourth quarter, the
holiday season takes on added importance.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's critical,'' said Robert Burton, Kmart's vice president
for investor relations. ``It's a tremendous source of the year's
profitability,'' he said, adding that the company was ``cautiously
optimistic,'' expecting comparable-store sales to increase 3 to 5
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Target anticipates a 4 to 6 percent increase in the quarter, a
spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
   The chain continues to distinguish itself from competitors and
attract more affluent shoppers than most discounters, analysts say,
by focusing on stocking a number of trendy items popular with
consumers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a trend department, so you'll see the latest apparel
trends, such as cargo pants,'' said Susan Eich, a spokeswoman. ``We
also have the silver influence in everything from candlesticks,
charger plates to jewelry.''
</P>
<P>
   And these days, most shoppers crossing the threshold of a
discount store do not leave emptyhanded.
</P>
<P>
   Anna Filomio and Laura Cimini, neighbors from Hawthorne, N.Y.,
sat in the Palisades Center mall's main food court, with the day's
haul of toys, books and housewares overflowing the chairs next to
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key is to find something cost-effective that looks like
more than you paid for it, so they're not going to stick it in a
closet,'' Ms. Cimini said. Both women said they planned to buy a
mix of small items, mainly from discount stores, along with a few
more expensive gifts like American Girl collector dolls.

IMF AGREES TO RESUME PAKISTAN AID, CUT OFF AFTER ATOM TESTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The International Monetary Fund agreed Wednesday to
resume assistance to Pakistan, which had been cut off earlier this
year after it detonated nuclear devices.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement, announced in Islamabad, followed a decision by
the United States to support the fund's resumption of aid to
Pakistan, which has been on the verge of defaulting on its
international debts. It came a week before Prime Minister Nawaz
Sharif is to meet with President Clinton in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The deal, which requires approval by the fund's board, will
unlock up to $1.3 billion in aid that will be paid in installments
starting as early as next month. Pakistan's government and fund
officials said the deal should enable the country to continue
making payments on its $32 billion foreign debt and avoid falling
further into poverty at a time when much of Asia has been battered
by financial turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the fund's headquarters in Washington said the
agreement called for the reactivation of an existing loan program
that was suspended last spring after Pakistan responded to nuclear
tests by India with detonations of its own devices. Fund officials
declined to provide further details of the pact.
</P>
<P>
   But officials from Pakistan's finance ministry told a news
conference in Islamabad that the government had agreed to a series
of economic steps to open up the IMF financing. It agreed to
increase the sales tax to raise revenues, to make unspecified
spending cuts to reduce the budget deficit and to other measures to
fight corruption and strengthen the banking system.
</P>
<P>
   Officials also suggested that the fund would support Pakistan's
efforts to reschedule payment terms for some of its short-term
loans from foreign governments and banks. Pakistan said it also
expected aid from the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Fund officials said the negotiations got a boost earlier this
week when Pakistan agreed to back down from demands it had made to
privately owned power companies to renegotiate electricity purchase
agreements at lower rates.
</P>
<P>
   Since the tests last spring, the United States, which sees the
rivalry between Pakistan and India as the world's most dangerous
arms race, has pressed the two countries to limit their nuclear
weapons programs. The leaders of both countries said at the United
Nations in September that they would put a moratorium on further
tests and comply with the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty by
September 1999.
</P>
<P>
   But despite pressure from Washington and the U.N. Security
Council, neither India nor Pakistan has promised to forgo
deployment of nuclear weapons or join a moratorium on the future
production of fissile material for warheads.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Washington has kept some sanctions in place,
including trade restrictions imposed last week on India and
Pakistan. The restrictions apply to 300 companies and government
agencies in the two countries that are involved in nuclear, missile
and military programs, and in effect bar sales to them by any U.S.
company.

GOVERNMENT OF CENTRIST TURKISH PRIME MINISTER IS VOTED OUT 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 BY STEPHEN KINZER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISTANBUL, Turkey _ The government of Prime Minister Mesut
Yilmaz, plagued since its inception 17 months ago by competing
pressures from Islamic groups and the rigidly secular military,
lost a vote of confidence in Parliament and fell Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The 314-214 vote came after Yilmaz was implicated in a
corruption scandal in which he is said to have helped gangsters buy
a state-owned bank. He has denied all charges against him.
</P>
<P>
   President Suleyman Demirel was expected to ask Yilmaz to stay on
as prime minister until an interim government can be formed to take
the country to an early election in April. But with both Turkey's
center-right and center-left parties divided by bitter rivalries,
there seemed little prospect that a stable government could emerge
from the election.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the military is likely to retain ultimate political
power here. Its commanders view themselves as the final bulwark
against religious fundamentalism. Critics, however, say their
political role restricts the growth of democracy.
</P>
<P>
   After two years of spectacular revelations about ties between
criminals and successive Turkish governments, many Turks have
become deeply cynical about politics. Some believe that supporting
the Islamic party is the best way to show their disgust with the
political establishment. Military commanders, however, may not
allow the party to come to power even if it wins the election.
</P>
<P>
   Yilmaz had sought to ease military-backed restrictions on
Islamic symbols, which he evidently believed were too strict and
risked creating a political backlash. He urged the military to stop
insisting that female university students be forbidden to wear head
scarves, but powerful generals quickly slapped him down. Similar
conflicts are likely to afflict the next government.
</P>
<P>
   Demirel could name an interim prime minister within a few days.
According to press reports, leading candidates include Hikmet
Cetin, the speaker of parliament, and former Prime Minister Bulent
Ecevit.
</P>
<P>
   During his term of office, Yilmaz managed to bring Turkey's
inflation rate down from nearly 100 percent annually to about 77
percent. Negotiations with the International Monetary Fund on an
economic package for 1999 were to have begun Friday in New York,
but were canceled Wednesday. Gunes Taner, the Cabinet minister who
was to have led Turkey's delegation, was implicated in the
corruption scandal that brought down the government.
</P>
<P>
   Human rights violations continued during Yilmaz's term, but
apparently decreased steadily. The human rights organization
Amnesty International recently praised the steps he took to curb
abuses.
</P>
<P>
   Although Yilmaz was not able to push through major reforms to a
political system that many Turks believe is encrusted and
self-centered, he will be remembered as the prime minister on whose
watch the country's most-wanted fugitive was captured. The
fugitive, Abdullah Ocalan, who leads a rebel army that has been
fighting for a Kurdish homeland in southeastern Turkey, is in
custody in Italy.
</P>
<P>
   Although Yilmaz is perceived as pro-Western, Turkey's relations
with Europe deteriorated during his term. After the European Union
refused to name Turkey as a candidate for membership last year,
Yilmaz reacted with a bitterness that alienated some European
leaders. Relations seemed to be improving until the capture of
Ocalan last month. When Italian leaders refused to extradite him
for trial in Turkey, Yilmaz and other Turks accused Italy of
embracing terrorism and threatened it with an economic boycott.
</P>
<P>
   The Yilmaz government was fragile from the start, depending on
the support of Deniz Baykal, a power broker who controls a faction
in Parliament but declined to join the ruling coalition. When
Baykal withdrew his support several weeks ago, the government's
fate was sealed.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Baykal acted after a series of charges that cast doubt on the
government's integrity. The charges stemmed from a complex scandal
that has been spreading for the last two years. It is centered
around allegations that Turkish leaders have for years maintained
ties to gangsters, using them to commit political murders and
allowing them in return to smuggle drugs and weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The charge that brought down the government Wednesday was based
on testimony from an alleged Turkish crime boss who is being held
in France. He released audiotapes suggesting that Yilmaz and Taner
helped one of his front men buy a bank from the government.
</P>
<P>
   Yilmaz was installed in June 1997 after the military pressured
Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan, leader of the Islamic party, into
resigning from office. But his government was not able to agree on
a strategy to counter rising Islamic influence here. Polls suggest
that if an election were held today, the Islamic party would finish
strongly and perhaps even in first place, as it did in the last
election in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of secular parties are expected to try to patch together
an electoral alliance in the hope of heading off another victory by
the Islamic party.
</P>
<P>
   Yilmaz has said he will campaign on the strength of his
government's economic successes and its role in the capture of
Ocalan. He is also anxious to clear his name.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be the people who will very soon make the real
judgment about our government,'' he said after Wednesday's vote.

NESTLE SALES SLUMP IN RUSSIA AND ASIA, SLOWING PROFIT GROWTH 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By JOHN TAGLIABUE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ Nestle A.G., the Swiss food giant, has become the latest
European company to feel the bite of the emerging-markets meltdown,
announcing Wednesday that collapsing sales in Russia and Asia will
drastically slow profit growth this year.
</P>
<P>
   Nestle, known in the United States for Taster's Choice coffee
and Perrier mineral water, said food sales in its Africa, Asia and
Australia regions had slumped by 8.7 percent in the first 10 months
of the year, to 10 billion francs, or $7.1 billion, compared with
sales in the period a year earlier. In Russia, sales plummeted by
30 percent, though Nestle gave no sales figure. In July, Nestle
reported that sluggish sales in Japan and Brazil, markets that had
shown abundant recent promise, coupled with a stronger Swiss franc
were clouding its growth outlook.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference at its headquarters in Vevey, Switzerland,
Nestle said global revenue in the first 10 months rose by 4
percent, to 59.2 billion Swiss francs, or $42.1 billion, from 56.9
billion francs in the period a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   More seriously, Nestle said commitments in Russia to deliver
products at dollar prices calculated before the ruble's 60 percent
plunge in value against the dollar would cut into earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Brabeck, who took over last year as Nestle's chief
executive, said that higher interest rates in Latin America would
also weigh on earnings. He added, however, that continued robust
demand for Nestle products in the United States and Western Europe
would help offset the downward trend elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   The results demonstrated how tricky it is becoming to keep a
global giant like Nestle on course in the turbulence of recent
months.
</P>
<P>
   Mario Corti, Nestle's chief financial officer, said that the
vast Russian market, where Nestle had predicted it would generate
sales this year of 1 billion francs, or $711 million, had remained
strong through June. ``Then, it fell out of bed,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Nestle's misfortunes in Russia were amplified by inadequate
hedging against the ruble's sharp drop against the dollar, the
currency on which Nestle bases its business there, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Investors punished the company by selling its shares, pushing
the share price on the Zurich market down by more than 4 percent,
to 2,990 Swiss francs, or $2,126.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But analysts' reactions to the news were mixed. Nestle reported
that real internal growth, or growth in revenue excluding
acquisitions, divestments and changes in sale prices and exchange
rates, was 4.6 percent. Rene Weber, who follows Nestle at Bank
Vontobel in Zurich, called that figure ``rather good,'' given that
most analysts' estimates were about 4 percent. But estimates of
earnings growth for the full year, he said, which had been about 9
percent, ``have now gone back actually to zero.''
</P>
<P>
   Nestle said it expected sales of more than 70 billion francs, or
$49.7 billion, in the full year. Brabeck said that he expected real
internal growth for the full year to reach 4 percent and that
profit growth would ``slightly exceed'' that figure. Vontobel's
Weber said internal growth would be lower than total sales growth
because of the exclusion of Spillers, a British pet food company
that Nestle acquired earlier this year for $1.16 billion, but which
he termed a ``good long-term investment.''
</P>
<P>
   Brabeck said Nestle was taking ``energetic measures'' to counter
the crises in Asia and Russia, including such ``back to basics''
steps as introducing lower-priced products, developing new
distribution channels and reviewing costs. Nestle, he said, had
closed 10 factories thus far this year, including four in Latin
America and one in Asia.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In 1906 Dr. Frederick A. Cook took a photograph that
made him famous and ultimately became perhaps the most
controversial picture in the history of exploration. Now a
historian has found the original, uncropped version of the picture,
and it does not look good for Cook.
</P>
<P>
   A cropped version, captioned ``The Top of Our Continent,'' was
published in 1908 with Cook's account of how he had braved
avalanches and ice cliffs to make the first ascent of Mount
McKinley, the highest peak in North America. Cook described himself
and his companion, Edward Barrill, as ``near the limit of human
endurance'' _ exhausted, freezing, gasping for oxygen _ when they
reached the Alaskan summit at 20,320 feet above sea level.
</P>
<P>
   ``At last!'' Cook wrote. ``The soul-stirring task was crowned
with victory. The top of the continent was under our feet.'' After
describing the vista of clouds and peaks spread out below, he
exulted in the ``most impressive'' memory taken from the peak:
``the final picture which I took of Barrille'' _ as Cook misspelled
the name _ ``with the flag lashed to his ax, as the Arctic air
froze the impression into a relief which no words can tell.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert M. Bryce has two words for that image, and they are Fake
Peak. Bryce, the author of the most exhaustive study of Cook's
career, has analyzed a newly discovered print made from Cook's
negative showing geographical features in the background that were
cropped when Cook published the photograph. Bryce concludes that
the photograph was taken on a small promontory 15,000 feet below
the McKinley summit, at barely 5,000 feet above sea level, about
the altitude of Denver.
</P>
<P>
   This finding confirms the suspicions of Cook's critics, who long
ago accused him of faking the McKinley summit picture and
identified the site known as Fake Peak. But there were so few
details visible in the picture published by Cook that it was
difficult to determine exactly where it was taken until Bryce found
the full print.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think Cook ever had any intention of going to the
summit,'' Bryce said. ``From all the evidence, it looks as if Cook
didn't go any higher than 5,000 feet on this McKinley trip. He
apparently spotted this feature that he thought he could pass off
as the summit, and it was easy to stage the photograph because
Barrill had to climb only a few hundred feet above the glacier
floor.''
</P>
<P>
   Bryce found the photograph in papers of Cook that were donated
recently to the polar archives at Ohio State University. Bryce, the
author of a 1997 book, ``Cook and Peary,'' a 1,100-page account of
Cook's rivalry with Robert E. Peary, published his analysis of the
photograph in the current issue of DIO, a journal devoted to the
history of science and exploration.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have been arguing about Cook on McKinley for 90
years,'' said Dennis Rawlins, the journal's publisher and a
historian of the Arctic. ``This is the single biggest find, because
it proves positively from Cook's own camera that he was lying.''
</P>
<P>
   The controversy has endured because it was the McKinley claim
that made Cook's reputation and eventually ruined his name during
his fight with Robert Peary. Cook's apparent success on McKinley
promptly won him support for an expedition to the North Pole, from
which he returned triumphantly in 1909.
</P>
<P>
   More than 100,000 people turned out in Brooklyn for a parade
welcoming him home. Icicles dripped from a huge triumphal arch
above Bushwick Avenue adorned with a sign, ``We believe in you.''
Cook had been accused of faking his North Pole trip by Robert
Peary, who had also just returned with his own claim on the Pole,
but the public was on Cook's side.
</P>
<P>
   He was seen as the romantic underdog, a charming Brooklynite who
had climbed McKinley and reached the pole largely on his own. Peary
was the establishment figure, a dour man backed by Manhattan
millionaires and the National Geographic Society, who had relied on
an army of Inuits for his Arctic exploration.
</P>
<P>
   But the Peary forces won the public-relations war by tracking
down rumors about the McKinley climb. The New York Globe &AMP;
Commercial Advertiser, whose publisher was the president of the
club of Peary patrons, published an affidavit from Barrill
explaining the photo hoax and declaring that he and Cook had never
climbed McKinley.
</P>
<P>
   ``Smashed is Dr. Cook,'' declared The Globe. ``The similarities
between the Mount McKinley hoax and the North Pole hoax are readily
discernible.'' The New York Times, which had sponsored Peary's
expedition, joined in the attack on Cook. The news caused The New
York Herald, which had sponsored Cook's expedition, to mute its
support for the doctor, and Peary was generally acknowledged as the
only one to reach the North Pole.
</P>
<P>
   Today most historians believe that both explorers were lying.
Peary is thought to have gotten closer to the pole, but not all the
way. Cook is generally thought to have reached neither the pole nor
the McKinley summit.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Explorers have known about Fake Peak since 1910, when an
expedition found it by following Barrill's directions. But because
it has been impossible to duplicate Cook's photograph precisely,
due to changed snow conditions and an earthquake that dislodged
some rocks from the promontory, Cook's defenders continued to
maintain that it was not the same place photographed by the doctor.
</P>
<P>
   The Cook photograph uncovered by Bryce reveals new background
details that precisely match those at the site of Fake Peak, such
as a nearby cliff and a distant peak, Mount Grosvenor. Now even
Cook's supporters acknowledge that the doctor might not have been
telling the truth, although they are still not ready to abandon
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's fairly strong evidence that the photograph wasn't
taken at the summit,'' said Ted Heckathorn, a member of the Cook
Society, a group with headquarters in Sullivan County, N.Y., that
is dedicated to defending the explorer's reputation. ``But even if
it wasn't, that doesn't prove he couldn't have climbed to the
summit anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Few historians or explorers share that view. ``Cook's account of
his climb is utterly ridiculous,'' said Bradford Washburn, the
retired director of the Boston Science Museum, who has mapped Mount
McKinley and climbed it three times, and has published an analysis
of Cook's diary and photographs. ``The tragedy is that he would
have been remembered as a good explorer if he'd just truthfully
reported what he accomplished near McKinley. But the Devil took him
up on to a mount, and the doctor listened.''

LITTLE IMMEDIATE INTEREST IN PATRIOTS' LUXURY BOXES 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   The use of luxury boxes and other premium seating is a key part
of the financing for the $280 million stadium proposed for the New
England Patriots in Hartford, Conn., but interviews with about a
dozen top companies in the state reveal little immediate interest
in helping the taxpayers in Connecticut foot the bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our overall sports sponsorship has been trimmed back and we
don't pay for luxury boxes,'' said IBM's John Buchholz. ``We looked
at it across the board, and we just decided to do other things for
corporate meetings and functions.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Tenneco said the company is reorganizing and any
such plans are on hold for the long term.
</P>
<P>
   And even some of the companies that stadium proponents assert
will be prime players in purchasing the boxes and seats say they
would prefer to wait and see.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's inappropriate to speculate on how we might
approach this at this point,'' said Fred LaBerge, corporate
spokesman for the insurance firm Aetna, which is located in
Hartford. ``At the same time, when it comes to promoting special
causes around Hartford, we have been in the forefront of providing
support.''
</P>
<P>
   In interviews with 10 of 18 of Connecticut's Fortune 500
companies, and other interviews with an additional group of law
firms and public relations agencies, revealed only one company and
a law firm immediately pledging to buy a luxury box. But both the
the company and the firm are closely tied to the redevelopment of
Hartford, and the stadium is a major part of that. Phoenix Home
Life Mutual, is chaired by Robert Fiondella, a major driving force
behind the stadium plans and the revitalization of Hartford. And
Peter Kelly, a partner in the law firm, Updike, Kelly and Spellacy,
is a former chairman of the state's convention center authority.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to buy a box and split it with another firm,''
Kelly said. ``I think the corporate support will be very
significant. I don't think that there'll be one corporate box empty
in that stadium.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Virtually every company I talked to is considering taking a
box,'' Fiondella said. ``The reaction I've had is that people will
support it.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the Patriots, they are ideally positioned. If they sell
do not sell all of the seats, they still reap a significant profit
from them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the state is very comfortable that the businesses in
the state will get behind this, and that is why the deal is
structured like it is,'' said Jonathan Kraft, Patriots vice
president. ``It was a risk they thought we could manage.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we know nothing about the business community in
Connecticut,'' Kraft said. ``We know about the New England football
fans in general and we know about Boston, and the businesses in our
area. So, we said to them, `You have to make us comfortable.' ''
</P>
<P>
   A variety of sources in sports and business say that for reasons
of geography and a lack of experience in dealing with professional
sports teams, the Connecticut market for luxury boxes and other
preferred seats will be hard to crack.
</P>
<P>
   Some point to the state's only other experience with a major,
professional sports franchise _ the National Hockey League's
Hartford Whalers _ as evidence of a lack of support for such
spending.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd say it's going to be a big challenge,'' said Thomas
Gutteridge, dean of the University of Connecticut School of
Business Administration. ``When we lost the NHL franchise, the
Whalers, that was a big part of it, the lack of corporate support.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the state is kind of balkanized,'' Gutteridge said.
``And it is a real challenge to get people in Connecticut to think
of it as Connecticut, as opposed to southwestern Connecticut, or
southeastern Connecticut, or Hartford.''
</P>
<P>
   By any measure, the sale of the high-end seating is a crucial
component of the stadium deal now under review in Hartford.
</P>
<P>
   The state is offering to pay for the entire $350 million stadium
project, which includes infrastructure improvements and parking.
The debt payment is expected to be $25 million per year for 30
years, state officials say. To help finance the deal, the state
expects to collect about $12.2 million in annual revenue from the
operation of the stadium and income taxes on the team at the
beginning of the deal, and more as time goes on.
</P>
<P>
   According to the state, those high-end seats will generate $4.5
million at the beginning of the deal, while the general seating
will result in only $2.7 million.
</P>
<P>
   Dean Pagani, the spokesman for Rowland, said that the state has
banked heavily on businesses picking up the tab for luxury boxes
and premium seats Financing of the guaranteed payment to Kraft is
not included as part of the current plans to finance the $350
million deal. ``It would be an additional cost,'' Pagani said.
</P>
<P>
   But if the state has to pay Kraft for a share those seats _ an
arrangement guaranteed by the memorandum of understanding signed by
Kraft and Roland last week, not only would the revenue projection
have to be slashed _ it could end up costing the state up to $17.5
million a year to pay for the boxes and seats.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, as the financing of the stadium continues over a 30
year period, the state is assuming that the revenue from those
seats will eventually grow to $25 million per year, as more and
more companies spend increasing amounts.
</P>
<P>
   It is clear that without significant support from corporate
Connecticut, the state and the taxpayer will foot the financial
burden for the stadium project _ the only one proposed for the NFL
that includes taxpayers money for the purchase of luxury boxes and
seats.
</P>
<P>
   While some Connecticut officials like Speaker of the House
Thomas Ritter are assuming that the state's guarantee to Kraft on
the high-end seats will never be implemented because businesses
will gobble up the seats, others are less than sure. Indeed,
several observers were unanimous in saying that the very fact that
the guarantee is in the memorandum of understanding between Kraft
and Roland indicates Kraft's concern that the boxes may not sell.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is a real comment on the market that they are
entering into that the deal contains the provision for the state
picking up those tickets,'' said Boston lawyer Lyman G. Bullard
Jr., a nationally known specialist in sports law. ``It clearly
reflects Kraft's concern that Hartford is just not really up to the
task of attracting the corporate support he needs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the assumption there is that they're going to have to
go down to Fairfield County, to Giants and Jets country, to attract
the support, and that is going to be a tough sell.''
</P>
<P>
   Other observers say that corporate support for the stadium is so
uncertain in Connecticut that the Boston-area and even Providence,
R.I. must continue to heavily support the team if the revenue
projections are to work out.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be an interesting question to see whether Boston firms
support the team if it moves,'' said Hal R. Tovin, director of
marketing for Citizens Financial Group, Inc. ``Citizens has a bank
operation in Connecticut and it is certainly something we will take
a look at.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard A. Higginbotham, president and chief executive officer
of Fleet Bank in Connecticut, said that the Boston-headquartered
bank is aggressive in using sports teams to market the company in
all of it locations, whether it is Boston, New York City or
Hartford.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do have a luxury box and some seasons tickets in
Foxborough,'' Higginbotham said. ``Absolutely, we will be
supportive in Hartford.''
</P>
<P>
   When a number of officials and businessmen involved with with
the stadium proposal are asked about the potential corporate for
support for the stadium, most react with a mixture of instinct,
prognostication and perhaps a little wishfulness. Despite the
state's gung-ho approach to its financing scheme, no one can
identify a specific study or any marketing research that says
companies will pay for the luxury boxes and premium seats. Jonathan
Kraft said that the team has already received a number of calls
about about luxury boxes and premium seating since the announcement
of the proposed deal, and the 10,000-seat waiting list for season
tickets has gown by 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two Boston companies I will not reveal have asked about the
boxes,'' Kraft said. ``It just shows that this really is not moving
the franchise. This is getting a new stadium in our territory.''

CINEMA THAT ROLLS WITH THE POLITICS  
(FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, NOV. 29)
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
B. Ruby Rich is the author of ``Chick Flicks: Theories and Memories
of the Feminist Film Movement,'' to be published this month by Duke
University Press. 
 By B. RUBY RICH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Brazil has long been proud of its place in world cinema. But
these days the country is quite simply film mad. Headlines appear
on the front pages of the major newspapers every time a Brazilian
film wins an international award or an Academy Award nomination.
</P>
<P>
   E-mail and the Internet are settings for debates over movies,
like the one that erupted last year when Bruno Barreto's ``Four
Days in September'' fueled complaints that it soft-pedaled Brazil's
years of military rule.
</P>
<P>
   Just as Brazilian films can be categorized according to which
regime was in power when they were being made, so too can Brazilian
governments be judged by the films with which they coincide, given
that the films are often receiving government subsidies.
</P>
<P>
   No sooner did the current president, Fernando Henrique Cardoso,
take office than he endorsed a pioneering film-finance program that
gives tax breaks to companies investing in Brazilian film
production. The Audio Visual Law, passed in 1994, is credited with
jump-starting Brazil's film industry after the previous president,
Collor DeMello, had withdrawn government support for the arts in
general and film in particular for four years.
</P>
<P>
   The late '90s are a time of great optimism for Brazil's movie
industry. Production is booming. According to Jose Carlos Avellar,
the director of Riofilme, a film distribution company, there are 40
films in the pipeline for release next year.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the tax law has given rise to new initiatives that
make filmmaking in Brazil even more viable. So many filmmakers have
been energized by this new climate that last spring, when the
Sundance Institute convened a filmmakers' workshop to help develop
new talent in Brazil, there were more than 150 submissions for a
dozen slots.
</P>
<P>
   It is with impeccable timing, then, that ``Cinema Novo and
Beyond,'' the largest retrospective of Brazilian cinema ever
mounted in the United States, opened this month at the Museum of
Modern Art. Organized by the museum in association with Riofilme
and the Brazilian Ministry of Culture, the program is presenting 59
features and 15 short films ranging over four decades.
</P>
<P>
   For those acquainted with the glory of Brazilian film from the
early '60s, the show is a dream come true; its sparkling new prints
restore a half-forgotten history to compelling visual splendor. For
those who have never known what they were missing, it's an
extravagant opportunity to catch up.
</P>
<P>
   And with the show also booked at major museums and film centers
throughout North America after it closes in New York on Jan. 22, it
is likely to shape the popular notion of Brazilian film for years
to come.
</P>
<P>
   The recent renaissance in Brazilian cinema has not been merely a
matter of money or political will. Nor is it a function of
worldwide attention, though certainly the international success of
``Central Station,'' which opened in the United States this month,
must reassure the politicians of the soundness of their financial
investment.
</P>
<P>
   Avellar links the current production renaissance to the dynamism
and invention of the 1960s film movement known as Cinema Novo,
which has served as both blueprint and inspiration for what could
be achieved.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the only way we could recover from zero like this in
only four years,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It was to Cinema Novo, too, that the thoughts of Jytte Jensen, a
film curator at the Modern, turned when she determined that there
was a need for such a show. She was just becoming aware of the new
films emerging from Brazil, but what dismayed her was the condition
of her favorite films from the '60s. ``I couldn't believe the
terrible state of those early films, which were barely surviving in
faded, worn-out prints,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Cinema Novo is the movement that put Brazil on the world cinema
map. Contemporaneous with the French New Wave, with which it shared
sources of inspiration, Cinema Novo was influenced equally by
Italian Neo-Realism and the great Russian director Sergei
Eisenstein.
</P>
<P>
   Dedicated to resisting the dominance of Hollywood, finding a
truly Brazilian cinematic style and exposing the unexplored lives
of real Brazilians in the favelas (slums) and the sertao
(drought-parched backlands), Cinema Novo filmmakers were possessed
by a cinematic fever.
</P>
<P>
   The films may have been dedicated to the principle of
``miserabilism,'' which illuminated the country's poverty, but they
translated their mission into the most gorgeous of spectacles in
shimmering black and white.
</P>
<P>
   In 1963-64, the release of three films set the terms of Cinema
Novo forever: Glauber Rocha's ``Black God, White Devil,'' Nelson
Pereira dos Santos' ``Barren Lives'' and Ruy Guerra's ``Guns.''
Rocha, the theorist of the movement, termed Cinema Novo's approach
``the esthetics of hunger.'' So it was.
</P>
<P>
   But there is a beauty that attends the long takes and
allegorical compositions, the shots of landscapes bereft of
vegetation and peasants bereft of hope. The starkly poetic images
in this tradition are as vivid now as then, but they're made even
more poignant by the realization of what a short life Cinema Novo
actually had as a coherent movement.
</P>
<P>
   April 1, 1964, is the key date. That's when a military coup
d'etat placed Brazil under a dictatorship that would last for 20
years. Immediately, Cinema Novo was transformed: some of its
directors went into exile, some found a low profile in advertising
or other fields, and some tried to work within the new constraints.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The movement itself mutated, spinning off marginal and
underground variations spiced with parody and experimentation. The
interesting films of this period tended to be heavily coded, with
political messages concealed under layers of melodrama, carnival or
romance.
</P>
<P>
   Joaquim Pedro de Andrade's ``Macunaima'' (1969) popularized the
so-called ``cannibalist'' movement with its tongue-in-cheek call
for an unapologetic consumption of the foreign. In his study,
``Tropical Multiculturalism,'' the scholar Robert Stam praised the
carnivalesque wit of ``Macunaima''and offered a citation from
Andrade's own manifesto: ``Cannibalism is an exemplary mode of
consumerism adopted by underdeveloped peoples.'' The film's use of
Rabelasian wit and brutally surrealist images made it an
unforgettable fable.
</P>
<P>
   Other masters of the early Cinema Novo pursued different
esthetic and political strategies. Carlos Diegues made one of the
most famous Brazilian films, ``Bye Bye Brazil,'' which placed two
of Brazil's most cherished myths into collision with one another:
the carnivalesque and the modern.
</P>
<P>
   As the past collided with the future in the journey of a troupe
of actors touring the countryside, Diegues fashioned the resulting
chaos into a critique. Leon Hirzman (an underrated member of the
Cinema Novo generation, with a trio of works in the retrospective)
made ``Sao Bernardo'' (1971), a devastating tale of a peasant who
transforms himself into a wealthy landowner at the cost of his own
soul.
</P>
<P>
   Its depiction of a violent and paranoid boss, who sees communism
behind every disagreement and retaliates with murder, reflected the
Brazilian people's experience of its own government in this period.
At the same time, the relationship between the violent Paulo and
his abused schoolteacher wife Madalena (played by the exquisite
Isabel Ribeiro) unfolds like a Shakespearean tragedy in its descent
into death, grief and madness.
</P>
<P>
   By November 1984, political change was beginning to sweep the
country and the Rio Film Festival was revived. Democracy was in the
air, a constitution was about to be ratified and the military was
preparing to step down. For this writer, seeing ``Twenty Years
Later,'' by Eduardo Coutinho, at that festival was transformative.
</P>
<P>
   Coutinho's film, about the murder of union organizer Joao Pedro
Teixeira, was buried by peasants at the time of the 1964 coup in
order to save it; 17 years later, he returned to the scene of the
crime and completed his movie.
</P>
<P>
   With the end of military rule in the '80s, Brazilian cinema,
emerging from years of repression, exploded into a movement that
one critic called a ``hunger for esthetics.''
</P>
<P>
   Suzana Amaral's powerfully moving ``Hour of the Star'' (1985),
based on a Clarice Lispector story, followed a poor woman from
northeast Brazil who comes to Sao Paulo. It's a film deeply rooted
in Brazil's internal migration to the metropolis. But this time
around, Ms. Amaral follows her anti-heroine Macabea through a
landscape littered with the detritus of popular culture, wasted
lives and urban dysfunction.
</P>
<P>
   The selection of work of the '90s at the Modern shows that the
Brazilian film revival is not a matter of hype but of deep-rooted
invention and cinematic reflection. High points range from
``Foreign Land,'' the early Walter Salles and Daniela Thomas opus
of Brazilian identity crisis abroad, to the work of two diasporic
Brazilians who have returned to make new work: Helena Solberg's
revisionist documentary ``Carmen Miranda, Bananas Is My Business''
(1995) and Jose Araujo's lyrical ode to the northeast Brazil,
``Landscape of Memories'' (1996).
</P>
<P>
   There are two themes that run throughout ``Cinema Novo and
Beyond,'' linking its past to its present. One concerns hunger and
appetite, scarcity and excess, as explored in Brazilian myth and
daily life. The other concerns journey and location, exile and
return, both internal and external, from the imported soldiers of
Os Fuzis and the itinerant prostitute of ``Iracema'' to the
displaced widow in ``Twenty Years After.''
</P>
<P>
   In Brazil, popular culture, daily life, the clash between the
modern and the primitive, all remain vital themes for a country
still discovering its own stories.

ADMIRAL ACCUSED OF STEERING CONTRACTS TO LOVER 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By STEVEN LEE MYERS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A one-star admiral serving at the Navy's
headquarters in the Pentagon has been relieved of his duties and
accused of improperly steering military contracts to a woman with
whom he was having an adulterous affair, Navy and defense officials
said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The officer, Rear Adm. John Scudi, is accused of violating the
Pentagon's ethics rules, as well as several other charges under the
Uniform Code of Military Justice, including obstruction of justice,
giving false statements and adultery.
</P>
<P>
   If formally charged in the military equivalent of grand jury
proceedings, Scudi would be only the second admiral to face
criminal charges since the Uniform Code of Military Justice was
enacted by Congress in 1951. The first case occurred in 1957 when a
rear admiral was convicted of homosexuality and sexual misconduct
and dismissed, according to the Navy.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the charges against Scudi _ including having an
adulterous affair and lying about it to investigators _ inevitably
echoed Kenneth Starr's accusations against President Clinton, which
have led to an impeachment inquiry that continues to roil the
House. Some Republicans have argued that discipline and morale in
the military have suffered because Clinton, as commander-in-chief,
is not subject to the same standards of moral behavior as soldiers
and officers.
</P>
<P>
   However, Navy and defense officials, who agreed to discuss the
accusations in more detail than usual for an on-going
investigation, said the charges involving extramarital sex were
secondary to those involving the unlawful awarding of government
contracts. Within the military justice system, adultery is rarely
prosecuted and, when it is, almost always accompanies other
accusations of criminal wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   The officials said Scudi, who as director of the Navy's offices
of privatization and base management oversaw the awarding of
millions of dollars in contracts, was accused of steering some
$150,000 in contracts over several years to a consulting firm owned
by the woman with whom he had a long-running affair. He did so, the
officials charged, without properly seeking competitive bids for
the work.
</P>
<P>
   Although he did not detail the accusations, Navy Secretary
Richard Danzig also highlighted the charges involving the awarding
of contracts. ``I'm struck by how this case involves questions
about impropriety with contractors,'' Danzig said in an interview
on CNN. ``And that means we need to pay special attention to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Scudi, 54, who is married, declined through a Navy spokesman to
comment on the accusations, some of which were first reported
Wednesday in The Washington Times.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy relieved Scudi of his duties in the Pentagon in August
and reassigned him to the Washington Navy Yard as the investigation
continued, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy has tentatively scheduled a preliminary hearing on the
charges for Dec. 14. During that hearing, known as an Article 32
hearing, a presiding officer will decide whether to hold a
court-martial.
</P>
<P>
   If convicted of all the charges, Scudi could face dismissal, a
loss of pay and benefits and a maximum of 11 and a half years in
prison.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Although charges involving adultery or fraternization remain
rare, the armed services have been buffeted in recent years by
cases involving sexual conduct.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, such accusations, especially against senior
officers, were usually handled quietly, with early retirements or
administrative punishments that stopped short of criminal charges.
In recent years, however, the handling of cases involving adultery
and other sexual behavior has received more scrutiny _ both inside
and outside the Pentagon _ and that has led to more high-profile
prosecutions.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, the Army found itself under fire for allowing
a two-star officer, Maj. Gen. David Hale, to retire even though a
subordinate's wife had accused him of coercing sex. In July, the
Pentagon's Inspector General accused Hale of a pattern of
``inappropriate behavior'' _ though not coercive _ involving
adulterous affairs with the wives of four subordinates, misuse of
taxpayer money and lying to investigators.
</P>
<P>
   The Army is now deciding whether to subject Hale to a
court-martial, even though he is now retired.
</P>
<P>
   After the investigation began, Scudi, a 32-year veteran, also
requested retirement, but Navy officials said the request would
have no effect on the prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   Officials familiar with the investigation, who spoke only on
condition of anonymity, said the allegations against Scudi extended
over several years and involved contracts awarded during previous
assignments at the Pentagon and in San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   The accusations came to light after the woman learned that Scudi
had begun a second adulterous relationship, this time with a senior
civilian employee of the Navy, the officials said. Scudi faces a
second adultery charge for that relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Officials also said that when investigators began looking into
the contracts, he lied about his actions and tried to obstruct
justice by urging the contractor not to cooperate. But the woman,
whom the officials declined to name, agreed to cooperate with Navy
investigators.

GAILEY FACES TOUGHEST TEST FROM NO. 1 FAN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM REEVES 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Chan Gailey climbs behind the wheel of his car tonight for
the drive home from Texas Stadium after the Cowboys-Vikings
Thanksgiving Day game, he'll steel himself for the worst.
</P>
<P>
   He will, by that time, have gone head to head with one of the
most talented teams in the NFL in the Vikings. He will have met
with his players and, win or lose, faced tough questions from the
media after the game.
</P>
<P>
   But his sternest test will come on the drive home.
</P>
<P>
   Some of us have back-seat drivers.
</P>
<P>
   Gailey lives with a back-seat coach.
</P>
<P>
   Meet Laurie Gailey, Cowboys head coach emeritus.
</P>
<P>
   ``You think you guys give me a hard time,'' Gailey likes to joke
with reporters. ``You're easy compared to my wife.''
</P>
<P>
   Take the Cowboys' 15-penalty performance Sunday against Seattle.
Please.
</P>
<P>
   ``She laid into me about all those penalties,'' Gailey says with
a rueful laugh. ``She didn't even wait for us to get out of the
parking lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Gailey's response: ``Tell me about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Like dutiful husbands everywhere, Gailey bites his tongue and
takes his medicine. After all, the lady with the sharp critique is
also the one who fixes the oyster dressing each Thanksgiving.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love oyster dressing,'' Gailey says, and you can almost see
his mouth watering as he speaks. ``I can't even begin to describe
how good it is.''
</P>
<P>
   If Gailey looks a little plumper on the sidelines today, blame
Laurie. The Gailey family had their Thanksgiving dinner last night
and yes, she prepared her famous oyster dressing, a recipe handed
down from her mother and one you can get in the ``1998 Cowboys'
Wives Cookbook'' that just came out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I must have eaten it the first time at her mother's house,
back when we were dating in 1969 or '70,'' Gailey says, his eyes
rolling at the memory.
</P>
<P>
   ``He looks forward to Thanksgiving because he looks forward to
that all year,'' Laurie says. ``I think it's why he married me.''
</P>
<P>
   Since her mom wasn't available, Laurie was the next best bet to
guarantee the annual appearance of oyster dressing on Chan's
Thanksgiving table.
</P>
<P>
   Along with a great cook and his best friend, Gailey soon
discovered he had married an inveterate football fan, one who very
much enjoyed taking an active part in her husband's world.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have an opinion, and I'm just like any other fan out
there,'' Laurie says. ``But when we lose, I'm very careful. I don't
say very much.''
</P>
<P>
   Gailey learned very quickly that Laurie had a discerning eye for
the intricacies of football.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's been doing this for a long time,'' he says. ``She's very
knowledgeable about the game; extremely knowledgeable. She used to
surprise me with some of the things she'd bring up, but I stopped
being surprised a long time ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``It kind of got to me at first. `Who are you to be questioning
me?' She just wanted to be involved. We love to needle each other
about things. She just likes to let me know when she understands
when something's not right.''
</P>
<P>
   Their discussions on the drive home have become part of the
repartee that both enjoy.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just laughs most of the time,'' Laurie says. ``He knows
it's coming, and he's a pretty good sport about it. I pick and
choose. I know him well enough to know when to say something and
when not to.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really have my own opinion. I don't just get it from what I
read or what I hear. I'll ask him things like, `What happened when
you called that timeout?' or `What was that play when Ernie caught
that pass on the sideline?' Things like that.''
</P>
<P>
   No, Laurie insists, she didn't help Chan design his offense,
which is almost as famous as her oyster dressing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know a lot about the X's and O's exactly,'' she says.
``And I'm not sure how much he listens to me, really. I think maybe
he probably thinks, `well, if she's saying it, then that's probably
what John Q. Public is saying.' I'm not so sure he knows exactly
what people are saying out there, he's so into his work.''
</P>
<P>
   Gailey listens and smiles a lot, amused and almost always amazed
at his wife's insight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do I get a kick out of it? I'm not sure that's the right
response,'' Gailey says with a chuckle. ``I'm just very
appreciative that I have a wife who cares and is involved and who
wants to win. She can say anything she wants, but let somebody else
say something and she's ready to fight. That's kind of the way it
is with families.''
</P>
<P>
   That's why Gailey will look at tonight's drive home with mixed
emotions. As usual, he knows he'll have to have some darn good
answers to her pointed questions.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, at the end of the drive, with any luck there should
be some of that leftover oyster dressing.
</P>
<P>
   It's a give-and-take relationship that he's happy to have lived
with for 25 years and counting.

COMMENTARY: THE SYSTEM GANGS UP ON A CHILD 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas)  (rl) 
 By BOB HERBERT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   If competence and integrity were the keys to survival, the
criminal justice system in Austin, Texas, would have passed out of
existence by now.
</P>
<P>
   From the very beginning the case against Lacresha Murray was an
exercise in incompetence and bad faith. The system ganged up on an
11-year-old girl and imprisoned her for a crime of which she is
almost certainly innocent _ the fatal beating of 2{-year-old Jayla
Belton.
</P>
<P>
   Lacresha is spending Thanksgiving at the Giddings State Home and
School, a juvenile prison 60 miles east of Austin where she has
begun to serve a sentence of 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   To this day the authorities in Austin deny that Lacresha was in
police custody two years ago when, without her family's knowledge
and without the benefit of a lawyer, she was interrogated by
detectives for at least three hours about Jayla's death. At the end
of that tape-recorded interrogation, Detective Sgt. Ernesto Pedraza
gave her a statement to sign, a statement she had trouble reading
and clearly did not understand.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's all true and correct,'' said Pedraza. ``Am I forcing
you to sign that?''
</P>
<P>
   Lacresha replied, ``Yeah.''
</P>
<P>
   That, of course, was the wrong answer. Pedraza, unhappy, said,
quite forcefully, ``Wha--?''
</P>
<P>
   Lacresha got the message. ``No,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Pedraza then said, ``OK, you're doing this voluntarily.''
</P>
<P>
   No one wants to admit that Lacresha was in custody because under
Texas law a child who is alone in the custody of the police must be
taken before a magistrate to insure that the child's rights are
protected, and that the child understands the proceedings that are
taking place and the penalties that might ensue.
</P>
<P>
   Lacresha had no clue as to what was going on. After she signed
the statement, she was charged with capital murder. Eleven years
old! Even in Texas you can't execute somebody that young. But you
can charge a child with capital murder, and that's what the
authorities did to Lacresha.
</P>
<P>
   For her first trial, held just two months after she was charged
(which is equivalent to the speed of light in a capital murder
case), the public defender was given a pittance with which to mount
a defense. Lacresha was promptly convicted of criminally negligent
homicide and intentional injury to a child. She was sentenced to 20
years.
</P>
<P>
   Then something unusual happened. When an appeals lawyer asked
the trial judge to throw out the verdict, the request was granted
and a new trial was ordered. The judge, John Dietz, told me in an
interview, ``I had a question as to whether justice was done.''
</P>
<P>
   Substantially more money was provided to the defense for the
second trial. There were still no witnesses contending that
Lacresha had attacked Jayla. There was no physical evidence
connecting her to the child's death, and no motive. And now there
were experts ready to testify that Jayla's death had been the
result of long-term physical abuse and neglect.
</P>
<P>
   If the prosecution had been interested in justice, it would have
dropped the case against Lacresha and investigators would have been
assigned to track down whoever had been abusing Jayla. Common sense
says that investigation should start with Jayla's mother, Judy
Belton, and her boyfriend, Derrick Shaw.
</P>
<P>
   But the prosecution was interested in saving face in this
high-profile case. And that could only be done by sending Lacresha
to prison for a long, long time.
</P>
<P>
   Worried that it would be unable to secure another guilty verdict
on homicide charges, the Travis County District Attorney's office
decided at the last minute to pursue only the charge of intentional
injury to a child. For a juvenile in Texas, that charge carries the
same maximum penalty upon conviction as capital murder _ 40 years'
imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
   It was an unconscionable but very clever move.
</P>
<P>
   All references to the death of Jayla Belton were removed from
the prosecution's pleadings. It was as if, from the prosecutor's
point of view, a homicide had never happened. Lacresha was accused
technically of causing ``bodily injuries that created a substantial
risk of death,'' when in reality she was on trial for killing a
young child.
</P>
<P>
   The jury returned a guilty verdict and Jayla was sentenced to 25
years. The system ganged up on an 11-year-old girl, and the system
won.

TWO SIDES OF SANTIAGO, TWO OPPOSING VIEWPOINTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (With PINOCHET; See also PINOCHET-REACT)

<P>
   SANTIAGO, Chile _ At one end of this city, supporters of Gen.
Augusto Pinochet cried and cursed the British but carried on with a
party celebrating his ill-timed 83rd birthday, anyway. At the other
end, detractors of the former dictator danced in the streets while
waving British flags and posters with pictures of victims who
disappeared in his 17 years in power.
</P>
<P>
   Chile once again showed its deep divisions Wednesday, as it has
through every twist and turn of Pinochet's legal troubles, which
began with his arrest 41 days ago in London on a Spanish warrant.
Police arrested at least four people and fired water canon to break
up demonstrations downtown and in front of the British Embassy. No
one was reported hurt.
</P>
<P>
   In the most serious incident officers and students clashed
briefly at the University of Concepcion, a traditional center of
activism in south-central Chile. Students threw stones and acid at
the police, breaking the collarbone of one officer and slightly
burning another.
</P>
<P>
   Political leaders of varied stripes called for calm, including
President Eduardo Frei, who reminded a national television audience
that it was his duty to guard against disorder.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can be absolutely certain that I will continue exercising
that responsibility with firmness and decisiveness,'' Frei said.
</P>
<P>
   He announced that he was dispatching Foreign Minister Jose
Miguel Insulza Salinas to London and Madrid to press the case that
Pinochet had diplomatic immunity as a senator for life and should
be allowed to return to Chile.
</P>
<P>
   His choice of Insulza, a leader of the Socialist Party, to lead
the diplomatic effort was a sharp rebuke to right-wing political
leaders who have repeatedly contended that Socialists in the
government coalition had conspired with European socialists to
punish Pinochet.
</P>
<P>
   As a senator for life, a position created in the constitution
written while the general was in power, the retired dictator has
legal immunity in Chile.
</P>
<P>
   Although they are a people known for their reserve, Chileans
wore their emotions on their sleeves Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel great pain that five people, five British judges, can
decide the future of Chile,'' said Sen. Hernan Larrain Fernandez of
the right-wing Independent Democratic Union Party.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're emotional and we're happy,'' Viviana Diaz, a leader of
the Group of the Relatives of the Detained and Disappeared, said.
``We know our missing loved ones are with us at this wonderful
moment.''
</P>
<P>
   Some 400 protesters, many from the Communist Party, skipped,
danced and sang through the downtown shopping district in a display
of joy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to live in a Chile without Pinochet,'' they chanted.
</P>
<P>
   The mix of British flags next to banners emblazoned with the
hammer and sickle was just one of many unusual images of the day.
</P>
<P>
   Chilean television showed Chilean human-rights protesters in
London as they sang a facetious version of ``Happy Birthday'' in
thick Spanish accents. The next clip showed red, white and blue
balloons flying from some office windows of the Chilean Congress in
celebration of Pinochet's birthday.
</P>
<P>
   The proceedings of the House of Lords on Wednesday were
televised live in Santiago, and the reaction to the ruling was
sharp and agitated at the headquarters of the Pinochet Foundation,
a group dedicated to promoting the former dictator's legacy.
Several people burst into tears, and others took out their
frustrations at visiting journalists. Some tossed glasses of water
at the reporters and photographers, while others pushed and kicked
a television cameraman.
</P>
<P>
   The mood cheered up somewhat by nightfall, when more than 2,000
supporters of Pinochet gathered on the tree-lined street outside
the foundation to celebrate the general's birthday. As the crowd
sang patriotic songs, venders sold ``Thank You Pinochet'' head
bands, ``I Love You Pinochet'' T-shirts, Chilean flags and ice
cream.
</P>
<P>
   Through the evening the crowd chanted, ``As long as Chile
exists, it will never be Marxist.'' Meanwhile people carried
posters that attacked ``British neocolonialism,'' a phrase that at
another time might sound Marxist.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel sadness, pain, hurt, because my rights as a citizen of
a democratic sovereign country have been squashed,'' Maria Ines
Martinez, 50, a public-relations executive, said. ``And our
government hasn't been decisive and clear in defending our
sovereignty.''

STUDY FINDS USE OF CORD BLOOD AS EFFECTIVE AS BONE MARROW
TRANSPLANTS

<TEXT>
<P>
   For people who need bone-marrow transplants to fight leukemia or
other deadly diseases, but who lack a compatible marrow donor,
doctors are salvaging hope from a curious source, one that is
normally thrown away: blood left in the umbilical cords and
placentas of newborn infants.
</P>
<P>
   In the largest study of placental blood use to date, in 562
patients, including more than 400 children, survival rates were
similar to those in studies using bone marrow from unrelated donors
who perfectly matched the recipients on tissue typing tests. The
procedure worked in many cases even when the placental blood was
not perfectly matched to the patients' tissue.
</P>
<P>
   (The researchers referred to it as placental blood, but it is
widely known as cord blood.)
</P>
<P>
   Patients in the new study were gravely ill with leukemia,
lymphoma, other cancers or genetic diseases, and were given cord
blood as a last resort because bone marrow donors had not been
found for them, or because they were considered too sick to wait
the months it could take to find a marrow donor.
</P>
<P>
   The results, being published on Thursday in the New England
Journal of Medicine, were announced on Wednesday by Dr. Pablo
Rubinstein, head of immunogenetics at the New York Blood Center in
Manhattan. The center has been banking placental blood since 1993
and provided it to 98 hospitals in the United States and overseas
that participated in the study.
</P>
<P>
   Because cord blood is readily available, it could be a huge boon
to thousands of Americans who need marrow transplants. Moreover,
cord blood is less likely than bone marrow to transmit infection,
and it is collected at no risk to the donor. Donors of bone marrow
must undergo a surgical procedure and anesthesia when their marrow
is harvested.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, smaller studies had suggested that cord blood might be
a possible alternative to bone marrow transplants, but researchers
said they were heartened by Rubinstein's findings because of their
scope and because patients involved had fared better than might
have been expected. All had been extremely ill, many in advanced
stages of disease after long periods of waiting in vain for a bone
marrow donor.
</P>
<P>
   Still, by 100 days after cord blood transplantation, 218 of the
562 had died. A similar rate would be expected with bone marrow
transplanted from unrelated donors in such severe cases.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Claude L'Enfant, director of the National Heart, Lung and
Blood Institute, which funded the study but did not take part in
it, said in a telephone interview, ``The prospects are quite
fantastic in my opinion. The work from the New York Blood Center is
really a landmark study.''
</P>
<P>
   But L'Enfant also tempered his remarks, adding that cord blood
transplants are an emerging treatment that must be studied further.
Also, he said, for widespread use ``You need to have a huge bank of
these cells, and that is not available at the present time.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Robertson Parkman, head of the division of research
immunology and bone marrow transplantation at Children's Hospital
in Los Angeles, said, ``This confirms previous observations, that
degrees of mismatch that would not be tolerated with bone marrow
transplantation are tolerated.''
</P>
<P>
   Parkman said the study also showed that a few ounces of cord
blood can sometimes be used to treat adults, as opposed to a quart
or more used in bone-marrow transplants. But the finding was
puzzling, because the procedure worked in some adults but not
others, and Parkman said further research was needed to find out
why.
</P>
<P>
   Bone marrow or cord blood transplants are given to patients who
have received such high doses of chemotherapy and radiation to
fight disease that their own bone marrow, which makes red and white
blood cells, has also been destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   Both marrow and cord blood teem with special cells that can
reconstitute the patient's ravaged blood supply and immune system.
Those cells, hematopoietic stem cells, can give rise to new red and
white blood cells and to platelets, which are essential for
clotting.
</P>
<P>
   Although the procedure is called a transplant, the marrow or
cord blood is really dripped into a vein like a tranfusion, and the
stem cells find their way to the marrow spaces in the patient's
bones. Even though people getting cord blood are given a smaller
volume of blood than those receiving marrow, the cord blood works
because it is so rich in stem cells and those very young cells have
more growth potential than those from an adult, Rubinstein said.
</P>
<P>
   The great advantage of placental blood, he said, is that it does
not have to be as closely matched to the recipient's tissue as bone
marrow does. That means it can be used to help more people,
including members of racial and ethnic minority groups who often
have trouble finding compatible donors. Less precise tissue matches
are possible because the cells in cord blood, less mature than
those in bone marrow from an adult donor, are less likely to be
rejected by the recipient or to attack the recipient's tissue.
</P>
<P>
   For a bone marrow transplant from an unrelated donor to succeed,
the donor and recipient must match on 6 out of 6 genetic traits
used in tissue typing. But placental blood transplants can work
when only 4 or 5 traits match, and sometimes even 3, though the
odds of success increase with better matches.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Dr. John Wagner, associate director of bone marrow
transplantation at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis, who
treated several patients in the study, said an important finding
was that three groups of patients did not do well with cord blood,
and, if they had a choice, might fare better with bone marrow.
Those patients had chronic myelogenous leukemia, severe aplastic
anemia and Fanconi's anemia.
</P>
<P>
   ``These three diseases have fallen out,'' Wagner said. ''Why
would that be? Is it peculiar to this group? How does it compare to
bone marrow transplantation? We know that with chronic myelogenous
leukemia, results with bone marrow are quite good. This is a
concern.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a quirk of human biology that makes placental blood so
rich in stem cells. After several months of pregnancy, stem cells,
which have been residing in the fetus' liver, begin cascading into
the bloodstream and migrating to the bone marrow. At birth the
baby's blood, and therefore the placenta and umbilical cord, are
still full of stem cells. Within about 24 hours, most of the stem
cells vanish from the baby's blood.
</P>
<P>
   It might seem wasteful, a biological mistake even, for such
precious cells to accumulate in tissues that are lost to the baby.
In fact, Rubinstein said, doctors used to think babies needed the
blood that was left in the placenta and cord, and would try to let
that blood drain into the infant, either by elevating the placenta
or lowering the infant below the level of the delivery table,
before the cord was cut.
</P>
<P>
   But gradually it became apparent that the procedure, called
placental tranfusion, could backfire. The extra volume of blood
forced into the baby caused heart problems in some infants, and the
excess of red cells sometimes led to jaundice. Nature had
apparently anticipated losses through the placenta and provided
fetuses with blood to spare.
</P>
<P>
   About 30 years ago, Rubinstein said, placental transfusions were
halted.
</P>
<P>
   Another curiosity, he said, is that although scientists revere
what they call ``true stem cells,'' those that can recreate the
entire blood supply and immune system, nobody has ever seen one.
Researchers know that there are stem cells in cord blood and bone
marrow, but they cannot identify just which cells they are.``We may
have seen it but don't know it,'' Rubinstein said. ``We infer and
know they exist from very good data.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, scientists do not know precisely how stem cells
manage to create new blood cells and yet maintain a population of
stem cells.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 5,500 people in North America who received bone marrow
from donors in 1997, 60 percent to 70 percent had matches in their
own families, and the rest found unrelated donors, according to the
International Bone Marrow Transplant Registry, a Milwaukee based
group that keeps statistics on the procedure. Figures were not
available on how many patients failed to find marrow donors, but
that had to be the case for at least 228, the number who received
cord blood in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Craig Howe, chief executive officer of the National Marrow
Donor Program, a Minneapolis based registry that helps people who
need bone marrow to find matching donors, said that the program
would also begin to help patients find cord blood matches sometime
next year. And other institutions are also establishing cord blood
banks, including the National Institutes of Health, Mount Sinai
Medical Center in New York, the University of Colorado in Denver
and Cardinal Glennon Hospital in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Companies have also sprung up to offer private cord-blood
banking to expectant parents, on the remote chance that their child
or someone else in the family might one day need a stem-cell
transplant. It is a trend that makes many scientists uncomfortable,
partly because it limits public access to cord blood. But many
couples seem interested: in just three years, one private firm in
California has banked 10,000 samples, more than the New York Blood
Center has stored in nearly six years.

HUTU LINKED TO RWANDA MASSACRES SAID TO FIGHT CONGO REBELS 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   NAIROBI, Kenya _ Soldiers of the former Rwandan army, many of
whom took part in the 1994 massacres there, are playing a big role
in putting down the latest rebellion in Congo, a U.N. report says.
</P>
<P>
   The involvement of the soldiers, mostly Hutu, has long been
suspected, even though Congo's President Laurent Kabila has denied
any association with them.
</P>
<P>
   The report says that thousands of former soldiers and associated
Hutu militiamen have converged in Congo and become a ``significant
component'' of the drive by Kabila and allied African countries to
suppress rebels who have emerged in eastern Congo, near the border
with Rwanda, in an area known as the Great Lakes region.
</P>
<P>
   It further contends that these former soldiers and Hutu militia
members have turned to drug trafficking to finance the purchase of
small arms.
</P>
<P>
   ``The situation in the Great Lakes region is rapidly heading
toward a catastrophe of incalculable consequences which requires
urgent, comprehensive and decisive measures on the part of the
international community,'' warns the report, which was issued this
week.
</P>
<P>
   ``The danger of a repetition of tragedy comparable to the
Rwandan genocide of 1994, but on a subregional scale, cannot be
ruled out.''
</P>
<P>
   The latest conflict in Congo has been brewing since August, when
a group of rebels, backed by Uganda and Rwanda, began an uprising
against Kabila, who himself took power only a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   The Rwandan government, which is dominated by the Tutsi ethnic
group, has said that it backed the rebellion largely to secure its
borders against attacks from the former Hutu soldiers in eastern
Congo.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the fighting has expanded into a regional conflict,
as soldiers from Zimbabwe, Angola, Chad and Namibia have joined
forces with Kabila against the rebels and their allies.
</P>
<P>
   In effect, the report says, the former soldiers and the Hutu
militias, known as the Interahamwe, have gained a ``a form of
legitimacy'' because of their ties to Kabila and his allies. ``This
is a profoundly shocking state of affairs,'' it says.
</P>
<P>
   These Hutu and others helped carry out the 1994 massacres in
Rwanda, in which hundreds of thousands of Tutsi and moderate Hutu
were killed. A Tutsi rebel force then took power in Rwanda, ending
the killing and driving more than 1.5 million Hutu out of the
country.
</P>
<P>
   The report says that Hutu soldiers dispersed into countries
around the region, but have been returning in ever-increasing
numbers to fight in eastern Congo. There are an estimated 5,000 to
8,000 Hutu soldiers in northeastern Congo and another 10,000 in the
south, the reports claims. Hundreds of Rwandan Hutu were recruited
by Kabila's government for fighting around Kinshasa, Congo's
capital, earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   The commission, headed by Mahmoud Kassem of Egypt, has
investigated the illegal flow arms into the region intermittently
since 1995, a task made more difficult since the rebellion began.
</P>
<P>
   Although there is a United Nations embargo on arms sales to the
Hutu groups, arms are getting through in large numbers and the
``free flow of arms into and within Africa is a major long-term
cause of insecurity,'' the report says.
</P>
<P>
   The Hutu have begun paying for the arms by trafficking in
Mandrax, a sedative used as a recreational drug, the report says.
The Mandrax is smuggled to Kenya and Tanzania, and then mostly to
Europe.

 By WARREN HOGE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ The House of Lords on Wednesday rejected Gen. Augusto
Pinochet's claim of immunity from arrest, committing him to remain
in custody here while Spain seeks his extradition on charges of
genocide and terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   In tersely worded verdicts, the five law lords who make up
England's highest court ruled 3-2 that crimes like hostage-taking
and torture are not protected by sovereign immunity because they
cannot be considered functional acts of a head of state.
</P>
<P>
   With the immunity issue settled, the focus shifts to Home
Secretary Jack Straw, who has until Dec. 2 to decide whether to
allow the Spanish extradition request to be answered by the courts.
</P>
<P>
   The government has remained publicly aloof so far, saying the
case is a matter for the courts to decide. But Straw, a key member
of the Cabinet, now has the power either to let the case go forward
or allow Pinochet to leave Britain on grounds of ill health or
compassion.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's ruling overturned the judgment of the High Court on
Oct. 28 that Pinochet, the onetime Chilean dictator, could not be
arrested because he is a former head of state and enjoys the
protection of the State Immunity Act of 1978. But the High Court
said he had to stay in England while the Crown Prosecution Service,
on behalf of the Spanish authorities, appealed the decision.
</P>
<P>
   The surprise arrest of Pinochet took place on Oct. 16 in
response to a request from a Spanish judge that he be held in
London for extradition to Madrid.
</P>
<P>
   One of the five judges, Lord Nicholls, expressing Wednesday's
majority view, told the House: ``International law has made plain
that certain types of conduct, including torture and
hostage-taking, are not acceptable conduct on the part of anyone.
This applies as much to heads of state, or even more so, as it does
to everyone else. The contrary conclusion would make a mockery of
international law.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's decision marked a potentially significant broadening
of the powers of prosecutors under international law and new human
rights covenants for pursuing people across national borders with
allegations of crimes against humanity. Opponents of the reasoning
behind Wednesday's finding have said prosecutors could apply it to
people like Queen Elizabeth II, for past British actions in
Ireland, and President Clinton, for the bombing of Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference in Parliament, Geoffrey Bindman, a lawyer
representing Amnesty International and the families of victims of
the Pinochet regime, called Wednesday's ruling ``the most important
case in human rights law this century.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The significance of this case will extend to all repressive
regimes where the heads of state seek to assert the freedom to
travel around the world living in luxury on the proceeds of their
crimes,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The first two judges to speak Wednesday upheld the earlier High
Court decision, raising the prospect among the hundreds of
thousands of people watching the event on television that Pinochet
would be flying home Wednesday afternoon on the Chilean Air Force
jet that has been parked at a suburban military field for the past
month.
</P>
<P>
   But the next three judges disagreed, setting off gasps in the
jammed public gallery and jubilant cheering and embracing among the
Chilean exiles gathered on the street outside Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Pinochet, who turned 83 on Wednesday, was appointed senator for
life in March when he stepped down as Army commander, largely for
the purpose of giving him immunity from prosecution in Chile.
</P>
<P>
   There was no word from the hospital in North London where he has
remained under police guard, recuperating from back surgery last
month. In his only comment since his arrest, he issued a statement
on Nov. 8 saying he was ``hurt and bewildered'' by his detention in
England, a country whose institutions he always admired, and would
fight the extradition order ``with all my spirit.''
</P>
<P>
   While a group of 100 Chilean exiles and other Pinochet opponents
danced and chanted joyously at the gates to the hospital, the
ambulance that was expected to transport the general to Brize
Norton Royal Air Force base in Oxfordshire, where a plane waited to
take him to Chile, drove off empty.
</P>
<P>
   Two warrants for the general's arrest and extradition from the
Spanish judge, Baltasar Garzon, allege that during the 17 years
Pinochet ruled Chile, he intentionally inflicted severe pain or
suffering, took hostages, conspired to kill enemies and conducted a
ruthless systematic purge of political opponents that resulted in
3,178 murders or ``disappearances.''
</P>
<P>
   Bow Street Magistrates Court in London has set a Dec. 2 deadline
by which Straw must make his decision and Pinochet must attend a
hearing, which would be his first appearance since his arrest.
</P>
<P>
   Former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher Wednesday urged Straw to
allow Pinochet to leave England because of his poor health. She has
lobbied for the general's release, saying the British should be
grateful to him for his support during the Falkland Islands War in
1982.
</P>
<P>
   ``The senator is old, frail and sick, and on compassionate
grounds alone should be allowed to return to Chile,'' she said
Wednesday moments after the law lords' ruling became known.
</P>
<P>
   In the House of Commons on Wednesday afternoon, William Hague,
the Conservative leader, also called on Straw to let the general go
and end what he called ``a huge diplomatic embarrassment for this
country.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's damaging relations with Chile, a long-standing ally of
our country, and causing instability in a country that is now
democratic,'' Hague said.
</P>
<P>
   The British government has said the Pinochet proceeding is a
matter for the judicial authorities here and in Spain.
</P>
<P>
   One official, Trade and Industry Minister Peter Mandelson, said
last month that extending compassion to Pinochet would be a ``gut
wrenching'' experience for those who remembered the events in Chile
after the military coup of 1973.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the statements from human rights groups Wednesday
specifically called on Straw to resist entreaties to interfere.
David Bull, director of Amnesty International U.K., said: ``It is
vital now that justice is done. This decision has opened the way
for that justice. We must send a message to the Home Secretary that
he must not overturn the will of the highest court in the land.''
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Pinochet, a self-declared Anglophile, had made a number of
visits here in recent years without incident. He arrived this time
on Sept. 21 and was treated as a VIP by the Foreign Office. He had
tea with Mrs. Thatcher in her home and gave a long interview to The
New Yorker magazine in which he proclaimed his love of England.
</P>
<P>
   But he suffered back pains during the flight from Chile, and a
doctor recommended immediate surgery. The operation took place on
Oct. 9 and the general was recuperating when he was arrested.
</P>
<P>
   He has remained under police guard, in keeping with the High
Court's direction that he remain in England while the appeal was
being heard.
</P>
<P>
   Pinochet has not been seen in public since his arrest.
</P>
<P>
   In the statement issued Nov. 8, he said the peaceful future of
countries that had experienced internal conflict lay in
``reconciliation,'' and argued that ``in Chile, as elsewhere,
recrimination is the enemy of reconciliation.'' He cited Spain,
South Africa and Northern Ireland as positive examples where ``wise
decisions have been made not to revisit the past.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The opening up of old wounds, bringing back into debate issues
where the true facts have long since been forgotten, serves no
purpose,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Reports about what occurred in Chile were ``a travesty of the
truth,'' he contended, and as a result, he had become the victim of
``spurious attempts by foreign prosecutors to convict me on
unproven charges.''

<P>
   MACON, Ga. _ The soldiers were not really soldiers at all, but
old men and boys and others who were considered unfit for a real
Confederate uniform, armed with squirrel rifles and shotguns and
smooth-bore muskets that hurled a musket ball in the rough
direction of the enemy. Their commanding general had no real
experience in battle, and it was rumored that what courage he had
came from a bottle of bourbon.
</P>
<P>
   Their ragtag regiment was called the Georgia Militia, but the
real Confederate regulars, half-starved, their ranks shot to pieces
at this late date in the Civil War, referred to them derisively as
``Joe Brown's Pets.''
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Joe Brown, who had formed them as a home guard, never let
them fight outside Georgia, say Civil War historians, so the
regulars questioned their courage. History probably would have
remembered them that way, too, or not at all, if the hated Union
general, William Tecumseh Sherman, had not put a match to the
little hamlet of Griswoldville, Ga., 10 miles east of Macon, on
Nov. 22, 1864.
</P>
<P>
   What happened next would go down as one of the most courageous
actions of the war, but one of its most tragic, one-sided and _
many historians believe _ foolish.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was never intended to even be a battle,'' said Bill Scaife,
a Civil War historian from Ackworth, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   But that is no reason, historians and history buffs here agree,
that the fields and trees should be paved over with subdivisions
and forgotten. Last week, the State of Georgia dedicated 17 acres
of battlefield _ virtually unchanged since that violent day _ to
the Georgia State Parks, which will maintain the land as a historic
site.
</P>
<P>
   A church had already been built on a corner of the battlefield,
and encroaching development threatened to swallow the site until
history buffs and others raised much of the $95,000 needed to
purchase the land and give it to the state for preservation.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia has preserved several battlefields, said Billy Townsend,
chief historian for the park system, but none that honors the kind
of soldier who died here.
</P>
<P>
   As a battle, historians say, it was barely a pause in Sherman's
March to the Sea, but as a tragedy, it was historic. Of the some
2,000 militia, 500 died, charging again and again and again across
the fields, and the blood was smeared for acres against an unusual
late November snow, surviving soldiers wrote.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although the Confederates showed a lot of courage, they did
not not show a lot of intelligence,'' said Scaife, who has written
several Civil War books and is working on one that will include the
Griswoldville battle.
</P>
<P>
   To understand it, historians say, one must understand a
Georgian's hatred of Sherman, who burned and pillaged the state,
intending to cleave the South in half and crush its armies and
spirit.
</P>
<P>
   He has been referred to here, said Townsend, ``as the first
modern war criminal.''
</P>
<P>
   Scaife said, ``We felt toward him the way we feel about Hitler
today.'' It was this man's army, an army that had just burned and
sacked Atlanta and was now marching on Savannah, that fell on the
tiny town of Griswoldville and burned it to the ground.
</P>
<P>
   The militia was not even supposed to encounter Sherman's army,
and was marching to help reinforce Augusta, north of Savannah, when
it collided with the veteran Union soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the militia, who had orders not to engage their enemy
because they were outnumbered by thousands, stared at them across
the field. Many had seen their homes burned to the ground by
Sherman's troops. Others had lived here, in Griswoldville.
</P>
<P>
   ``They could smell the burning buildings,'' Townsend said.
</P>
<P>
   They itched to fight, some historians say. To strike back at the
Yankees would have elevated them in the eyes of other soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   But they never would have stormed across those open fields if
they had not had orders to do so, and it is one of the great
mysteries of the war that, against all common sense and decency,
that order was given.
</P>
<P>
   Scaife said the commander of the militia, Gen. G.W. Smith, ``had
the habit of finding some excuse not to lead troops into battle.''
Instead, he appointed a younger, less-experienced general, Pleasant
J. Phillips, to lead the march.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was the least-experienced of the commanders,'' Scaife said,
in a militia officer corps that was mostly made up of political
appointees.
</P>
<P>
   He also had a reputation for drinking too much, ``but in
fairness to his descendants, I don't know about that,'' Scaife
said. ``But whether he was drunk or not, he did not command with
any degree of competence.''
</P>
<P>
   Phillips ordered his militia to charge the enemy across open
ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``These were the pick of Sherman's veterans,'' armed with
weapons that could fire as fast as the soldier could work the lever
of his repeating rifle, Scaife said.
</P>
<P>
   It was slaughter.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips ordered them to charge again, and they were slaughtered
again. They charged seven times, until one in four men, almost, was
dead. The militia was not so much as defeated as it was exhausted,
used up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of it was anger,'' that kept the men throwing themselves
against the rifles of their enemies, Townsend said.
</P>
<P>
   Their courage cost the Union forces just 90 men, historians say.
</P>
<P>
   It was the only infantry battle actually fought by the opposing
forces on Georgia soil. The other confrontations were sieges.
</P>
<P>
   The war was pretty much lost already. Sherman did march to the
sea.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was courageous,'' said Scaife, ``but it was tragic.''

COLLEGE BASEBALL COACH LOST A LEG TO CANCER, BUT FOUND SOMETHING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM REEVES 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   At some point today, Butch McBroom, like millions of others
across this country, will bow his head to say thanks.
</P>
<P>
   Like yours, McBroom's prayer will start simply.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks, Lord, for the bountiful food on the table.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks for the love of family and the support of good friends.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks for the great outdoors, the animals and birds, the
forests and the seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks for a career and an avocation that provides so much
satisfaction.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks for life.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks even, for the empty pants leg that flutters where muscle
and sinew once worked in harmony, where blood once flowed.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, thanks even for that which is no longer there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe this happened for a purpose,'' McBroom said, ``and
I'm a better person because of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen years after his left leg was amputated at the hip
because of cancer, McBroom has reached a point where he sometimes
wonders to himself what he would do if wheeler-dealer Satan
suddenly showed up at the door and offered him a trade.
</P>
<P>
   His left leg back for his life as it is now and the person he
has become.
</P>
<P>
   ``Would I make that deal?'' he wondered aloud. ``My life today
to have my leg back? As much as I'd like to have two legs again and
throw these crutches away, I'm not actually sure that I would.''
</P>
<P>
   McBroom, who will begin his 26th season as head baseball coach
at UT-Arlington in January, is sitting on the front porch of a log
cabin buried deep in a forest of oak and mesquite on 175 acres of
prime hunting land, about 80 miles southwest of Fort Worth and 20
miles north of Stephenville in Erath County.
</P>
<P>
   This is McBroom's Xanadu, if you will, his own little piece of
heaven on earth. He can sit on the porch in the early mornings,
sipping his coffee and watch deer feeding in the meadow 50 yards
away.
</P>
<P>
   At dawn last Easter morning, McBroom took his Bible, climbed
aboard a four-wheeler, and drove it to the top of what passes for a
mountain in Texas. From there, he looked across the land and
watched the sun come up as he read passages from the Easter story.
</P>
<P>
   There's a direct line from the leg McBroom lost in 1983 to this
cabin and this land that he loves so much. The $500,000 malpractice
settlement he received after losing his leg in '83 _ the cancer was
originally misdiagnosed _ was what allowed him to afford to buy
this place four years later.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what complicates the deal,'' McBroom said. ``I love
this place so much, I don't know that I'd give it up for
anything.''
</P>
<P>
   But there's more than that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a much better person now than I was then,'' McBroom said
without hesitation. ``I stop and smell the roses. I consider people
where I didn't before. I don't rush through life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really know the power of having Jesus Christ in your life
and what that means. I didn't understand that fully before. I have
taken my handicap and done things that I would not have done had I
had two legs, speaking engagements, things like that. I talk to
kids who are handicapped regularly. I think, I hope, that I've made
a difference.''
</P>
<P>
   No deals with the devil necessary for McBroom. He made his
covenant with a higher power a long time ago. `Bolt of electricity'
Eighteen years ago, it started as a small knot in the back of his
left thigh. Irritating, sure, but no big deal, McBroom thought.
Nothing an athletic, energetic 37-year-old college baseball coach
would let bother him. Besides, the doctor kept telling him it was
nothing to worry about.
</P>
<P>
   It turned out to be a rare, slow-growing, cancerous tumor that
was attached to the lining around the sciatic nerve in his left
hamstring. When McBroom, who grew up in Fort Worth and graduated
first from Carter-Riverside High School and then Baylor University,
first noticed it, it was the size of a raisin. When doctors removed
it surgically three years later, it was the size of Nerf football
and weighed a pound and half.
</P>
<P>
   McBroom went through chemotherapy and radiation treatments but
in June '83, there was reoccurence of the cancer. This time there
was no hesitation by his new doctor at Baylor Hospital in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't ease into it or anything,'' McBroom remembered. ``He
just said flat out, `We're going to have to amputate your leg.' I
got sick. I literally got sick at my stomach and had to lay down.
</P>
<P>
   ``The next two days was like I was in a state of disbelief that
it was really going to happen. I did a lot of praying, a lot of
soul-searching. I just finally said, `Hey, if this means saving my
life, let's go do it.'''
</P>
<P>
   It was one night shortly before the surgery in August when
McBroom had the experience that will stick with him for the rest of
his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was lying in bed, and I was praying, saying `What am I going
to do?' I was praying for God to heal me. And I heard a voice
within me say, `I'm going to heal you of the cancer, but you're
going to lose your leg.' I felt like I'd had a bolt of electricity
go through me from my head to my toes. I knew then I'd never have
to worry about cancer again.
</P>
<P>
   ``From that point on, I focused on what was left and not what
was gone. I made up my mind that whatever I could possibly do, I
was going to keep doing it.''
</P>
<P>
   For the first five days after his leg was amputated, a feverish
McBroom lay in a pool of sweat in his hospital bed, the leg that
was no longer there causing him agonizing pain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't prepared for how tough it was going it be,'' McBroom
recalled. ``For five days it felt like my left ankle was being
crushed.''
</P>
<P>
   Five days later a gaunt and haggard McBroom left the hospital 50
pounds lighter. On his way home, he stopped by the UTA baseball
field to talk to his players.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was amazing,'' said John Mocek, who left his job as
athletic department business manager to become McBroom's assistant
coach for the next 14 years. He is now the school's assistant
athletic director in charge of business operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We stopped practice for about 10 minutes and Butch sat on the
outside of the fence, near the dugout, and the guys came out and
milled around him because they couldn't believe it, couldn't
believe that he was there after what he'd been through,'' said
Mocek, who first played for McBroom at Union College in Jackson,
Tenn., and then followed him to UTA. ``He said he was going to do
it, and he was at workouts within another week.''
</P>
<P>
   McBroom wheeling around on his crutches is a familiar sight now
at UTA. He has become an avid skier and, he says, a better golfer
than he was with two legs, ``because I don't try to hit it so
hard.''
</P>
<P>
   He can't do some of the things he always loved _ pitching
batting practice, hitting fungoes, coaching third base _ but it has
always been the interaction with the players that mattered most,
and he still has that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've gone back and helped with his baseball camps after he
lost his leg,'' said former Mavericks infielder Danny Smith, who
graduated in 1981 and manages Applejack's Liquor Store in
Arlington. ``I think it's made him appreciate life more. He knows
he was lucky.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has a different outlook on life now. I think it's like guys
who have been through war, or in a prison camp, and they know and
appreciate what they have now more than they ever did before.'' A
love for coaching McBroom is a four-time Southland Conference coach
of the year and had 14 consecutive seasons of 30-plus victories.
Sixty-two of his former players have gone on to play professionally
and 41 have entered the coaching ranks, including his son Chad, who
is the assistant varsity baseball coach at Mineral Wells High
School.
</P>
<P>
   There's a certain pride in a father who sees his son following
in his own footsteps, knowing that perhaps he has passed on the
love of a noble profession like coaching and teaching.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm thankful that God has allowed me to do what I do,''
McBroom said. ``I love coaching. I absolutely love it. I love the
competition, but I think seeing kids go out and become men is what
I enjoy most of all.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes you don't see that until they've been away for a
couple of years and then come back. To see them mature and start
families of their own, to see so many of them become great young
men and to hope that maybe I had some influence on that somewhere
along the line, that's important to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Players have changed in the quarter-century since McBroom came
to UTA, and not always for the good.
</P>
<P>
   ``So many kids today refuse to take responsibility for
anything,'' McBroom says. ``Nothing is ever their fault. I wish
parents would understand that loving a kid is not giving him
everything he wants. Loving that kid is giving him direction,
making him get out on his own, letting him fail, because without
failing, he'll never learn how to succeed.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes young people have to fall, like McBroom has fallen,
his crutches flying one way, his body pitching the other.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems to take forever,'' McBroom said, ``because I can't
wait to pick myself up and keep going.''
</P>
<P>
   Keep up if you can.
</P>
<P>
   It's another way of proving the old adage. To really know a man,
to know his life, to understand who he really he is, where he's
been and where he's going, it's simple.
</P>
<P>
   Just walk a mile in his shoe.

OPEC PREPARES PLAN TO PREVENT FURTHER DROP IN OIL PRICES 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By AGIS SALPUKAS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   After a day of meetings, members of the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries appeared to be nearing an agreement
on what action they will take to try to keep oil prices from
falling further, but a spokesman for the group said Wednesday that
there were still more issues to discuss.
</P>
<P>
   The spokesman, OPEC secretary general Rilwanu Lukman, said
Wednesday in Vienna, where the group is meeting, that ``we are
still discussing everything,'' according to a Bloomberg News
report.
</P>
<P>
   Lukman said the group will reconvene Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   John Lichtblau, the chairman of the Petroleum Industry Research
Foundation, Inc., a research group for the oil industry based in
New York, said OPEC had little choice but to extend the production
cuts it made earlier this year. Those reductions have helped to
keep oil prices from collapsing.
</P>
<P>
   ``What else can they do?,'' he said. ``They already have an
agreement. It's unlikely that they will not extend it.''
</P>
<P>
   There has been dissension among members of the group on what
course to take. Some major producers such as Iran have asked Saudi
Arabia to make deeper cuts. Venezuela has been reluctant to extend
the cuts that the group agreed to last June, which have helped to
keep crude oil prices from dropping below $10 a barrel.
</P>
<P>
   The group agreed this past spring to reduce production by 2.6
million barrels a day, about 3 percent of the daily world supply of
74 million barrels.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts had expected the group to simply extend the current
level of cutbacks but even that could be in doubt due to the
differences among the members.
</P>
<P>
   Dissension among OPEC members was viewed as one reason why crude
oil futures prices fell Wednesday. Crude oil for January delivery
fell 29 cents, or 2.6 percent, to $11.86 a barrel on the New York
Mercantile Exchange, close to the 12-year low of $11.42 reached
June 15. Prices have fallen about 40 percent from from late last
year.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, inventories keep building up in the United States as
the driving season winds down.
</P>
<P>
   The American Petroleum Institute, the industry trade group,
reported Wednesday that a rise in imports of oil, which hit near
record levels last week, was a major reason for the increase in
crude oil inventories.
</P>
<P>
   There are huge forces adding to the extra supplies that are
beyond OPEC's ability to manage, such as the economic slump in
Asia, increasing exports of some non-OPEC producers such as Russia,
and unseasonably mild weather in the United States, which has
reduced demand for heating oil.
</P>
<P>
   Politics is also at work with Venezuela, a major producer,
becoming restive in keeping down its exports due to a coming
election Dec. 6.
</P>
<P>
   Saudi Arabia has been aggressive in building up its exports to
the United States to offset some of the loss of revenue due to
steep drop in the price of oil.

MICHIGAN PROSECUTOR BRINGS MURDER CHARGES AGAINST KEVORKIAN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Also see KEVORKIAN-LEGAL) (sw) 
 By DIRK JOHNSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A Michigan prosecutor on Wednesday brought first-degree murder
charges against Dr. Jack Kevorkian for administering a lethal
injection last September to a terminally ill man who wished to die,
a videotaped act of euthanasia that was nationally televised on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   David Gorcyca, the prosecutor for Oakland County, said
Kevorkian's actions clearly fit the definition of premeditated
murder, and that the consent of the dying man, who had Lou Gehrig's
disease, was no legal defense.
</P>
<P>
   While Kevorkian claims to have presided over more than 120
suicides, this case was the first in which he took a direct role in
causing a death. If convicted, he could face a sentence of life in
prison.
</P>
<P>
   He surrendered to the police on Wednesday afternoon in Waterford
Township, a suburb of Detroit, and was later released on a $750,000
personal bond, on the condition that he not participate in any
assisted suicides. A preliminary hearing was scheduled for Dec. 9.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this case, there is an obvious violation of the law,'' the
prosecutor said, ``which I will not turn my back to.''
</P>
<P>
   Kevorkian, 70, had virtually dared legal authorities to charge
him, or implicitly acknowledge that people have the right to end
their lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``They must charge me _ because if they do not that means they
do not think it was a crime,'' Kevorkian said when the videotape of
the death of Thomas Youk, 52, was shown on ``60 Minutes,'' a CBS
News show that was viewed in more than 15 million households.
</P>
<P>
   People on both sides of the debate over assisted suicide and
euthanasia applauded the filing of formal charges, both calling for
a showdown on an issue that goes to core philosophies of life and
liberty. But legal experts said that prosecutors might be at a
disadvantage because a jury might find it easy to sympathize with
the sufferings of the terminally ill.
</P>
<P>
   Faye Girsh, executive director of the Hemlock Society, which
advocates the rights of people to end their lives, said the
Michigan prosecutor's decision to file charges was legally
appropriate.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was what Jack Kevorkian wanted,'' said Ms. Girsh. ``He
chose to do this to make a point to the American public.''
</P>
<P>
   Noting that three juries had failed to convict Kevorkian in
earlier cases of assisted suicides, Ms. Girsh said it was
``questionable whether a jury of 12 citizens'' would convict him.
</P>
<P>
   Wesley Smith, a lawyer for the International Anti-Euthanasia
Task Force who is a critic of Kevorkian, said of the charges filed
against Kevorkian, ``It's about time.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``Unless the rule of law means nothing in this
country, Jack Kevorkian belongs in jail.''
</P>
<P>
   The American Medical Association issued a statement on Tuesday
that condemned Kevorkian as ``a self-admitted zealot killing
another human being to advance his own interests and ego-driven
urge to martyrdom.''
</P>
<P>
   A Michigan law that took effect on Sept. 1 forbids assisted
suicide. A statewide vote on a measure that would have legalized
assisted suicide, under certain circumstances, was defeated on Nov.
3 by a margin of 71 percent to 29 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Kevorkian, whose license to practice medicine has been revoked
in Michigan and California, was tried and acquitted three times on
charges related to the deaths of five people in Michigan between
1994 and 1996. A fourth case ended in mistrial.
</P>
<P>
   On ``60 Minutes,'' Kevorkian said that if he were sent to
prison, he would starve himself.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with the Oakland Press of Michigan, Kevorkian
said that he wanted to be charged. ``I want to be prosecuted for
euthanasia,'' he told the newspaper. ``I am going to prove that
this is not a crime, ever, regardless of what words are written on
paper.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he was ``tired of all the hypocrisy,'' adding, ``we're
going to end this, one way or another.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Kevorkian had given the videotape to CBS, which later turned it
over to prosecutors. Mike Wallace, a reporter on the show, said the
tape was handed over because ``it belonged to Dr. Kevorkian,'' and
that is what he wished to be done.
</P>
<P>
   On the tape, Kevorkian is shown presenting a consent form to
Youk, who then signed it.
</P>
<P>
   Two nights later, on Sept. 17, Kevorkian is shown injecting Youk
with drugs to make him sleep, then stop breathing, and then stop
his heart.
</P>
<P>
   When asked during the broadcast if he had killed Youk, Kevorkian
replied, ``I did.''

MARILYN MANSON: NOT EASY TO KEEP BEING OUTRAGEOUS 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By JON PARELES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A big flashing sign spelled out ``DRUGS'' on the
stage of the Hammerstein Ballroom on Monday night. And Marilyn
Manson, wearing a sparkly red outfit with garters, thigh-high boots
and a codpiece-thong combination that left his buttocks bare, did
his parody of a preacher, declaring that God spoke to him and said
that Jesus Christ invented marijuana, cocaine and LSD.
</P>
<P>
   Determined to offend both church and state, Manson was trying
hard to hold on to his role as the corrupter of American youth.
American youth may have other ideas, like treating him as mere
entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   Manson is already facing the predicament of anyone who builds a
career on shock value: shocks wear off fast. Two years ago, when he
released ``Antichrist Superstar'' (Nothing/Interscope), he
titillated fans and scandalized fundamentalists by tearing up
Bibles and miming sex acts, while Internet rumors built his aura by
portraying his shows as orgies of raw sex and bloody sacrifices. It
was easy to miss the skepticism _ about stardom, demagoguery and
the hard sell _ that was also part of the songs, and Manson thrived
on the notoriety. But he couldn't top it.
</P>
<P>
   His current album, ``Mechanical Animals'' (Nothing/Interscope),
revives the artifices of glam-rock. As the songs lash out against
dehumanization _ from drug-induced numbness to loveless sex to
media brainwashing _ the music harks back to mid-1970s David Bowie
and to early disco; it's more melodic than Manson's past songs,
relying on tunes as well as howling and brute force.
</P>
<P>
   Onstage, Manson wore glossy costumes and feathered accessories,
not the rags and stage blood of his Antichrist act. He was using
the glittery trappings of show business to decry the hollowness of
a show-business mentality.
</P>
<P>
   But a clean and shiny Manson just isn't as scary as the old one,
even with a band whose guitars generate sternum-vibrating power
chords while the drums summon an earth-shaking stomp. (The band's
drummer, Ginger Fish, had a kit with three big bass drums, although
he only had two feet.) Manson's listeners are used to show business
that pretends to subvert or attack insincerity and materialism;
it's the gimmick behind every other youth-oriented ad campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Compared to his old battle with all authority, distress over
phoniness is a relatively minor concern, and his tales of
alienation and anguish don't play as well as his old hostility.
That's why, although songs like ``I Don't Like the Drugs (but the
Drugs Like Me)'' are antidrug, he acted as if he were flouting
taboos.
</P>
<P>
   The parts of the show that drew the biggest applause were
revived from the Antichrist tour, including a song with Manson
walking around on stilts and long canes, looking like a giant
insect, and a song where he ranted from a pulpit and tore up one
more Bible. He feigned sex with his backup singers; he rubbed his
codpiece. At the end of the show, he pulled down the drum kit while
the other musicians abused their own instruments. And it all seemed
like a rerun _ one more step on the way to Manson's appearance,
circa 2005, as one of the Hollywood Squares.

RILEY SHOULD BE REWARDED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The postseason awards are starting to roll out, and all that
should be said is, expect the expected.
</P>
<P>
   You already know that Texas tailback Ricky Williams will win the
Heisman Trophy. That was guaranteed when he made the cover of
Sports Illustrated.
</P>
<P>
   But it would be nice if some courageous choices were made
instead of just giving awards to whoever has the best record or
stats.
</P>
<P>
   A perfect example is the Pacific-10 Conference's Coach of the
Year award.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA's Bob Toledo will probably win because the Bruins look like
they will make the Fiesta Bowl and could win the national
championship. Or maybe Arizona's Dick Tomey will be rewarded for
leading the Wildcats to a 10-1 record heading into Friday's game
with Arizona State.
</P>
<P>
   But in terms of pure coaching, the winner should be Oregon
State's Mike Riley.
</P>
<P>
   Riley has taken over the worst program in the conference and led
the Beavers to their best record (5-6) since 1971. He brought them
within a whisker of a bowl bid and defeated archrival Oregon for
only the fourth time in the past 24 years.
</P>
<P>
   With a walk-on quarterback, Riley came within one point of
defeating Washington (35-34) and Cal (20-19), and took UCLA to the
wire (41-34).
</P>
<P>
   Heaven forbid that the coaches will get together on their
conference call and do anything but the predictable. The coaching
award will probably be rubber-stamped so fast, Riley's name won't
even be mentioned.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, the coaches won't spend too much time worrying about
themselves if they're arguing about who the first-team quarterback
should be.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA's Cade McNown, who just won the Unitas Award, has led the
Bruins to a perfect 10-0 mark. He's thrown for 2,617 yards, with 18
touchdowns and 10 interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   Will it be enough to keep Oregon's Akili Smith on the second
team? Smith has thrown for 3,307 yards, with 30 touchdowns and
seven interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   McNown's efficiency rating 146.3. Smith's is 170.4. McNown is
probably the toughest quarterback in the nation, and the best at
pulling out a late victory.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the coaches have one tough decision to make, after all.
</P>
<P>
   Out of control: Some of the thousands of fans who rushed
Mississippi State's field got unruly after the Bulldogs upset
Arkansas. One man jumped on the back of Hogs guard Russ Brown. The
man was thrown off and came at Brown again. Brown, who bench
presses more than 500 pounds, drilled him in the face and that
settled the matter.
</P>
<P>
   Security personnel who witnessed the incident said Brown acted
reasonably and faced no disciplinary action from Arkansas coach
Houston Nutt.
</P>
<P>
   Worth the wait: Minnesota's fifth-year seniors never had carried
a trophy off the field, until Saturday's 49-7 romp over Iowa. Until
then, those seniors had lost every time the Gophers played for the
Little Brown Jug (Michigan), Paul Bunyan's Axe (Wisconsin) or Floyd
of Rosedale (Iowa), which is actually a pig, and apparently weighs
close to the real thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``That pig is heavy,'' Gophers fifth-year senior linebacker Parc
Williams said. ``My shoulder was starting to get tired.''
</P>
<P>
   Off the hook: If any bowl begged for the worst _ and was granted
its wish _ involving a local team, it was the San Diego-based
Holiday Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Had San Diego State qualified for the WAC title game, then won
it, Holiday officials could have had to choose between the Aztecs
and Nebraska to play opposite a Pac-10 team in the Dec.30 game.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would definitely (have been) a no-win situation for us,''
John Reid, the game's executive director said. ``There's no way we
(could have) made everyone happy with that one.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cornhuskers have already promised a contingent that could
reach 30,000 if invited to San Diego. The key, besides a better TV
rating, is the new money that would be poured into the economy from
those visiting Huskers fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be huge,'' Reid said. ``From the image standpoint to
the hotel rooms... everything would be phenomenal.''
</P>
<P>
   Nebraska took 33,000 to its nonconference game at Cal this
season.
</P>
<P>
   No answers: Penn State was outscored 79-12 in its three most
important games of the season, conferences losses at Ohio State,
Michigan and Wisconsin, all of which finished in a three-way tie
for the Big Ten title.
</P>
<P>
   In their last five conference defeats last season and this
season, the Nittany Lions have been clobbered by a 162-34 margin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know where our team is,'' coach Joe Paterno said. ``I
don't know whether we just played three teams that played so well
or are so much better than we are.... I wish I had the answers, but
I don't.''
</P>
<P>
   Clemson candidates: The short list at Clemson reportedly
includes Tulane's Tommy Bowden, Virginia Tech's Frank Beamer,
Mississippi's Tommy Tuberville and Miami's Butch Davis.
</P>
<P>
   Over at South Carolina, Lou Holtz has emerged as the top
candidate, thanks to his tight relationship with athletic director
Mike McGee. &QL;

 &HT;    EMBARGOED UNTIL NOVEMBER 29
 &HT;    Unseen hands can be writer's guardian angel or a usurping
nightmare
 &HT;    By Michael Skube
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   In literature, even more than in journalism, the editor's hand
is unseen and unsuspected. Browsers in the bookstore look for
labels like anyone else. The label is the author's name. The book
that says ``By John Irving'' has a better chance of being picked
up, opened for inspection and eventually bought than the book that
says ``By Irving Johnson.'' Brand names sell, whether it's books or
beans.
</P>
<P>
   But the name on a book also, of course, implies things personal.
Immersed in a novel, readers assume _ not always consciously _ that
the words and the story are the author's. (What else does it mean
to say ``By John Irving''?) It is not an unreasonable assumption.
Editors, even when their existence is acknowledged, are
afterthoughts. Most readers, even if they've heard of Maxwell
Perkins, couldn't say what editors do, only that they're somehow
involved. But it doesn't matter; it's the author that counts.
</P>
<P>
   One would think so, and yet the strange relationship between the
late Raymond Carver and Gordon Lish, as D.T. Max wrote recently in
The New York Times Magazine, raises issues that could almost be
called truth-in-labeling. At the least, it leads one to wonder how
much of a book was Carver and how much was Lish.
</P>
<P>
   One byline, two voices
</P>
<P>
   No one knew this better than Carver, who died in 1988. Grateful
at first for Lish's editorial experience, he later resented his
editor's intrusive hand _ much as Thomas Wolfe broke with Perkins
because he was hurt that people said he was only a volcano of words
whose work Perkins funneled into a novel. But where Perkins served
as a midwife, Lish did something very different. He not only cut
words and passages, but did wholesale rewriting. In Carver's
short-story collection ``What We Talk About When We Talk About
Love,'' for example, Lish rewrote 10 of the 13 endings.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the spare, ``minimalist'' prose that made Carver an
avant-garde writer of the late '70s and early '80s _ and
establishment fiction today _ was as much Lish's doing as Carver's.
But no one knew it at the time _ only Lish and Carver, and then
Carver's widow, the poet Tess Gallagher, and a small circle of
literary friends in whom he confided his misgivings. Perhaps only a
writer knows how essential stylistic control can be, but also how
the desire to be published, to see one's words in print, can tempt
one to bargain with the devil.
</P>
<P>
   Seven years ago, Lish's papers were sold to the Lilly Library at
Indiana University, enabling scholars and journalists such as Max
to see the extent to which Carver's reputation rested on the
handiwork of an editor whose own fiction sold poorly. Reading
Lish's fiction, Max writes, was like ``looking at the gears of a
clock that's missing a face.'' It was sterile, cold, artificial.

   Carver, whatever his deficiencies, was none of those things. But
_ like many fiction writers today _ he almost certainly needed an
editor who was more than a midwife; he needed someone who could
help him write English prose. ``Lish,'' D.T. Max writes, ``was
constantly on guard against what he saw as Carver's creeping
sentimentality. In the original manuscripts, Carver's characters
talk about their feelings. They talk about regrets. When they do
bad things, they cry. When Lish got hold of Carver, they stopped
crying. They stopped feeling. Lish loved deadpan last lines, and he
freely wrote them in.''
</P>
<P>
   `Bullying and competitive' changes
</P>
<P>
   More often than not, Max thinks, Lish's revisions were for the
better: ``His additions gave the stories new dimensions, bringing
out moments that I was sure Carver must have loved to see.'' It was
other changes _ ``bullying and competitive'' _ that were troubling.
``Lish,'' Max writes, ``was redirecting Carver's vision at the
service of his own fictional goals. The act felt parasitic.'' Lish
saw himself as Carver's ventriloquist. ``I could not believe no one
had stumbled onto what was going on,'' he told Max.
</P>
<P>
   Unseen hands have been suspected of holding the pen before, of
course. People have speculated _ with no evidence _ that Harper
Lee's childhood friend Truman Capote was the real author of ``To
Kill a Mockingbird.'' But here, in the archives of the Lilly
Library, was a case where two hands were clearly visible.
</P>
<P>
   When Carver broke with Lish, the rupture was never healed, and
Lish, now retired, told Max that while he doesn't enjoy talking
about ``the Carver period,'' he was bitter over the betrayal by
``this mediocrity'' he claims to have made a celebrity.
</P>
<P>
   For Carver's friends and his widow, Lish's words _ and his
papers at the Lilly Library _ are less an embarrassment than a
diminution of a reputation they believe was rightfully Carver's.
His later work, published after Lish was out of the picture, shows
a fuller, more developed voice. But their loyalty, as Max writes,
``goes deeper than his work. Born in the rural Northwest, Carver
was the son of an alcoholic sawmill worker and a waitress. He first
learned to write through a correspondence course.'' He wrote about
the working poor. Before his death from lung cancer at age 50, he
had known poverty and had struggled with his own alcoholism. ``His
life,'' as Max writes, ``inspired faith, not skepticism.''
</P>
<P>
   Writing, as the cliche goes, is always an act of faith, and any
writer is forever appreciative of the guardian angel he calls his
editor. But it is finally the words that count most, and the
knowledge that they are his and not someone else's.

 &HT;    Line aims to conceal men's fear of makeup
 &HT;    By A. Scott Walton
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   No one questions the age-old male practice of smearing
greasepaint over the face for camouflage while hunting or warring.
</P>
<P>
   So why should anyone question if a man wears Camo to conceal
blemishes while he hunts for a new job or does battle in a
courtroom?
</P>
<P>
   That's what Nashville-based makeup artist Michele Probst says in
defense of her year-old line of flaw-fixing facial products for
men. Probst's Menaji brand Camo concealer, 911 eye gel, lip balm,
moisturizer, masque and skin toner grew out of her experience
making up the faces of men such as Vice President Al Gore, Dallas
Cowboys quarterback Troy Aikman and world boxing champion Evander
Holyfield for their public and television appearances.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started getting requests for little cosmetic kits my clients
could keep with them and use when I wasn't around,'' Probst said.
Politicians and television announcers routinely wear makeup, she
said, and it's only a matter of time before cosmetics catch on
among men in other professions as well.
</P>
<P>
   Tired eyes, sagging skin, dry lips and blemishes can all detract
from the impression a man makes on the people he works with. By now
it's a well-known fact that more men are resorting to cosmetic
surgery to make them appear more youthful and attractive as they
advance in age and their careers.
</P>
<P>
   Men aren't immune to vain tendencies. But they're generally not
comfortable with the notion of entering that female-dominated
domain of cosmetic use either.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't use the `M' word (makeup) because we know it puts
lots of men off,'' Probst said. To distinguish her ``camouflage''
products from makeup, she sells Menaji mainly in specialty shops
such as Bachrach menswear store at Cumberland Mall in Atlanta. And
unlike makeup, which embellishes the eyes and lips and cheekbones,
Menaji products were formulated to blend in invisibly against the
skin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Half the battle is getting the products into a man's
bathroom,'' Probst said. ``Once they see you can't see the products
on, they're more confident about using them.''
</P>
<P>
   The products range in price from $12 for the lip balm to $30 for
the eye gel. That may sound pricey, but Probst contends that it's
more the fear of being seen buying cosmetics than the cost that
makes men reluctant.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fifty percent of our sales at retail are women buying for the
men in their lives. And another large percentage of our sales _ to
men _ are made over the Internet because of the anonymity it
provides.''
</P>
<P>

   COOLIDGE: says Moon.
</P>
<P>
   Nurture, not nature
</P>
<P>
   A quail plantation is anything but a nature preserve.
</P>
<P>
   On a quail plantation, nature is bent to the owner's single
purpose. And that purpose is to propagate wild quail.
</P>
<P>
   At whatever cost.
</P>
<P>
   In the old days when, for instance, late Coca-Cola patriarch
Robert Woodruff bought parcels of land and built his famous
30,000-acre quail plantation and retreat, Ichauway, land sold for
$1 an acre or less. That was the late 1920s.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, when The Limited chairman Leslie Wexner bought
8,000 acres of the old Tallassee Plantation, he paid $17 million.
</P>
<P>
   He promptly renamed it Abigail (after his wife), tore down the
old plantation home and is building a new 30,000-square-foot
showpiece.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody buys a plantation for profit.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you think a quail plantation can take care of itself,
you're crazy,'' says Ben Hardaway. A wealthy Columbus construction
company executive and self-published author (``Never Outfoxed: The
Hunting Life of Benjamin H. Hardaway III''), he once owned the Lee
County quail plantation Senah.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no way to make one break even, or even come close,''
Hardaway says.
</P>
<P>
   Curt Hall, owner of Plantation Services in Albany, the chief
broker of quail plantations in the state, estimates the cost of
annual maintenance between $100,000 and $600,000.
</P>
<P>
   What that translates into is this: You can buy quail at the
grocery for about $2 a piece. On the most efficiently run
plantation, that bird you're about to bite into for dinner cost
roughly $3,000.
</P>
<P>
   But that hasn't dimmed the appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get calls all the time from people who say `Look, if you've
got something, call me,'' says Hall. ``There are more people out
there who want one than places available.''
</P>
<P>
   Pinebloom's operation is typical for its size.
</P>
<P>
   The plantation has a year-round staff of 18, and enough
equipment to build a highway: a pair of $130,000 front-end loaders;
a road grader; dumptruck, and fleet of pickup trucks, not to
mention farm equipment to work the assortment of crops grown mainly
to feed the quail population.
</P>
<P>
   Corn, millet, wheat, sorghum.
</P>
<P>
   The process of creating a ``natural'' quail habitat is as
meticulous and never-ending as building a Japanese garden.
Hardwoods are bulldozed, stacked and burned because they create too
much shade and thwart the growth of the underbrush where quail
breed and thrive.
</P>
<P>
   There are some environmental benefits in this. The remaining
stands of long-leaf pine in Georgia still exist mainly because of
quail plantation owners' policy of thinning and burning.
</P>
<P>
   Pines are planted and thinned in precise rows, again to allow
the growth of underbrush. Between these sparse areas are spaced
``safe havens'': thickets of briars impenetrable to man or shotgun
pellet.
</P>
<P>
   Without a place to flee the hunt after they've been flushed,
quail might move to the property next door. Interspersed between
these are feed plots of corn and wheat and seed sprinkled by crews
constantly working the woods.
</P>
<P>
   Usually the day after quail season, the burning begins. On a
properly maintained quail plantation, 60 percent of the land is
burned to keep the underbrush down and flush out and kill the
rodent and snake population.
</P>
<P>
   Every year.
</P>
<P>
   A hunter can tell a obsessively kept quail habitat by the black
scorch marks at the base of the pine trees.
</P>
<P>
   Cultivate the population
</P>
<P>
   In the fall before quail season, Tallahassee-based Tall Timbers
Research Station, a group funded by plantation owners (annual
budget: $350,000) to perfect the art of propagating wild quail,
hosts an annual seminar on its latest findings.
</P>
<P>
   Between a barbecue lunch outdoors under a yawning canvas and
tours of the grounds, researchers and wildlife experts offer
plantation managers and owners the latest findings.
</P>
<P>
   Which are always the same.
</P>
<P>
   Do whatever is legal, and environmentally sound _ or, at least
unassailable by the Environmental Protection Agency _ to eliminate
everything that stands between you and a thriving quail population.
</P>
<P>
   That includes trapping, in many cases killing, quail predators _
including raccoon, fox, bobcat, coyotes, possum, even deer, which
eat the grain intended for the birds.
</P>
<P>
   The first week of November, the group held its annual Fall Field
Day at Foshalee Plantation, in Florida, just south of the Georgia
line. The parking lot was filled with pick-up trucks and sports
utility vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd of about 250 was mostly dressed for the bush.
</P>
<P>
   Before lunch, the group caravaned around the property, stopping
for demonstrations. At one, a state wildlife agent demonstrated
dog-proof traps for raccoon and fox.
</P>
<P>
   ``This one works real well capturing coon,'' explained the
agent, holding up one in a series of metal contraptions. ``And it's
a lot less chewing (off their own legs). So it's more humane.''
</P>
<P>
   The agent offered another tip for bait. Something dogs won't
eat.
</P>
<P>
   Marshmallows.
</P>
<P>
   After lunch, a succession of plantation managers offered their
secrets to creating the perfect quail haven. Bob Walthallmanager of
Sunny Hill explained this his ``boss' goal is to shoot a covey rise
every 15 minutes a hunt. And last year, we shot a little better
than 4 coveys an hour.''
</P>
<P>
   To achieve that required, among other things, removing 2,000
tractor trailer loads of hardwood from the plantation.
</P>
<P>
   ``My boss calls me two or three times a week,'' said Walthall.
``And he never asks how the trees are doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Country clubbing
</P>
<P>
   One of the main reasons Charlie Loudermilk took Aaron Rents
public in 1982 was to raise the cash to buy a plantation. He had
fallen in love with quail hunting in the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, he could afford his dream game preserve.
</P>
<P>
   Before quail season, he shoots dove. And, west of the house is a
duck pond with blinds. Duck season is coming, too. And crews put
out feed to keep the flocks around.
</P>
<P>
   He is fastidious about maintaining Woodhaven. The property has a
full-time staff of 8. And, if there's anything that galls
Loudermilk, it's litter on the property.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I find trash _ a can or a cigarette butt _ I think `what
slovenliness,''' he says. Even with his wealth, he runs Woodhaven
on a tight budget.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really liking my $10 magnolias,'' he says, as we wheel
past several of the newly purchased trees, 4-feet tall, sitting
under an oak tree in plastic pots. A sprinkler is watering them.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Atlanta, those would cost $50.''
</P>
<P>
   Golf has gone well this morning.
</P>
<P>
   Charlie's had three pars.
</P>
<P>
   He's beating the reporter by a stroke. Not difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Still, his wife had joked before the round: ``Charlie can't
stand to lose.''
</P>
<P>
   On the tee box of No. 5 we come upon a turtle, black and about
the size of a frisbee. What transpires is the kind of scene Tom
Wolfe would have loved to have witnessed researching his novel.
</P>
<P>
   Like Wolfe's account of the quail crowd watching horses mate,
for amusement, in``A Man In Full'' _ which the author says he saw
happen _ it seems pure fiction.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's that?'' asks the reporter.
</P>
<P>
   ``A turtle,'' says Charlie. ``I think it's dead.''
</P>
<P>
   Charlie pulls out his 7-iron and flips the turtle over. It
starts crawling away.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's alive,'' says the reporter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not for long,'' says Charlie.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're going to kill it?''
</P>
<P>
   ``You're damn right I'm going to kill it. They eat baby ducks.''
</P>
<P>
   He takes the 7-iron and whacks at the turtle's head several
times, missing. Finally, on the fifth blow, he cracks the shell
with a sickening crunch. Crimson blood oozes out.
</P>
<P>
   He wipes the club on the grass. Picks another club and tees off.
His shot finds the green and he pars the hole.
</P>
<P>
   When we get back to the main house, he strolls the grounds with
the plantation manager, chatting. That afternoon on the tee box of
the 5th hole, the turtle is gone.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't belong.

 CANCUN: Maria Bustamante.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Until the mid-1990s, Cancun had served Mexico's traffickers much
as other coastal resorts. It was a place to relax, to launder
profits and to take delivery of the occasional load of South
American cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   But after the police seized a tractor-trailer laden with cocaine
near Chetumal in 1995, a group of drug-enforcement agents,
including several military officers, traveled to Quintana Roo to
investigate further.
</P>
<P>
   In a secret July 1997 report to federal prosecutors, the
director of Mexico's anti-drug police, Lt. Col. Edgardo Cedillo
Gonzalez, outlined some explosive findings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Allow us to inform you that great quantities of drugs,
including cocaine, are being smuggled through Quintana Roo,
approximately four tons a week,'' states the report, a copy of
which was given to The New York Times by an opponent of the
governor. ``Among those implicated in the criminal organization is
the state governor, Mario Villanueva, alias `El Chueco.'''
</P>
<P>
   Police commanders were coordinating the drug shipments, the
report says, while the staff chemist at the local office of the
federal attorney general was employed by the traffickers to analyze
the purity of cocaine shipments. One Chetumal merchant was
routinely carrying cash bribes from the drug mafia directly to
Villanueva, the report says.
</P>
<P>
   The officer's report identifies the smuggler in charge in the
state as Ramon Alcides Magana. Mexican and U.S. officials say
Magana is a former army lieutenant and federal police officer who
went to work for the powerful trafficker, Amado Carrillo Fuentes,
as a bodyguard. He was promoted to manage Carrillo Fuentes'
operations in Cancun, shortly before pressure on the traffickers'
air routes prompted them to ship cocaine in speed boats into the
coastal marshes of Quintana Roo from Central America.
</P>
<P>
   Villanueva vigorously denied the accusations in the 1997 report,
emphasizing that enforcement of drug laws is a responsibility of
the federal government. ``We don't know what they do or where they
are,'' he said of the traffickers.
</P>
<P>
   When he first learned of the report, Villanueva said he flew
immediately to Mexico City to protest his innocence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I demand that you show me the files,'' he said he told
Madrazo, the attorney general. ``If I have something to do with
this, well, then investigate me!''
</P>
<P>
   Madrazo took the governor up on his offer. He had the special
prosecutor, Mariano Herran Salvatti, question Villanueva in detail
under oath for several hours.
</P>
<P>
   After that appearance, Villanueva told Mexican newspapers that
both Madrazo and Herran assured him that he had been cleared.
``They told me I was clean,'' he recalled, ``that there was nothing
on me.''
</P>
<P>
   But Herran told a different story.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no way that we could say Villanueva has been
exonerated, because only our investigation can determine that,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``To say he has nothing to do with drug trafficking just doesn't
correspond with what's happening.'' Herran continued, ``An
investigation with many lines of inquiry is under way, and at the
right moment the result will be made public.''
</P>
<P>
   As the investigations have broadened, the traffickers in
Quintana Roo have grown more brazen.
</P>
<P>
   Three times in the last year, officials said, Magana's gunmen
have kidnapped federal drug investigators. But when they made the
mistake of abducting an army lieutenant in a secret
narcotics-intelligence unit, they provoked a blow-torch response.
</P>
<P>
   Word of the kidnapping reached the defense minister, Gen.
Enrique Cervantes, just as the traffickers were starting to torture
the officer for information. According to officials familiar with
the incident, Cervantes flew into a fury. He sent one group of
soldiers, backed by armored personnel carriers, to surround
Magana's Mexico City home, trapping the trafficker's wife inside.
Then he sent three more planeloads of troops to Cancun, where they
started breaking down the doors of the traffickers' mansions.
</P>
<P>
   The raids turned up a trove of documents, Mexican and U.S.
officials said, including messages and notes that suggested that
state police officials had been alerting the traffickers about drug
agents' movements in Quintana Roo. The soldiers also found papers
to a car driven in Magana's escort convoy. It was registered with
the Quintana Roo police and assigned to Oscar Garcia Davila, whom
investigators identified as the leader of the lieutenant's
kidnappers.
</P>
<P>
   A year earlier, Garcia had been hired to command police
operations in Cancun and the northern part of the state only months
after he had been purged from the federal police for corruption.
</P>
<P>
   After the army's June raids in Cancun, federal investigators
announced that they had identified Garcia as Magana's security
chief, and said they had discovered a state police credential
indicating that he was still on active duty. He is now a fugitive.
</P>
<P>
   Villanueva, who still refers to Garcia by his first name, says
he knew nothing of his ties to the traffickers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did not know that Oscar was involved in that kind of
situation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the twilight of his six-year term, when most governors are
quietly preparing to retire or positioning themselves for another
job, Villanueva has been unusually busy.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, he became embroiled in a contretemps with U.S.
diplomats after the U.S. consul in Cancun complained that he had
been threatened by one of the governor's aides for complaining
about official foot-dragging in the investigation of the death of a
U.S. tourist.
</P>
<P>
   In June, Villanueva sent the state congress a package of
constitutional reforms, one of which sought to reduce the period in
which a public servant could be held accountable for crimes
committed during their time in office.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition deputies quickly dubbed it ``the impunity law.''
Faced with the prospect of an embarrassing debate that would focus
on his own political troubles, the governor quietly withdrew the
bill.
</P>
<P>
   Another attempt to safeguard his future ended in a noisy
confrontation _ this time with the leaders of his own party.
</P>
<P>
   When Villanueva encouraged several of his closest associates to
seek the PRI's nomination to succeed him as governor, the party's
national leadership blocked their candidacies. After weeks of
infighting, the nomination was finally won in a September primary
by Joaquin Hendricks Diaz, a former army officer who had been seen
as a dark horse.
</P>
<P>
   The prospect of his governorship does not bode well for
Villanueva. Relations between the two have been cool since 1995,
when Hendricks, as the PRI's state president, displayed an
independent streak that enraged the governor, several members of
the party said.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, Hendricks noticed plainclothes police officers outside his
home. Then a friend reported that the governor had ordered his
arrest.
</P>
<P>
   Panicked, Hendricks crawled into the trunk of a car and fled
Chetumal with one of his relatives at the wheel.
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, the two men reconciled. And after Hendricks won
the PRI nomination this fall, the governor expressed support for
his candidacy. But Villanueva's frustrations with Mexico City
boiled over soon afterward.
</P>
<P>
   In a rambling, late-night speech last month to Quintana Roo's
PRI leaders, he accused both the party's national president,
Mariano Palacios, and its secretary general, Carlos Rojas, for
meddling in the state's affairs. In remarks that made headlines
around the country, he demanded an apology from Palacios and a
resignation from the leader's deputy.
</P>
<P>
   Rojas shot right back. Noting that Villanueva had garbled
Hendricks' name in the speech, he insinuated that the governor was
drunk when he delivered it. ``He was not in the best of
conditions,'' Rojas told reporters. Villanueva denied the
accusation.
</P>
<P>
   Were prosecutors to recommend bringing charges against
Villanueva, it would pose an agonizing choice for Zedillo.
</P>
<P>
   Dropping the case could weaken his authority. But pursuing it
aggressively might create new turmoil in the PRI just a year before
crucial national elections.
</P>
<P>
   Villanueva said he was not worried about the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``I abide by the law, and if something wrong has been done in my
administration, I'll take responsibility,'' he said. ``If they want
to put me on trial, there are lawyers who can manage things in
courts.''

 &HT;    EMBARGOED UNTIL NOVEMBER 29
 &HT;    My kingdom for a quail
 &HT;    By Jeffry Scott
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   COOLIDGE, Ga. _ It's a good morning on the quail plantation.
</P>
<P>
   Sun is brilliant. Sky is clear.
</P>
<P>
   Warm as toast.
</P>
<P>
   And, over a breakfast of grits, scrambled eggs, bacon, biscuits,
coffee and orange juice, served by live-in servants Hayward and
Yvonne Wiggins, Charles Loudermilk, 71, is musing on his place in
literary history.
</P>
<P>
   Founder and chairman of Aaron Rents Inc. and worth $100 million,
Loudermilk is dining with a reporter and his slender, gracious
42-year-old wife of a year, Courtney, on the glassed sun porch of
their 20,000-square-foot, columned mansion. The mansion is at the
end of a live oak lined driveway, in the middle of his 4,500-acre
quail hunting ``plantation,'' Woodhaven.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the inspiration for Charlie Croker, the main character in
Tom Wolfe's new novel, ``A Man in Full,'' isn't Atlanta real estate
mogul Tom Cousins.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it's Charlie Loudermilk.
</P>
<P>
   Cousins, like Croker, is a real estate empire builder. Croker
owns the fictional quail plantation Turpmtine. Cousins owns the
6,900-acre quail plantation Nonami.
</P>
<P>
   But Loudermilk, like Croker, attended Georgia Tech and injured
his knee playing football. Not only that, says Loudermilk, ``I have
a `trophy wife' who is 39 years younger than me.''
</P>
<P>
   Courtney smiles, reaches over and tugs her husband's sleeve.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not 39,'' she says. ``It's 29.''
</P>
<P>
   Loudermilk, whose creased face is still impish, tucks his chin,
bites his lower lip and flares his cheeks in a comic grimace.
</P>
<P>
   ``OK, 29,'' he says, shrugging.
</P>
<P>
   For a few minutes he chats about Atlanta politics, picks at his
eggs and sips coffee, then puts both hands flat on the table and
looks at the reporter:
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's play some golf.''
</P>
<P>
   On his own course, of course.
</P>
<P>
   Just as Tom Cousins has at Nonami.
</P>
<P>
   We thrum by golf cart past the accouterments of life as a baron
amongst the pine barrens.
</P>
<P>
   Past the bronze Jaguar sedan, across the garden-pebble driveway,
over neatly trimmed grass, under the leafy canopy of
Spanish-moss-draped live oaks, past the golf club house to the
first hole of a 10-hole course that would distinguish most country
clubs.
</P>
<P>
   ``My friends call this `Ye Olde Course at Coolidge,' '' says
Loudermilk.
</P>
<P>
   With a stiff swing he lofts a ball that lands short of the green
and recalls what good friend John Portman once told him about his
golf game.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me I play like the Japanese _ I hit it straight every
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, when the well-known Atlanta architect was here during
quail season, Loudermilk told his golfing buddy what he thought of
his hunting habits. Portman refused to hunt. He said he couldn't
``kill little birds.'' That comment got in the newspaper. So
Loudermilk sent Portman a note.
</P>
<P>
   ``I called him a candy ass,'' says Loudermilk, laughing.
</P>
<P>
   The trick is to get invited
</P>
<P>
   Life is different down here.
</P>
<P>
   Mainly, you have to be richer than Croesus to fully appreciate
it.
</P>
<P>
   Or be related to Croesus.
</P>
<P>
   Or at least be his investment banker.
</P>
<P>
   You have to belong.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of us drive through the red hills of southwest Georgia,
and outside our car window, the sweep of the landscape suggests an
Erskine Caldwell portrait: pine forests, peanut and cotton fields,
and small towns with names such as Moultrie, Cotton and Ochlocknee.
</P>
<P>
   But, out there, past the line of slash and longleaf pine, behind
discreet ``Posted: Keep Out'' signs along miles of well-tended
fence, is another world.
</P>
<P>
   God's Big Acres.
</P>
<P>
   It's the area between Albany and Thomasville known as the
``Plantation Belt.''
</P>
<P>
   For some of the richest people in America, this is their country
club: a patchwork of more than 80 plantations of vast acreages _
5,000, 10,000, 20,000 _ that translate into square miles devoted to
the bobwhite quail, ``The Prince of Gamebirds.''
</P>
<P>
   On these plantations _ with names such as Nilo, Nonami,
Pineland, Pinebloom, Abigail, Wild Fair _ there remain some of the
last vestiges of the antebellum plantation South, cultivated by
people with fortunes difficult to fathom.
</P>
<P>
   Millionaires, billionaires, magnates of virtually every
industry.
</P>
<P>
   Some come from old money. The Mellon family, for example, owns
Pineland. Nilo plantation is owned by the family of the late head
of Olin Industries, John Olin.
</P>
<P>
   Others are the showpiece sanctuaries of a new generation _ the
trophy rich: Charlie Loudermilk; Tom Cousins (Nonami); real estate
developer John Varner (Wild Fair); businessman and Zell Miller
crony Virgil Williams (Southern Heritage); Ted Turner (Avalon, in
North Florida); the Smith family, owners of the Atlanta Falcons
(Seminole); Leslie Wexner, chairman of the Limited (Abigail).
</P>
<P>
   It is a hospitable world.
</P>
<P>
   The trick is to get invited.
</P>
<P>
   Because, mostly, it is an intensely private realm where the
network is the net worth. It is a place made more circumspect of
outsiders since the publication of Wolfe's ``A Man in Full.''
</P>
<P>
   Elements of the novel, with its vivid scenes of the privileged
rich shotgunning birds and watching horses mate, portray the
plantation as a kind of below-the-gnat-line ``Bonfire of the
Vanities.''
</P>
<P>
   Outsiders seeking access are usually met with a cordial
``thanks, but no thanks.''
</P>
<P>
   Wita Harbert, the widowed owner of Pinebloom, agreed to let a
reporter and photographer tour her plantation. A sprawling
12,000-acre spread 12 miles south of Albany, its proportions are
staggering.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, Pinebloom is 10 miles across. Its acreage of
woods, pastures, farmland, lakes and painstakingly maintained quail
habitat is networked with 100 miles of dirt roads.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Harberts really aren't interested in press,'' says
plantation manager Larry Moon, an affable bird dog trainer, his
face handsomely craggy from years of working outdoors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Celebrities don't come here. But many of the guests are rich.
When John (Wita's late husband, and builder of the Birmingham-based
Harbert construction empire) was here, he liked entertaining _ but
he really liked to hunt.
</P>
<P>
   ``And who he really liked to hunt with was somebody who could
make a million-dollar deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Pinebloom's owners have made 20th century accommodations to the
corporate jet set _ oil company executives, for instance _ and
family friends, including a posh guest quarters called the Swamp
House and a 5,700-foot, paved and lighted air strip large enough to
land a DC-10.
</P>
<P>
   There are stories from the old days, when U.S. Steel owned
Pinebloom (Harbert bought it in 1981), that one jet would land
carrying company executives, take off, and another jet would land
from Las Vegas. Its payload: chorus girls.
</P>
<P>
   Then they'd all meet at the Swamp House.
</P>
<P>
   Old manners
</P>
<P>
   The main house _ refurbished to period splendor with antiques
and paintings by a French designer who lived on the grounds for six
months _ was built in 1846 by slave labor. The white Greek Revival
manse is the former home of Alfred Holt Colquitt, Confederate Major
General, and later Georgia governor and U.S. senator.
</P>
<P>
   Many manners of the period are intact, too.
</P>
<P>
   One fixture of the mansion is the 81-year-old butler, Will
Rudolph, whom the Harberts kept on after they bought the plantation
from U.S. Steel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Harbert immediately liked me,'' says Rudolph. ``If he
really wanted to know what was going on at Pinebloom, he'd ask me.
He told me I was a member of the family.''
</P>
<P>
   In the mansion's downstairs study, there's a photograph of
Rudolph and Wita Harbert standing in front of the mansion's azalea
garden and holding by the feet a dead wild turkey Wita shot for
Thanksgiving.
</P>
<P>
   We eat lunch (vegetable soup and cornbread sticks) at the Skeet
House a mannish, dark-panelled club room with fireplace and
virtually every variety of local game _ turkey, deer, bass, wild
boar _ mounted on the wall. We are served by black help dressed in
white smocks and aprons. Lunch is summoned with a dinner bell.
</P>
<P>
   The most symbolic fixture and tradition of a quail plantation is
the hunting wagon: a polished wood rig with pneumatic tires, two
expensive leather car seat benches, pulled by mules in requisite
handsome leather and brass-knobbed harnesses.
</P>
<P>
   At Woodhaven, Charlie Loudermilk's black mule-driver, Willie
Johnson _ an employee on the plantation almost as long as the 17
years Loudermilk has owned it _ wore a dusty cap that says: ``Every
Day's Just Another Slice of Honey Dew Melon.''
</P>
<P>
   J.L. Jackson, a black man of 62, has been driving the hunting
wagon at Pinebloom for 16 years. He's wearing a nondescript cap. By
reputation he is gregarious.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Harberts like him on the wagon because he's very
entertaining to the guests,'' says Rudolph. ``He's always telling
stories and making jokes.''
</P>
<P>
   But, ask him about his job and his answers are short.
</P>
<P>
   You like quail hunting?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Ever shoot quail yourself?
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes.''
</P>
<P>
   Are you a good shot?
</P>
<P>
   ``Pretty good.''
</P>
<P>
   For guests, dinner at Pinebloom is served in the elegant main
house dining room, 7:45 p.m., sharp, by a butler and three maids.
During quail season (which began Nov. 15 and runs through February)
quail is often the main course; otherise, it's rib roast or
chicken.
</P>
<P>
   Coat and tie required.
</P>
<P>
   Strictly enforced.
</P>
<P>
   The protocol at Pinebloom is such a mix of Yacht Club, good ol'
boy, gun-blasting blue blood manners nobody except the owners seems
to exactly fit in.
</P>
<P>
   When author Tom Wolfe visited, having been introduced by Atlanta
friends, and former quail plantation owners themselves _ Atlanta
real estate mogul Mack Taylor and wife Mary Rose Taylor, head of
the Margaret Mitchell House _ Wita Harbert was impressed.
</P>
<P>
   Wolfe was outfitted in his trademark off-white plantation suit,
and she told him over iced tea: ``I really enjoyed `Bonfire of the
Vanities.'''
</P>
<P>
   But then the subject turned to hunting.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me he had been practicing shooting skeet in New York
and only hit 2 out of 200,'' recalls Harbert. ``I told him: `Honey.
You better not go shoot quail. You don't have a chance.'''
</P>
<P>
   A bird dog's life
</P>
<P>
   No visit to Pinebloom is complete without paying respects to the
bird dogs. Pinebloom has a kennel of 50 pointers and retrievers
(not far from the pasture with the plantation's 20 horses and
mules).
</P>
<P>
   But, only in their eternal repose do you get a true sense of the
bird dog's caste.

   In this world a good bird dog _ which can cost $20,000 _ is
revered.
</P>
<P>
   A great dog is enshrined.
</P>
<P>
   Underneath towering live oaks a few hundred yards from the main
house, Moon walks through the dog graveyard, surrounded by a short
white picket fence. In front of the graveyard is a life-sized dog
cast in bronze.
</P>
<P>
   Dogs are buried in pine caskets. Each grave is marked with an
elegantly simple, engraved granite headstone.
</P>
<P>
   There are humans with less dignified graves.
</P>
<P>
   One headstone reads: ``We Un of Pinebloom. 6/24/85 - 3/6/98.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That was Mrs. Harbert's favorite dog, a black Labrador
Retriever,'' says Moon. ``He used to ride on the hunting wagon with
her. She took him back to Birmingham, he got loose and was hit by a
car.''
</P>
<P>
   Moon sent to Birmingham for the body.
</P>
<P>
   We Un came back to Pinebloom. So did Mrs. Harbert.
</P>
<P>
   ``She said a few words at his funeral,'' says Moon.

<HEADLINE>
HYDE'S STAFF IS SAID TO DRAFT THREE ARTICLES OF IMPEACHMENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (gm) 
 By ALISON MITCHELL and ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As the House Judiciary Committee moves into the
final stages of its inquiry, Rep. Henry Hyde's senior staff is
beginning to draw up three articles of impeachment against
President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   A senior Republican official of the committee said Wednesday
that the drafting was in its ``very early stages'' and that any
proposals would have to be circulated for approval to the
committee's 21 Republican members. But the three articles that are
being considered would allege perjury, obstruction of justice and
witness tampering, and, on the basis of the president's repeated
assertion of legal privileges, abuse of power.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde, R-Ill., who is chairman of the committee, is overseeing
the work, which is being done by David Schippers, the investigative
counsel for the panel's majority, and Thomas Mooney, the
committee's staff director. As a young House aide to moderate
Republicans 24 years ago, Mooney helped draw up the articles of
impeachment that led to Richard M. Nixon's resignation in the
Watergate scandal.
</P>
<P>
   The committee official who spoke of the drafting Wednesday, on
the condition of anonymity, said that as part of the process, aides
were looking at the report sent the committee by Kenneth Starr, the
independent counsel, as well as the Watergate articles of
impeachment and impeachment cases against three federal judges.
</P>
<P>
   The committee staff is not preparing any version of a censure
resolution, even though many in the House believe that censure
could win approval on the House floor and that impeachment cannot.
While there have been routine contacts between the committee and
the Republican leadership, Republicans say there is little if any
coordination of a common strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Intent on finishing work soon, Hyde sent a letter to the White
House on Wednesday threatening to subpoena the president if he did
not respond by Monday to 81 questions sent to him by the committee
three weeks ago. White House officials say the president will
respond on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde may also ask his committee on Tuesday, after a hearing that
day into the consequences of perjury, to subpoena additional
witnesses, a Republican committee aide said. And he may soon seek a
vote to release documents held under seal in additional boxes that
Starr has sent the committee in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The Judiciary Committee is moving steadily along the path toward
recommending impeachment even though moderate Republicans outside
the committee and some experienced House Republican aides say they
think a floor vote on even a single count of perjury would be too
close to call. Any article beyond perjury would be ``doomed,'' said
one senior House Republican aide.
</P>
<P>
   Because Rep. Robert Livingston, the incoming speaker, has said
any lawmaker's vote on impeachment will be a vote of conscience,
Republican leaders are not conducting formal counts by the whip,
the leadership member who keeps such tabs. That makes House vote
estimates more fluid than usual.
</P>
<P>
   But Republicans outside the committee say they expect 15 to 20
of their members to defect, even on a perjury count. That means
that five to 10 Democrats would have to vote for impeachment for it
to prevail. (The House, where terms expire on Jan. 3, now has 228
Republicans, 206 Democrats and 1 independent, who usually votes
with the Democrats.)
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The chance that enough Democrats would break ranks to create a
majority for impeachment diminished this week when Rep. Paul McHale
of Pennsylvania, Clinton's most outspoken Democratic critic, called
for him to be censured instead. The political arithmetic is fueling
further calls, particularly from Democrats but from some
Republicans too, for censure rather than impeachment, and, although
Livingston has indicated that censure is not his first choice, he
has left the possibility open.
</P>
<P>
   But Rep. Tom DeLay, the majority whip, said on CNN Wednesday
that he wanted an impeachment vote and would fight censure. Other
Republicans say their party is in a no-win situation, whether it
pushes through impeachment on a near-party-line vote or else fails
on impeachment and does nothing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The worst thing this Congress or any Congress can do is
impeach a president on a straight party-line vote,'' said Ken
Johnson, a spokesman for Rep. W.J. ``Billy'' Tauzin, R-La. ``It
will effectively kill any hopes of reaching bipartisan compromises
on saving Social Security, protecting Medicare and cutting taxes,
and there are some people who think those issues are more important
than burning the president at the stake.''
</P>
<P>
   This unease among Republicans and the uncertainty of the vote
counts pose tactical problems for the Judiciary Committee, whose
Republicans are determined to move forward with impeachment on the
ground that Clinton's efforts to cover up his relationship with
Monica Lewinsky undermined the nation's system of justice.
</P>
<P>
   If, for example, committee Republicans decide to approve three
articles of impeachment, they must decide whether to wrap the
articles into one resolution, knowing this would almost guarantee
defeat on the floor. An alternative would be to send each of the
three counts to the floor, in hopes that one would be approved.
</P>
<P>
   In 1974, the three articles of impeachment against Nixon were
reported out of committee on three separate days, each as a
separate resolution ending ``Richard M. Nixon by such conduct
warrants impeachment and trial, and removal from office.'' Two
other proposed articles of impeachment were defeated in committee.
</P>
<P>
   An impeachment resolution could also be drafted in a way that
would allow lawmakers on the floor to seek separate votes on each
individual count. A senior Republican aide, outside the committee
said, ``I think they know their strongest case is perjury. If they
were not to report out a stand-alone article on perjury, it would
be a mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   Nicole R. Nason, a committee counsel, said, ``It is premature to
say exactly what a resolution of articles of impeachment would look
like.'' She said, ``Each article of impeachment must stand on its
own merit so at the appropriate time the members will have an
opportunity to review and debate the text.''
</P>
<P>
   Because the stakes are so high, Republicans and Democrats alike
say the committee's actual voting on articles of impeachment _
expected toward the end of the week of Dec. 7 _ could take several
days and likely will include scores of amendments. The Democrats
will offer at least one censure motion in committee although they
expect to lose.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans say it is Schippers, the Republican's chief
investigative counsel, who is most intent on a third article on
abuse of power. But they say it is not clear that all Republicans
on the committee will support that charge or a count on obstruction
of justice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both of those counts are very iffy,'' said an aide to one
committee Republican. He said a few Republicans have concerns about
those counts because the committee never questioned any major
witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans' deliberations are also likely to be affected by
how Clinton answers the 81 questions asking whether he admits or
denies dozens of points in Starr's impeachment report to Congress.
A number of the questions ask Clinton to admit or deny he gave
``false and misleading'' statements under oath in January and in
August.
</P>
<P>
   In his letter to the president, Hyde said that ``despite
repeated requests for more than a month, the White House has yet to
provide the committee with any materials that tend to exonerate you
or even dispute the evidence submitted'' by Starr. He said that if
the president did not reply by Monday, he would urge the committee
to issue a subpoena to Clinton. Hyde also offered the president or
his attorneys the chance to appear before the committee to defend
him.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials said Clinton will submit his response on
Friday. Aides involved in preparing the president's response said
Clinton will not admit to perjury or other offenses, but will
largely restate the answers to similar questions raised at his
January deposition in a sexual harassment suit by Paula Jones and
in his August grand jury testimony.
</P>
<P>
   The president's reply, which takes up about 20 typewritten
pages, is ``legalistic and breaks no new ground,'' said a senior
White House official who has seen a draft. Another official
familiar with the document said not a single answer is a simple
admission or denial. He called the answers, ``long, explanatory,
contextual and legalistic.''
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats too sent out letters on Wednesday. Rep. John
Conyers, D-Mich., asked Starr to answer numerous questions under
oath including whether he knew while he was testifying before the
committee and citing Samuel Dash as his ethics adviser that Dash
was resigning.
</P>
<P>
   And Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., asked Attorney General Janet
Reno to investigate whether Starr in House testimony disclosed the
contents of sealed court documents. He cited Starr's statements
that questions about Ms. Lewinsky's right to counsel had been
litigated. Starr's office could not be reached for comment late
Wednesday afternoon.

  (Sidebar with HOLIDAY-SHOPPING) 
(bl) 
 By SHARON R. KING   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Conspicuous consumption may be off a little this year, much like
many a Wall Street bonus, but a bit of luxury and indulgence is
definitely still in style. And for those on smaller budgets, the
appearance of luxury _ in, say, fake fur trims and gold- and
silver-colored candles, handbags and champagne flutes _ works just
as well.
</P>
<P>
   America's Research Group predicts that 40 percent of consumers
will spend more this year. With forecasts like that and consumer
confidence on an upswing, ``there's nothing to suggest the holiday
is going to be a bust,'' said John Konarski, director of research
for the International Council of Shopping Centers, which tracks
shopping trends. Whatever the budget, when it comes to holiday
shopping, emotion takes over.
</P>
<P>
   In the luxury corner, white gold, platinum and silver are
popular, turning up in everything from cross pendants to Edwardian
and Victorian designs inspired by the movie ``Titanic.'' Watches,
long a gift staple, feature dials with colors like gunmetal gray,
salmon or mother of pearl, and bracelet versions.
</P>
<P>
   Exotic travel locales, though, might bring to mind Indiana Jones
more than James Bond.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are looking for experiences,'' said Arnold Brown,
chairman of Weiner, Edrich, Brown Inc., a New York firm that helps
business analyze change.
</P>
<P>
   Holiday vacations this year, he says, are as likely to focus on
the self-indulgent luxury of a spa or cruise as on an educational
trip such as an ecology tour or whale watching.
</P>
<P>
   Low-end computers, priced under $1,000, will make their way into
the homes of many shoppers, from retirees and other first-time
buyers to families adding a model exclusively for the children.
Recent price cuts are also expected to help computer and video
games and cell phones disappear from store shelves, along with
hand-held computer devices.
</P>
<P>
   The trend in apparel leans toward the casual. Fleece pullovers,
the brighter the better, are flying off the shelves, said Thomas
Burns, senior vice president at the Doneger Group, retail
consultants based in New York.
</P>
<P>
   In women's clothing, cashmere is generally expected to sell
well, with many sweaters offered for $20 to $30 and up. But
analysts expect consumers to balk at the lowest-priced, thinnest
versions. Velvet and suede are also popular choices to add a hint
of luxury.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the gifts you can never go wrong with: books. But
move over, Martha Stewart; Oprah Winfrey reigns here. Though
cookbooks have long been a gift staple, this year mystery, suspense
and self-improvement are hot. And anything Ms. Winfrey picks for
her television book club is an instant best seller.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you go into a Barnes &AMP; Noble, they have a section that says
`Oprah's Picks,''' Konarski said. People believe that ``if Oprah
says it's good, it must be good.''
</P>
<P>
   And whether shoppers want them or not, scented soap and candles
will be inescapable. These days, few stores fail to carry them, in
all shapes, sizes and colors.
</P>
<P>
   Candles also offer a New Age twist. As 1999 brings the eve of a
millennium, a religious or mystical influence will be felt
everywhere from candles to jewelry and books to music.
</P>
<P>
   Convenience is gaining converts as Internet shopping continues
to grow, lifted by a broadening array of products available by
computer.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the last 15 years, I've done all my shopping from my
chair,'' whether by catalog or Internet, Brown admitted. ``You have
the list of all the people you're shopping for, and bang, bang,
bang, you do all the shopping.''

 MCI Customers Say They Were Overcharged  &HT;       
 By Deborah Solomon 
 &HT;     c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
Some customers of MCI WorldCom have filed two lawsuits against the
telecommunications giant, charging that it unfairly overcharged
subscribers for long-distance calls.
</P>
<P>
   Two class-action suits were filed in the wake of a Federal
Communications Commission decision this month ordering MCI WorldCom
to stop charging its highest rates to certain customers.
</P>
<P>
   The telecommunications company had been charging some
long-distance customers 38 cents per minute with a $2.49 surcharge
for domestic calls.
</P>
<P>
   Those rates, among the highest in the industry, were applied to
customers who had signed up with MCI, but were dropped from MCI's
discount calling plans because they didn't pay their bills within
90 days. Instead of just cutting off service to customers who don't
pay their bills, MCI continued to provide service, but at a higher
per-minute rate.
</P>
<P>
   The FCC ruled that practice was ``inherently confusing and
therefore, unreasonable'' and ordered MCI to stop. It also noted
that MCI may have been charging the higher rates to some customers
whose bills were in good standing.
</P>
<P>
   In a filing with the FCC, MCI said only about 1 percent of its
customers were affected, but two class-action lawsuits filed this
week say the number is much higher.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Girard, a San Francisco attorney, said hundreds of
thousands of MCI customers were charged the higher rates and should
get a refund. He filed a lawsuit in U.S. District Court in
Washington, D.C., seeking reimbursements for any MCI customer
affected by the rates, known in the industry as ``casual calling''
rates.
</P>
<P>
   Another law firm in Pensacola, Fla., has also filed a similar
suit seeking reimbursements for MCI customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that MCI has been applying the casual calling rates
to individuals who were not past due in their bills and they've
applied that in circumstances that have nothing to do with the
fault of the user,'' Girard said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It remains to be seen whether it was accidental or intentional
but we think customers are entitled to a refund.''
</P>
<P>
   Girard said MCI customers can determine if they were affected by
checking their bills for a surcharge.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Papantonio, an attorney in Florida, said he believes 5
percent of MCI's customers were charged the higher rates.
Papantonio said MCI probably owes customers several hundred
thousand dollars in reimbursements.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the affected customers included people who had moved to
another address and assumed they were still getting their old MCI
rate. Others were customers who had asked to be switched to a
different long-distance carrier, but whose requests were never put
through. In the interim, they were inadvertently dropped from the
subscriber list and charged the higher rate.
</P>
<P>
   The FCC did not fine or punish MCI, but said it would keep a
close watch on the company and could take ``remedial action'' in
the future.
</P>
<P>
   After the decision was issued, MCI said it would drop nonpaying
customers, rather than providing them with the long-distance
service at higher rates. The company did not return calls seeking
comment.

 Shopping the E-Mall  &HT;       
 By Jamie Beckett 
 &HT;     c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
Frustration, traffic jams, confusing pricing, no sales help. It's
not the mall _ it's the Web.
</P>
<P>
   With thousands of Web stores selling millions of items, finding
what you want online can be a chore. Enter the comparison-shopping
sites, which search other online shopping sites and promise to
ferret out the best deals. Once they scout out a product, most of
the comparison sites direct you to purchase it directly from the
e-retailer.
</P>
<P>
   But after a few days of trying to shop these sites, the mall is
looking more attractive.
</P>
<P>
   Comparison shopping on the Web can locate bargains. But too
often, the searches are clumsy, inaccurate or incomplete. All of
the sites omitted small online retailers. If you know what you
want, the Web is a great marketplace and the comparison sites can
provide a general idea of where to get it and what you might pay.
But if you don't, you'd better do your homework first.
</P>
<P>
   The Chronicle made a shopping list of items it hoped to buy on
the Web _ a Holiday Barbie, a Sony Digital Video Disc player, a
Black &AMP; Decker cordless drill, a copy of Tom Wolfe's new novel and
a pair of Nike Air Jordan athletic shoes. Then, we put five of the
comparison-shopping sites to work: Yahoo Shopping
 &LR; (shopping.yahoo.com &LR; ), Excite Product Finder  &LR; (jango.excite.com), &LR; 
Amazon.com's Junglee  &LR; (www.junglee.com), &LR;  mySimon
 &LR; (www.mysimon.com &LR; ) and bottomdollar  &LR; (www.bottomdollar.com). &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Luckily, we weren't counting on the shopping ``bots'' _ so
called because most act like electronic robots, going out to the
Web to find, retrieve and deliver information _ to do our holiday
shopping. Only two items _ the doll and the book _ were easy to
find. As for the DVD player, the drill and the shoes, we'd have had
better luck in the stores.
</P>
<P>
   We started with the Barbie, this year's version of the glittery
Yuletide doll. Excite's shopping engine found the largest number of
Barbies _ eight _ and what appeared to be the best price, $19.99
from FAO Schwarz. But the apparent bargain turned out not to be.
Besides being the 1997 Holiday edition, the sale Barbie was out of
stock.
</P>
<P>
   The second-best price, $29.97, came from Wal-Mart online, a site
located by Excite, mySimon and bottomdollar. Junglee, which only
searches merchants that pay to be listed, omitted Wal-Mart and
counted eToys' $32.99 Holiday Barbie as its best deal.
</P>
<P>
   Although we thought we'd done a fairly straightforward search,
some of what came back puzzled us. The mySimon bot inexplicably
retrieved three Teddy Bear listings along with the Barbies.
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo, which first searches affiliated merchants before
expanding to the Web, initially located only Barbies sold by FAO
Schwarz and Toysid, both for over $40.
</P>
<P>
   When the search was extended to the entire Web, Yahoo found,
among other things, Shrimp on the Barbie, a Wonder Bra called Miss
Barbie, a Holiday Ham and a Pine Cone Holiday Tin. But not one
Holiday Barbie.
</P>
<P>
   The second item on our list was the Digital Video Disc player,
which promises better sound and picture quality than a VCR. This
one was tough because we didn't really know what we should look for
in a DVD player and had no salespeople to assist us.
</P>
<P>
   For the purposes of the story, we decided on Sony's DVP-S500D, a
midlevel DVD player. Once again, Excite gave us the largest number
of listings, retrieving two of that model. But the low-price leader
was bottomdollar, which found one for $399 from J&AMP;R Music World _
$100 cheaper than the best price of the other sites. Yahoo found
one for $539.95 from Tek Gallery. Junglee only sent us to
Crutchfield's Web site, which provided specs on the equipment but
required you to call an 800 number for the price.
</P>
<P>
   Next up, the Black &AMP; Decker cordless drill. We didn't have a
model in mind, which was a good thing because only one of the
shopping engines, Yahoo, could find any cordless drills by Black &AMP;
Decker, and that was on its search of the entire Web.
</P>
<P>
   We decided to give our shopping sites an easy one and took a
look for a hardcover edition of Tom Wolfe's new novel, ``A Man in
Full.'' Four of the sites found it easily. But bottomdollar snagged
the best deal, landing a copy for $14.48 from shopping.com.
</P>
<P>
   Excite doesn't list books because it has a marketing agreement
with Amazon.com. After paying millions to be Excite's exclusive
bookseller, Amazon.com didn't like the idea of being stacked up
against competitors. Elsewhere on its site, Excite directs
book-buyers to Amazon.com and only Amazon.com.
</P>
<P>
   But the book search also netted a few surprises. According to
the sites, we could spend up to $396 for the very same book if we
were so inclined. We were not able to learn if this would buy us a
diamond-encrusted edition or if it would ensure that the author
gave a personal reading of the novel at our house.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the Nikes. A cinch, or so we thought. But only Yahoo
could find a way to buy the hot Air Jordans online, and that was
after we did a Web search. Yahoo's own shopping site did not
include it. Three other sites _ Excite, bottomdollar and mySimon _
don't list shoes.
</P>
<P>
   But Junglee really puzzled us. When we searched for Nike under
``shoes,'' it retrieved a list that included shorts and caps _ but
no shoes.

 Comparison Shopping For an ISP  &HT;       
 By David Einstein  
 c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; Question: &LR;  I need a new Internet service provider. I want unlimited
monthly use. There seem to be hundreds of choices available. Do you
have any suggestions on how to find a good ISP? And are there any
comparisons I could look at?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Answer: &LR;  You're right, there are hundreds of ISPs to choose
from in California _ and more than 5,000 throughout the country.
Finding one that suits your needs won't be difficult, though,
because most ISPs offer unlimited service for a monthly fee of
about $20. (Some go as low as $8 a month if you prepay for a year.)
For information about ISPs with local access numbers for your area,
go to either  &LR; www.boardwatch.com &LR;  or  &LR; www.isps.com. &LR;  Both Web sites
have extensive lists of ISPs and the services they offer.
</P>
<P>
   As for comparisons, rating ISPs is a little tough because there
are so many of them. You might check out an article by my
colleague, Jon Swartz, in the October 27 special Telecommunications
Section in which he spotlighted some of the top performers. You can
find the article at  &LR; sfgate.com, &LR;  The Chronicle's Web site.
</P>
<P>
   When choosing an ISP, the most important considerations should
be reliability, service and technical support. Above all, you
shouldn't have to suffer busy signals or other connection problems.
</P>
<P>
   Grammatically Correct
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have a Packard Bell PC which came with Microsoft Works.
Although it has a spell checker, we badly need a grammar checker
for my teenage daughter. Is there a patch or add-on I can download
without upgrading to Word?
</P>
<P>
   A: Not that I know of. However, you can get Word, complete with
grammar checker, as part of Microsoft's Works Suite 99. This
under-$100 package is one of the best bargains around. Besides
Word, it includes Works version 4.5, the Encarta Encyclopedia 99,
Money 99, a mapping program and a greeting card program.
</P>
<P>
   But if you want my advice, forget the software and get your
daughter a good English grammar workbook. That way, she might learn
how to use the language so she wouldn't have to depend on a
computer. An electronic grammar checker can clean up her work and
possibly even improve her grades, but in the long run, she won't
know any more about English than she does now.
</P>
<P>
   The same goes for spell checkers, which have given us a
generation of kids who don't know how to spell and don't care
because they can always ask the computer to bail them out.
</P>
<P>
   Little Black Book
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is there some way to print out the address book in the
Netscape e-mail program? It would be handy to have a copy while
traveling.
</P>
<P>
   A: You can't send the address book information directly to the
printer, but with the latest upgrade of Netscape Communicator,
version 4.5, you can save it and print it out using another program
like Word.
</P>
<P>
   Here's how: With your address book open, select the name of the
directory _ such as Personal Address Book _ that you want to save.
Then choose Export from the File menu. Give the file a name and
save it. You can choose a format that's compatible with Netscape
Communicator or one that works with a word processor or
spreadsheet.
</P>
<P>
   No More Cookies
</P>
<P>
   Q: A few months ago, you provided information on how to disable
cookies when using Netscape Navigator or Internet Explorer. Is
there also a way to do it in the newest 4.0 version of America
Online?
</P>
<P>
   A: There is indeed. But before I get to that, let's define
cookies for readers who aren't familiar with them. A cookie is a
tiny file sent to your browser by a Web site. It's used to store

 Montgomery Promotions Designed to Halt Defections  &HT;       
 By Sam Zuckerman 
 &HT;     c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
The recent executive shakeup at NationsBanc Montgomery Securities
is a gambit to build a core of loyalists at an investment bank
that's been racked by high-level defections, people close to the
firm said.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, the San Francisco firm unveiled a sweeping
reorganization of its sales, trading and research operations.
</P>
<P>
   Montgomery created a new supermanager position, director of
equities, and tapped Kent Logan, its longtime sales chief, to fill
it. In the new postion, Logan, 54, supervises sales, trading and
research.
</P>
<P>
   The firm also elevated several rising stars, most notably Scott
Kovalik who was promoted from chief Nasdaq stock trader to director
of trading. Logan's deputy, Craig Johnson, 44, rose to head of
sales.
</P>
<P>
   The previous head trader, 51-year-old Robert Kahan, resigned to
make way for Kovalik, 34. Jim McMahon, head of sales trading, also
left the firm.
</P>
<P>
   By promoting several key players, Montgomery's new chief
executive Lewis Coleman created a team of managers motivated to
stay, said insiders and investment banking rivals.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're providing opportunities for younger, rising corporate
managers,'' Logan said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Shoring up management is critical at Montgomery following a
demoralizing conflict between the firm's owner, North Carolina's
BankAmerica Corp., and its founder and former chief executive,
Thomas Weisel.
</P>
<P>
   Weisel quit Montgomery in September after a dispute with
BankAmerica over control of the junk-bond business. About half a
dozen senior managers, including technology investment banking
chief Sanford Miller, followed him out the door.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of Weisel's departure, rival firms said they were
planning to poach top Montgomery staff members. Montgomery insiders
said dozens of managers and employees could jump ship early next
year after 1998 bonuses are paid.
</P>
<P>
   Logan's promotion cemented his loyalty to Montgomery. ``I intend
to end my career here,'' the new director of equities said.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, the rise to head trader could keep Kovalik on board.
Praised by rival investment bankers for his unusual combination of
stock-trading skill and management acumen, Kovalik was considered a
prime recruitment target.
</P>
<P>
   Logan played down the notion that Montgomery's reorganization
was aimed at stanching defections.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would draw the analogy to a Silicon Valley company,'' he
said. ``We're moving from an entrepreneurial culture ... to the
next level.''
</P>
<P>
   Logan said the new structure, with an additional layer of
management, is designed to support ``a major buildup'' as the firm
gears up to do business with customers of its parent bank in
addition to its traditional clients among smaller, fast-growing
companies.
</P>
<P>
   Montgomery is shooting to double its revenue in the next three
years and move up from its current rank as the nations's
ninth-largest investment bank to one of the top five, Logan said.

EUROPEANS REJOICE AT LORDS' PINOCHET RULING 
</HEADLINE>
  (With PINOCHET, see also PINOCHET-CHILE) 
(bl) 
 By TIM WEINER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Many European leaders applauded Wednesday's ruling
against the former dictator of Chile, Augusto Pinochet, but within
the U.S. government and in some legal circles, there was a note of
consternation at the potential power of a Spanish judge to
transcend national borders in the name of international law.
</P>
<P>
   Muted responses from United States officials reflected some
uneasiness in Washington with the idea that former government
leaders can be held responsible by foreign courts. At the State
Department and the National Security Council, spokesmen said that
Pinochet's fate was a matter for the Spanish and British courts.
</P>
<P>
   Alfred Rubin, a professor of international law at the Fletcher
School of Law and Diplomacy in Boston, said the power of the
Spanish judge in the case to reach across national boundaries was
troubling.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's to prevent Spain from extraditing Henry Kissinger, who
was involved in the coup?'' he asked. ``What's to prevent Spain
from ruling the world? The whole thing seems to be leading to
chaos, with every country sitting in judgment of the revolutions of
other countries. That strikes me as undemocratic.''
</P>
<P>
   Across Europe, many officials were openly elated.
</P>
<P>
   In Geneva, Mary Robinson, the U.N. High Commissioner for Human
Rights, said the ruling ``will hearten human-rights defenders
around the world.'' The decision ``confirmed the emerging
international consensus against impunity,'' said Ms. Robinson, a
former president of Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   In Paris, French President Jacques Chirac said: ``May justice be
done, and may light be fully shed on Pinochet's responsibilities.''
French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin said: ``It's a surprise, it's a
joy, it's bad news for dictators.''
</P>
<P>
   France, along with Spain, Belgium and Switzerland, has sought
Pinochet's extradition for crimes against their citizens. The
United States has not.
</P>
<P>
   German Justice Minister Hertha Daubler-Gmelin has said she would
support an extradition request if there was evidence of damage
suffered by German citizens. The German Greens Party, junior
partner in the government, praised the ruling. ``This confirmation
of human rights from the motherland of democracy clears the way for
legal proceedings against a criminal dictator to take their
course'' in Spain, a ``democracy which is still young,'' said the
party's co-leader, Gunda Roestel.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, relatives of victims praised the ruling.
Michael Moffitt, whose wife of 113 days, Ronni Moffitt, was killed
by Pinochet's secret police, said the ruling was a ``great
vindication.'' Ms. Moffitt died along with a former Chilean foreign
minister, Orlando Letelier, when their car was blown up by a bomb
in Washington in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great Thanksgiving Day present for a lot of people, a
lot of victims of that beast,'' said Moffitt, 47, a financial
manager living in New Jersey. More than 3,000 people were killed as
the general took power in a 1973 coup. The dead included Charles
Horman, a 31-year-old American working as a filmmaker and writer in
Chile.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday his mother, Elizabeth Horman, said the ruling gave her
a measure of happiness. ``The wheels of justice grind slowly but
they grind exceedingly small,'' said Mrs. Horman, an artist who
lives in Manhattan and is in her 90s.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want Pinochet in prison,'' she said. ``Do you realize what
he did to us? Do you know what kind of man my son was? He was
attractive and humorous and loving. And he was a human rights
advocate. And that's why he got caught up in the coup.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Ratner, director of the Center for Constitutional
Rights, which represents Horman's family, said the Letelier and
Moffitt killings represented strong legal cases against the former
dictator. But he added that it was far from certain that the
Justice Department would move against Pinochet.
</P>
<P>
   Though mid-level officials at the Justice Department have
discussed extraditing Pinochet in those killings, they have
considered it as an option only if the former dictator won immunity
from the British courts. Any extradition proceeding by the United
States would have to be approved by the State Department and the
White House.
</P>
<P>
   In Madrid, Isabel Allende, the daughter of Salvador Allende, the
elected president of Chile who was overthrown by Pinochet's coup,
said: ``Future dictators will have to think very hard before they
turn to killing, before they betray their oaths, before they break
their democratic constitutions.''
</P>
<P>
   She added: ``This is not a case of revenge. What we want is
justice. We are fighting for justice and not impunity. I feel great
satisfaction and it is a great, historical moment.''

 How Online Comparison Sites Work  &HT;       
 By Jamie Beckett 
 &HT;     c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
Online shopping was a novelty last holiday season. This year, it's
a phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
   Web shoppers are projected to spend $2.3 billion this holiday
season, twice what they did a year ago. That's a whole lot of mouse
clicks, but the dollars are still puny compared with traditional
retailing, where shoppers are expected to part with some $3 billion
every day between now and Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   Looking for a way to shift the balance a little, Internet
retailers and others are offering something you can't get at the
mall without wearing out your shoe leather _ comparison shopping
Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   The comparison sites work much like the search engines most Web
surfers already use, but in this case, they scan the Web or a
database for the best deal. Shoppers can search for a specific item
and, depending on which site they're using, specify price,
manufacturer and other particulars. Because they promise to add
both traffic and revenues, major Web players are clamoring to add
comparison shopping sites.
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo rolled out its version last week. In the past year,
Internet gateways Excite and Infoseek, online bookseller Amazon.com
and online search-engine developer Inktomi bought companies that
offer comparison shopping technology. Excite and Amazon.com's sites
are up; Infoseek's and Inktomi's are being developed.
</P>
<P>
   For Internet shoppers, the comparison sites don't always
deliver. But for the Internet gateways, or portals, such as Yahoo,
Excite and Infoseek, they can be a way to turn Web surfers into Web
spenders.
</P>
<P>
   ``The portals know how to build traffic. Now they need to figure
out a way to make money off that traffic,'' said Julia Pickar,
industry analyst for Zona Research in Redwood City.
</P>
<P>
   One way is e-commerce. Most sites collect a fee every time they
direct a sale to a merchant, usually a small percentage of the
purchase price.
</P>
<P>
   For the merchants, the sites are a way to win new customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the merchant's standpoint, it's very efficient,'' said
Jeff Mallett, chief operating officer at Yahoo. ``When they
(comparison shoppers) get there, they're ready to buy.''
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, the sites can put smaller online e-retailers on
the same footing as the giants.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you search books, a Powell's Books is listed on the same
page as its biggest competitors but at a very low cost. Yet they
spend only a fraction of what Amazon.com does on advertising,''
said Nicole Vanderbilt, senior analyst at Jupiter Communications in
New York.

IN A TRIAL, JURORS MIGHT BE SYMPATHETIC 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: With KEVORKIAN)  
(rl) 
 By WILLIAM GLABERSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Prosecutors are at a sharp disadvantage in the first-degree
premeditated murder case they filed against Dr. Jack Kevorkian
Wednesday because a jury might find it easy to sympathize with the
suffering of the terminally ill, experts in criminal law said.
</P>
<P>
   Law professors and experienced defense lawyers said Kevorkian,
who has escaped numerous prosecutions, could again argue that the
law is out of step with society's desire to help ease the pain of
terminally ill people.
</P>
<P>
   Whether assisted suicide, or euthanasia, is morally right or
wrong, several of the experts say, jurors are often uncomfortable
applying existing laws to such cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``The law of murder was not drafted with these sorts of cases in
mind,'' said Franklin Zimring, a professor of criminal law at the
law school at the University of California at Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   That would give Kevorkian an advantage over prosecutors in a
trial in the televised death that Kevorkian has described as his
first euthanasia, legal experts said.
</P>
<P>
   Kevorkian appears to be acknowledging that he intentionally
caused the death of Thomas Youk, a 52-year-old man suffering from
Lou Gehrig's disease, whose final moments were shown on ``60
Minutes'' Sunday. Several lawyers said that constitutes murder
under the law.
</P>
<P>
   But they said that, in a courtroom, the issues would be far more
complex. For example, they said, to find premeditated murder jurors
generally must conclude that the killer acted with malice
aforethought, which is defined as ``disregard of human life.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Biros, a former prosecutor who is now at the law firm of
Proskauer Rose in Washington, said, ``Dr. Kevorkian turns that
whole concept on its head because he says, `Look, I have total
regard for life,''' with his assertion that he is helping to ease
pain.
</P>
<P>
   That argument, lawyers said, would not likely get far with a
judge. But jurors might be attracted to such a claim because of
their empathy with the victims of serious illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, legal experts said, the courts are likely to be
hostile to any claim that Youk gave his permission to be killed.
Courts and legislatures have said that they cannot permit people to
approve their own deaths because that would open a Pandora's Box of
potential abuses.
</P>
<P>
   But jurors might be swayed by assertions that justice demands
that a suffering person be in control over his or her death, said
Robert Lawry, a criminal law professor at Case Western Reserve
University School of Law in Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   If Kevorkian were convicted of murder he could be sentenced to
life in prison. The severe sentence, some lawyers said, could help
Kevorkian fight the case. Even people who disapprove of euthanasia,
these lawyers said, could say that it would be irrational to impose
on a mercy killer the same sentence that would be imposed on
cold-blooded killers.
</P>
<P>
   Kevorkian's strength in court in the past has often come from
such sympathies. He was acquitted in three trials involving five
deaths, one case against him ended in a mistrial, a judge threw out
a murder charge in 1990 and another murder case was dropped in
1992.
</P>
<P>
   Michigan's new law against assisted suicide went to effect just
before Youk's death. That, some lawyers said, could strengthen the
prosecutor's hand. In addition, in the previous cases, Kevorkian
merely helped someone commit suicide. In the current case,
Kevorkian is believed to have injected Youk with a fatal solution.
</P>
<P>
   By challenging the Michigan prosecutors to charge him with
murder, Kevorkian appeared to be preparing to make a plea to have
jurors approve of his euthanasia even though the law does not
permit it, lawyers said.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers are generally not permitted to urge jurors to disregard
the law. But in cases raising grave issues, it is common for
lawyers to argue that the jurors must make a statement on behalf of
society.
</P>
<P>
   Benjamin Brafman, a New York defense lawyer, said that in a case
like the one in Michigan where the dying man's family seemed to
approve of his decision, it might be tempting for jurors to refuse
to convict.
</P>
<P>
   Brafman handled a New York case in 1995 in which a book editor,
George Delury, acknowledged he had assisted in the death of his
wife, who was suffering from multiple sclerosis. In that case, the
woman's family protested. Delury pleaded guilty to attempted
manslaughter and served four months in prison.
</P>
<P>
   But in cases like Kevorkian's, Brafman said, ``Jurors listen to
the law but they conclude that there is no victim and the person
was suffering. So they say, `Who has been harmed?'''

 &HT;    Morton's: Steakhouse in its prime
 &HT;    By Cliff Edwards
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ That big-name account is up for grabs, and you've got
a choice of hundreds of restaurants to wine and dine the executives
and win the prize.
</P>
<P>
   For 20 years, it's been no contest for meat-and-potatoes kind of
guys. Beef is definitely what's for dinner at Morton's of Chicago,
the steakhouse that opened on a snowy December night in 1978 in the
basement of downtown office building and has grown to 42
restaurants across the globe, including one in West Palm Beach.
</P>
<P>
   Morton's is known for its understated elegance, for providing
excellent food and even better service that keep customers coming
back.
</P>
<P>
   With the meal averaging more than $65 a person, Morton's isn't
for everyone. And company President Allen Bernstein doesn't pretend
it should be.
</P>
<P>
   The chain has positioned itself as a place for the important
event _ on someone else's dime. Morton's says many of its patrons
are business people dining on expense accounts that make it a
little easier to order that double Porterhouse steak, topping three
pounds and weighing in at $59.95 each.
</P>
<P>
   ``The average person can't afford to spend that kind of money
for dinner for two,'' says Bernstein, a former Wendy's franchise
owner. ``That means we've got to be at the top of our game, buying
the best of the best of beef and other items to satisfy the
heavy-hitters we see coming in.''
</P>
<P>
   Morton's was a creation of Arnie Morton and Klaus Fritsch, who
met while running the food service operations for Hugh Hefner's
Playboy Club in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   They wanted Morton's to be a place to offer ``the biggest and
the best steaks, and that's what we did,'' says Fritsch, who still
serves as vice chairman of the company.
</P>
<P>
   In 1987, the pair sold the seven-unit chain to a private
investment group, which in turn sold it in 1989 to Quantum
Restaurant Group. That company changed its name to Morton's
Restaurant Group in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The chain throughout has kept up a tradition of serving only
prime aged beef, a moniker given only to less than 3 percent of
U.S. beef annually.
</P>
<P>
   Each Morton's restaurant _ from Chicago to New York, Singapore
to Canada _ features the same menu and the same preparation and
presentation of food. A book helps new staffers learn the ropes and
tapes teach them the spiel they must give when they roll out carts
showing huge, plastic-wrapped cuts of meat and live lobster.
</P>
<P>
   Each restaurant features dark woods and extensive wine lists
aimed at attracting the core customer: married males, ages 35 to
55, with average incomes of more than $100,000. Frank Sinatra tapes
play in the background and serigraphs of famous people dominate the
walls.
</P>
<P>
   The rich and famous and repeat big-spenders see the best
treatment. A computer system notes their orders, whether they're
married or single and even whether they've just had a child, giving
each general manager information with which to greet a guest.
</P>
<P>
   Investors who monitor the food world have had high regard for
Morton's Restaurant Group, which also includes 10 Bertolini's
Authentic Trattoria Italian-style dining restaurants. They note
there is little nationwide competition in the fine-dining
steakhouse category, with the Ruth's Chris chain being one of the
few exceptions.
</P>
<P>
   The company's stock tumbled recently on fears a global economic
crisis could force big-spenders to tighten their pocketbooks, but
analyst Allan Hickok at Piper Jaffray says he still considers
Morton's a good buy.
</P>
<P>
   ``If times are tough and you're trying to get an important
client to sign on the dotted line, are you going to take them to
Applebees or Denny's for a grand slam breakfast? You'll take them
to Morton's,'' he says. ``When business people tighten, it's rarely
on the food side.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Morton's Restaurant Group reported its third-quarter
profits rose 11 percent over the comparable year-ago period to
$1.02 million and for the first nine months of the year saw its net
income rise 24.4 percent over a year ago. About 85 percent of the
company's revenue comes from the steakhouses.
</P>
<P>
   And so diners like Neil Smith of Chicago keep coming to
Morton's.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love the place,'' says Smith, who often picks up the check
while trying to sell cosmetic surgery lasers to doctors. ``You know
what you're going to get here: good food and excellent service.
That's all you can ask for.''

 By JOHN TIERNEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In 1906 Dr. Frederick A. Cook took a photograph that
made him famous and ultimately became perhaps the most
controversial picture in the history of exploration. Now a
historian has found the original, uncropped version of the picture,
and it does not look good for Cook.
</P>
<P>
   A cropped version, captioned ``The Top of Our Continent,'' was
published in 1908 with Cook's account of how he had braved
avalanches and ice cliffs to make the first ascent of Mount
McKinley, the highest peak in North America. Cook described himself
and his companion, Edward Barrill, as ``near the limit of human
endurance'' _ exhausted, freezing, gasping for oxygen _ when they
reached the Alaskan summit at 20,320 feet above sea level.
</P>
<P>
   ``At last!'' Cook wrote. ``The soul-stirring task was crowned
with victory. The top of the continent was under our feet.'' After
describing the vista of clouds and peaks spread out below, he
exulted in the ``most impressive'' memory taken from the peak:
``the final picture which I took of Barrille'' _ as Cook misspelled
the name _ ``with the flag lashed to his ax, as the Arctic air
froze the impression into a relief which no words can tell.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert M. Bryce has two words for that image, and they are Fake
Peak. Bryce, the author of the most exhaustive study of Cook's
career, has analyzed a newly discovered print made from Cook's
negative showing geographical features in the background that were
cropped when Cook published the photograph. Bryce concludes that
the photograph was taken on a small promontory 15,000 feet below
the McKinley summit, at barely 5,000 feet above sea level, about
the altitude of Denver.
</P>
<P>
   This finding confirms the suspicions of Cook's critics, who long
ago accused him of faking the McKinley summit picture and
identified the site known as Fake Peak. But there were so few
details visible in the picture published by Cook that it was
difficult to determine exactly where it was taken until Bryce found
the full print.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think Cook ever had any intention of going to the
summit,'' Bryce said. ``From all the evidence, it looks as if Cook
didn't go any higher than 5,000 feet on this McKinley trip. He
apparently spotted this feature that he thought he could pass off
as the summit, and it was easy to stage the photograph because
Barrill had to climb only a few hundred feet above the glacier
floor.''
</P>
<P>
   Bryce found the photograph in papers of Cook that were donated
recently to the polar archives at Ohio State University. Bryce, the
author of a 1997 book, ``Cook and Peary,'' a 1,100-page account of
Cook's rivalry with Robert E. Peary, published his analysis of the
photograph in the current issue of DIO, a journal devoted to the
history of science and exploration.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have been arguing about Cook on McKinley for 90
years,'' said Dennis Rawlins, the journal's publisher and a
historian of the Arctic. ``This is the single biggest find, because
it proves positively from Cook's own camera that he was lying.''
</P>
<P>
   The controversy has endured because it was the McKinley claim
that made Cook's reputation and eventually ruined his name during
his fight with Robert Peary. Cook's apparent success on McKinley
promptly won him support for an expedition to the North Pole, from
which he returned triumphantly in 1909.
</P>
<P>
   More than 100,000 people turned out in Brooklyn for a parade
welcoming him home. Icicles dripped from a huge triumphal arch
above Bushwick Avenue adorned with a sign, ``We believe in you.''
Cook had been accused of faking his North Pole trip by Robert
Peary, who had also just returned with his own claim on the Pole,
but the public was on Cook's side.
</P>
<P>
   He was seen as the romantic underdog, a charming Brooklynite who
had climbed McKinley and reached the pole largely on his own. Peary
was the establishment figure, a dour man backed by Manhattan
millionaires and the National Geographic Society, who had relied on
an army of Inuits for his Arctic exploration.
</P>
<P>
   But the Peary forces won the public-relations war by tracking
down rumors about the McKinley climb. The New York Globe &AMP;
Commercial Advertiser, whose publisher was the president of the
club of Peary patrons, published an affidavit from Barrill
explaining the photo hoax and declaring that he and Cook had never
climbed McKinley.

   ``Smashed is Dr. Cook,'' declared The Globe. ``The similarities
between the Mount McKinley hoax and the North Pole hoax are readily
discernible.'' The New York Times, which had sponsored Peary's
expedition, joined in the attack on Cook. The news caused The New
York Herald, which had sponsored Cook's expedition, to mute its
support for the doctor, and Peary was generally acknowledged as the
only one to reach the North Pole.
</P>
<P>
   Today most historians believe that both explorers were lying.
Peary is thought to have gotten closer to the pole, but not all the
way. Cook is generally thought to have reached neither the pole nor
the McKinley summit.

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Explorers have known about Fake Peak since 1910, when an
expedition found it by following Barrill's directions. But because
it has been impossible to duplicate Cook's photograph precisely,
due to changed snow conditions and an earthquake that dislodged
some rocks from the promontory, Cook's defenders continued to
maintain that it was not the same place photographed by the doctor.
</P>
<P>
   The Cook photograph uncovered by Bryce reveals new background
details that precisely match those at the site of Fake Peak, such
as a nearby cliff and a distant peak, Mount Grosvenor. Now even
Cook's supporters acknowledge that the doctor might not have been
telling the truth, although they are still not ready to abandon
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's fairly strong evidence that the photograph wasn't
taken at the summit,'' said Ted Heckathorn, a member of the Cook
Society, a group with headquarters in Sullivan County, N.Y., that
is dedicated to defending the explorer's reputation. ``But even if
it wasn't, that doesn't prove he couldn't have climbed to the
summit anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Few historians or explorers share that view. ``Cook's account of
his climb is utterly ridiculous,'' said Bradford Washburn, the
retired director of the Boston Science Museum, who has mapped Mount
McKinley and climbed it three times, and has published an analysis
of Cook's diary and photographs. ``The tragedy is that he would
have been remembered as a good explorer if he'd just truthfully
reported what he accomplished near McKinley. But the Devil took him
up on to a mount, and the doctor listened.''

ALLIANCE MAY BECOME FORMIDABLE THREAT TO MICROSOFT 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 By JOHN MARKOFF   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Eight years ago Apple Computer and IBM undertook
a common software and computer chip development effort to challenge
Microsoft Corp.'s dominance of personal computing and remake the
computing industry at home and in the workplace.
</P>
<P>
   Three years later the alliance was in a shambles, beset by
internal turmoil and ignored by the market. Indeed, during the past
decade the failure of large corporate technology alliances seems to
be the rule rather than the exception.
</P>
<P>
   However, for a number of reasons, the three-way alliance between
America Online, Sun Microsystems and Netscape Communications may
succeed in having an impact on Microsoft where other attempts have
failed.
</P>
<P>
   The difference this time, say industry executives, is that the
new alliance may soon become a force in an area precisely where
Microsoft has failed: the media-rich world beyond the personal
computer.
</P>
<P>
   At its heart the vision underlying the America Online-Sun
alliance is a bet on a new computing model that will reach the
majority of the American people who do not surf the World Wide Web
and are unlikely ever to become personal computer users.
</P>
<P>
   The wager is that the array of popular consumer brands that
America Online has marshaled will finally give Sun's Java
programming language a crucial advantage in a world of
consumer-oriented computing gadgets ranging from cell phones to
wireless personal digital assistants to kitchen information
appliances.
</P>
<P>
   ``The 1990s were the bell-the-Microsoft-cat decade,'' said
Michael Schrage, a research associate at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology Media Laboratory. ``The previous efforts
failed because they were about technology and not business models.
The question today is which companies have done a good job defining
a new business model?''
</P>
<P>
   In the past, Microsoft dismissed the attacks without breaking
stride. In the personal computer market it continued to fine-tune a
business model based on monopoly control of the Windows operating
system, which runs on ever-cheaper personal computers. More
recently Microsoft has attempted to use its power in the personal
computer industry to leverage itself into new markets that it has
hoped would grow with the same speed as the personal computer.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, for example, it attempted to entice the cable industry
into supporting a new venture dubbed Cablesoft that would extend
the PC industry model of a proprietary operating system and cheap
hardware into the living room.
</P>
<P>
   That effort failed because there has been little demand for
interactive television. More recently, Microsoft acquired WebTV, an
Internet TV start-up, but has not been able to reach a mass
audience with that effort either.
</P>
<P>
   Although Microsoft executives have said they would use the new
alliance as grounds for ending the federal government's antitrust
case now under way in Washington, they have otherwise been
unusually silent about the new American Online-Sun venture.
</P>
<P>
   A Microsoft spokeswoman said the company was searching for a
successor to Pete Higgins, the recently departed vice president who
has headed the company's struggling interactive media business, and
it was likely that Microsoft's strategy would be made clear when
Higgins' successor was named.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's most immediate vulnerability is to the programming
and content centered successes of America Online.
</P>
<P>
   ``This potentially has a massive impact on Microsoft,'' said
James Moore, president of Geopartners, a Cambridge, Mass.,
consulting firm. ``The ability to deliver software to consumers and
transaction processing oriented electronic commerce is precisely
where Microsoft is most vulnerable.''
</P>
<P>
   America Online has already given a small hint of the potential
power of its brand on the Internet in the recent release of a new
version of its ICQ chat software. Originally available as a small
application permitting friends to keep in instantaneous contact via
the Web, ICQ will increasingly be used by AOL as a portal to the
entire world of its content and as a simple means of delivering
software to personal computer users.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sun never sets on the AOL empire,'' said Nat Goldhaber,
chairman and founder of Cybergold, a Berkeley, Calif.-based
electronic commerce company that has a partnership agreement with
America Online. ``Eighty percent of the Net looks at something
owned by AOL every day.''
</P>
<P>
   A second point of potential vulnerability will be Microsoft's
continued ability to get its vast customer base to upgrade to new
versions of Office and Windows. That will be tempered if innovation
moves to the new consumer-oriented devices that will sell for far
less than even today's $1,000 personal computers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Windows has maxed out and this is a fundamental weakness that
Microsoft has,'' said Mitchell Kertzman, chief executive and
president of Network Computer Inc. ``What happens when Windows
isn't driving innovation in industry any more? In the future new
devices are going to be the drivers of innovation in both software
and hardware.''

STADIUM BECOMES AN ARENA OF BASIC HUMAN NEEDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARY SANCHEZ  
 c. 1997 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN PEDRO SULA, Honduras _ On his first day in the world, the
infant boy snuggles closer to his mother, Jessica Marina Garcia, on
the metal cot they share. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   They have just returned from the hospital to their ``home'' _ a
plot of concrete under the stands of Estadio Olimpico on the
outskirts of town. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the stadium was the site of the Central American
Games. Now it's a haven for the Garcias and 502 other families who
lost everything to Hurricane Mitch. They are among the estimated 2
million left homeless in Honduras. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But some schedules even a hurricane can't disrupt: Children must
be fed, bathed and clothed. And babies will be born. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So daily routines in the shelters largely revolve around the
needs of children. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The hospital where Garcia delivered this child _ her firstborn _
supplied her with one outfit for the baby: yellow knit booties, a
matching cap and a shirt that snaps in front. She has one cloth
diaper. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In addition to settling on a name for their son, now she and her
husband must figure out how to provide the necessities for their
infant. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At least they already had staked out a prime spot at the
stadium. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Garcias' temporary home is about the size of an average
American bathroom, near an area where vendors used to sell soft
drinks and snacks to soccer and track fans. The walls are four
sheets; the roof, a blanket. The only building materials here are
those that can be tied together. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A row of tarps where more people live lines the edge of the
parking lot. Imagine Arrowhead Stadium with families living under
makeshift tents encircling the entire outside rim. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Some families managed to save a few hens and chicks from the
flooding. The birds run around the stadium, pecking for food in the
gravel. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Other hurricane survivors were lucky enough to haul out boxes of
clothes, furniture, soiled mattresses, a few photos or perhaps a
radio. Those with nothing sleep on the concrete. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Grids of rope and wire cross the stadium, forming clotheslines
for the people. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Children outnumber adults at least 3 to 1. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In one area, a woman struggles to sweep up dead flies as her
baby screams at her ankles. She keeps sweeping, letting the baby
wail. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For a minute, she seems to be pondering her dilemma. Which takes
precedence? Stopping to pick up the child, or sweeping away the
dead bugs before her child finds them? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   She picks up the baby. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Nearby, naked toddlers escape from their mothers as the mothers
try to bathe them with bowls of water carried from sinks in the
stadium bathrooms. Babies throw temper tantrums under the concrete
steps of the stadium. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But the children are helpful too. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A common sight is children hauling plastic buckets of water from
the 2,500-liter tanks in the parking lot. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And a brigade of youngsters with brooms attacks the concrete
every Sunday after the fire department comes to spray the area with
water. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I lost everything, my home, my bed,'' said Maria Suyapa Lopez,
whose third grandchild was born in a shelter Friday. ``But the most
important thing is your children, and as you can see, everyone here
is safe and healthy.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Making sure things stay that way is the crusade of Leonarda
Fernandez de Castellanos. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Fernandez, a nurse, oversees the stadium shelter as part of her
job with the city's relief agency. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``/{Buenas dias/},'' she greets the families, as she takes the
first of her twice-daily walks around the stadium. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The smell of beans and bananas frying on kerosene stoves fills
the air. Other people have built stoves with bricks for a base,
wood for fire and a metal trash can lid for a griddle. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Wash your hands, wash your face,'' Fernandez yells, after
pointing out some standing water and trash she wants removed. ``The
dirt brings flies and disease.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Fernandez is also in charge of distributing rations. Every 10
days, each family gets 30 pounds of rice, beans and corn. They also
receive flour, oil and sometimes milk. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For Teresa Jesus Castaneda, it is not enough. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   She has forgotten how long she has been at the stadium, she
says. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know, maybe about a month,'' she says. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Her neighborhood, Asentamientos Humanos, flooded in the
hurricane. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Castaneda has 12 children. The youngest, 5-month-old Brian Jose
Benitez, is asleep in a hammock, giving her a welcome break. He has
been sick with vomiting and diarrhea. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The bottle tucked under the baby's arm holds the last of the
powdered milk. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It is so hard, trying to take care of, keep track of, so many
children here,'' she says. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Her husband is out trying to buy vegetables to resell for a
profit. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Like many in the stadium, Castaneda is living beside the family
who were their neighbors before the flood. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Older children from both families take turns watching the
littlest ones while the mothers and fathers leave to find work in
town. The government has offered extra food to people who will
sweep the streets of debris from the flooding. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Relief workers are trying to consolidate the 260 shelters in the
San Pedro Sula area. The stadium will be used for another two
months, Fernandez estimates. Maybe longer, depending on how long it
takes to relocate everyone. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Edelmira Quiroz arrived at the stadium from another shelter on
Sunday. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Most families are brought in military trucks. But Quiroz came in
a horse-drawn cart, with possessions from her family and two others
piled inside. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   She doesn't complain, but neither can she forget. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``When we finally move into a new house, we will remember this
misery,'' Quiroz said. &QL;

UCLA FINDS HIDDEN TREASURE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico _ He was not a McDonald's All-American. He
did not criticize Kansas coach Roy Williams' substitution pattern.
He was not a lauded foreign player who came to America for prep
school, then thrilled college and pro scouts.
</P>
<P>
   Matt Barnes was the lowest-rated of UCLA's recruits _ the
``throw in'' _ but he's been the biggest surprise of the early
season and may start today when UCLA faces San Francisco in the
first of three games in the Puerto Rico Shootout.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Barnes doesn't start, he'll be one of the first players
off the bench. Such is the impression he's made on the coaches, the
impact he's made on the court and the recovery he's made from
offseason foot surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ``People saw him as a throw-in,'' Bruins coach Steve Lavin said.
``They'd say, `You also got that football player from Sacramento.
What's his name?'
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, he's been a surprise, but only in terms of how quickly
he's developed. We knew he was good, we just thought it would take
him longer to get to this point.''
</P>
<P>
   Barnes started and played four positions in the season opener
against Santa Clara, scoring nine points and grabbing eight
rebounds in 28 minutes. At 6-foot-8, he's UCLA's most versatile
player _ an updated version of J.R. Henderson _ and one of its most
resourceful. He often does his best work without the ball, content
to rebound, defend and make his offensive-minded teammates look
good.
</P>
<P>
   But surprised? No, he's not surprised.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew how good I was, but I wasn't able to show it in high
school,'' he said. ``Yeah, I have something to prove, being the
least-talked about of the freshmen. But I know if I was healthy, I
would have made the McDonald's (All Star) game.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins first noticed Barnes in April 1997, at an all-star
game at the end of his junior season. Like Henderson, he understood
not just his role but everyone else's. And he fit the part
physically. UCLA wanted a big-wing recruit to replace 6-6 Charles
O'Bannon and 6-5 Toby Bailey.
</P>
<P>
   But Barnes had sprained the big toe on his left foot while
playing football for Del Campo High the previous fall, and the more
he played, the worse it got. His super spring gave way to a timid
and ineffective summer, and his rating dropped.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a top-20 talent who played himself into a top-50 or
top-100 player,'' said UCLA assistant Jim Saia, who recruited
Barnes. ``He didn't have a good summer. He wasn't the same player I
had seen in April, but we knew why, and we stuck with him.''
</P>
<P>
   The big schools didn't know why, didn't ask, and they stayed
away _ leaving the recruitment to Arizona, UCLA and Cal. Saia saw
Barnes again last September at a tournament at Long Beach City
College, and was so impressed he returned to Westwood and
immediately told Lavin, ``He have got to sign this kid.''
</P>
<P>
   A longtime fan, Barnes committed during UCLA's in-home visit.
Grateful for the chance and aware of his sagging reputation, he
said to Lavin and Saia: ``Don't worry. I'll show everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   The skeptics remained. As the Bruins slowly accumulated the
nation's No.1 recruiting class, coaches and evaluators wondered why
UCLA had wasted a scholarship on a skinny, timid kid from
Sacramento who seemingly lacked the jumper to play guard and the
toughness to play forward.
</P>
<P>
   ``UCLA asked me why I was shaky, so they knew what was going
on,'' Barnes said. ``But nobody else asked. A lot of people doubted
me. It was hard having the outside world looking in and not knowing
what was happening.''
</P>
<P>
   Barnes broke the toe playing football last year, but thought he
had aggravated the sprain. He missed the first half of the
basketball season, then returned to average 30 points and 10
rebounds. Bone spurs formed, the pain persisted, and eventually the
break was diagnosed.
</P>
<P>
   He had surgery in July and did not play for 2{ months. When
UCLA's practice began Oct.17, the soaring expectations that
accompanied freshmen JaRon Rush, Ray Young, Dan Gadzuric and Jerome
Moiso did not follow Barnes. Not even the coaches believed he would
develop this quickly. But he dropped 20 pounds, ran himself into
shape and slowly regained his timing.
</P>
<P>
   Now the career that began in obscurity looks as bright as the
others. Barnes is more advanced than Young, more physical than
Moiso, bigger than Rush and more versatile than Gadzuric. He's
unselfish, tougher than anyone thought, and vital to UCLA's
success.
</P>
<P>
   ``Matt does so many things on the floor, and he's a player who
can play with great players,'' Saia said. ``In that way, he fills a
niche for us. He's finally playing like the guy we saw before his
injury.''

 Holiday travel will benefit from extremely low gasoline prices  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JENNIFER MANN  
 c. 1997 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you're driving over the river and through the woods to
grandmother's house this Thanksgiving, add cheap gasoline prices to
your list of blessings. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City continues to be treated to the cheapest fuel prices,
considering inflation, since anyone started keeping statistics. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That trend began a year ago with the Asian economic meltdown,
which continues to put a big damper on demand. That, coupled with
surging supplies, equals historically low prices. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The average cost of self-service regular unleaded gas in Kansas
City is 88 cents a gallon, down almost 18 percent from last
Thanksgiving. The cost of self-service regular unleaded at the pump
_ not accounting for inflation _ is the cheapest it's been in 10
years, when it averaged 81 cents a gallon in 1988. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Area residents on the Kansas side of the state line can probably
expect to pay a bit more because Kansas has higher fuel taxes _ 18
cents a gallon compared with 17 cents in Missouri. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And although gasoline prices throughout the nation are at
historic lows, Kansas City's are among the lowest. For instance,
the average for self-service regular unleaded on the West Coast is
$1.19. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The geographic location of Kansas City gives it a big leg
up,'' said Mike Right of the AAA-Auto Club of Missouri. ``It's got
good access to pipelines, highway systems and barge traffic.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Another factor in the area's favor, Right said, is heavy
competition. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If the Asian economy hadn't fallen apart, drivers would be
paying substantially more per gallon, the Energy Department said in
a recent report. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Asian fallout is expected to help keep gasoline prices low
for at least the next decade, the report says. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Russian economic crisis has had a minimal impact on overall
prices because it has big supplies of crude oil within its borders.
Japan, on the other hand, has virtually none. And although China is
on the verge of becoming a big crude-oil producer, it will still
have to rely heavily on imports. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Mike Shanahan of the American Petroleum Institute in Washington,
D.C., said that even with low prices at the pump, it's still
economically viable for companies to continue producing. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Overproduction right now is extreme,'' Shanahan said. ``Of
course, that's good for consumers.'' &QL;

SEASON'S GREETINGS ARRIVE EARLY FOR THOSE SENDING THANKSGIVING
CARDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE STAFFORD  
 c. 1997 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Rodney LaMothe, president of Industrial Park Realty in Kansas
City, dumped a decadeslong tradition of sending company Christmas
cards. So far, reactions have been terrific. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He sent Thanksgiving cards instead. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really glad we did it,'' said LaMothe, whose company does
leasing for Mid-West Terminal Warehouse Co. ``It was a
break-away-from-the-pack kind of thing.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   LaMothe, along with a growing number of business owners and
operators, sees Thanksgiving as a better time to express
greetings. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``At Christmas, you get lost in the volume, but I've already had
two or three people who called to thank me for the Thanksgiving
card,'' LaMothe said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Kathi Mishek, Hallmark Cards spokeswoman, said the company made
about 15 Thanksgiving cards specifically aimed at the
business-to-business market. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Three years ago, the business was zero,'' Mishek said. ``Now
it's one of our fastest-growing business units.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hallmark won't have precise sales numbers until January, but
Mishek said early market research indicated that business operators
like Thanksgiving cards for more than just stand-out-from-the-pack
reasons. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a time thing,'' Mishek said. ``People are saying they
don't have enough time around Christmas. There's a small but
growing group that's calling our 1-800 number to thank us for
having these Thanksgiving options.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Having more time at Thanksgiving to personalize her messages is
important to Connie Swartz. Her company, Creative Courseware Inc.,
has sent Thanksgiving cards for three years. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a no-brainer almost,'' she said. ``Thanksgiving is a time
to give thanks. Plus, the holiday has a nonreligious slant. It's a
cleaner message.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Swartz also likes being in the Thanksgiving vanguard because no

   ``If you send one, you're OK. If you don't, you're fine, too,
because no one expected one,'' she said. &QL;

<P>
   Right Management Consultants in Overland Park has sent
turkey-time cards since 1990. The office, which does career
counseling and outplacement work for executives and employees let
go by their employers, took advantage of an option to customize the
card's message. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The suggested words in the Hallmark catalog _ ``As we celebrate
all the reasons to be thankful this special time of year, we
remember you and our pleasant association'' _ was edited slightly
to eliminate the last four words and replace them with a statement
of best wishes. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Vince Sabia, vice president of client services, said the company
customized the message to ``do businesses the way we want to be
known, to show that we understand people and care about them.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Thanksgiving card LaMothe sent from Industrial Park Realty
was created by Masterpiece Studios Inc., a card manufacturer in
Mankato, Minn., which sells the line exclusively through the
wholesale trade. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   John Kind, president of Masterpiece, said the company began
marketing Thanksgiving cards to businesses nearly 20 years ago. The
niche represents a small part of Masterpiece's overall card
business (about a dozen Thanksgiving cards compared with more than
300 Christmas cards), but its percentage growth has been ``nice''
in the last four or five years, Kind said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Neither buyers nor manufacturers said diversity concerns were
driving conversions to Thanksgiving instead of Christmas greetings.
Most companies already had moved to more generic ``season's
greetings'' in deference to those who might celebrate Hanukkah,
Kwanzaa or other holidays instead of Christmas. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Both buyers and card makers agreed, though, that Thanksgiving
was a logical time to tell business contacts they're appreciated.
And, at least so far, the message isn't getting lost in a
competitive deluge. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Current senders hope it stays that way. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I really don't want to have to move to Valentine's Day,''
Swartz said. &QL;

THANKFUL

<TEXT>
<P>
   What is there to be thankful for this Thanksgiving? Let us count
the reasons: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --The price of gasoline is going down, rather than up. Remember
Thanksgiving 25 years ago? It was a time of gas lines; predictions
of ever higher oil prices; and disciples of Thomas Malthus
forecasting doom, gloom and the end of prosperity fueled by dynamic
postwar growth. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --The price of most everything else, meanwhile, is rising only
slowly. During that gloomy Thanksgiving season a quarter-century
past, the Consumer Price Index was rising at a 9 percent rate and
headed for a 12 percent jump the next year. Since last
Thanksgiving, the index is up about 1.5 percent. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --The exception to this disinflationary trend, however, is the
price of stocks. The market has again begun to go up instead of
down. As summer was giving way to autumn, the Dow Jones industrial
average was almost a couple of thousand points below July's record
high. Many market mavens had embraced the notion that the bull
market had run out of gas. On Monday, both the Dow and the
broader-based Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index vaulted to new closing
highs. Monday's Dow close, incidentally, was about 1,000 percent
higher than where the average stood about this time 25 years ago. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The cost of money is going down, rather than up. Last
Thanksgiving, the prime rate that banks charge their most
creditworthy borrowers was 8.5 percent. This Thanksgiving, it's
7.75 percent. On Thanksgiving '73, the prime was 9.75 percent. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --Japan didn't take over America. Remember 10 or so
Thanksgivings ago? The joke was that Japan had lost the war but won
the peace. Many Americans feared America Inc. was on its way to
becoming a colony of Japan's growing economic empire. The Japanese
could do no wrong, and the key, liberal economists claimed, was
Japan's cooperative alliance between big government and big
business. Japan's stock market has lost more than 60 percent of its
value during the '90s, the economy is mired in recession, and its
financial system is beset by problems that may take another
generation to resolve. Meanwhile, the long-suffering average
Japanese consumer-taxpayer suffers much economic abuse at the hands
of both big business and big government. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --You live in America, rather than Russia, Indonesia, Thailand,
Malaysia, North Korea, Cuba, China, the place once known as
Yugoslavia, and just about anywhere else on the planet anyone would
care to name. The United States certainly has its problems, but
it's No. 1 in every way. Ask anyone who's traveled extensively
abroad. Too many Americans, unfortunately, don't appreciate the
blessings that naturally accrue to anyone lucky enough to be here
because they have allowed their way of looking at things to become
too provincial. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Don't wait until New Year's to make a resolution. Make one
today. Resolve to spend at least some time this Thanksgiving
thinking of all the reasons you have to be thankful. Whether you're
with loved ones or alone, at work or play, in good health or bad,
rich or not so, sad or happy, young or old, you always have
something to give thanks for. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's just a matter of creating for yourself a few moments of
quiet time at this special time of year to think about them. &QL;
</P>

WILLIAMS STAYS PUT; VAUGHN AN ANGEL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a crushing reversal of fortune that has depressingly familiar
precedents, the Red Sox learned Wednesday night that instead of
signing free agent center fielder Bernie Williams, they were swept
away by a last-minute bid from the New York Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   With a seven-year deal for a guaranteed $87.5 million, the
defending champion Yankees retained the American League batting
champion and Gold Glove outfielder while maintaining their record
of one-upping their archrivals in acquiring elite talent. There's
also an option for an eighth year, reportedly with a $4 million
buyout, that makes the guaranteed value of the deal $91.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement of Williams's agreement with the Yankees came
within an hour of notification that Mo Vaughn had made his
departure from the Red Sox official, agreeing to a six-year, $80
million deal with the Anaheim Angels. The timing of Vaughn's
announcement only reinforced the image of the huge void in the
Boston lineup that general manager Dan Duquette had hoped Williams
would fill.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels also hold a club option on a seventh year for $14
million, with a $2 million buyout.
</P>
<P>
   Compounding the failure to land Williams _ Duquette had been
poised Wednesday night to receive a phone call from Williams's
agent, Scott Boras, to accept the Sox' seven-year offer _ was the
GM's assertion that the Red Sox were no longer interested in free
agent slugger Albert Belle.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox had courted Belle immediately after breaking off talks
with Vaughn, but Belle gradually slipped off the radar screen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that's going to work for us,'' Duquette said of
signing Belle, who under a provision in his contract with the White
Sox has until next Wednesday to sign as a free agent with another
club, or return to Chicago with a deal to pay him $33 million in
the next three years. ``I'm sure Albert will play somewhere next
year.''
</P>
<P>
   Duquette would not elaborate on why the Red Sox bowed out of the
Belle bidding, though there were hints Wednesday night that the Sox
had become sufficiently concerned about character issues involving
the controversial slugger, who has a history of antisocial
behavior. Efforts to reach Belle's brother, Terry, his agent, Arn
Tellem, and Red Sox CEO John Harrington were unsuccessful as of
mid-evening.
</P>
<P>
   Belle was talking to the Baltimore Orioles, another Boston rival
in the AL East, and was expected to either sign with them or return
to the White Sox.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where do we go?'' a subdued Duquette said by phone Wednesday
night, echoing a question that comes in the wake of what may be a
worse lineup upheaval than the one caused by Roger Clemens's
departure two winters ago. ``We'll have to take a look. We'll
probably take a look at pitching.''
</P>
<P>
   That does not mean, however, that the Red Sox will be a late
entrant in the bidding for either Kevin Brown or Randy Johnson, the
top two pitching prizes on the market. The Sox had interest in
Johnson, but as Duquette said Wednesday night, ``Both pitchers have
said they'd like to play for a team in a different geographic
location.''
</P>
<P>
   Duquette also sounded unenthusiastic about renewing talks with
Rafael Palmeiro, the 34-year-old first baseman who reportedly has
received a five-year offer from his incumbent team, the Orioles.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's still available,'' Duquette said. ``We've always liked
him as a player. But it looks like it's up to five years.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sox have also contacted Robin Ventura, a third baseman who
can play first, and reportedly have shown interest in Gregg
Jefferies, but neither of those players can approach the power
numbers (40 home runs, 115 RBI) that Vaughn posted in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   There are several trade options the Sox could explore. They've
talked to the Expos about outfielder Rondell White, but according
to a source, the Sox don't have the talent to make that deal work.
Also available in trade is Gary Sheffield, the Dodgers' slugger
whose career began in Milwaukee when Duquette was with the Brewers,
but he has had injury problems and his production has fallen short
of what a team would expect from a $10 million-a-year player.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees had consistently refused to offer Williams more than
a five-year deal, and owner George Steinbrenner publicly mocked
Boras's assertion that the agent had at least one seven-year offer
in hand. It wasn't until the Red Sox met for two days with Williams
in Atlanta, and put their seven-year deal on the table, that the
Yankees summoned Williams and Boras for a meeting Tuesday night in
Tampa.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Red Sox jumping in like they did certainly sped the
process up to get us a lot higher than we were before,'' said
Yankees GM Brian Cashman.
</P>
<P>
   Boras had spoken in glowing terms about his meeting with the Red
Sox, and as late as Wednesday afternoon, one of Williams's closest
associates believed that Williams would sign with the Red Sox. The
deal to which Williams agreed was very close to the seven-year,
$100 million contract Boras had vowed his client would receive last
spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was hard for me to go somewhere else,'' said Williams in a
conference call from Puerto Rico. ``It came down to I wanted to be
a Yankee and remain a Yankee for my whole career.''
</P>
<P>
   Duquette was asked if he felt used by either the agent or the
Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made good offers on a couple of fronts,'' he said. ``That's
just the way the market works.''
</P>
<P>
   Told that Williams had come away enthusiastic about his meetings
with the Sox, Duquette replied, with a hint of sarcasm, ``We
impressed him? That's nice to hear.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams's deal guarantees him $91.5 million, or a half-million
more than the seven-year, $91 million deal Mike Piazza had signed
with the Mets, the industry's previous benchmark.

YANKEES' STAR BERNIE WILLIAMS RESIGNS, SPURNING BOSTON 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Bernie Williams, the Yankees' star center fielder,
agreed to re-sign with the team on Wednesday after owner George
Steinbrenner, in a staggering reversal, caved in to Williams'
demand for a seven-year contract worth $87.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees previously had offered Williams a five-year, $60
million deal, and even into Wednesday morning they refused to
change that bid, feeling sure that even if Williams accepted a
seven-year contract with rival Boston, they would instead sign
prolific slugger Albert Belle.
</P>
<P>
   But in mid-afternoon, the Yankees learned that the Baltimore
Orioles had offered a five-year, $65 million contract to Belle, far
more than the Yankees wanted to pay the contentious outfielder. The
prospect of being left without either Williams or Belle apparently
led Steinbrenner to increase his offer to Williams by nearly 50
percent, essentially matching Boston's offer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very happy the whole thing is over with,'' said Williams,
in a conference call with reporters from Puerto Rico. ``It's just
an honor for any player to play his entire major-league career with
the same team. It was going to be hard for me to go somewhere
else.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams added: ``It came down to the fact that I wanted to be a
Yankee.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Brian Cashman, the Yankees' general manager: ``He was
getting close to going to Boston, we were getting close to losing
him. At some point during today, both parties took a step backwards
and reached out again one more time, and after that it just
happened quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams' deal is worth slightly less than the seven-year, $91
million deal catcher Mike Piazza received to re-sign with the Mets
in October. Williams will receive $12 million in each of the next
seven seasons, and the Yankees hold a $15 million option on an
eighth season; the Yankees could buy out the eighth-year option for
$3.5 million, making the total package worth $87.5 million. As part
of limited no-trade clause, Williams can name six teams to which he
cannot be dealt.
</P>
<P>
   Yankees officials were convinced for months that Williams would
stay only if the Yankees extended the highest bid, and some within
the organization believed that Williams' wife did not want her
husband to return to New York. Williams met with Boston officials
Sunday and Monday and fielded the seven-year offer.
</P>
<P>
   Williams acknowledged Wednesday night that he was close to a
deal with the Red Sox. But before completing an agreement, he asked
for one last meeting with the Yankees, going face-to-face with
Steinbrenner on Tuesday. That conversation and Baltimore's sudden
interest in Belle led to the deal with the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   The Orioles now are poised to sign Belle and the Red Sox come
out of the fray as big losers, without Williams or Mo Vaughn, the
popular first baseman who left Boston this year and agreed
Wednesday to a six-year, $80 million with the Anaheim Angels.
</P>
<P>
   Boston's decision to break off talks with Vaughn helped create
the bidding war for Williams that ensued between them and the
Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   ``What it came down to is that I'm not sure Bernie ever really
wanted to leave the Yankees,'' said Red Sox General Manager Dan
Duquette, ``and when George Steinbrenner realized that one of the
best all-around players the Yankees have had since Joe DiMaggio was
ready to leave, he wouldn't let that happen.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Yankees are significant winners in keeping Williams, a
two-time Gold Glove winner who won the American League batting
title this year. Williams is well-liked and respected by his
teammates, whereas signing Belle would have invited potential
disaster into their harmonious clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees are significant financial losers, however, in their
long-term dealings with Williams. A year ago, they offered Williams
a five-year, $37.5 million deal, at a time when he wanted a
seven-year, $70 million. About 10 days ago, the Yankees offered
Williams the five-year deal, and preparing for the very real
possibility he would sign elsewhere, they opened serious
discussions with Belle and another outfielder, Brian Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   But the Yankees waited to see if Williams had serious offers
from other teams and to see if he really wanted to re-sign _ and as
they waited, Jordan signed a five-year, $40 million deal with the
Atlanta Braves on Monday, and the Orioles aggressively joined the
bidding for Belle. The Yankees' delays in addressing Williams'
situation cost them between $30 million and $50 million.
</P>
<P>
   Having recently negotiated a contract with Steinbrenner, veteran
pitcher David Cone believed that the posturing between the Yankees
and Williams was ``like a high-stakes poker game, where something
had to give.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody's going to be excited and happy to see Bernie
back,'' Cone said.
</P>
<P>
   The signing of Williams means the Yankees, who won 125 games and
the World Series last summer, will field virtually the same group
of players in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty rare in today's game to see that happen,'' said
Cone. ``Bernie is the final piece to the nucleus _ he's been a
lifelong Yankee, and it's pretty refreshing to see him stay.''

`TROUT IN THE CLASSROOM' HOOKS STUDENTS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRETT PAULY  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CASTAIC, Calif. _ As students from Sylmar's Harding Street
School lined the banks of Piru Creek to release fish they had
raised from eggs, fifth-grade teacher Vicki von Arx tried to
explain the sadness some were feeling.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have mixed feelings,'' she said. ``They know that some
will make it and some will not.''
</P>
<P>
   After all, the third- and fifth-graders had nurtured the rainbow
trout for six weeks, watching them hatch and grow to 1 inch while
discovering details about their life cycle and habitat
requirements, the importance of water quality and other lessons in
conservation and ecology. The culmination of their science project,
``Trout in the Classroom,'' was at hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to miss them a lot,'' said Janet Arreguin, 8, of
Sylmar. ``Some make me laugh when they are running around the
little aquarium.
</P>
<P>
   ``They helped me by surviving, and now I am surviving like some
fish. I'm surviving because I'm learning. I learned what bugs fish
eat and all that.''
</P>
<P>
   Older students rationalized that letting the trout go was a good
thing, a happy occasion.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like exciting because we raise the fish and when they
put them back... hopefully they will make more fishes,'' said
Timothy Martinez, 11, of Sylmar.
</P>
<P>
   Embraced by the Los Angeles Systemic Initiative _ the L.A.
Unified School District's math and science arm _ for the past two
years, ``Trout in the Classroom'' introduces children to ``yucky''
science in a friendly, hands-on manner, sometimes without them
realizing it. Moreover, it transcends science, and education
itself, covering many varied topics and involving resources outside
the school, including the Department of Fish and Game, area fishing
clubs, parents and the community at large.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they are getting science and conservation fed to them
without knowing they are learning anything. Teachers are sneaking
it in on them,'' said Erwin Goldbloom of West Hills, education
chairman for the Sierra Pacific Fly Fishers, one of more than a
dozen Southland fly-angling clubs whose members are program
volunteers.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the teachers are on the ball, they can go into other
offshoots _ reproduction, genetics, life cycles of bugs, plant
life, the food chain. And spelling, essays, math _ what percentage
of fish make it, for example,'' said Goldbloom, donning waders for
the Nov. 19 trout release northwest of Castaic to help with the
collection of insects for basic lessons in entomology. ``It also
gets them out here, which is nice.''
</P>
<P>
   Taught in more than 40 LAUSD classrooms a year, the interest in
``Trout in the Classroom'' can have a snowball effect, said Chris
Holle, LAUSD's science coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see this in more than one class and it excites the
imagination of the whole school,'' Holle said. ``It's a way to get
the community involved and the parents involved and give them a
sense of stewardship. They have a greater sense of responsibility
for the environment, so that when they go to it they have a new
appreciation and understanding of it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We want students to feel they are important contributors to
their world and that they can have a large effect on it,'' he said.
``These children are very young and they're getting that feeling
already.''
</P>
<P>
   Sylmar postal clerk Gloria Mendez arranged for a day off to be
with her 8-year-old twins, Angelica and Marcos, and help hand out
art material for a drawing project that coincided with the trout
release. Students also played games, went on a nature walk and
studied water conditions. Mendez caught the trout-program bug
because Angelica would come home and speak so excitedly about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Almost every day she talks about it,'' Mendez said. ``She then
draws pictures of fish and now she likes to eat fish.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Besides,'' she said, ``this is about science. I like
science.''
</P>
<P>
   It's exactly the type of comment that fuels science coordinator
Holle's passion to turn on a greater audience with programs like
``Trout in the Classroom.''
</P>
<P>
   Introduced to Southland schools about six years ago by Trout
Unlimited and the Southwest Council of the Federation of Fly
Fishers, ``Trout in the Classroom'' is based largely on a
curriculum developed in 1988 by a substitute science teacher at a
Humboldt County elementary school.
</P>
<P>
   Diane Higgins of McKinleyville wanted to teach fishery science
to her students in Eureka but was unable to find lesson material.
After attending a teacher's workshop dealing with a 1970s British
Columbia program of rearing salmon eggs in the classroom, Higgins
applied for and received a $12,000 grant to develop a teaching
curriculum she called ``California's Salmon and Steelhead: Our
Valuable Natural Heritage.''
</P>
<P>
   Higgins said her lessons are now taught across the state and in
parts of Oregon and Nevada. Classrooms are provided with
refrigerated trout incubators _ purchased either by a fishing club
or school district. In California, the Department of Fish and Game
supplies rainbow trout eggs. Educators receive DFG-approved
training to care for the eggs and to assist them with the
curriculum.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's boomed. It's gone big,'' said Daniel Iwata of Fountain
Valley, a member of the Fly Fishers Club of Orange County who was
instrumental in ushering ``Trout in the Classroom'' into the
region. ``It really gets into the stewardship of nature's
resources, and I think that's the important thing.''
</P>
<P>
   And if the program develops new anglers, well, Iwata said,
``That's an extra kudo.''
</P>
<P>
   It already has spawned a few.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to learn how to fish to see how the fishes look when
they are adults,'' said Janet Arreguin.
</P>
<P>
   Would you keep them or release them?
</P>
<P>
   ``Release them,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Why?
</P>
<P>
   ``Because they need some home and they need to protect
themselves and make more fish, because without them we won't grow
much healthier.'' &QL;

BRITAIN'S HIGH COURT REJECT PINOCHET'S BID FOR IMMUNITY
</HEADLINE>
  
 (REPEATING to remove graphic note; no other changes.)  (See also PINOCHET-CHILE, PINOCHET-REACT) 
 (nk) 
 By WARREN HOGE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ The House of Lords on Wednesday rejected Gen. Augusto
Pinochet's claim of immunity from arrest, committing him to remain
in custody here while Spain seeks his extradition on charges of
genocide and terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   In tersely worded verdicts, the five law lords who make up
England's highest court ruled 3-2 that crimes like hostage-taking
and torture are not protected by sovereign immunity because they
cannot be considered functional acts of a head of state.
</P>
<P>
   With the immunity issue settled, the focus shifts to Home
Secretary Jack Straw, who has until Dec. 2 to decide whether to
allow the Spanish extradition request to be answered by the courts.
</P>
<P>
   The government has remained publicly aloof so far, saying the
case is a matter for the courts to decide. But Straw, a key member
of the Cabinet, now has the power either to let the case go forward
or allow Pinochet to leave Britain on grounds of ill health or
compassion.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's ruling overturned the judgment of the High Court on
Oct. 28 that Pinochet, the onetime Chilean dictator, could not be
arrested because he is a former head of state and enjoys the
protection of the State Immunity Act of 1978. But the High Court
said he had to stay in England while the Crown Prosecution Service,
on behalf of the Spanish authorities, appealed the decision.
</P>
<P>
   The surprise arrest of Pinochet took place on Oct. 16 in
response to a request from a Spanish judge that he be held in
London for extradition to Madrid.
</P>
<P>
   One of the five judges, Lord Nicholls, expressing Wednesday's
majority view, told the House: ``International law has made plain
that certain types of conduct, including torture and
hostage-taking, are not acceptable conduct on the part of anyone.
This applies as much to heads of state, or even more so, as it does
to everyone else. The contrary conclusion would make a mockery of
international law.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's decision marked a potentially significant broadening
of the powers of prosecutors under international law and new human
rights covenants for pursuing people across national borders with
allegations of crimes against humanity. Opponents of the reasoning
behind Wednesday's finding have said prosecutors could apply it to
people like Queen Elizabeth II, for past British actions in
Ireland, and President Clinton, for the bombing of Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference in Parliament, Geoffrey Bindman, a lawyer
representing Amnesty International and the families of victims of
the Pinochet regime, called Wednesday's ruling ``the most important
case in human rights law this century.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The significance of this case will extend to all repressive
regimes where the heads of state seek to assert the freedom to
travel around the world living in luxury on the proceeds of their
crimes,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The first two judges to speak Wednesday upheld the earlier High
Court decision, raising the prospect among the hundreds of
thousands of people watching the event on television that Pinochet
would be flying home Wednesday afternoon on the Chilean Air Force
jet that has been parked at a suburban military field for the past
month.
</P>
<P>
   But the next three judges disagreed, setting off gasps in the
jammed public gallery and jubilant cheering and embracing among the
Chilean exiles gathered on the street outside Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Pinochet, who turned 83 on Wednesday, was appointed senator for
life in March when he stepped down as Army commander, largely for
the purpose of giving him immunity from prosecution in Chile.
</P>
<P>
   There was no word from the hospital in North London where he has
remained under police guard, recuperating from back surgery last
month. In his only comment since his arrest, he issued a statement
on Nov. 8 saying he was ``hurt and bewildered'' by his detention in
England, a country whose institutions he always admired, and would
fight the extradition order ``with all my spirit.''
</P>
<P>
   While a group of 100 Chilean exiles and other Pinochet opponents
danced and chanted joyously at the gates to the hospital, the
ambulance that was expected to transport the general to Brize
Norton Royal Air Force base in Oxfordshire, where a plane waited to
take him to Chile, drove off empty.
</P>
<P>
   Two warrants for the general's arrest and extradition from the
Spanish judge, Baltasar Garzon, allege that during the 17 years
Pinochet ruled Chile, he intentionally inflicted severe pain or
suffering, took hostages, conspired to kill enemies and conducted a
ruthless systematic purge of political opponents that resulted in
3,178 murders or ``disappearances.''
</P>
<P>
   Bow Street Magistrates Court in London has set a Dec. 2 deadline
by which Straw must make his decision and Pinochet must attend a
hearing, which would be his first appearance since his arrest.
</P>
<P>
   Former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher Wednesday urged Straw to
allow Pinochet to leave England because of his poor health. She has
lobbied for the general's release, saying the British should be
grateful to him for his support during the Falkland Islands War in
1982.
</P>
<P>
   ``The senator is old, frail and sick, and on compassionate
grounds alone should be allowed to return to Chile,'' she said
Wednesday moments after the law lords' ruling became known.
</P>
<P>
   In the House of Commons on Wednesday afternoon, William Hague,
the Conservative leader, also called on Straw to let the general go
and end what he called ``a huge diplomatic embarrassment for this
country.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's damaging relations with Chile, a long-standing ally of
our country, and causing instability in a country that is now
democratic,'' Hague said.
</P>
<P>
   The British government has said the Pinochet proceeding is a
matter for the judicial authorities here and in Spain.
</P>
<P>
   One official, Trade and Industry Minister Peter Mandelson, said
last month that extending compassion to Pinochet would be a ``gut
wrenching'' experience for those who remembered the events in Chile
after the military coup of 1973.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the statements from human rights groups Wednesday
specifically called on Straw to resist entreaties to interfere.
David Bull, director of Amnesty International U.K., said: ``It is
vital now that justice is done. This decision has opened the way
for that justice. We must send a message to the Home Secretary that
he must not overturn the will of the highest court in the land.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Pinochet, a self-declared Anglophile, had made a number of
visits here in recent years without incident. He arrived this time
on Sept. 21 and was treated as a VIP by the Foreign Office. He had
tea with Mrs. Thatcher in her home and gave a long interview to The
New Yorker magazine in which he proclaimed his love of England.
</P>
<P>
   But he suffered back pains during the flight from Chile, and a
doctor recommended immediate surgery. The operation took place on
Oct. 9 and the general was recuperating when he was arrested.
</P>
<P>
   He has remained under police guard, in keeping with the High
Court's direction that he remain in England while the appeal was
being heard.
</P>
<P>
   Pinochet has not been seen in public since his arrest.
</P>
<P>
   In the statement issued Nov. 8, he said the peaceful future of
countries that had experienced internal conflict lay in
``reconciliation,'' and argued that ``in Chile, as elsewhere,
recrimination is the enemy of reconciliation.'' He cited Spain,
South Africa and Northern Ireland as positive examples where ``wise
decisions have been made not to revisit the past.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The opening up of old wounds, bringing back into debate issues
where the true facts have long since been forgotten, serves no
purpose,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Reports about what occurred in Chile were ``a travesty of the
truth,'' he contended, and as a result, he had become the victim of
``spurious attempts by foreign prosecutors to convict me on
unproven charges.''

WELL, WHAT HAVE WE HERE? NOT MUCH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   This is not a Mo Vaughn story. Promise. Well, I almost promise.
For now we will try to stay away from the betrayal-and-trust theme
in which the Red Sox and Mo had entangled themselves the past few
years. It is a theme with so much psychosis that the syrupy Dr.
Laura could devote an entire radio show to it. Until she got bored.
And she would become bored.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is that Dan Duquette and John Harrington could
probably tell us some startling things about Vaughn. And Vaughn
could probably dish us some devious, inside management stories.
They might tell us that Mo snores. Mo might tell us that they wear
wingtips and knee-high dress socks to the beach. That's fine. We
can let those three stand in a semicircle and singe each other with
verbal grenades. But this is what I truly want to know:
</P>
<P>
   Who has the Dom Perignon on ice so we can all celebrate the Jose
Offerman Era?
</P>
<P>
   That's what Sox fans were left with Wednesday. Vaughn finally
became an Anaheim Angel, agreeing to a contract that is worth $80
million; Bernie Williams thanked the Sox for their kind words and
stayed with the Yankees (did anyone really think the Sox were going
to outbid the pinstriped vault known as George Steinbrenner?); and
Albert Belle, who had grown cool to the Sox a few days ago, further
receded to either the Baltimore or Chicago horizon.
</P>
<P>
   Now, pretend for a moment that you are an objective baseball
fan, viewing the transaction wire from a city such as Anchorage or
Tuscaloosa. You see that shortly after saying goodbye to Vaughn,
the Sox sign Offerman to a deal averaging more than $6 million a
season, even though they already have enough second basemen to fit
any style you want to play. You hear Offerman say that he struggled
so much in Los Angeles because there was too much pressure. Yep.
Too much pressure. In LA. You see that Offerman dominated in Kansas
City, a Triple A team that finished about 700 games out of first
place in the AL Central for about the 30th consecutive season.
</P>
<P>
   You continue to read, although you are frightened by these
people. You watch the Bostonians pursue a true jazz head in center
fielder Williams. You watch them chase after the Angriest Brother
In The Business in Belle, a man who _ true story _ once flinched
when he thought a reporter said, ``You suck'' to him when the
reporter actually said, ``What's up?'' You begin to frown when you
see that the Indians signed Roberto Alomar to a contract worth $30
million-$32 million, only $6 million more than Offerman's.
</P>
<P>
   I am sure the Sox have a vision. I am not sure I want to know
what it is. I am not sure I want to visit them too often next
season. Remember the good days of October, when the Sox were only a
few players away from being a very good team? They are now about
six players away. Maybe even six years away. Not only did they lose
Vaughn, they also lost a very good setup man in Greg Swindell. They
have to hope the Bret Saberhagen Miracle continues and that
Offerman can be a great leadoff man in front of ... in front of ...
whom?
</P>
<P>
   We know John Valentin can hit second and Nomar Garciaparra can
hit third or fourth. But who else is there? The Sox were exposed in
the postseason because they needed another above-average bat to
complement Vaughn and Garciaparra. So they lose their top home run
man, add a guy who popped seven homers, and still have not added a
starter who can pitch between Pedro Martinez and Tim
Wakefield/Saberhagen. Worse, look at all the major signings. Many
of them are in the American League. Randy Johnson looks like he'll
sign with the Rangers. Mo is in Anaheim. Williams is in New York.
The Indians have a Fantasy League All-Star lineup and the strongest
bullpen in the league. And the Sox have Offerman and a bunch of
nice rejection letters reading, ``You're a sweet guy who is going
to make someone happy one day. It just won't be me ...''
</P>
<P>
   Despite all the local chatter about Duquette as a heartless
cyborg, I actually like the man. He is a lover of literature and
Bruce Springsteen. But if he continues to let things like this
happen with his team, he will have plenty of time to theorize on
the musical Boss after being pushed aside in the AL East by the
Yankee Boss.
</P>
<P>
   If you thought the Yankees were dominant last season, they could
win 135 games if they manage to trade for the most underrated
player in baseball, Montreal's Rondell White. Duquette? Well, his
famous poolside interview with Bob Lobel will become his personal
Buckner. He won't be able to watch himself say that you cannot let
potential free agents walk away and get nothing for them.
</P>
<P>
   He had to know Mo was leaving, right? Everyone knew. They hoped
he would stay, but even the children from his Blue Hill Avenue
youth center knew he was going to be out. Why didn't The Duke know
and react to it? He knew Vaughn was going to leave as soon as he
stood in front of the Green Monster (another Buckner moment) and
did not mention Vaughn as a potential All-Star in 1999. I am afraid
to ask where the Sox will be at the '99 All-Star break. I am afraid
to ask what kind of numbers Vaughn will be dropping on the rest of
the AL by then, too.
</P>
<P>
   But more than anything, I am afraid of the people who are
running the Red Sox. Yo, Duke. If you are not acting alone, please
speak up. Tell us if Harrington is putting you up to this. If this
is all your work, you might find yourself chilling in the
Berkshires at the All-Star break and beyond the All-Star break.
</P>
<P>
   Happy Thanksgiving, Sox fans. Be thankful. The Red Sox have
brought you Offerman.
</P>

POLITICAL FIRES SEND ENVOY TO U.N. HOT SEAT 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ It was an accident of politics that put Peter
Burleigh in the U.S. chair this fall when the Security Council
grappled in its inimitably ponderous way through crises in Kosovo
and then Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   An Asian and Middle East specialist, Burleigh was little known
beyond the Foreign Service when Bill Richardson left the top job at
the U.S. Mission in August to become energy secretary and the
Clinton administration ran into trouble with the nomination of his
would-be successor, Richard Holbrooke.
</P>
<P>
   Burleigh had been the mission's No. 2 diplomat (a slot
traditionally reserved for a career officer preferably with
experience in the Middle East) for a year before he stepped in as
charge d'affaires. He was Richardson's choice as a deputy, an
assignment Burleigh now describes as ``harder and better'' than he
expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got called in the middle of the night in Colombo and asked
if I would come the next day for an interview with Bill Richardson
in Washington,'' said Burleigh, who was then U.S. ambassador in Sri
Lanka. ``I foolishly agreed.'' It was February 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hit it off, Richardson and I, which continued here,''
Burleigh said. ``I'm a big fan, even though we are wildly different
kinds of people. He was an easy boss to work for.''
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Slobodan Milosevic, Saddam Hussein and Peter
Burleigh himself have done much to raise the acting U.S.
representative's profile at the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   Fate seems determined to snare Burleigh in the long-playing
Iraqi story. Before the Persian Gulf War in 1991, he was selected
to become the next ambassador to Iraq. From 1985 to 1987, he had
been in charge of Iraqi and Iranian affairs at the State
Department, and in 1987 had moved up to deputy assistant secretary
of state for Near Eastern and South Asian affairs.
</P>
<P>
   In these weeks of crisis, Burleigh has become a popular figure
around the United Nations, not least because of his ability to poke
fun at himself and his anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   When he spoke recently at the 50th anniversary dinner of the
U.N. Correspondents' Association, he spun a story about how
thrilled he was when he returned, exhausted, to his office one
evening to find the association's invitation. It was addressed to
Richardson.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I read on, and was truly heartened to read these words,''
he said. ``In the event that Ambassador Richardson has moved on, as
he inevitably will, to even greater things, we would be more than
honored by the presence of the internationally acclaimed and
respected diplomat Richard C. Holbrooke.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If they can't make it, please send that other guy. The one
with the bow tie,'' said Burleigh, who is famous for his colorful
ties. (An aide said that ``every time he gets stressed he buys
another one.'')
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no idea how many bow ties I have,'' Burleigh answered
before being asked. He said he buys them all, handmade, from Beau
Ties Ltd., a small mail-order company in Middlebury, Vt. And he
keeps instructions in his office to fax to people who want to know
why he never fails to tie a perfect bow.
</P>
<P>
   Albert Peter Burleigh, 56, is a Californian who first developed
an interest in South Asia when he joined the Peace Corps and was
sent to Nepal after graduating from Colgate. He later returned to
Katmandu as a Fulbright scholar. Nepali is one of the South Asian
languages he now speaks fluently, along with Bengali, Hindi and
Sinhalese.
</P>
<P>
   After joining the Foreign Service, he served in the U.S.
embassies in Nepal, India, Bahrain and finally Sri Lanka. He has
also been the State Department's coordinator for the Office of
Counterterrorism and principal deputy assistant secretary of state
for intelligence and research.
</P>
<P>
   Fellow diplomats say Burleigh's biggest problem in the Security
Council, of which he is president for the month of November, is
lack of political footing in the Clinton White House. That appears
to limit his role to delivering Washington's messages rather than
helping to form policy.
</P>
<P>
   His sideline role was evident recently as Washington took 24
hours longer than most members to join the Security Council
consensus on Iraq and give Saddam a chance to prove he really means
to cooperate with arms inspectors. Other diplomats said Burleigh
spent a lot of time working phones and waiting for instructions.
</P>
<P>
   ``So would anyone who would be in the job, because of the high
seriousness of the issues,'' Burleigh said. He added that he had
been treated ``extremely well'' and kept in the loop through video
conference calls with both Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
and National Security Adviser Sandy Berger.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe being a career diplomat is the kind of
damaging characteristic that a lot of people have commented on, in
at least some ways,'' he said.

GROUP OPPOSING INDIAN WHALE HUNT MOVES BOAT 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Ending a 57-day standoff, representatives of the Sea
Shepherd Conservation Society on Wednesday moved their second boat
away from the reservation of the Makah Indians, where some society
members had said they would come between the tribe and its plan to
hunt whales.
</P>
<P>
   The Makahs, who wanted to resume whaling Oct. 1, say they still
plan to revive a tribal tradition by paddling a cedar canoe on a
hunt for a whale.
</P>
<P>
   With swells 7 to 8 feet high in the Pacific Ocean, the weather
would now prevent the hunt, said Lisa Distefano, international
director of Sea Shepherd, a marine conservation and advocacy group.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that they didn't kill a whale, for us, is the biggest
victory,'' Ms. Distefano said. ``We feel better after having met
them face to face, all of them, and after having seen that
nonlethal alternatives are something they'll talk about.''
</P>
<P>
   One Sea Shepherd boat has moved to Seattle, which is about 130
miles from the reservation, and the other left Wednesday for Friday
Harbor, about 80 miles away. Smaller conservation groups said they
would remain near Neah Bay, where they could monitor a tribal hunt.
</P>
<P>
   The Makah Indians, who traditionally hunted whales in the
Pacific and the Strait of Juan de Fuca from their land on the
Olympic Peninsula, stopped whaling 70 years ago when hunters on the
East Coast depleted the population of the gray whale, now an
internationally endangered species.
</P>
<P>
   When the gray whale was taken off the federal endangered species
list in 1994, the Makahs expressed interest in resuming the hunt, a
move supported by the government but criticized by
environmentalists.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the tribe and the Sea Shepherd society, based in
Marina del Ray, Calif., met Monday to discuss their concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of the Makah, the silent majority, support whaling
nonlethally,'' Ms. Distefano said, suggesting whale-watching trips,
re-enactments of whaling expeditions and native canoeing as
alternatives to the hunt. ``It was important for us to leave so the
silent majority can voice themselves. They didn't want to be allied
with anyone from the outside.''
</P>
<P>
   But Makah officials are committed to continuing the hunt, saying
that the prospect of returning to whaling has strengthened the
structure of the tribe and given young people something to be proud
of, a modern link with their traditions. The Makah Indians' Treaty
of 1855 with the United States government made the tribe the only
one specifically allowed to hunt whales.
</P>
<P>
   The modern tribe, with support from the Clinton administration
and a $310,000 grant from the Commerce Department, last year won a
rare exemption from the worldwide whaling ban, allowing it to take
up to five gray whales per year in the next five years.
</P>
<P>
   The tribe plans to smoke the whale meat and make it into jerky
that will be distributed to families and eaten at community
gatherings. As of 1990, 55.1 percent of the tribal members lived
below the poverty line.
</P>
<P>
   Donny Swan, a Makah whaler who comes from a traditional whaling
family, said he and seven companions who will set out in a dugout
canoe continue to prepare for the hunt by paddling at 5 a.m. and
participating in spiritual bathing.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are glad to see them gone,'' Swan said of the Sea
Shepherd representatives. ``I hope we don't see them again.'' He
said the tribe planned to hunt a whale ``as soon as the weather
breaks.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Distefano said the tribe would have to answer to
international outrage if it killed a whale, which is done by
harpooning the animal and then shooting it.

AFTER LOSING FOCUS, WATTS BACK ON TRACK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ For a while, Quincy Watts' life was set as nicely
as a Thanksgiving table. After winning two gold medals at the 1992
Summer Olympics in Barcelona, Watts had fame, fortune and friends
at his fingertips. It was a sumptuous feast and Watts freely
indulged.
</P>
<P>
   His gnawing hunger quickly was sated but Watts didn't stop.
People kept loading his plate with seconds and thirds and fourths,
shoving appearance money and first-class plane tickets and lavish
party invitations in front of his nose.
</P>
<P>
   The former Taft High track standout was too obeisant. That much
is so obvious to him now but the truth escaped him back then, when
he was seated at the head of the quartermiler's table eating
everything up, ignoring the internal voice that was screaming for
him to stop.
</P>
<P>
   The problem with becoming fixated on everything on your plate,
as Watts would come to see, is you tend to ignore the people who
are preaching moderation, who can't bear to watch you overindulge,
who try to coax you from the table.
</P>
<P>
   Watts had to gain weight and lose his lofty world ranking before
he realized it's not the opulence of the spread that matters, it's
the family fanned out around you at the table.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I've been through has made me appreciate my family,''
Watts said. ``They are what I'll be giving thanks for because
they've never stopped supporting me.''
</P>
<P>
   It's funny how time has a way of re-directing our gratitude. In
1988 gymnast Kristie Phillips, a seeming shoo-in for Olympic
stardom, could do no better than second alternate on the U.S. team
and didn't get to compete in Seoul. Ten years later she told Sports
Illustrated that not having a chance to shine on the world's
grandest stage did her a world of good because if she ``had gotten
everything, I wouldn't know what it takes to make it in the
world.''
</P>
<P>
   Her words drew nods and murmurs from Watts, who had gotten
everything so easily in 1992 that it made navigating the next few
years doubly difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never had had to deal with losing,'' he said. ``I never had
had to battle myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Never mind his gold medals, the real triumph of the human spirit
is revealed in Watts being back on the track and back on track.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Phillips, Watts was a long shot for Olympic stardom who
delivered in stunning fashion, finishing five meters ahead of his
nearest competitor in the 400 and setting an Olympic record that
would weather Michael Johnson's challenge in Atlanta four years
later.
</P>
<P>
   He added a second gold medal in the 4 X 400 relay and in the
European kingdom, where track athletes are royalty, was immediately
anointed a knight. Overnight he found he could earn more money
simply for showing up for a race than his father netted in a year
as a postal employee.
</P>
<P>
   The wind(fall) remained at Watts' back through 1993. He became a
cult figure in Europe after starring in a commercial every bit as
popular as today's stateside standby, ``Got Milk?''
</P>
<P>
   In the commercial a Viking king offered Watts his hefty wife in
exchange for a pair of the runner's generously cushioned sneakers.
Watts took one look at the woman and ran the other way as she gave
chase and cried, ``Quin-cy!''
</P>
<P>
   It was hard to imagine the lean times that lay ahead, in those
days when a continent was screaming his name. Watts gained a few
pounds on the post-Olympics banquet circuit but managed to run
fourth in the 400 at the 1993 World Championships.
</P>
<P>
   After that he became increasingly harder to track as injuries _
to his legs, back and, worst of all his psyche _ slowed him to a
virtual stop. Indeed, the rumors of his demise traveled faster than
did Watts in 1996 when he finished seventh in the 400 at the U.S.
trials, assuring the perpetuation of the 400's Olympic streak of
no-repeat gold medalists.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was living in the fast lane,'' said Watts, who had the
personalized license plate (2XGOLDQ) on his late-model luxury sedan
to prove it. ``I had everything I wanted. I thought it would never
end. I started getting distracted. I was missing practices. I was
doing everything not to be successful and I always had an excuse
for everything. A lot of the things I blamed people for, I can now
see I brought those things on myself.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1994 Watts was ranked seventh in the world in his specialty.
He hasn't seen the top-10 since. For the past two years he has been
the phantom of the 400. He really was invisible to many of the
friends and business acquaintances who had ingratiated themselves
to him in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Of all the lessons Watts had to learn, the hardest was there
were people who used him as though he were an ATM. Thankfully, his
grandmother Olivia and father Rufus remained steadfastly in his
corner. With their support, Watts finally resurfaced in September.
</P>
<P>
   He returned to the track after a right ankle sprain ended a
whimsical free-agent tryout with the San Diego Chargers.
</P>
<P>
   Football had been an itch Watts didn't dare scratch since he
played for the USC scout team in 1990. He had wondered ever since
how far he might have gone in the sport if he had concentrated on
it instead of track.
</P>
<P>
   He finally decided to devote one year to finding out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to get the what-ifs out of my mind,'' Watts said the
other day, soaking up the sun after sweating through a weight
workout at UCLA. ``If it worked out, great, and if it didn't I
could always go back to track.''
</P>
<P>
   So it is that he resumed his love affair with running. The
surprise is that he has been able to look at the track's same old
curves in an entirely new light.
</P>
<P>
   ``Football turned my whole perspective around,'' Watts said.
``Running now gives me so much pleasure. I have a whole new respect
for it that I should have never lost.''
</P>
<P>
   Odd, isn't it, to think he had to work like a dog in one sport
to rediscover the joy of being a greyhound in another.
</P>
<P>
   ``I realized I have a God-given talent to run track,'' Watts
said. ``Through my own faults I've let this talent kind of go into
hibernation. I'm not going to let that happen. I'm not going to
waste my talents.''
</P>
<P>
   Watts will be 30 in 2000. That's the same age another Angeleno,
Michael Larrabee, was in 1964 when his comeback in the quarter mile
ended in Olympic gold. If Watts gets to Sydney, great. But he
doesn't need to accomplish anything more to be grateful. &QL;

CHINA SAID TO HOLD 70 CHURCH LEADERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ More than 70 Protestant ``house church'' leaders
remain in detention after a crackdown on illegal church activities
in late October and early November, a human rights group said
Wednesday. One woman, it said, was beaten so badly in jail that she
suffered brain injuries.
</P>
<P>
   The crackdown occurred in the central province of Henan, where
underground Protestant leaders from around the country were
meeting. China allows worship in an official Protestant church that
accepts the leadership of the government, but tens of millions of
Chinese are believed to have become involved in so-called house
churches that operate illegally.
</P>
<P>
   The injured woman, Cheng Meiying, had traveled to the meetings
from northeastern China where she was a successful missionary,
establishing many new house churches, according to the statement
from the New York-based group Human Rights in China.
</P>
<P>
   The statement, based on information passed abroad by
house-church followers, said Ms. Cheng had repeatedly been beaten
while in detention and lost consciousness for three days. She was
released on Saturday but suffers memory loss and severe
disorientation, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
   Another church leader, Li Qingrui, was shot in the thigh while
fleeing the police, the statement said. After receiving hospital
care he escaped and is now the object of a national manhunt, it
said.

GRAHAM RECALLS A THANKSGIVING BLOWOUT AND BLUE FEET 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By BILL PENNINGTON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ On Thanksgiving Day six years ago, Kent
Graham was a 24-year-old Giants rookie about to start his first
National Football League game on national television in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Graham did not approach the situation with cold feet.
</P>
<P>
   They were blue.
</P>
<P>
   Someone had dyed Graham's feet blue in practice that week,
putting a colorless powder in his socks and shoes that turned blue
when combined with any kind of moisture, like perspiration. The dye
took about a week to wear off.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was raining that day in practice and my feet really got
soaked,'' Graham said Wednesday at Giants Stadium. ``Apparently,
there was blue stuff seeping out of my shoes.''
</P>
<P>
   Graham was forced into the lineup that week of the 1992 season
because of injuries to the Giants' two top quarterbacks, Phil Simms
and Jeff Hostetler.
</P>
<P>
   ``Phil and Hoss were just looking at my feet and laughing,''
Graham said. ``I didn't get it, and I didn't even notice until
after practice when I took my shoes off.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was like, `What's this?'''
</P>
<P>
   Graham suspects that the wide receivers coach, George Sefcik,
put the blue dye in his socks.
</P>
<P>
   If it's a trick that Graham found offensive, it's one he has
learned from.
</P>
<P>
   This year at the Giants' training camp, the rookie quarterback
Ben Anderson showed up one day with a case of blue feet.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone pointed the finger at Graham.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, with a wide grin, Graham said, ``I don't know how his
feet turned blue.''
</P>
<P>
   Blue feet or not, Graham's NFL debut did not go well. Dallas was
on the verge of its first Super Bowl season under coach Jimmy
Johnson. On Thanksgiving Day, the Cowboys blitzed Graham _ and his
eventual replacement, Dave Brown, _ all day in a 30-3 rout. Graham
completed 12 of 28 passes for 151 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a long time ago,'' Graham said when asked what he
remembered about the day _ besides having blue feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember being nervous. I remember that I almost threw up in
the tunnel before the game. It was a dream come true, starting on
Thanksgiving on national TV.''
</P>
<P>
   Graham gets another shot on national television as the Giants'
starting quarterback Monday night in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a lot more comfortable about it than I was six years
ago,'' said Graham, who has since started 18 other NFL games for
the Giants and Arizona Cardinals. ``But I'm just as excited to have
an opportunity on national television. I'm going to go out there
and attack the defense, and I'm going to have fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Just the same, he may check carefully this week before putting
on his socks.
</P>
<P>
   Barely a Ripple
</P>
<P>
   Both San Francisco coach Steve Mariucci and 49ers quarterback
Steve Young made little of the controversy spawned by Jerry Rice's
complaints last weekend that he wasn't getting enough passes thrown
his way.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a situation where he was venting,'' Mariucci said of
Rice, who is leading the National Football Conference in receptions
with 61. ``He's got such high standards. But it's not an issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking with reporters on a conference call, Young said: ``I
respect Jerry because his work ethic is so unbelievable. He works
for the ball, he deserves the ball. It's not that hard to throw the
ball to Jerry Rice. We've always had trouble having enough balls in
this offense. It's very difficult to get it around to enough people
when you only have one ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Young was asked if he had sent Rice flowers this week as he is
depicted doing in a popular television commercial.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, that was a one-shot deal,'' Young answered.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton Apologizes
</P>
<P>
   Giants defensive tackle Keith Hamilton had little comment on his
arrest Monday on a charge of marijuana possession.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want to apologize to the Giants' organization and to my
family and to the fans,'' said Hamilton, who was stopped early
Monday morning for speeding on the George Washington Bridge, which
links New Jersey and Manhattan. Police said they found less than an
ounce of marijuana and a pipe on Hamilton.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton was also charged with driving an uninsured car and
driving under the influence of a controlled dangerous substance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been in the league seven years and nothing like this has
happened before,'' Hamilton said. ``We'll see how it ends up.''

NEW ANGLE TO ANGLING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRETT PAULY  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ There is much more in the field of outdoors
writing than guidebooks. Literature of nature is often overlooked
by anglers and hunters wishing to improve their luck and technique.
Here are two examples of vastly varying quality:
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no taking trout in dry breeches.''
</P>
<P>
   This pearl of wisdom comes from no less a literary giant than
Miguel de Cervantes, the Spanish writer who penned ``Don Quixote''
in 1605.
</P>
<P>
   Spring that on the average angler who dunks night crawlers and
crawdads in search of the bass of a lifetime. ``Don who?'' may be
the response.
</P>
<P>
   While fishermen may not be known as the most well-read group of
individuals, the converse seems to be true: Many writers seem to be
anglers, as evidenced in ``The Quotable Fisherman'' (Lyons Press;
$20).
</P>
<P>
   The jottings of such pen-toting luminaries as Mark Twain, Izaak
Walton, Ernest Hemingway, George Eliot, Sergei Aksakov, John Buchan
and Norman Maclean grace the book's 200 pages; their very presence
lends credence to the (begin ital)art(end ital) of sport-fishing,
which is often overlooked, misunderstood and maligned by people who
just don't get it.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the selected comments should help the uninitiated to
better fathom the passion of man vs. fish:
</P>
<P>
   ``The outdoor life pleased these old men because they believed
any properly obsessed fly fisherman carried rivers and trout inside
him.'' &QL; 
_Harry Middleton &QL; 
``The Earth is Enough,'' 1989
</P>
<P>
   ``I chose my cast, a march brown and a dun,
</P>
<P>
   And ran down to the river, chasing hope.'' &QL; 
_Wilfred S. Blunt &QL; 
``A New Pilgrimage,'' 1889
</P>
<P>
   ``The wildness and adventure that are in fishing still recommend
it to me.'' &QL; 
_Henry David Thoreau &QL; 
``Walden,'' 1854
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing is more trying to the patience of fishermen than the
remark so often made to them by the profane: `I had not patience
enough for fishing!''' &QL; 
_Arthur Ransome &QL; 
``Rod and Line,'' 1929
</P>
<P>
   Complemented by line drawings from Alan James Robinson and
introduced by prolific angling author Nick Lyons, who compiled the
entries, ``The Quotable Fisherman'' offers much for the angler and
layman alike to nibble on.
</P>
<P>
   When a professional fisherman is in his boat, he never stops
fishing _ even when he has to relieve himself... while the female
editor of a bass-angling magazine on board is snapping photos of
the catch.
</P>
<P>
   That fine bit of detail may fascinate some, but, for many, it
offers much more information than they wanted to know. It's also at
the core of the trouble with ``Bass Master Shaw Grigsby: Notes on
Fishing and Life'' (National Geographic Books; $19.95).
</P>
<P>
   While writing in the first person can be a valuable element of
outdoor writing, offering an air of first-hand knowledge for the
subject, it is a tool that can be quickly overused _ sometimes to
ad nauseam _ if not kept in check. Soon readers are counting how
often ``I'' appears rather than considering the advice offered, no
matter how sage.
</P>
<P>
   Such is the case with the 192 pages by Shaw E. Grigsby Jr. of
Gainesville, Fla., who ranks fifth on the all-time money list among
competitive bass anglers. His valuable tips and storytelling soon
dissolve into a vane diary that only a mother could love.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt Grigsby knows his stuff. His commentary on how nature
often dictates a bite in the passage ``Rhythms,'' for example, is
right on. When all is still, when the cows are laying down, the
birds aren't chirping and the bugs aren't biting, neither are the
fish.
</P>
<P>
   The torture of getting snagged by his own hook is recalled
concisely enough, and Grigsby's recommendations for those who
follow suit are sincere and helpful.
</P>
<P>
   But anglers who try their hand at writing tend to feature
themselves too frequently, thus minimizing their expertise. Proving
that the best stories usually come from writers-cum-anglers.

GAILEY EXPECTED TO MAKE GAME-TIME DECISION ON SANDERS
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ When the Cowboys meet the Minnesota Vikings
today, Dallas will be trying to clinch its first playoff berth in
two seasons. As Chan Gailey rises this morning, he remains unsure
if he'll have Deion Sanders on defense.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders did not have his sprained, left big toe in a walking
cast, but instead sported tennis shoes as he walked around the
club's jogging track yesterday, talking with team owner Jerry Jones
and trainer Jim Maurer.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders' status, and that of backup running back Chris Warren
(groin) won't be determined until before kickoff.
</P>
<P>
   ``How active or inactive they'll be won't be determined until
closer to game time,'' Gailey said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Gailey said he was unaware the Cowboys could clinch a
playoff berth this soon. But according to the league, the Cowboys
make the playoffs if they win ``and'' Arizona and New Orleans lose
on Sunday. The Cardinals are at Kansas City; the Saints are at
Miami.
Kick return duties
</P>
<P>
   Gailey has settled on wide receiver Jeff Ogden to replace Warren
on kickoff returns, and cornerback Kevin Smith to replace Sanders
on punt returns.
</P>
<P>
   Smith has one punt return in his pro career for 17 yards in
1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key thing for me is to make sure I catch the ball,'' Smith
said. ``But hey, I plan on doing something with it when I get it.
Deion has kidded me a lot about it this week.''
</P>
<P>
   Ogden said he didn't return kicks in college or high school.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just going to hit the holes and run as fast as I can,''
Ogden said.
Stopping Moss
</P>
<P>
   Smith said the key to defending Vikings wide receivers Randy
Moss and Cris Carter is not solely in tight coverage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Me and Charlie \RWilliams\S have to make sure we make plays on
the ball,'' Smith said. ``A lot of times, when you are in coverage
and on top of the guys, they can still jump up and get the ball
over you. Being in coverage is not enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams said he's aware of Moss' jumping ability. But, ``we
also got to hit those guys if they get the ball. We've got to be
physical.''
Jerry speak
</P>
<P>
   Jones compared the pregame buzz to a ``Texas-Oklahoma game.''
But what Jones really likes is the Cowboys are a legitimate part of
the ``aura'' of a big game again. He doesn't even mind his team is
considered the underdog.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like that,'' Jones said. ``It's just like the entire year. I
enjoy being unexpectedly competitive _ unlike the years when
everybody gave us the Super Bowl before the season. It's more fun
to be a part of a team and do what I do if we are challenged by
doing the unexpected.''

EXXON-MOBILE MERGER TALKS ARE REPORTED 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Va., Texas)   (EDS: This is a short refer on page 1.)  
(js) 
 By AGIS SALPUKAS with LAURA M. HOLSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Exxon Corp. and Mobil Corp. have held discussions about
combining their business operations, a person involved in the talks
said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear Wednesday whether talks were continuing. If the
companies were to merge, it would create the largest U.S. company
in terms of revenue.
</P>
<P>
   A possible merger was reported separately by both The Financial
Times of London and Bloomberg News. The reported talks between
Exxon, whose annual revenue exceeds that of Wal-Mart and General
Electric, and Mobil, the No. 2 U.S. oil company, come as oil prices
have sunk to their lowest in almost 12 years. A combined company
would be bigger than Royal Dutch/Shell Group, the world's largest
oil company by revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Financial terms of the discussions could not be determined
Wednesday. Neither Exxon or Mobil would comment.
</P>
<P>
   Any union would reunite two parts of John D. Rockefeller's
Standard Oil Trust, which was broken up by the Supreme Court in
1911. Exxon was then known as Standard Oil of New Jersey, and Mobil
consisted of two companies: Standard Oil of New York and Vacuum
Oil.
</P>
<P>
   Both Exxon, which has a market value of $176.7 billion, and
Mobil, which has a market value of $61.1 billion, have a history of
being fiercely independence. Both have already cut back on staff
and made themselves lean in order to survive long periods when oil
prices are low. But this has been a particularly unsettling year
for the oil industry, and there is little prospect that crude oil
prices will recover soon.
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, chief executives of most oil companies have had to
swallow their pride and look for suitable partners. This summer,
British Petroleum announced a $48.2 billion agreement to buy Amoco
Corp., creating the world's third-largest oil company and prompting
analysts to predict even more widespread consolidation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It showed that megamergers are doable,'' said Adam Sieminski,
an analyst for BT Alex. Brown.
</P>
<P>
   He added, however, that a combination between Exxon and Mobil
would not be an easy match because Mobil has been known for being a
proud company that has said in the past that it would not want to
merge.
</P>
<P>
   Exxon, he added, is a ``well run company that likes to grow its
own businesses.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that the heads of both companies, Lee Raymond, the
chairman of Exxon, which is based in Irving, Texas, and Lucio Noto,
the chairman, president and chief executive of Mobil, which is
based in Fairfax, Va., are different personalities.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will not be easy,'' he said of combining the two far-flung
companies, which have vast networks of refineries and gas stations
that overlap in the United States and Europe. ``If you offer enough
money you can make anything happen,'' he added.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Both companies are under pressure to find new fields of oil to
help them survive in the long term. Like other oil companies, they
had hoped to quickly tap into the vast reserves of Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Even though they were prepared to spend billions, they have held
back because of the political and economic crisis in Russia and
great reluctance by Russian officials and oil companies to give up
control of vast fields.
</P>
<P>
   Thus they have had to fall back on their own exploration areas
such as the deep waters in the Gulf of Mexico and West Africa. Such
exploration is very expensive, and even when large fields are found
it often takes platforms costing $1 billion to bring the oil into
production.
</P>
<P>
   Oil prices have been under pressure for more than a year,
falling more than 40 percent from the $20-a-barrel level because of
growing inventories of petroleum and declining Asian demand caused
by the economic crisis there. On Wednesday, crude oil for January
delivery fell 29 cents, or 2.6 percent, to $11.86 a barrel on the
New York Mercantile Exchange, close to the 12-year low of $11.42
reached on June 15.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and
some other oil-producing nations, notably Mexico, have tried to
stem the price drops with pledges to cut back on production. But
those pledges have not always been honored, and rallies in the oil
market this year have proven short-lived. OPEC members on Wednesday
continued their discussion on extending their production cutbacks,
and an agreement is expected as early as Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   In the spring, OPEC agreed to reduce production by 2.6 million
barrels a day, about 3 percent of the daily world supply of 74
million barrels. The main result of that agreement appears to have
been to keep oil prices from falling below $10 a barrel.
</P>
<P>
   Washington regulators said Wednesday that they had not been
notified about the Exxon-Mobil discussions. The Federal Trade
Commission is still reviewing British Petroleum's pending purchase
of Amoco.
</P>
<P>
   An Exxon-Mobil deal would be certain to receive several months'
worth of scrutiny by the commission, which would review how much of
the industry such a merger would control.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts and investment bankers were split about the logic of
the possible merger. Some pointed to difficulties that the
companies could face if they were combined.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you asked me if Exxon needed to be bigger, the answer is
probably no,'' said Garfield Miller, president of Aegis Energy
Advisors Corp., a small independent investment bank based in New
York. ``It is hard to say that there is anything in particular to
gain.''
</P>
<P>
   In particular, Miller said, the two companies have enormous
similarities in their domestic refining and marketing businesses.
``They really do overlap quite a bit,'' he said. ``You really do
wonder what is the benefit of all that redundancy.''
</P>
<P>
   Another investment banker in the energy business, speaking on
the condition of anonymity, also questioned the rationale for the
discussed merger. ``When you look at the BP-Amoco deal, you can
rationalize it,'' the banker said. ``But none of those reasons
apply to an Exxon-Mobil deal.''
</P>
<P>
   But Amy Jaffe, an energy research analyst with the James A.
Baker III Institute for Public Policy, said the combination of the
two companies would be logical, in part because it would give them
greater influence in bidding for projects in Middle Eastern
countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a deal that makes sense,'' Ms. Jaffe said. ``With this
combined company, there is no project that would be too big.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Ms. Jaffe said, the merger would provide each
company with new oil and gas assets in areas of the world where
they had little influence. ``There are a lot of complimentary
assets where they are not redundant,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She said that Exxon, for example, has a strong presence in
Angola, while Mobil does not. And Mobil has significant assets in
the Caspian Sea and Nigeria, where Exxon is weak.

 By WARREN HOGE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ The House of Lords on Wednesday rejected Gen. Augusto
Pinochet's claim of immunity from arrest and committed him to
remain in custody here while Spain seeks his extradition on charges
of mass murder and terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   In tersely worded verdicts, the five law lords who make up
England's highest court ruled 3-2 that crimes like hostage-taking
and torture are not protected by sovereign immunity because they
cannot be considered functional acts of a head of state.
</P>
<P>
   With the immunity issue settled, the focus shifts to Home
Secretary Jack Straw, who has until Dec. 2 to decide whether to
allow the Spanish extradition request to be answered by the courts.
</P>
<P>
   The government has remained publicly aloof so far, saying the
case is a matter for the courts to decide. But Straw, a key member
of the Cabinet, now has the power either to let the case go forward
or allow Pinochet to leave Britain on grounds of ill health or
compassion.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's ruling overturned the judgment of the High Court on
Oct. 28 that Pinochet, the onetime Chilean dictator, could not be
arrested because he is a former head of state and enjoys the
protection of the State Immunity Act of 1978. But the High Court
said he had to stay in England while the Crown Prosecution Service,
on behalf of the Spanish authorities, appealed the decision.
</P>
<P>
   The surprise arrest of Pinochet took place on Oct. 16 in
response to a request from a Spanish judge that he be held in
London for extradition to Madrid.
</P>
<P>
   One of the five judges, Lord Nicholls, expressing Wednesday's
majority view, told the House: ``International law has made plain
that certain types of conduct, including torture and
hostage-taking, are not acceptable conduct on the part of anyone.
This applies as much to heads of state, or even more so, as it does
to everyone else. The contrary conclusion would make a mockery of
international law.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's decision marked a potentially significant broadening
of the powers of prosecutors, under international law and new human
rights covenants, to pursue people across national borders with
allegations of crimes against humanity.
</P>
<P>
   The ramifications were unclear, but opponents of the reasoning
behind Wednesday's finding have said prosecutors could apply it to
people like Queen Elizabeth II, for past British actions in
Ireland, and President Clinton, for the bombing of Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference in Parliament, Geoffrey Bindman, a lawyer
representing Amnesty International and the families of victims of
the Pinochet regime, called Wednesday's ruling ``the most important
case in human rights law this century.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The significance of this case will extend to all repressive
regimes where the heads of state seek to assert the freedom to
travel around the world living in luxury on the proceeds of their
crimes,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The first two judges to speak Wednesday upheld the earlier High
Court decision, raising the prospect among the hundreds of
thousands of people watching the event on television that Pinochet
would be flying home Wednesday afternoon on the Chilean Air Force
jet that has been parked at a suburban military field for a month.
</P>
<P>
   But the next three judges disagreed, setting off gasps in the
jammed public gallery and jubilant cheering and embracing among the
Chilean exiles gathered on the street outside Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Pinochet, who turned 83 on Wednesday, was appointed senator for
life in March when he stepped down as Army commander, largely for
the purpose of giving him immunity from prosecution in Chile.
</P>
<P>
   There was no word from the hospital in North London where he has
remained under police guard, recuperating from back surgery last
month. In his only comment since his arrest, he issued a statement
on Nov. 8 saying he was ``hurt and bewildered'' by his detention in
England, a country whose institutions he always admired, and would
fight the extradition order ``with all my spirit.''
</P>
<P>
   While a group of 100 Chilean exiles and other Pinochet opponents
danced and chanted joyously at the gates to the hospital, the
ambulance that was expected to transport the general to Brize
Norton Royal Air Force base in Oxfordshire, and a plane to Chile,
drove off empty.
</P>
<P>
   Two warrants for the general's arrest and extradition from the
Spanish judge, Baltasar Garzon, allege that during the 17 years
Pinochet ruled Chile, he intentionally inflicted severe pain or
suffering, took hostages, conspired to kill enemies and conducted a
ruthless systematic purge of political opponents that resulted in
3,178 murders or ``disappearances.''
</P>
<P>
   Bow Street Magistrates Court in London has set a Dec. 2 deadline
by which Straw must make his decision and Pinochet must attend a
hearing, which would be his first appearance since his arrest.
</P>
<P>
   Former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher Wednesday urged Straw to
allow Pinochet to leave England because of his poor health. She has
lobbied for the general's release, saying the British should be
grateful to him for his support during the Falkland Islands War in
1982.
</P>
<P>
   ``The senator is old, frail and sick, and on compassionate
grounds alone should be allowed to return to Chile,'' she said
Wednesday moments after the law lords' ruling became known.
</P>
<P>
   In the House of Commons on Wednesday afternoon, William Hague,
the Conservative leader, also called on Straw to let the general go
and end what he called ``a huge diplomatic embarrassment for this
country.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's damaging relations with Chile, a long-standing ally of
our country, and causing instability in a country that is now
democratic,'' Hague said.
</P>
<P>
   The British government has said the Pinochet proceeding is a
matter for the judicial authorities here and in Spain.
</P>
<P>
   One official, Trade and Industry Minister Peter Mandelson, said
last month that extending compassion to Pinochet would be a ``gut
wrenching'' experience for those who remembered the events in Chile
after the military coup of 1973.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the statements from human rights groups Wednesday
specifically called on Straw to resist entreaties to interfere.
David Bull, director of Amnesty International U.K., said: ``It is
vital now that justice is done. This decision has opened the way
for that justice. We must send a message to the Home Secretary that
he must not overturn the will of the highest court in the land.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Pinochet, a self-declared Anglophile, had made a number of
visits here in recent years without incident. He arrived this time
on Sept. 21 and was treated as a VIP by the Foreign Office. He had
tea with Mrs. Thatcher in her home and gave a long interview to The
New Yorker magazine in which he proclaimed his love of England.
</P>
<P>
   But he suffered back pains during the flight from Chile, and a
doctor recommended immediate surgery. The operation took place on
Oct. 9 and the general was recuperating when he was arrested.
</P>
<P>
   He has remained under police guard, in keeping with the High
Court's direction that he remain in England while the appeal was
being heard.
</P>
<P>
   Pinochet has not been seen in public since his arrest.
</P>
<P>
   In the statement issued Nov. 8, he said the peaceful future of
countries that had experienced internal conflict lay in
``reconciliation,'' and argued that ``in Chile, as elsewhere,
recrimination is the enemy of reconciliation.'' He cited Spain,
South Africa and Northern Ireland as positive examples where ``wise
decisions have been made not to revisit the past.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The opening up of old wounds, bringing back into debate issues
where the true facts have long since been forgotten, serves no
purpose,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Reports about what occurred in Chile were ``a travesty of the
truth,'' he contended, and as a result, he had become the victim of
``spurious attempts by foreign prosecutors to convict me on
unproven charges.''

   The New York Times News Service will send the following Money
and Business articles for release Sunday, Nov. 29, 1998:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ON THE SECTION FRONT &LR;
</P>
<P>
   COLLEGE-GRADS-RECRUIT (Undated) _ Campus recruiting by Wall
Street firms and management consultants _ between them the biggest
hirers of freshly minted college graduates _ has become an
elaborate dance, with fierce competition on both sides. The
companies spend a bundle to try to snare the best and brightest,
and the kids go to greater and greater lengths to attract the
attention of the ``right'' company, just as they did four years
earlier to get into the ``right'' school. This year promises to be
fiercer than ever, with the downturn in the markets casting a dark
shadow over the promised riches on Wall Street and everyone hoping
to make it in the door before the feared hiring freezes set in. By
Andrew Ross Sorkin.

<P>
   ROTH-IRA (Undated) _ The Roth IRA may be the best deal
Washington has ever offered savings-minded taxpayers. But few
Americans are taking advantage. The next month is taxpayers' last
chance to get the best possible deal on a Roth. Here's how, and why
you may want to do it. By David Cay Johnston.

</P>
<P>
   BIZ-PROFILE-GANWAL (Undated) _ Profile of Rakesh Ganwal, new CEO
at U.S. Air. By Adam Bryant.
</P>
<P>
   BIZ-BRIEFS (Undated) _ A weekly column of short items on people
and personalities that make business more than a dollars and cents
proposition.
</P>
<P>
   BIZ-DAMS (Undated) _ Once the neglected stepchild of the
electricity industry, hydroelectric power gets a surprise shot in
the arm from deregulation. It turns out consumers will pay a
premium for power that comes from renewable sources like hydro
power. And their operators love them too, because they are cheap to
run and you can easily store power (i.e. water above the dam) for
use in peak periods. By Agis Salpukas.
</P>
<P>
   BIZ-MANAGEMENT-TYCO (Undated) _ L. Dennis Koslowski is busily
building a conglomerate that he thinks will be fun to run. Last
week Tyco International, the company he has headed since 1992,
capped an 18-month, $11 billion buying spree by agreeing to acquire
AMP, a maker of electronic connectors. The deal will rescue AMP
from a hostile takeover attempt by Allied Signal. His is a process
fraught with do's and don'ts _ mostly don'ts. By Claudia H.
Deutsch.

study of severance pay. By Dylan Loeb McClain.
</P>
<P>
   INVEST-PORTFOLIOS (Undated) _ Stocks are back, and that is great
news for investors. But the rebound in the marquee indexes doesn't
tell the full story, as mutual fund investors will discover when
they compare their own portfolios to the Dow Jones industrial
average, which is up 23 percent from its August low and hit a new
high last week. By Jonathan Fuerbringer.

earlier record- breaking pledge to the University of Arizona
college of law in Tucson and making tens of millions more in
donations. By Diana B. Henriques.
</P>
<P>
   BIZ-FOR-ME (Undated) _ While most of us wouldn't hesitate to ask
a confidant about his love life, his paycheck is a different story.
Sex may be private, but it is rarely secret. Money, however, is the
best-kept secret. It is no wonder. Mixed messages about money
surround us. At some point, we have all been taught that money is
the root of all evil, that it does not buy happiness or, as the
song goes, love. By Linda Carroll Martin.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; AUTOS &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ABOUT-CARS-OLDSMOBILE (Undated) _ Putting televisions and
videocassette players in vans is nothing new. Builders of custom
vans have been doing it for years. But buying a custom van has
often meant accepting all that goes with it: crushed velour
curtains, for instance. Moreover, the size and shape of traditional
cathode-ray TV's usually require a ``pop-top'' _ a reinforced
fiberglass roof into which the monitor is mounted _ that can raise
a vehicle's height to more than 7 feet, barring it from many
parking decks. Oldsmobile's new Premiere edition of the Silhouette
minivan solves that problem by using a compact
liquid-crystal-display monitor as the centerpiece of its integrated
entertainment system. By Dan Neil.
</P>
<P>
   With Photo.
</P>
<P>
   CAR-SMART-MINIVANS (Undated) _ The minivan has become the object
of snickers and it seems at risk of being muscled aside by sport
utilities with comparable space plus a rugged image. Although the
minivan segment is not growing, it is far from dead. Automakers are
frantically working to lure new buyers with vans that are safer,
more exciting, more luxurious and more practical. By Cheryl Jensen.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; STAND ALONE GRAPHIC &LR;
</P>
<P>
   IN-MY-BRIEFCASE (Undated) _ A voyeuristic short feature that
lets readers see business personalities in more dimensions than
they are usually portrayed. This week: With H. Russell Fraser of
American Capital Access. This item will move only as a graphic.

COX, FINED, ACCUSES NFL OF RACISM 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Tenn., Ill.)   (bl)  
 By GERALD ESKENAZI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. _ Bryan Cox, believed to be the most heavily
fined player in pro football history, has been on his best behavior
since joining the New York Jets in August and, as a result, had
been enjoying a fine-free season.
</P>
<P>
   But the National Football League fined Cox $10,000 Wednesday for
unnecessary roughness during the Jets' victory last Sunday in
Nashville, and afterward he lashed out, accusing the league of
racism.
</P>
<P>
   Cox, who is black, used the words ``tokens'' and ``house
Negroes'' in discussing two black NFL officials _ Gene Washington,
the director of football operations, who handed down the fine, and
Harold Henderson, the labor relations director.
</P>
<P>
   ``With this league being over 70 percent black, and within the
league office all the black people that are in any position of
authority are always pitted against the players in the league,''
Cox said. ``I feel like that's unfortunate, and I don't like
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Cox, a linebacker, was not penalized for either of the plays for
which he was fined Wednesday. Both involved hits with his forearm
in the second quarter, one to the head of Oilers quarterback Steve
McNair and one to running back Eddie George.
</P>
<P>
   The latest fines bring Cox's career total to at least $146,000.
They marked only the second time in his career that Cox has been
fined for his play _ the other fines had to do with actions away
from play involving fans or officials, or fighting.
</P>
<P>
   Cox says he has been fined more than $200,000 in a career that
began in 1991, but published records show a total of $146,000. The
NFL has fined him $136,000 and he was also fined at least once, for
$10,000, by the Bears, his previous team. He was not fined by the
Dolphins in five seasons in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Cox conceded that he was wrong on the hit against George, but
defended his actions against McNair, a scrambling quarterback who
had just run for 17 yards. ``I was trying to tomahawk the ball, and
when I swung, he slid and his head went where the ball was,'' Cox
said.
</P>
<P>
   Cox, initially low-keyed as he discussed the fines at his
locker, then took on the league. That is not unusual _ Cox has
already filed two lawsuits against the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   One of his complaints Wednesday was that he is unable to
designate the charities his fine money goes to. Cox said he wanted
it to go to a youth center founded by Jackie Joyner-Kersee in his
native East St. Louis, Ill.
</P>
<P>
   Cox complained that there was no predominantly black charity
that receives fine money. By a 1993 agreement with the Players
Association, the money is split among four charities, two chosen by
the league and two by the union. The league gives the money to
cancer funds named for Vince Lombardi and Brian Piccolo while the
players group chose a Lou Gehrig's disease charity and another that
helps needy former players. Before the 1993 agreement, the money
went solely to the cancer funds.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Bill Parcells, who rescued the 30-year-old Cox from limbo
last summer after he was cut by the Bears, said of the fines, ``I'm
not in a position to agree or disagree.'' But he also said that the
hit against McNair ``could have been interpreted in a couple of
ways.''
</P>
<P>
   Cox, a former Pro Bowler who was out of shape when Parcells
called on him, quickly become a major figure on defense for a team
hurt by injuries to its linebackers. He is now the starting
weakside linebacker, having sent last year's top draft pick, James
Farrior, to the sideline.

EDITORIAL: CENSORING CYBERSPACE 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Thursday, Nov. 26: &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Lowell Reed of Philadelphia has wisely
issued an order temporarily preventing enforcement of a new federal
law restricting free speech on the Internet. The Child Online
Protection Act, which was tucked into the omnibus budget bill
passed by Congress last month, could greatly harm the right of
adults to see or read anything that might be deemed unsuitable for
children.
</P>
<P>
   The measure would require commercial sites on the World Wide Web
to set up barriers to prevent anyone under the age of 17 from
gaining access to material deemed ``harmful to minors'' _ a vague
standard that could well include R-rated or other controversial
materials that are perfectly legal and non-pornographic. Operators
of Web sites containing such material must ask users to provide a
credit card or adult identification number, or risk criminal
penalties.
</P>
<P>
   The new law is touted as a way to protect children from Internet
pornography. But it would not apply to overseas Web sites, so
children would still have access to smut online. Nor would the act
inhibit businesses that actually sell X-rated materials online.
Such businesses already ask for credit card payments, so they would
be protected from prosecution under the act.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the primary effect would be to discourage the free
dissemination of constitutionally protected material. For example,
an online bookseller who includes free excerpts of a sexually
descriptive novel on a Web site might run afoul of the law and be
threatened with prosecution because he did not screen out children.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court last year struck down as overly broad the 1996
Communications Decency Act that made it a crime to send or display
indecent material on the Internet where youngsters might see it.
The new measure is no improvement. Even the Justice Department,
which is now defending the law, has raised serious questions about
its constitutionality. The way to protect children from adult
materials is through parental monitoring and guidance, not by
locking down the Web for everyone. The courts should quickly scotch
this attempt to censor Internet speech.

EDITORIAL: THIS DEMURE DAY OF THANKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Thursday, Nov. 26: &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Thanksgiving is still a simple holiday, yet for most of us an
occasion of genuine feeling in a crowded festal calendar. To judge
by house and yard decorations in rural America, Halloween has
spilled over its once-meager banks and washed away all of October
and much of November. In cities, the Christmas season as we know it
now _ an economic indicator with colored lights and eggnog _ can no
longer be confined, as it used to be, within the month that begins
on the day after Thanksgiving. But Thanksgiving sticks strictly to
its allotted Thursday, and the power of this quiet holiday is
evident in the trouble so many of us go through to get home in time
to honor it. There is something invariably touching about a feast
of thanks at which we all find our own reasons to be thankful, in
which the feeling is named but not the cause.
</P>
<P>
   The year is getting old and the light weak by the time
Thanksgiving comes. The only color in the woods is the green of
damp moss and the bright orange berries of bittersweet. There are
historic reasons that Thanksgiving falls when it does _ matters of
Pilgrim fact and presidential proclamation _ but over time it has
become a holiday emblematic of this bare season. By the end of the
eleventh month, the year is ancient enough to have shown us its
wisdom. We know what to be grateful for by now, or gratitude is
simply beyond us.
</P>
<P>
   You do not have to be very old to remember Thanksgivings that
began at 4 or 5 in the morning, when women rose alone in the dark
to start cooking the turkey. By the time the men and children got
out of bed, the bird had already been roasting for a couple of
hours on the back porch in its own enameled turkey roaster, a
device that lived in the basement all but one day a year, resembled
an electric bassinet, and kept the main oven free for pies.
Thanksgiving then meant haste in the early hours, a long delay
before the big midafternoon dinner, and scratch meals _ why eat
now? _ for breakfast and lunch, a day in which you went straight
from starvation to stupefaction, in which men and children felt
more than ordinarily useless whenever they came near the kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting down to the big meal seems like the crux of
Thanksgiving, but it really comes a couple of hours later. The
pumpkin pie is gone, the dishes are done, the dogs and overnight
guests are napping, and there is a strange vacancy in the afternoon
light. For a moment the year halts, a moment when the wakeful are
not quite sure what to do with themselves. In that instant, that
hollow in time, you find yourself listening to the unnatural
stillness of the afternoon, pausing to look closely at the world
around you. That is all the celebration necessary on this most
modest, most poignant of days.

EDITORIAL: PINOCHET LOSES A ROUND 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Thursday, Nov. 29: &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A British appeals court Wednesday greatly bolstered the
possibility that Gen. Augusto Pinochet of Chile will face justice _
a quarter-century after most of the crimes of his military coup.
The 3-2 decision that Pinochet's status as a former head of state
does not give him immunity in Britain makes it likely that British
courts will agree to Spain's request for his extradition. The
decision will rest in the hands of Home Secretary Jack Straw.
Unless Pinochet's health worsens drastically, Straw must resist the
temptation to decide that he is too frail to stand trial.
</P>
<P>
   The law lords, a panel of the House of Lords that serves as
Britain's top court, ruled that the charges against Pinochet,
including torture and hostage-taking, cannot be considered official
functions and therefore the immunity normally granted to a former
head of state does not apply.
</P>
<P>
   The decision settles the most important legal issue involved in
Spain's extradition request. Britain almost always complies with
requests from European nations and requires little examination of
the factual evidence of the case. Straw must not heed the false
argument that trying Pinochet would imperil Chile's democracy. His
extremist supporters are noisy but few. Chile's military and
business leaders know that the economic growth and respect they
enjoy would vanish if democracy fell. Straw should let British
justice, and then possibly Spanish justice, take its course.

LUNG CANCER SURGERY CONFIRMED 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 By CHARLIE NOBLES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD, Fla. _ On his 84th birthday, a day spent with close
family, Joe DiMaggio finally agreed to acknowledge that he had a
cancerous tumor removed from his right lung.
</P>
<P>
   ``Early on, he's telling me, `Don't tell the world about
cancer,''' said Morris Engelberg, DiMaggio's longtime friend,
spokesman and lawyer. ``It's a scary word for his generation.''
</P>
<P>
   In making periodic announcements about DiMaggio's condition,
Engelberg had complied.
</P>
<P>
   DiMaggio, who has been in Memorial Regional Hospital since Oct.
12, relented after Engelberg convinced him that his surgery has
become public knowledge and that Dr. Luis Asanza's operation on
Oct. 14 had successfully removed the cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason he's in the hospital past the first 10 days is not
the tumor,'' Engelberg said Wednesday at his law offices here.
``It's because of pneumonia. And one lung is cleared up, the other
lung is on the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cancer did not spread to his liver. It did not spread to
his kidneys. It did not spread to his head. There is no
chemotherapy planned. They say for safety, they may have some
radiation.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Earl Barron, the lead doctor among six physicians who have
been treating DiMaggio, told The Associated Press that ``The
prognosis for his recovery is good. For a while, it was touch and
go, but he has been showing steady improvement.''
</P>
<P>
   From Engelberg's perspective, DiMaggio felt feisty enough
Wednesday to show anger over an early morning CNN report that he
had had a heart attack. ``It's hard for him to speak because of
this thing in his throat that helps him breathe,'' Engelberg said.
``It's coming out Friday or Monday at the latest. But he was
sitting there watching TV, and he's getting angry.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Engelberg said, he had shielded DiMaggio from televised
reports that said the legendary center fielder had suffered a heart
attack last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked Dr. Barron today, `Did Joe have a heart attack?'''
Engelberg said. ``And he looked at Joe and told him, `No, you
didn't have a heart attack.'''
</P>
<P>
   The main concern about DiMaggio's health now centers on his
continuing struggle with pneumonia. DiMaggio's early morning
birthday celebration included his brother Dom; granddaughter Paula;
her husband, Jim; their daughters, Vanessa, 11, and Valerie, 9, and
Barron and some hospital staff members.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Engelberg said the medical staff told him and the
family that DiMaggio would likely spend three to five more weeks in
the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then they qualified it,'' he said. ``They said anything can
happen in medicine. It's up to God. Tomorrow morning, anything
could happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Engelberg said DiMaggio appeared to be suffering months before
he was hospitalized.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't feel well,'' Engelberg said. ``He wasn't eating. He
lost 15 pounds.''
</P>
<P>
   In early October in Chicago, DiMaggio was to be honored by the
National Pan American Sports Hall of Fame. The final night there,
over dinner, DiMaggio confided to Engelberg that he did not feel
well and wanted to go back to his hotel room.
</P>
<P>
   ``Joe is fiercely independent,'' Engelberg said. ``He'll never
let you help him out of a car or anything. But getting up from the
dinner table, he let Tommy Lasorda help him up. That really showed
me how sick he was.''
</P>
<P>
   The following morning, DiMaggio and Engelberg caught a 5 a.m.
flight to New York for Joe DiMaggio Day at Yankee Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went through the whole routine at Yankee Stadium,''
Engelberg said. ``I could see how sick he was, but he couldn't turn
them down. In the third inning he had to leave.''
</P>
<P>
   Engelberg flew to Fort Lauderdale the next morning to catch up
on a mountain of work. He said DiMaggio felt so poorly that he
stayed over a day.
</P>
<P>
   Engelberg said that on Oct. 12, he insisted that DiMaggio check
into a hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``He couldn't have gone another week,'' Engelberg said. ``But he
was going to try to go to the World Series. I actually talked him
out of it. He couldn't fly with pneumonia.''
</P>
<P>
   After the tumor was removed two days later, DiMaggio began to
show complications from pneumonia. On Nov. 16 DiMaggio's blood
pressure suddenly dropped 30 points, according to Engelberg. He
said Barron told him the next six hours would determine DiMaggio's
fate. ``I arranged for a priest to be called,'' Engelberg said.
</P>
<P>
   The next morning, Engelberg arrived at the hospital at 5 a.m.
DiMaggio's brother showed up 30 minutes later.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody could sleep,'' Engelberg said. ``We get there and he's
sitting up getting a shave. I said, `You're the great Joe D.' I
thought he was going to die. Dr. Barron said to me, `It just shows
you it's not medicine, it's God.'''

METS AND FORMER EMPLOYEE SETTLE HARASSMENT CLAIM 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By LENA WILLIAMS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Asserting that ``it was best for all concerned to put
the matter behind us,'' the Mets announced Wednesday that they had
settled a sexual harassment claim involving General Manager Steve
Phillips and a former employee who worked in the team's
minor-league offices in Port St. Lucie, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   In a three-paragraph release faxed to news organizations
Wednesday afternoon, Dave Howard, the Mets' senior vice president,
said that under terms of the settlement, no lawsuit will be filed
against Phillips or the Mets.
</P>
<P>
   ``While the organization's position has not changed, we felt it
was best for all concerned to put the matter behind us,'' Howard
said.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Dominic Barbara, one of two lawyers
representing the woman, issued a one-paragraph statement from his
Long Island law office that said his client's ``contemplated
claim'' against the Mets and Phillips had been resolved.
</P>
<P>
   Terms of the settlement were not disclosed and neither side
would comment further on a matter.
</P>
<P>
   The ripple effect from the claim reached far beyond the baseball
field, going into the private lives of Phillips' family. He
admitted to a consensual sexual relationship with the woman, as
well as admitting to other affairs.
</P>
<P>
   The matter began on Nov. 8 when Phillips, 35, who had deftly
handled the signing of Mike Piazza to a long-term contract only two
weeks before, announced he was taking a leave of absence to deal
with an allegation of sexual harassment.
</P>
<P>
   Coming as it did, on the eve of important general managers'
meetings, Phillips' departure appeared to catch many by surprise.
The club, reeling from the sting of the harassment claim and the
embarrassing public admissions by Phillips of his affairs, called
on Frank Cashen, who was the team's general manager from 1980 to
1991, to serve on an interim basis.
</P>
<P>
   From the beginning, the Mets stood by Phillips. Team officials
said they had investigated the allegations and found there was a
consensual sexual relationship between Phillips and the woman, but
nothing that constituted harassment. The team's owners, Fred Wilpon
and Nelson Doubleday, refused to fire Phillips.
</P>
<P>
   During his absence, Phillips underwent counseling. Bobby
Bonilla, the former Met, was signed by Cashen to a three-year deal
on Nov. 10. Six days later _ an absence of eight days in all _
Phillips was back on the job.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference at Shea Stadium to announce his return, a
remorseful Phillips was confronted by Barbara, who said he
represented a former Mets employee who intended to sue Phillips for
sexual harassment.
</P>
<P>
   But there were indications that Barbara, a lawyer whose clients
have included Joey Buttafuoco and Jessica Hahn, was not looking for
a legal battle, at one point telling reporters, ``I will vigorously
fight for my client, but I believe Mr. Phillips is very sincere in
what he's saying.''
</P>
<P>
   Reached by telephone Wednesday, Howard, the team's vice
president of business and legal affairs, said discussions between
the parties were fairly brief and that a resolution came together
fairly quickly and was settled late Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Those familiar with the case said the parties had been
discussing a possible settlement for several days and said the
woman had indicated that she would be willing to settle for a sum
of money.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Barbara nor Steve Malove, a Miami-based lawyer also
representing the woman, could be reached by telephone Wednesday to
comment on the matter.

CLASSROOM EXPERIMENT GOES AWRY, BURNS TEENS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY PATRICIA FARRELL AIDEM, LISA VAN PROYEN AND LEE BARNATHAN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Two high school seniors were burned Wednesday _
one suffering life-threatening injuries _ when a homemade cannon
crafted for a physics experiment exploded as about 30 horrified
classmates watched.
</P>
<P>
   Chris James was listed in critical condition and Nolan LaMar in
serious condition at the Grossman Burn Center at Sherman Oaks
Hospital, where they were airlifted after the explosion. Their
physics teacher and friends kept vigil with the families of the
17-year-old boys.
</P>
<P>
   A third student, Jesse Honea, also 17, was released from a
Valencia hospital after treatment for respiratory difficulty
resulting from the blast, which occurred on the football field of
the Hart High School campus, about 25 miles northwest of Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very fortunate,'' Honea said. ``I had my back turned and I
didn't see what happened. I felt the flames go straight past me. I
felt the intense heat. It sounded frightening. A lot of people were
crying.''
</P>
<P>
   Schoolmate Mike Baker was in the health office when LaMar was
brought in after the 8:25 a.m. accident.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's devastating. He was bleeding, his face was so burned,''
he said. ``There are a lot of people standing around. They're
crying, everybody is worried.''
</P>
<P>
   The physics class was gathered on the football field for a
supervised experiment designed to calculate velocity, said Bob Lee,
superintendent of the William S. Hart Union High School District in
the Santa Clarita Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Empty fruit-juice cans were opened, then taped together to
create a cylinder that was closed at one end.
</P>
<P>
   A capful of methanol _ a fuel more volatile than gasoline _ was
added to the ``launcher,'' a small hole poked near the bottom and a
tennis ball wedged in the top. Students were to light the fuel with
a match at the hole and hold the device at an angle as pressure
mounted to launch the tennis ball.
</P>
<P>
   But James and LaMar apparently saw no reaction. They were
looking into the launcher when the fuel flashed and exploded with
intense heat.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a danger when you use methanol,'' said Lt. Tom
Spencer of the Los Angeles County Sheriff Department's
arson/explosives detail. ``When it's lit, you can't tell it's
burning. You can't see a flame.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. A. Richard Grossman, medical director at the burn center,
said paramedics recognized that James was starting to suffocate
from the trauma and very likely saved the teen's life by inserting
a breathing tube as he lay on the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like super-heated air,'' Grossman said. ``At thousands of
degrees, it instantly cooks in a millisecond.''
</P>
<P>
   James, a member of Hart's varsity soccer squad, suffered
third-degree burns to his face, chest, shoulders and arms.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors told James' parents that the boy's most serious burns
were to his vocal cords and airway, life-threatening injuries
caused by inhaling the burning methanol. He was placed on a
respirator to keep his airway open.
</P>
<P>
   Grossman performed surgery on James' hands Wednesday morning to
prevent gangrene.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Grossman said, James will undergo ``the real
surgery'' when doctors take a look at the boy's lungs and ``strip''
his vocal cords. Surgeons also will place a tube through the boy's
abdomen into his stomach so they can feed him solid food for the
next few weeks, Grossman said. In the meantime, he will be fed
intravenously.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be critical to get him through the next few weeks,''
Grossman said, adding that James is ``going to have a severely
scarred face.''
</P>
<P>
   When James came to the hospital, he was alert and conscious and
responding to questions, said Larry Weinberg, a spokesman for the
burn center.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any third-degree burn is life-threatening. But he's young,
he's strong and he's in very good health. He has a very good chance
of fighting this,'' Weinberg said.
</P>
<P>
   About a dozen members of James' family, including his older
sister, Nancy, and his 16-year-old brother, went immediately to the
hospital, hugging one another, shedding tears and waiting for
updates.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's such a good kid, a very responsible kid, very reliable.
He is highly respectful to his parents and to other people,'' said
his grandmother, Joanne Webberley.
</P>
<P>
   James' aunt, Valerie Fought, said her nephew wants to be a
theatrical director and has made several videos for the family.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a real ham,'' she said. ``He hoped to get a sports
scholarship.''
</P>
<P>
   She said James' mother, Carolyn, had bought three large turkeys
for Thanksgiving and was planning to host a big family gathering.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know where we'll be spending Thanksgiving,'' she said,
referring to the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   LaMar, an aspiring firefighter who plays varsity baseball, was
transferred from Henry Mayo Newhall Memorial Hospital to the
Grossman facility, where he was in serious condition with
respiratory problems as well as burns to his face and chest.
</P>
<P>
   At Hart High, a crisis counseling center was set up in the
school library for teachers and students, said Eileen Foderaro,
secretary to Principal Gary Fuller.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the students went home early, Lee said.
</P>
<P>
   Physics instructor Chris McGee went to the Sherman Oaks
hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``The teacher was very troubled, very upset,'' said sheriff's
Deputy Scott Gibson, the liaison to Hart.
</P>
<P>
   Friends who went to the hospital to check on their classmates'
conditions said they were horrified.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone was shocked. It's just a freak accident that
happened,'' said James Shields, a junior.

EXXON-MOBILE MERGER TALKS ARE REPORTED 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs 3rd graf. to clarify Exxon revenue and 7th graf to correct
price of British Petroleum-Amoco deal. Subs throughout for
tightening and polishing.)  
 (ATTN: Va., Texas)   (EDS: This is a short refer on page 1.)  
(js) 
 By AGIS SALPUKAS with LAURA M. HOLSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Exxon Corp. and Mobil Corp. have held discussions about
combining their business operations, a person involved in the talks
said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear Wednesday whether talks were continuing. If the
companies were to merge, it would create the largest U.S. company
in terms of revenue.
</P>
<P>
   A possible merger was reported separately by both The Financial
Times of London and Bloomberg News. The reported talks between
Exxon, whose annual revenue exceeds that of General Electric Co.,
and Mobil, the No. 2 U.S. oil company, came as oil prices sank to
their lowest in almost 12 years. A combined company would be bigger
than Royal Dutch/Shell Group, the world's largest oil company by
revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Financial terms of the discussions could not be determined
Wednesday. Neither Exxon or Mobil would comment.
</P>
<P>
   Any union would reunite two parts of John D. Rockefeller's
Standard Oil Trust, which was broken up by the Supreme Court in
1911. Exxon was then known as Standard Oil of New Jersey, and Mobil
consisted of two companies: Standard Oil of New York and Vacuum
Oil.
</P>
<P>
   As oil prices have plummeted to levels last seen in the
mid-1980s, oil companies have been under pressure to cut costs.
Exxon, which has a market value of $176.7 billion, and Mobil, which
has a market value of $61.1 billion, both have histories of being
fiercely independent, and both have already cut back on staff and
made themselves lean to survive even during a prolonged period of
low oil prices. But this has been a particularly unsettling year
for the oil industry, and there is little prospect that crude oil
prices will recover soon.
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, chief executives of most oil companies have had to
swallow their pride and look for suitable partners. This summer,
British Petroleum announced an agreement to buy Amoco Corp. for
$48.2 million, creating the world's third-largest oil company and
prompting analysts to predict even more widespread consolidation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It showed that megamergers are doable,'' said Adam Sieminski,
an analyst for BT Alex. Brown.
</P>
<P>
   He added, however, that any combination between Exxon and Mobil
would not be an easy match because Mobil has been known for being a
proud company that has said in the past that it would not want to
merge.
</P>
<P>
   Exxon, he added, is a ``well-run company that likes to grow its
own businesses.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that the heads of both companies, Lee Raymond, the
chairman of Exxon, which is based in Irving, Texas, and Lucio Noto,
the chairman, president and chief executive of Mobil, which is
based in Fairfax, Va., are different personalities.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will not be easy,'' he said of combining the two far-flung
companies, which have vast networks of refineries and gas stations
that overlap in the United States and Europe. ``If you offer enough
money you can make anything happen,'' he added.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Both companies are under pressure to find new fields of oil to
help them survive in the long term. Like other oil companies, they
had hoped to quickly tap into the vast reserves of Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Even though they were prepared to spend billions, they have held
back because of the political and economic crisis in Russia and
great reluctance by Russian officials and oil companies to give up
control of vast fields.
</P>
<P>
   Thus they have had to fall back on exploration areas of their
own such as the deep waters in the Gulf of Mexico as well as West
Africa and parts of Asia. Such exploration is very expensive, and
even when a big field is discovered, platforms costing $1 billion
or more are required to bring the it into production.
</P>
<P>
   Oil prices have been under pressure for more than a year,
falling more than 40 percent from the $20-a-barrel level because of
growing inventories of petroleum and declining Asian demand caused
by the economic crisis there. On Wednesday, crude oil for January
delivery fell 29 cents, or 2.6 percent, to $11.86 a barrel on the
New York Mercantile Exchange, close to the 12-year low of $11.42
reached on June 15.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and
some other oil-producing nations, notably Mexico, have tried to
stem the price drops with pledges to cut back on production. But
those pledges have not always been honored, and rallies in the oil
market this year have proven short-lived. OPEC members on Wednesday
continued their discussion on extending their production cutbacks,
and an agreement is expected as early as Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   In the spring, OPEC agreed to reduce production by 2.6 million
barrels a day, about 3 percent of the daily world supply of 74
million barrels. The main result of that agreement appears to have
been to keep oil prices from falling below $10 a barrel.
</P>
<P>
   Washington regulators said Wednesday that they had not been
notified about the Exxon-Mobil discussions. The Federal Trade
Commission is still reviewing British Petroleum's pending purchase
of Amoco.
</P>
<P>
   An Exxon-Mobil deal would be certain to receive several months'
worth of scrutiny by the commission, which would review how much of
the industry the combined company would control.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts and investment bankers were split about the logic of a
potential deal. Some pointed to difficulties that the companies
could face if they were combined.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you asked me if Exxon needed to be bigger, the answer is
probably no,'' said Garfield Miller, president of Aegis Energy
Advisors Corp., a small independent investment bank based in New
York. ``It is hard to say that there is anything in particular to
gain.''
</P>
<P>
   In particular, Miller said, the two companies have enormous
similarities in their domestic refining and marketing businesses.
``They really do overlap quite a bit,'' he said. ``You really do
wonder what is the benefit of all that redundancy.''
</P>
<P>
   Another investment banker in the energy business, speaking on
the condition of anonymity, also questioned the rationale for the
discussed merger. ``When you look at the BP-Amoco deal, you can
rationalize it,'' the banker said. ``But none of those reasons
apply to an Exxon-Mobil deal.''
</P>
<P>
   But Amy Jaffe, an energy research analyst with the James A.
Baker III Institute for Public Policy, said the combination of the
two companies would be logical, in part because it would give them
greater influence in bidding for development projects in the Middle
East.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a deal that makes sense,'' Ms. Jaffe said. ``With this
combined company, there is no project that would be too big.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Jaffe said the proposed deal would provide each company with
assets in areas where it had little influence. ``There are a lot of
complementary assets where they are not redundant,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She said that Exxon, for example, has a strong presence in
Angola, while Mobil does not. And Mobil has significant assets in
the Caspian Sea and Nigeria, where Exxon is weak.

EX-POLITICIAN SENTENCED IN MURDER FOR HIRE 
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In Maryland, Ruthann Aron was known for her
take-no-prisoners approach to business and politics. On Monday, the
state where she was once viewed as a rising political star took her
prisoner.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Aron, 55, who ran unsuccessfully in Maryland's Republican
primary for the United States Senate in 1994, was sentenced to
three years in the Montgomery County Detention Center for trying to
hire a hit man in June 1997 to kill her husband and a Baltimore
lawyer who once testified against her.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecution, in her second trial in the case, said Ms. Aron
was a calculating killer who sought to arrange the killings to
protect her political career.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Aron's lawyers argued that she had a history of mental
illness, including bipolar and borderline personality disorders.
They said she sought out a hit man after a breakdown when her
emotionally abusive husband, Dr. Barry Aron, a urologist,
threatened to leave her.
</P>
<P>
   While the state conceded her mental problems, prosecutors argued
that her husband's intention to divorce her would have been
humiliating on the eve of a contemplated campaign for a seat on the
Montgomery County Council.
</P>
<P>
   The state also contended that Ms. Aron held the lawyer, Arthur
G. Kahn, responsible for disclosing her past legal problems and
ruining her bid for the Senate nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Vincent E. Ferretti Jr. ruled that she must continue to
see her private psychiatrist while in the county jail and undergo
psychiatric treatment during her five years of supervised
probation.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Aron, an affluent developer in Potomac, cultivated a tough
and tenacious image in her career as a developer and later as a
politician. Her personality, her troubled marriage and her
political ambitions were central issues in her trials.
</P>
<P>
   The first ended in a hung jury; Ms. Aron entered a no-contest
plea before the jury began deliberating in her second trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mind did blow; I did crack up,'' Ms. Aron told the court on
Monday in her first public account of ordering the killings. She
went on to apologize to her adult children, saying, ``Dana and
Josh, I'm sorry from the bottom of my heart, I'd rather be dead
than to bring you to this day.''
</P>
<P>
   The defense lawyer, Barry Helfand, originally proposed that Ms.
Aron spend one year in a private New York psychiatric hospital at
her expense, though state guidelines recommend a term of 8 to 18
years.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Aron, who was arrested in June 1997, was sentenced to five
years for soliciting a hit man to kill Aron, her husband of 31
years. Ferretti suspended all but 18 months of that sentence.
</P>
<P>
   For soliciting the killing of Kahn, Ms. Aron received a 10-year
sentence with all but 35 months suspended and credit for 17 months
she has already served, for a balance of 18 months. She will also
serve five years' probation.
</P>
<P>
   Kahn represented Ms. Aron's business partners in a lawsuit
against her in 1984. In 1996, he testified against Ms. Aron in a
defamation suit that she brought against her political rival,
William E. Brock III, who defeated her in the Senate primary. In
the final week of the campaign, Brock ran television and radio
advertisements saying that Ms. Aron had ``trouble obeying the
law.'' Ms. Aron lost the suit.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Friedman, Barry Aron's lawyer, said the sentence was
fair.
</P>
<P>
   ``The judge literally carved out a compromise,'' Friedman said.
``Ruthann Aron needs treatment, but she also needs punishment.''
</P>
<P>
   Joyce Lyons Terhes, the state Republican Party chairwoman, said:
``I have always known Ruthann to be very strong-willed, very
determined and very aggressive. Sometimes, if you're like that, it
can consume you.''

COMMENTARY: THE SYSTEM GANGS UP ON A CHILD 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs last graf to for correction saying Lacresha was sentenced,
not Jayla) (rl) 
 By BOB HERBERT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   If competence and integrity were the keys to survival, the
criminal justice system in Austin, Texas, would have passed out of
existence by now.
</P>
<P>
   From the very beginning the case against Lacresha Murray was an
exercise in incompetence and bad faith. The system ganged up on an
11-year-old girl and imprisoned her for a crime of which she is
almost certainly innocent _ the fatal beating of 2{-year-old Jayla
Belton.
</P>
<P>
   Lacresha is spending Thanksgiving at the Giddings State Home and
School, a juvenile prison 60 miles east of Austin where she has
begun to serve a sentence of 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   To this day the authorities in Austin deny that Lacresha was in
police custody two years ago when, without her family's knowledge
and without the benefit of a lawyer, she was interrogated by
detectives for at least three hours about Jayla's death. At the end
of that tape-recorded interrogation, Detective Sgt. Ernesto Pedraza
gave her a statement to sign, a statement she had trouble reading
and clearly did not understand.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's all true and correct,'' said Pedraza. ``Am I forcing
you to sign that?''
</P>
<P>
   Lacresha replied, ``Yeah.''
</P>
<P>
   That, of course, was the wrong answer. Pedraza, unhappy, said,
quite forcefully, ``Wha--?''
</P>
<P>
   Lacresha got the message. ``No,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Pedraza then said, ``OK, you're doing this voluntarily.''
</P>
<P>
   No one wants to admit that Lacresha was in custody because under
Texas law a child who is alone in the custody of the police must be
taken before a magistrate to insure that the child's rights are
protected, and that the child understands the proceedings that are
taking place and the penalties that might ensue.
</P>
<P>
   Lacresha had no clue as to what was going on. After she signed
the statement, she was charged with capital murder. Eleven years
old! Even in Texas you can't execute somebody that young. But you
can charge a child with capital murder, and that's what the
authorities did to Lacresha.
</P>
<P>
   For her first trial, held just two months after she was charged
(which is equivalent to the speed of light in a capital murder
case), the public defender was given a pittance with which to mount
a defense. Lacresha was promptly convicted of criminally negligent
homicide and intentional injury to a child. She was sentenced to 20
years.
</P>
<P>
   Then something unusual happened. When an appeals lawyer asked
the trial judge to throw out the verdict, the request was granted
and a new trial was ordered. The judge, John Dietz, told me in an
interview, ``I had a question as to whether justice was done.''
</P>
<P>
   Substantially more money was provided to the defense for the
second trial. There were still no witnesses contending that
Lacresha had attacked Jayla. There was no physical evidence
connecting her to the child's death, and no motive. And now there
were experts ready to testify that Jayla's death had been the
result of long-term physical abuse and neglect.
</P>
<P>
   If the prosecution had been interested in justice, it would have
dropped the case against Lacresha and investigators would have been
assigned to track down whoever had been abusing Jayla. Common sense
says that investigation should start with Jayla's mother, Judy
Belton, and her boyfriend, Derrick Shaw.
</P>
<P>
   But the prosecution was interested in saving face in this
high-profile case. And that could only be done by sending Lacresha
to prison for a long, long time.
</P>
<P>
   Worried that it would be unable to secure another guilty verdict
on homicide charges, the Travis County District Attorney's office
decided at the last minute to pursue only the charge of intentional
injury to a child. For a juvenile in Texas, that charge carries the
same maximum penalty upon conviction as capital murder _ 40 years'
imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
   It was an unconscionable but very clever move.
</P>
<P>
   All references to the death of Jayla Belton were removed from
the prosecution's pleadings. It was as if, from the prosecutor's
point of view, a homicide had never happened. Lacresha was accused
technically of causing ``bodily injuries that created a substantial
risk of death,'' when in reality she was on trial for killing a
young child.
</P>
<P>
   The jury returned a guilty verdict and Lacresha was sentenced to
25 years. The system ganged up on an 11-year-old girl, and the
system won.

TEXAS RANGERS RAISE TICKET PRICES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Rangers increased ticket prices yesterday in anticipation of
having a 1999 payroll of somewhere between $75 million and $80
million.
</P>
<P>
   They just aren't sure if free-agent pitcher Randy Johnson will
be part of that increased payroll. Barry Meister, Johnson's agent,
said yesterday the Rangers are still one of four teams being
considered, refuting reports that the decision was down to either
the Anaheim Angels or the Arizona Diamondbacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are four clubs involved,'' Meister said. ``The
indisputable fact is the Texas Rangers are one of four clubs Randy
is considering pledging his services to for four years. It's a
four-horse race and none of the horses have been eliminated.''
</P>
<P>
   Meister said he would have notified owner Tom Hicks if the
Rangers had been eliminated.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a number of mutual business associates with Mr. Hicks
and I have too much respect for Mr. Hicks and his reputation to
hold him up one more minute than is necessary in giving him a
positive or negative answer,'' Meister said.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles Dodgers are the fourth team involved. The
Diamondbacks again showed their determination to be competitive
when they signed pitcher Armando Reynoso to a two-year contract
yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels have reached an agreement with Mo Vaughn on an $80
million contract, and a source said yesterday the All-Star first
baseman has been lobbying Johnson to join him in Anaheim.
</P>
<P>
   Meister said he is hoping Johnson will make a decision no later
than Monday.
</P>
<P>
   But the Rangers couldn't wait that long to announce their price
increases because season tickets and miniplans go on sale tomorrow.
Only adult tickets were affected. Prices were raised from $1 to $5,
depending on the category.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody likes to increase prices, we certainly don't,'' Rangers
president Tom Schieffer said. ``But what we had to face was the
payroll is going to go up substantially. The choice we had was to
increase ticket prices or decrease the payroll. We just needed the
revenue. We're sorry we needed to do it, but all the money is going
into the payroll and more.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers finished this season with a payroll of approximately
$62 million. Schieffer estimated the payroll will be between $75
million and $80 million next year. He said that will be the case
even if the Rangers don't sign Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a question of whether we're going to sign Randy
Johnson or not sign Randy Johnson,'' Schieffer said. ``We're still
going to have a big payroll. We'd like to have Randy Johnson and we
think we can have him on the team and players around him that will
help us win. But if we don't have Randy Johnson, we still think
we'll add a lot of players that will add up to Randy Johnson
numbers.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers did not increase prices on children's tickets (13
years old and younger) in the bleachers and grandstands. They added
children's tickets in certain upper box areas. There are no
children's discounts in the lower seating bowl, upper reserved and
home run porches.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're sensitive to the fact that increasing ticket prices
makes it harder for families to come to The Ballpark,'' Schieffer
said. ``We're trying to do everything we can to soften that blow.''

THERE'S A LESSON FOR TCU IN TULANE'S AMAZING SEASON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GIL LEBRETON 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There are four undefeated teams in major college football, and
every time I say the name of one of them it makes me want to cough
up my giblets.
</P>
<P>
   In a Thanksgiving, uh, classic, unbeaten Tulane (perform
Heimlich maneuver on me here) will face Louisiana Tech today for
the chance to elevate its record to a perfect 11-and-0.
</P>
<P>
   I know Tulane. I grew up not far from Tulane. I used to ride my
bike to Tulane and buy $1 tickets and sit in the end zone at old
Tulane Stadium, which was sort of the Taj Mahal of rust.
</P>
<P>
   And it was in that north end zone, after watching the Greenies
squander yet another fourth-quarter lead and lose to yet another
Vanderbilt or Rice or worse, that I came to the realization that a
life linked with Tulane would mean nothing but heartache.
</P>
<P>
   The coach of the Greenies in those years was Andy Pilney. In
eight seasons at the New Orleans school, Pilney won 25 games.
</P>
<P>
   When Tommy O'Boyle took over in 1962, he remarked how, while it
was tough to see Coach Andy go, ``No coach should ever put himself
in position to lose 62-0,'' a score by which Pilney's teams had
lost to rival Louisiana State not once, but twice.
</P>
<P>
   Four years later, LSU again beat Tulane by the surgically
precise score of 62-0. O'Boyle was canned the next day.
</P>
<P>
   As he returned to his office after being told the news, O'Boyle
saw secretary Lurlyn Fitzpatrick. ``Miss Fitz,'' a stunned O'Boyle
said, ``can you believe it? They fired me!''
</P>
<P>
   O'Boyle had won only six of his 40 games.
</P>
<P>
   So, I know Tulane. The problem is, I don't think Tulane knows
Tulane.
</P>
<P>
   There are people back home who actually think 10-0 Tulane should
hold out on the Liberty Bowl invitation it has received and wait to
see if the Greenies get a Bowl Championship Series berth.
</P>
<P>
   That's a good one.
</P>
<P>
   To his everlasting credit, one of them isn't Tulane coach Tommy
Bowden, who has said, ``We're right where we ought to be. I'm
ranked ahead of Michigan and behind Nebraska, and I don't have to
play either one.''
</P>
<P>
   With Davey O'Brien award finalist Shaun King at the controls,
the Green Wave soared through the Conference USA race. The Greenies
have humbled the likes of Navy and Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on which computer you use, Tulane has the nation's
104th toughest schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, here they are today, playing for 11-0 and an odds-on chance
to end up in the final Top 10.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, good grief.
</P>
<P>
   There isn't a team in the Top 20 that couldn't jackhammer Tulane
by three or four touchdowns. Yet, history beckons. The last time
that a Green Wave team did this well was 1931.
</P>
<P>
   One neighborhood's Chevy is another neighborhood's Cadillac. The
Greenies are beneficiaries of (A) Bowden's coaching, (B) King's
passing and (C) almost voodoo-like scheduling.
</P>
<P>
   TCU, are you following all this?
</P>
<P>
   The Horned Frogs _ like Tulane, a modest-sized private
institution with a somewhat tarnished recent football past _ have
seen two conferences slide out from under them in the past few
seasons. Fresh from a 6-5 campaign, TCU could emerge as the
preseason favorite to win next year's Western Athletic Conference.
</P>
<P>
   Don't laugh. The Frogs could be next season's Tulane.
</P>
<P>
   Is that good? You tell me. Tulane, even on its diet of C-USA
shrimps, has enjoyed the prominence of a high national ranking,
weekly mention on ESPN and a conference championship with
accompanying bowl bid.
</P>
<P>
   You tell me. Or should TCU set its future sights on a bigger
pond?
</P>
<P>
   Tulane fans _ which number in the dozens _ would rather ignore
the footnotes and revel in the success. Two years ago, admittedly,
they were losing football games to the same teams that they have
soundly thrashed this season.
</P>
<P>
   But Tulane is a myth. Their games in the 70,000-seat Superdome
have drawn an average of 21,000, even in this undefeated season.
Bowden has cried for New Orleans fans to support ``the hometown
team,'' but the Tulane student body now numbers less than 30
percent from the New Orleans area. Almost as large a percentage
come from the New York City area, New Jersey and the Midwest.
</P>
<P>
   Tulane doesn't have a school band anymore. It borrows bands from
the area high schools. Its alma mater is a taped recording.
</P>
<P>
   Rival LSU dropped Tulane from its schedule because it felt the
games weren't profitable.
</P>
<P>
   Their loss, alas, is Tulane's gain. The Greenies are this
season's quintessential big fish in the small green pond.
</P>
<P>
   Today they go for 11-0, and I think I'm going to throw up.
</P>
<P>
   Surely, TCU has higher sights than that.

COWBOYS' KISELAK IS A FEEL-GOOD STORY FOR TURKEY DAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN LYONS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Five Thanksgiving Days ago, he was going
door-to-door, selling whole- and term-life insurance to businesses
in San Antonio. To enjoy the holidays, he watched the way he spent
his paycheck, which at times was a $250 a week.
</P>
<P>
   Today, he is the starting center for the Cowboys. Making
$158,000 a year, he can buy all the turkey and dressing he wants.
</P>
<P>
   You want a feel-good story to go down with your after-dinner egg
nog?
</P>
<P>
   Meet Mike Kiselak.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm living a dream,'' Kiselak says. ``It took me a long time
to get here, and I'm not going to wake up in the middle of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Buoyed by his devout faith, he endured eight years and two
football leagues to finally make an NFL roster, which he did with
the Cowboys last summer.
</P>
<P>
   And so, at age 31, when most NFL players are facing the downside
of their careers, Kiselak is an NFL rookie.
</P>
<P>
   He is giving thanks today because his journey from the
University of Maryland to Valley Ranch did not end on some dusty,
sun-baked practice field in Missouri, or Texas, or New York, where
he was told three times that he was not good enough to block NFL
defensive linemen.
</P>
<P>
   He is giving thanks that he did not suffer a career-ending
injury while barnstorming for World League clubs in San Antonio and
Sacramento, Calif. He is giving thanks for the opportunity to play
in the Canadian Football League, and for the friend who sent his
game tapes to the Cowboys in the hopes they would offer him a
tryout.
</P>
<P>
   ``Isn't that what the American Dream is about?'' Cowboys coach
Chan Gailey said. ``Here is a guy who continued to persevere and
fight until he reached a goal.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is,'' Kiselak said, ``an amazing story if I go back and
think about it.''
Driving through tears Kiselak thought it was almost over before it
started.
</P>
<P>
   After moving from the defensive line his junior year at
Maryland, he started every game at right guard until graduating in
1990. He signed as a free agent with the Kansas City Chiefs. But
coach Marty Schottenheimer, who had selected center Tim Grunhard
and guard David Szott in that spring's NFL draft, cut Kiselak
before training camp ended.
</P>
<P>
   Kiselak gave Schottenheimer his Chiefs playbook. Then he packed
his 1985 Nissan with his belongings and drove the 23 1/2 hours in
the rain to his home in Pine Bush, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a major storm, but I drove anyway and I cried all the
way home because I thought my days of playing football were done,''
he said. ``I didn't know what I was going to do with the rest of my
life. I had no plans.''
</P>
<P>
   Kiselak, however, knew how to build things, having worked at
various construction jobs to pay his way through college. So he
helped his brother build an eight-room, 7,500-square-foot house.
Feeling better about himself, he was about to settle into his
career.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in early 1991, Kiselak heard about this new football
league being formed, the World League of American Football. A few
franchises were setting up in the United States. He dropped
everything to go to Orlando, Fla., for the league combine. That
spring, the San Antonio Riders selected him in the fourth round of
the first WLAF draft.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't even know where San Antonio was,'' he said. ``I'm
thinking Santa Barbara, Santa-something. Must be California. I
called my mom and told her I was going to California. She said,
`Mike, you are going to Texas.'''
</P>
<P>
   Kiselak played two years for the Riders. But the itch to play in
the NFL never subsided, and because the WLAF seasons ended in late
spring, it gave him a chance to try out for NFL teams during the
summer. In 1991, he went to the New York Giants camp. In 1992, he
went to the Houston Oilers camp. Both times he was waived.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Houston, I went out there and I just was not physically
ready,'' he said. ``The WLAF season had just ended and I was tired.
When I signed with the Giants, I'd worked out and thought I was
playing well. My strength was better. I just wasn't in their plans.
It happens like that sometimes.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, the WLAF folded. Needing work to support his family _
he got married

<P>
   in July _ Kiselak earned a license to sell insurance. It wasn't
a lot of money. But at least he and his wife Kimberly were eating
every night. ``I've got a lot of respect for those guys selling
insurance because you've got to love what you are doing.''
</P>
<P>
   The insurance gig did not last long. The Canadian Football
League announced plans to field teams in the United States. In
March 1993, he signed a free-agent contract with the CFL's
Sacramento Gold Miners. He started at center there for two years.
Kimberly, who stayed in San Antonio, was able to visit regularly
when she landed a job with Southwest Airlines. ``That saved our
marriage,'' Mike said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was frustrating not being able to see him,'' Kimberly said.
``I was going to go live in Cleveland with my family. But we came
through. Everything worked out just fine.''
</P>
<P>
   The Gold Miners moved to San Antonio in 1995. And just as
Kiselak was getting better as an offensive lineman _ he was a CFL
All-Star in 1995 _ the league announced it was no longer fielding
teams in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Kiselak thought his football career was over.
</P>
<P>
   Again.
</P>
<P>
   He thought about trying out for the NFL again. Or he could get
back into the insurance-selling business. And there was always a
construction job waiting for him.
</P>
<P>
   Then he received a phone call. The Saskatchewan Rough Riders
selected him in the CFL's dispersal draft. The prospect of playing
in Central Canada, with its cold winters and ``big mosquitoes''
wasn't appealing to Kiselak. He talked it over with Kimberly.
Maybe, they thought, he should just give up playing football.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was going to quit,'' he said. ``Then I got this phone call
from Toronto. It was from some of my coaches who'd transferred from
San Antonio. They said, `Hey, we're picking up Doug Flutie, and a
lot of other good players. We want you to be our center. I said
`sure.' They traded away one of their offensive linemen and maybe a
pack of cigarettes and I was there.''
</P>
<P>
   Snapping the ball to Flutie in Toronto, Kiselak was selected the
CFL's most outstanding offensive lineman two consecutive years. The
Argonauts won consecutive Grey Cup championships. Kiselak was
enjoying himself. But he still wanted to prove that he could block
people like Reggie White and Bruce Smith.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted,'' he said, ``to play in the NFL and continue to
play, not just make it and let my breath out.''
Attention at last By now, game tape showing Kiselak's talents was
floating all around the NFL. Cowboys scouting director Larry
Lacewell had a copy and liked what he saw. But he admits he didn't
get serious about Kiselak until a friend of Kiselak's, Mike
Krueger, kept sending Lacewell more tapes.
</P>
<P>
   ``He kept calling me, almost like he was his agent,'' Lacewell
said. ``There wasn't any doubt in my mind that he could pass
protect because all they did in the CFL was pass. But I had no idea
if he could run-block the way we have to in this league. It just
doesn't happen up there. I had no idea.''
</P>
<P>
   Lacewell talked to team owner Jerry Jones and vice president
Stephen Jones and told them ``we should take a chance because we'll
never know until we suit him up.''
</P>
<P>
   Krueger, it turns out, had been friends with Kiselak since his
days in San Antonio. When Mike and Kimberly Kiselak accepted Jesus
Christ into their lives, they started going to Krueger's house to
read the Bible. Krueger was not Kiselak's agent, but he and a
family minister advised him on many things, including his football
career.
</P>
<P>
   When the Cowboys offered Kiselak a contract after working him
out last winter, Kiselak waited.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Lord spoke to us and told us there'd be two teams that
would offer us a contract,'' Kiselak said. ``The first one is the
one the Lord put his hands on. The second team would offer more
money. Sure enough, Dallas offered me a chance to play. Then, about
a month later, Seattle offered more money. I told my agent that
we're going to Dallas.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, he had to make the team. The Cowboys selected three
offensive linemen in last spring's draft and signed five others to
free-agent contracts during the summer.
</P>
<P>
   Kiselak knew he was a long shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody knew who I was,'' he said. ``And that was fine with me.
I didn't lose any sleep. I knew I had a job to do. I believed I'd
make the team. During training camp, my wife got a transfer from
San Antonio to Dallas. We got out of our house and bought a house
up here. And this was before the final cuts. So they could have cut
me. But that wasn't on my mind. I was here to make the team.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys waived five offensive linemen before the season.
</P>
<P>
   Kiselak, to the surprise of Gailey, was not one of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We kept thinking, `No way was he going to make it,''' Gailey
said. ``He wasn't fast enough, or strong enough. But the longer he
played, the better he got. He kept blocking the right guy and he
kept fighting. He won us over.''
</P>
<P>
   He continued his strong play during the regular season and
received his first extended action Oct. 4 against the Washington
Redskins when starting right guard Everett McIver sprained his
knee. He moved into the starting lineup Nov. 8 when center Clay
Shiver sprained a big toe. Kiselak has played so well that Gailey
has kept him in the starting lineup even though Shiver is healthy
again.
</P>
<P>
   And Kiselak plans to stay in the lineup for a long time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Through all those years, I knew I was getting older and
older,'' he said. ``But for some reason, the Lord kept opening
doors for me to continue playing. I'd play for nothing because I
loved the game. I've got a great opportunity here. And I don't want
to waste it.''
</P>
<P>
   He hasn't so far.

IRISH LEAN ON BACKUP QUARTERBACKS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STEVE IRVINE  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Bob Davie, Notre Dame head football coach of the
present, learned everything he needed to know about Coley O'Brien
on Sunday from an Irish coaching legend of the past.
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien, for the uneducated in the lore of Notre Dame football,
was a reserve quarterback who, because of a shoulder injury to
starter Terry Hanratty, stepped in to lead the Irish to the most
lopsided victory in the storied rivalry with USC. It was 32 years
ago today that O'Brien in his first start threw for 255 yards and
three touchdowns as the Irish blitzed the Trojans 51-0 to cap a
9-0-1 season and capture the national championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talked to Ara Parseghian and he talked about the 1966 (USC)
game,'' Davie said. ``He told me about Coley O'Brien taking over at
quarterback.''
</P>
<P>
   Davie then went out and put his history lesson to use.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told our football team, `Arnaz Battle is Coley and Eric
Chappell is O'Brien,''' Davie said.
</P>
<P>
   Arnaz Battle and Eric Chappell have spent Saturdays this fall
watching Jarious Jackson quarterback the Irish to nine wins in 10
outings. This Saturday, when the Irish come to the L.A. Coliseum
for their annual tussle with the Trojans, things will be much
different for Battle and Chappell, or Coley and O'Brien, if you
please.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest thing I have to deal with is just the whole idea
of playing in a game like this for the first time,'' said Chappell,
a 6-foot-4, 225-pound junior from Montgomery, Ala. ``It's different
because the other times I've been in there with the second and
third strings. So I have to get acclimated to playing with the ones
on our team against the quality of competition.''
</P>
<P>
   The majority of the quarterback work this season has been
handled by Jackson, who waited three seasons behind Ron Powlus for
the chance. The 6-foot, 220-pound flash from Mississippi completed
104 passes in 188 attempts for 1,740 yards with 13 touchdowns and
six interceptions and rushed for 441 yards on 113 carries with
three touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   But Jackson's regular season came to a close last Saturday in
South Bend on what was supposed to be the final play of a 39-36
victory over LSU. The Irish had the ball deep in their own
territory and the plan was for Jackson to run the final eight
seconds off the clock before taking a knee in the end zone. But LSU
linebacker Arnold Miller came untouched around the corner and hit
Jackson while the Notre Dame quarterback was trying to plant his
foot to escape.
</P>
<P>
   Battle was one of the first players off the bench to Jackson's
side as he was being treated by the trainers in the end zone for
what was later diagnosed as a regular-season ending partial
ligament tear in his right knee.
</P>
<P>
   ``After Jarious got hurt, he just told me and Eric to step up
and lead the offense,'' said Battle, a 6-1, 196-pound freshman from
Shreveport, La., who considers Jackson a mentor.
</P>
<P>
   So Davie and the Irish will hinge their hopes of playing in the
Rose Bowl or another BCS-affiliated bowl on a pair of quarterbacks
who, without a media guide, are unknown. Sounds good enough to the
guy who'll make sure they get the ball on every play.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone has to make their first start at some point,'' said
Notre Dame center John Merandi, a graduate of Rim of the World in
Lake Arrowhead. ``Once the game starts, you just play.''
</P>
<P>
   Battle's last start came a year ago while playing for C.E. Byrd
High in Shreveport, where he threw for 527 yards and rushed for 677
yards as a senior. His Notre Dame playing time has consisted of a
10-play, 80-yard scoring drive late in the loss to Michigan State,
three snaps in a win over Stanford and eight plays in a victory
over Baylor. Battle left the Baylor game, which was Oct. 31, with a
shoulder sprain and hasn't played since.
</P>
<P>
   ``My shoulder is a nonfactor,'' said Battle, who beat out
Chappell for the backup spot before hurting his shoulder. ``I can
go out there and do anything I need to do. It's the least of my
worries.''
</P>
<P>
   Chappell, who is more of a passing threat than Battle, threw for
3,000 yards in his final two seasons at Carver High in Montgomery,
Ala., but only 700 came in his senior year. He didn't take a snap
in his first two years at Notre Dame but did see special-teams
action in the final five games of last season. This year he has
attempted one pass _ it was incomplete _ in two abbreviated
appearances.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eric has shown a lot of improvement lately,'' said quarterback
coach Mike Sanford, a USC graduate and former Trojans assistant.
``When Arnaz hurt his shoulder and (Eric) got more reps, he got
better in just about everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Davie might not decide who will start until Saturday morning,
but he said the game plan won't be drastically changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though that position is crucial and vital,'' Davie said,
``you're not going to make 10 other players uncomfortable by doing
something different.''
</P>
<P>
   The guys devising the other game plan _ Paul Hackett and his
staff _ are a little uncomfortable not knowing what to expect.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reality is that until the game starts and until the game
begins to unfold, we're just not going to know exactly what we're
up against,'' Hackett said. ``There's no tape to study, so there's
no chance to get the nuances, the strengths and weaknesses of the
unknown quarterback. There's a history of teams making this change
and performing brilliantly.''
</P>
<P>
   Apparently he's also heard all about Coley O'Brien.
