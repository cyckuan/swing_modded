<HEADLINE> Japanese PM Pledges More Aid to Georgia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi
on Thursday pledged to expand economic aid to Georgia to help the
former Soviet republic boost production and proceed with economic
reforms.
</P>
<P>
Obuchi made the commitment during a 30-minute meeting with
Georgian President Eduard Shevardnadze at the Japanese PM's
official residence.
</P>
<P>
Obuchi told Shevardnadze that Japan intends to work toward
extending yen-denominated, low-interest loans, with a second to
Georgia for a project to develop a port on the Black Sea, a
Japanese Foreign Ministry official said.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders agreed to beef up "multifaceted" relations
between Japan and Georgia, the official said.
</P>
<P>
They also signed and issued two joint statements for promoting
"friendship and partnership" and expanding "cooperation in areas
of trade and economy."
</P>
<P>
Following their meeting, Japanese FM Masahiko Komura and his
Georgian counterpart Irakli Menagarishvili signed documents on
Japan's 670 million yen (5.5 million U.S. dollar) grants to
Georgia.
</P>
<P>
The grants include 370 million yen (three million dollars) for
purchasing farm equipment to boost wheat production and 300
million yen (2.5 million dollars) for importing goods necessary to
proceed with structural adjustment programs.
</P>
<P>
Shevardnadze arrived earlier in the day for a five-day visit,
the first trip to Japan since he became Georgia president. He has
visited Japan three times in the past as foreign minister of the
Soviet Union.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Regrets U.S. Decertification of Drug Fight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, March 4 (Xinhua) -- The Myanmar government has
expressed regrets over the continuous U.S. decertification of the
country's sustained efforts for eradication of narcotic drugs and
remarkable achievements.
</P>
<P>
"It is a decision that came out of a dubious process that
politicizes the global efforts to eliminate the scourge of
narcotic drugs," the Myanmar Foreign Ministry said in a press
release here Thursday evening.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar has done a tremendous job in the global efforts leading
to positive results as the U.S. government itself acknowledged in
its international narcotic control strategy report for 1998, it
pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. report accepted that production and cultivation in
Myanmar declined significantly from 1997 levels with an estimated
drop of 16 percent in opium cultivation and 26 percent in
production, the press release said.
</P>
<P>
Progress made in 1998 with regard to eradication, increased
drug seizures and destruction of heroin refineries as well as
improved security situation in northern Shan state permitted the
Myanmar anti-drug forces to conduct more vigorous law enforcement
efforts, especially in Kachin and Kokang regions, it added.
</P>
<P>
"In spite of all these frank admissions, Myanmar was
decertified, which smacks of double standard and politicization
that affect not only the people of Myanmar in particular, but also
the citizens of the U.S. and the world at large," it complained.
</P>
<P>
It called for eradication of narcotic drugs as a global problem
 through international cooperation in an integrated and holistic
manner, with simultaneous efforts in the sectors of demand
reduction, law enforcement and provision of alternative
development to the people of poppy cultivating areas.
</P>
<P>
It disclosed that Myanmar is engaged in cooperative efforts at
the regional and sub-regional levels not only for the effective
elimination of opium cultivation and trafficking in narcotic drugs
but also for demand reduction. The current master plan of the
government for the development of border areas and national races
calls for a program of integrated development combined with law
enforcement, it said.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar reaffirmed its commitment to the eradication of
narcotic drugs at the recent Fourth International Heroin
Conference in Yangon, which was boycotted by the United States,
Britain, France and some European countries.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar does not believe that the certification process of the
U.S. government will in any way contribute to the solution of the
global scourge of narcotic drugs, the press release added.
</P>
<P>
It vowed to undertake unswervingly its share of the global
burden and fully cooperate with the international community in
this respect.

<HEADLINE> Pak PM Calls for Joint Efforts to Achieve D-8 Goals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz
Sharif Thursday called for concerted efforts to achieve the
objectives set out by the D-8 (Developing Eight) group.
</P>
<P>
"The member countries should work hard to achieve these
objectives and make it a successful organization," Sharif told
reporters at the airport here Thursday afternoon on return from
Dhaka, Bangladesh, where he attended the two-day second D-8 summit
on March 1 and 2.
</P>
<P>
The summit had identified several projects which could be very
beneficial to Pakistan, he said, adding, "Political will is
required to achieve these objectives as economies of all these
states are more or less similar."
</P>
<P>
The D-8 includes Pakistan, Iran, Bangladesh, Egypt, Nigeria,
Indonesia, Malaysia and Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Sharif said in his arrival statement that the Dhaka
summit represents an important landmark in promoting cooperation
among the D-8 countries.
</P>
<P>
The Dhaka Declaration identifies specific projects for
cooperation especially in trade, agriculture, rural development,
energy and various scientific fields, he added.
</P>
<P>
He said the D-8 leaders also reviewed the global economic
situation especially the current economic and financial crisis
affecting Southeast Asia and many Islamic countries.
</P>
<P>
They agreed that the D-8 should establish contacts with the
Organization of the Islamic Conference and other groups of
developing and developed countries, he said.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in Dhaka, Sharif also had bilateral meetings
with leaders of other member countries and discussed issues of
mutual concern with them.
</P>
<P>
The leaders expressed their pleasure and happiness over the
beginning of talks between Pakistan and India on the Kashmir issue
which is the most important issue in the region, the prime
minister said.
</P>
<P>
"Like Pakistan, they also expect that these talks would produce
positive results," he added.

<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh
Hasina on Thursday urged Pakistan to take measures to expand
imports from Bangladesh to narrow trade imbalance between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh had a trade deficit with Pakistan for several years,
she told Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif at an informal
meeting at the airport before the latter's departure for home in
the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Sharif was here to attend the two-day second Developing-Eight
(D-8) summit on Monday and Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Hasina also asked Sharif to expedite the repatriation of the
Pakistanis stranded in Bangladesh. "Bangladesh could not afford
them (the Pakistanis) for long," she said.
</P>
<P>
The lack of necessary fund hindered the process of
repatriation, Sharif said. He added that there were lots of
refugees flowing into his country from Afghanistan, which also
created a big problem for the country.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters on Tuesday, Sharif said he had taken up
the issue (of repatriation of stranded Pakistanis) when he first
came to power in 1991. His government was able to take some of the
stranded people, but there was internal resistance and an ethnic
problem surrounding it, he was quoted as saying by The Independent
daily newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Pakistani Foreign Minister Sartaz Aziz, who was present on the
occasion, said the Pakistani government did not accept the
stranded people as Pakistanis. "We are taking them on humanitarian
considerations," he was quoted as saying.

<HEADLINE> Cambodia Discusses Tribunal Report With U.N. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Cambodian Foreign Minister Hor
Nam Hong met with U.N. representative Thomas Hammarberg Thursday
afternoon, focusing on a U.N. panel's report about a tribunal for
Khmer Rouge leaders.
</P>
<P>
Hammarberg, the U.N. secretary general's special representative
on human rights in Cambodia, arrived here Thursday and went
straight to talks with Hor Nam Hong.
</P>
<P>
Hammarberg said Secretary General Kofi Annan had already
received the report presented by the three-member U.N. panel which
is about the Khmer Rouge leaders' crimes. But he said Annan has
not yet made any decision on whether the tribunal should be set up
to bring the Khmer Rouge leaders to justice.
</P>
<P>
Hor Nam Hong said he will fly to New York on Monday and meet
Annan on the issue on March 12.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister said the royal government of Cambodia is
considering to introduce the South African model of setting up a
truth and reconciliation commission to deal with the Khmer Rouge
issue. He also reiterated Hun Sen's attitude on it in his letter
to Annan Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Three jurists appointed by Annan visited Cambodia in November
to investigate possibilities of holding a tribunal against the
Khmer Rouge on charges of crimes against humanity.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Hun Sen had already sent a letter to Annan
demanding that the Khmer Rouge issue be dealt with cautiously and
properly. Otherwise other former Khmer Rouge officers and its rank
and file would be panicked into returning to the jungle and
renewing the guerrilla war in Cambodia.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam's Central Bank Maintains Forex Intervention </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, March 4 (Xinhua) -- The State Bank of Vietnam was
capable of controlling the exchange rate and would intervene
whenever necessary, The Saigon Times daily Thursday quoted an
official with the central bank as saying.
</P>
<P>
The average exchange rate of the Vietnamese dong against the
U.S. dollar on the interbank market Wednesday strengthened to
13,887 dong after a week of continuous decline, which bankers say
is a sign of intervention by the central bank.
</P>
<P>
Since the new forex regulations took effect last Friday, the
dong has continuously become weaker against the dollar, with the
local currency gradually dropping from 13,880 to 13,888.
</P>
<P>
Although the official quotations have risen a little, the real
trading rates at commercial banks and on the black market have
been falling.
</P>
<P>
At Vietcombank in Ho Chi Minh City, selling rates remained
unchanged Wednesday, but buying prices fell slightly to 13,899
dong.
</P>
<P>
Since last Friday, daily spot quotations at commercial banks
have been determined by adding at most 0.1 percent to the previous
working day's average.
</P>
<P>
A Vietnamese banking official said ahead of the Lunar New Year,
the bank had bought plenty of dollars from commercial banks as
demand this year, unlike usual, was far behind supply.
</P>
<P>
The Saigon Times daily quoted an unofficial source as saying
the central bank in the last two months had purchased at least 140
million dollars and now has foreign currency reserves of more than
600 million dollars.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam to Deal With Y2K Problem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, March 4 (Xinhua) -- The year 2000 computer problem would
be successfully dealt with in Vietnam before December 1, The
Saigon Times daily reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
According to a Y2K compliance program, by March 15, localities
and escorts in Vietnam will finish Y2K surveys of their places,
and by March 25, detailed plans for Y2K compliance will be worked
out.
</P>
<P>
These detailed plans, after being approved, will be carried out
from April to September and the period up to November 30 will be
reserved for dealing with emerging problems and those which have
yet to be dealt with relating to the millennium bug.
</P>
<P>
According to Vietnam's National Y2K Steering Committee, the
impact of the Y2K issue is not expected to be serious in Vietnam
compared with developed countries or other countries in the
region. However, the danger is considerable.
</P>
<P>
The impact will be most serious in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City
and in sectors such as banking, finance and electricity.
</P>
<P>
So far, five localities and 11 sectors have also set up
steering boards in charge of the problem.
</P>
<P>
A Y2K service center was set up Wednesday to provide
information on the Y2K problem, survey its possible impact and
propose solutions to all clients and organizations in Vietnam.

<HEADLINE> Duma Speaker: Russian-NATO Cooperation Hinges on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Russia's top legislator said
Thursday that the country's continued cooperation with the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization hinges on a firm guarantee of
Moscow's strategic interests.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a hearing on NATO expansion, Gennady Seleznyov,
speaker of the State Duma, or lower house of parliament, said NATO
tends to enlarge the spheres of its activity beyond Europe.
</P>
<P>
This means that the entire present-day international security
system will be affected, Seleznyov said, noting that the
alliance's leadership "tend to resort to force in tackling many
regional conflicts."
</P>
<P>
"This is particularly vivid in Iraq and Kosovo," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We have no doubt that all attempts to use force in dealing
with present-day problems are absolutely hopeless," the speaker
said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that NATO's plans to usurp the right to carry out
military operations by bypassing the U.N. Security Council
undermine the foundations of the international security system.
</P>
<P>
Under no circumstance should the countries and peoples which
have already fallen victim to NATO or are under threat of NATO's
"punishment" should be left without support, the speaker said.
</P>
<P>
Seleznyov voiced special concern over NATO's admission of
countries located directly next to Russia.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed regret, if not "surprise," over the official
positions and statements of Eastern European leaders who argue
that their countries will have absolute security and become
full-fledged members of the European community when they join
NATO.
</P>
<P>
The experience of the 20th century shows that when a grouping
which claims the leading role and wants all others to obey emerges
in Europe, the most destructive conflicts may flare up, Seleznyov
said.
</P>
<P>
At Thursday's hearing, First Deputy Chief of the Russian
General Staff, Col. Gen. Valery Manilov said that the admission of
Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary to NATO "will extend the
alliance's zone of influence 650-750 kilometers eastward."
</P>
<P>
He said following the admission of three new members, the
European grouping of NATO's ground forces will increase by 12
divisions, its personnel by 15 percent and tanks by 22 percent.
</P>
<P>
"The NATO military machine is approaching the Russian border,
which is changing the image of both Europe and the world and
demands concerted, well-coordinated and confident actions from
Russia and its allies, actions that would not provoke
incommensurate moves," he told the Duma deputies.

WASHINGTON, March 4 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Federal Aviation
Administration (FAA) said Thursday it will seek a 33,000 U.S.
dollars fine against Northwest Airlines for arranging to have a
B-24 bomber fly in formation with a jumbo jet as an honor for the
jet's retiring pilot.
</P>
<P>
Last July's maneuver with a 747 carrying 373 passengers was
dangerous, careless and illegal, the FAA said.
</P>
<P>
The agency has proposed the fine against the airline and a
1,000 dollars penalty against the Northwest dispatcher who
organized the event. The FAA has also proposed 90-day flying
suspensions for the pilots who flew both aircraft.
</P>
<P>
The flight ended safely, but aviation regulations prohibit
formation flying involving any aircraft carrying paying
passengers.

<HEADLINE> IMF Approves Augmentation of ESAF Loan to Kyrgyz </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 4 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary Fund
(IMF) has approved a request by the Kyrgyz government to augment
by about 12 million U.S. dollars the IMF's financial support
under the current three-year Enhanced Structural Adjustment
Facility (ESAF), the IMF announced on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The IMF Executive Board approved last June the current ESAF
amounting to 88 million dollars for the Central Asian country.
</P>
<P>
The program supported by the current ESAF was designed to
consolidate the gains in macroeconomic stabilization and
structural adjustment achieved under Kyrgyz Republic's first
three-year ESAF-supported program, and to address the remaining
deficiencies in creating a sustainable environment for continued
growth based on a dynamic private sector, the IMF said.
</P>
<P>
The augmentation, which is intended to help counter the impact
of the Russian financial crisis on the Kyrgyz economy, will be
available as part of the second loan under the first annual ESAF
arrangement.
</P>
<P>
ESAF is a concessional IMF facility for assisting eligible
members that are undertaking economic reform programs to
strengthen their balance of payments and improve their growth
prospects. ESAF loans carry an interest rate of 0.5 percent a year
and are repayable over 10 years, with a grace period of five and a
half years.

UNITED NATIONS, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Not discouraged by recent
setbacks in peacekeeping efforts in Africa and the emergence of
new threats to stability in Africa, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan on Wednesday called for renewed cooperation in the
international community to enhance African peacekeeping capacity.
</P>
<P>
In his report to the U.N. Security Council and the General
Assembly, Annan said that the 185-member world body, which bears
the primary responsibility in the maintenance of world peace and
security under the U.N. Charter, can play a crucial role in
rendering assistance to peacekeeping efforts by Africa's regional
and subregional organizations.
</P>

became the first black African to head the United Nations, shows
that the United Nations is attaching growing importance to the
peace and development on the African continent. In April 1998, his
first report shed much more light on the causes and solutions of
conflicts in Africa.
</P>
<P>
Over the past years, Africa has witnessed a rapid development
within itself of mechanisms to address conflict, and important and
subregional initiatives have taken shape in response to the
conflict and instability in Burundi, the Central African Republic,
Sierra Leone, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Guinea-Bissau, and
Liberia, among others, the dispute between Ethiopia and Eritrea.
</P>
<P>
However, the mechanisms alone can not be strong enough to put
an end to the ongoing conflicts in Africa. "Further progress in
the enhancement of African peacekeeping capacity would only be
possible with the determination of the African States themselves,"
Annan said.
</P>
<P>
The recent U.N. failure in its peacekeeping operations in
Angola originated from the non-cooperation of both warring parties
in the southwest African country. The Angolan Government has
repeatedly announced its willingness to see an early exit of the
U.N. peacekeepers following their mandate expiration on December 26.
</P>
<P>
There is a tendency of military adventurism in Africa, largely
hindering the painstaking efforts to bring peace and stability
back to the continent.
</P>
<P>
In essence, the enhancement of African peacekeeping capacity
mainly include the efforts to get more African countries involved
in U.N. peacekeeping operations and better African ability to
prevent and solve armed conflicts.
</P>
<P>
At present, 22 African countries are contributing almost 2,500
troops to United Nations peacekeeping operations, their efforts
show clearly that the enhancement of African peacekeeping capacity
can help advance the cause of peace, not only in Africa, but
around the world.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, "support from non-African countries will
continue to play a crucial role in the process" of improving
African peacekeeping capacity, Annan said.
</P>
<P>
However, the outside assistance is yet to meet the fundamental
demands of Africa in its efforts to prevent and contain conflicts.
Examples are the declining Official Development Assistance (ODA)
and the reluctance to invest in the efforts to build peace in
post-conflict areas in Africa.
</P>
<P>
The world has cried out for the elimination of such practice of
double standards in metering post-conflict assistance.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, equal attention should be given to all conflict
regions, including Africa. The world community noted with concern
that certain hot issues have become the focus of attention while
some others have been unfairly put on the back burner. Africa, in
much harder humanitarian and economic situations, is stuck in
various kinds of difficulties in getting capital assistance and
the involvement of the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
In short, "a combination of determination, preseverance and
vision on the part of African leaders and commitment by the
international community to support their efforts is vital for
peaceful progress within Africa as well as for enhancing Africa's
contribution to the maintenance of international peace and
security," Annan added.

<P>
WASHINGTON, March 4 (Xinhua) -- The telephone companies,
backbone of local voice and data communications in the United
States, have passed extensive Y2K test, said the New York Times
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
All the testing results indicate that U.S. telephone
networks would operate smoothly in 2000.
</P>
<P>
The Telco Year 2000 Forum, which conducted the testing, said
that more than 1900 separate equipment and systems tests since
last June turned up only six computer glitches. None of them
would have had any effect on service, said the Forum.
</P>
<P>
Among the problems, four involved the transition from 1999 to
2000 and two related to February 29, a leap-year day that some
computer equipment does not recognize.
</P>
<P>
The Forum's eight companies, which account for 90 percent of
the nation's local phone lines, tested "911" systems, basic
phone services, enhancements such as caller identification,
software that routes calls and various date networks.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Talks aimed at handing power to the
Northern Ireland Assembly reached a "critical stage", a Downing
Street spokesman said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
He stressed the March 10 date for Northern Ireland Secretary Mo
Mowlam to pass powers to the assembly was a "target" not a formal
deadline.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said a deadline might be set to "focus minds" if
progress had not been reached by the target date.
</P>
<P>
But government ministers, including Prime Minister Tony Blair,
remain confident that a deal can be reached on the issues, such as
arms decommissioning, which are stalling efforts to implement the
terms of the Good Friday Agreement.
</P>
<P>
Mowlam earlier on Thursday briefed ministers on the current
situation.
</P>
<P>
"Mo said despite the difficulties she remains optimistic that,
given there's overwhelming support to make the agreement work, we
will get there in the end," Blair's spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, David Trimble, Northern Ireland's first minister,
held talks on Thursday with the Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern
in Dublin to pave the way for the devolution of powers from
Westminster to the Northern Ireland Assembly, according to BBC
report.
</P>
<P>
Trimble said after the meeting that the on-going discussions
involved "sorting out a fresh treaty between the Republic of
Ireland and the United Kingdom and preparing detailed legislation
on north-south co-operation."
</P>
<P>
They also discussed the decommissioning in Northern Ireland
which has staled the peace process in the province.

<P>
MOSCOW, March 4 (Xinhua) -- The Kremlin on Thursday denied
reports that President Boris Yeltsin had ordered Prime Minister
Yevgeny Primakov to sack Communists in the government.
</P>
<P>
Presidential spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin described as "sheer
nonsense" the reports that Yeltsin had ordered, or would order,
Primakov to sack any Communists.
</P>
<P>
"The president made no statement on this theme and did not
demand anything from (Primakov)," Yakushkin told the NTV
commercial television.
</P>
<P>
He suggested that the media reports could be a provocation
designed to "interfere with the normal work of the government."
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin, who was admitted to the Central Clinical Hospital last
Saturday for a recurrent stomach ulcer, and Primakov, who is on
holiday by the Black Sea resort of Sochi, did not comment publicly
on the latest media speculation.
</P>
<P>
But they dismissed rumors of a rift between them in a joint
appearance on television last week. Yeltsin said he would remain
president until his term ends in mid-2000 and Primakov vowed to be
prime minister until then.

<HEADLINE> German GDP Falls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Germany's economy struggled toward
the end of 1998, with its gross domestic product (GDP) in the
fourth quarter falling 0.4 percent behind the third quarter,
according to a report of the German Federal Statistics Office.
</P>
<P>
The annual GDP growth rate for the full year was 2.8 percent,
the office said Thursday, confirming earlier estimates.
</P>
<P>
But in the final quarter - versus the final quarter of 1997 -
the annual GDP growth rate was 2.5 percent. In the third quarter
the annual rate had been 2.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
In a breakdown between east and west, the office said that for
the first time in many months eastern German growth outpaced that
of the west in the last quarter.
</P>
<P>
Western German GDP in the final quarter showed an annual rate
of 2.4 percent, compared with 2.9 percent in the third quarter. In
eastern Germany, GDP growth was 2.6 percent in the last quarter,
up sharply from 1.7 percent in the third.
</P>
<P>
The office said the economy in the final quarter was fueled
solely by domestic demand, with capital equipment investments
surging by 11 percent. Private consumption rose by 2.7 percent -
surpassing the GDP rate for the first time since the first quarter
of 1996.
</P>
<P>
In a reflection of the troubles in Asia, South America and
Russia last year, German exports growth in the last quarter was
only 1.6 per cent, while imports rose by 4.8 percent on an annual
basis, the report showed.

UNITED NATIONS, March 4 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan said on Thursday that the United Nations is still short of
the goal for full gender balance by 2000.

"Clearly, we must work harder," he told a panel discussion at

Despite progress in women's participation in decision-making

equality, he said.
</P>
<P>
Women are facing a new challenge of the negative side of
globalization as poverty among women especially heads of
households and older women appears to be deepening, he said.
</P>
<P>
Women are likely to suffer financially the consequences of the
break-up of the family when divorce rates increase everywhere,
the U.N. chief said.

He urged those countries that have not yet ratified the

<HEADLINE> China to Protect Northeastern Black Soil Area </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 4 (Xinhua) -- China will make further efforts to
protect the fertile black soil area in the northeastern part of
the country, legislators from northeast China's Jilin Province
said here today.
</P>
<P>
"The northeastern region each year produces some 35 million
tons of commercial grains and is therefore reputed as China's 'big
barn'. The black soil area in Jilin and Heilongjiang provinces
provides the region's best farmland," said Liu Xiang, a Jilin
deputy to the Ninth National People's Congress (NPC), China's
legislature.
</P>
<P>
Liu, a research fellow with the Jilin Provincial Institute of
Agricultural Sciences, is here for the upcoming annual session of
the Ninth NPC, scheduled to open tomorrow morning.
</P>
<P>
Since the late 1970s, Liu said, the Chinese government has
taken a series of measures, such as planting trees to form shelter
forest belts, to maintain natural conditions in the black soil
area.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, however, part of the land in this area has
shown signs of deterioration as a result of long-time cultivation,
with the land's content of organic substance and its fertility
level keeping on dropping, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he said, natural shields for the black soil area,
which mainly refer to natural forests in the Changbai Mountains to
the east of the area and the large area of grassland to its west,
have gradually diminished due to excessive logging and
desertification.
</P>
<P>
Yang Shaoming, another Jilin lawmaker, said that his province
is now making active efforts to persuade local farmers to abandon
traditional farming techniques and turn to an ecology-friendly
agriculture.
</P>
<P>
"We encourage farmers to adopt crop rotation and replace
chemical fertilizers with organic manure," said Yang, who is also
head of the Jilin Provincial Department of Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
The province also plans to plant more trees in the shelter
forest belts, gradually cut the size of the logging industry in
the Changbai Mountains and improve the ecological environment in
the western grassland area to prevent any further loss of land to
desert, he added.
</P>
<P>
"Once these measures take effect, grain production in the black
soil area can be further raised," he said. "We expect that grain
output in northeast China will increase by at least 18 million
tons by the year 2005, which can feed half of the 90 million
people to be born in China over the same period."

<HEADLINE> NPC Session Holds First Press Conference </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 4 (Xinhua) --The Second Session of the National
People's Congress will be held between March 5-15 in Beijing,
according to the session's spokesman.
</P>
<P>
"It is an important session to be held at an important time and
a major event in the political life of the Chinese people,"
Spokesman Zeng Jianhui said at the session's first press
conference held here this morning.
</P>
<P>
Zeng briefed reporters on the session's agenda and the
legislative work of the Standing Committee of the Ninth National
People's Congress.
</P>
<P>
The NPC Standing Committee of this term pays special attention
to the quality of legislation and has introduced new ways for the
enactment of laws, he said. It solicits views and opinions about
laws from all social circles and publishes law drafts on
newspapers to get people's views on them, he said.
</P>
<P>
Law makers, including NPC Standing Committee Chairman Li Peng,
have made frequent fact-finding tours to grassroots units, where
they have done research and obtained first-hand materials that
have a bearing on legislation.
</P>
<P>
"Now drafts for some important laws and decisions have to go
through three rounds of examinations and deliberations by the NPC
Standing Committee before their enactment,compared with two rounds
in the past," Zeng said.
</P>
<P>
To strengthen the legislature's supervisory role, the NPC
Standing Committee sent six work groups to localities in the past
year to check on the implementation of six laws and decisions. A
feed-back mechanism has been put in place to end non-enforcement
or slack enforcement of laws, he said.
</P>
<P>
The NPC Standing Committee will speed up drafting a law on
supervision, he said.
</P>
<P>
As a subordinate institution of the National People's Congress,
the Preparatory Committee for the Macao Special Administrative
Region (PCMSAR) is working at high gear and in good order.
</P>
<P>
The just concluded PCMSAR's 6th meeting produced a namelist of
candidates for a Selecting Committee for the first Macao SAR
government. The Selecting Committee will be officially voted into
being at the preparatory committee's next meeting, Zeng said.

"Forging and advancing a socialist relationship among all
nationalities have always been a basic principle of our Party in
dealing with ethnic problems, and all the Chinese nationalities,
either the Han nationality or the ethnic groups live together
harmoniously and enjoy equality," the Chinese leader pointed out,
calling for the people of all nationalities to continue to hold
high the banner of nationality unity, adhere to the ethnic
policies of the Party, improve the autonomy of ethnic groups,
oppose activities of any form aimed at splitting the nationality
unity and contribute to the social stability of the country.
</P>
<P>
Jiang also urged the areas inhabited by ethnic groups to speed
up their economic development and social progress to enhance the
unity of all nationalities.
</P>
<P>
"The economic and social development in the areas inhabited by
ethnic groups has a direct bearing on the modernization drive of
the whole country," he said, adding that "only when the
development in these areas is accelerated, could the whole Chinese
nation be revitalized."
</P>
<P>
"We still have a lot of work to do in order to accelerate the
development of the areas inhabited by ethnic groups," Jiang said,
pointing to the fact that the central government has already taken
and will take more special policies and measures in that regard.
</P>
<P>
On the religious issue, Jiang said: "We should first fully
carry out the religious policies of the Party, improve the
handling of religious affairs, and guide the religion to adapt
itself to the socialist society of China."
</P>
<P>
He stressed that respecting and protecting the freedom of
religious belief is a basic policy of the Party and government,
and the Party members should unite with the religious people, and
help them contribute to the country's modernization drive.
</P>
<P>
He explained that there are two aspects about guiding the
religion to adapt itself to the socialist society of China. First,
the religious people should abide by laws of socialist China;
secondly, the religious people should contribute as much as
possible to the unity of the motherland and the nationalities and
social progress.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of the important role of the CPPCC members in this
regard, Jiang said their active participation in state affairs
vividly reflects the policies of equality among all nationalities
and freedom of religious belief in China.

"In the coming year we need to further stabilize and strengthen
the agricultural sector, deepen reform of state-owned enterprises,
make financial reform a success, as well as boost domestic demand
and ensure social, political stability," the article says.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, it says, the general guiding principle for this year'

and face up to challenges, and work hard with one heart and one
mind.
</P>
<P>
"This should also become the guiding principle of the Second

</P>
<P>
It continues to say that over the past two decades since the
Third Plenum of the 11th CPC Central Committee, which started
China's reform and opening-up, the people's congress system has
played a vital role in building China's socialist democracy and
legal system and ensuring a smooth development of the country's
reform, opening-up and socialist modernization drive.

<P>
"Meanwhile, this system has constantly made self-improvement

that the Ninth NPC has done a lot of work and achieved new
progress in fields like legislation and supervision since it
convened its first session in March, 1998.
</P>
<P>
It finally calls on people of all ethnic groups across China to
"hold higher the great banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory", "rally
more closely around the Party Central Committee with Jiang Zemin
at its core", and unswervingly march forward along the path of
building socialism with Chinese characteristics.

<P>
BEIJING, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
called for greater efforts today in ethnic and religious work,
saying correct handling of the ethnic and religious issues has a
direct bearing on the national unity, social stability, economic
development and strong border areas.
</P>
<P>
President Jiang made the remark this afternoon when calling on
some of the National Committee members of the Chinese People's
Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), who are also
representatives from the ethnic groups and religious circle and
are here to attend the on-going Second Session of the Ninth CPPCC
National Committee.
</P>
<P>
Also present on the occasion was Li Ruihuan, Standing Committee
member of the Political Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party (CPC)
Central Committee and Chairman of the CPPCC National Committee.
</P>
<P>
"We should unswervingly carry out the ethnic and religious
policies, and improve our work in all fields including the ethnic
and religious field," said Jiang who is also the General Secretary
of the CPC Central Committee.
</P>
<P>
"This is of great significance to maintaining the solidarity
and stability of the nation, to consolidating and furthering a
relationship of equality, unity and mutual assistance among all
nationalities, and to advancing the cause of building socialism
with Chinese characteristics to the 21st century," he added.
</P>
<P>
Immersed in heated discussions, the CPPCC National Committee
members present at the meeting put forward opinions and
suggestions on topics such as the economic development of the
regions inhabited by ethnic groups and implementation of the
policy of freedom of religious belief.
</P>
<P>
After hearing the discussions of the CPPCC members, Jiang said
the Party and the central government have always attached great
importance to the ethnic and religious work, and have come up with
a correct way to handle the ethnic and religious issues by
implementing ethnic and religious policies with Chinese
characteristics that have the support of the Chinese people of all
nationalities.
</P>
<P>
China is a large family composed of 56 nationalities, and in
socialist China and under the leadership of the Chinese Communist
Party, all nationalities have forged a new relationship, the
ethnic regions have achieved autonomy of ethnic groups, and all
the nationalities enjoy genuine unity and equality, Jiang said.

<P>
BEIJING, March 4 (Xinhua) -- The Friday issue of the People's
Daily, China's leading newspaper, will carry an editorial hailing
the opening of the Second Session of the Ninth National People's
Congress (NPC), the country's top legislature.
</P>
<P>
"People are the owners of our country, and the NPC session,
held once every year, is an occasion for people to exercise state
power," says the editorial, titled "People's interests rule
supreme."
</P>
<P>
Describing the upcoming NPC session as "a very important
meeting", the editorial says that the session is of great
significance for greeting the 50th founding anniversary of the
People's Republic of China on October 1 and the return of Macao at
the end of this year, as well as for further promoting the great
cause of China's reunification.
</P>
<P>
"It will also help mobilize, organize and encourage people of
all ethnic groups across the country to do a good job in various
aspects this year," it says.
</P>
<P>
The NPC session, scheduled to open in Beijing tomorrow morning,
will hear and examine a Government Work Report to be delivered by
Premier Zhu Rongji, discuss a draft amendment to the Chinese
Constitution, and deliberate some other draft laws and documents.
</P>
<P>
The editorial says that 1998 was a year of great triumphs for
the Chinese people, who, under the leadership of the Communist
Party of China (CPC), withstood the strong impact of the Asian
financial crisis, won the battle against the worst flooding in
decades and maintained a steady growth of the national economy.
</P>
<P>
It goes on to say that 1999 will turn out to be a year of
particular significance in the Chinese history, as many major
events are expected to happen this year and the country will have
many difficulties to overcome.

illegal gambling den was a friend and neighbor.
</P>
<P>
But Clark said he did not influence a government decision that
awarded Dimitrios Pilarinos a license to run a lucrative casino.
</P>
<P>
Dimitrios, who has been charged with keeping a common gaming
house, had close ties to the premier.
</P>
<P>
Not only did their children play together, but Dimitrios did 16,
000 Canadian dollars (10,560 U.S. dollars) worth of renovations to
Clark's home last year, shortly before winning provincial approval
for a casino, said the National Post newspaper.
</P>
<P>
That link may explain why commercial crime investigators
searched the premier's home Tuesday night, just three hours after
more than 40 RCMP officers raided the North Burnaby Inn during an
undercover investigation into illegal gambling. It was that raid
that led to Dimitrios' arrest.
</P>
<P>
Clark released a copy of a memorandum prepared by his staff,
confirming his instructions to be insulated from any decision on
the application by Pilarinos for a charity casino license.
</P>
<P>
Shortly before Clark's statement, the RCMP issued a brief
statement confirming that their raid on the Premier's home was
connected to their continuing investigation of an application for
a charity casino license.
</P>
<P>
The statement also said the search warrant involved did not
allege any criminal activity on the part of Clark.

<HEADLINE> Sweden Quits European Table Tennis League Next Season </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Sweden will withdraw from next
season's European Table Tennis League to protest the way the
competition is run, a senior table tennis official said.
</P>
<P>
"We hope to change the way the league's competition system so
far, but the European Table Tennis Federation(ETTF) turned a deaf
ear to our opinion, so we have to opt to quit the league next
season," said Orjan Nilsson, president of Sweden National Table
Tennis Management Committee, Wednesday night,
</P>
<P>
Nilsson said the Sweden Table Tennis Association made the
decision a month ago for the ETTF declined to take its proposal of
adopting the knockout system to slash the number of games in the
league.
</P>
<P>
Participants in the league have to put themselves through the
group stages and then qualifiers before they finally reach the
finals.
</P>
<P>
The league profile has been lowered for the big number of games,
which scared many well-known players withdraw.
</P>
<P>
Big guns such as Jan-Ove Walderner and Joegen Persson, both
from Sweden, have skipped the event since last year, while Germany
and France are sending their second-string players to take part in
the tournament.

<HEADLINE> Jordanian King Names New Prime Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Jordan's new King Abdullah Bin
Hussein has asked a veteran politician, Abdul-Raouf Rawabdeh, to
form a new government in the first major shakeup since King
Hussein died a month ago.
</P>
<P>
Rawabdeh, 60, held several cabinet posts during the past three
decades, including his first transportation portfolio in 1976. He
is known for his liberal outlook and a supporter of Jordan's 1994
peace treaty with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Rawabdeh has taken over the reign of the government from Prime
Minister Fayez Tarawneh who is expected to formally tender his
resignation to King Abdullah later Thursday, the Jordanian News
Agency Petra reported.
</P>
<P>
The Tarawneh-led government has been blamed by the media and
the public for a stagnant economic growth, a two-digit
unemployment rate, poor efficiency and rampant corruptions after
it came to power seven months ago.
</P>
<P>
The former government was set up on August 20, 1998 following
the resignation of the Majali cabinet, triggered by a serious
widespread water contamination scandal in Amman which saw dozens
of residents hospitalized.
</P>
<P>
The new monarch Abdullah, 37, is seen as apparently following
the traditional policy, though not written in law books, that a
government should step down following the proclamation of a new
king.
</P>
<P>
Newspapers in Amman had been preparing the public for a
possible power change in the government, clamoring that the
resignation of the Tarawneh government was a matter of days or at
most weeks after Abdullah acceded to the throne on February 7,
hours after his father Hussein died of cancer.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah has the constitutional rights to dissolve or form
governments.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Calls for Reform of UN Security Council </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 4 (Xinhua) -- South African Foreign
Minister Alfred Nzo Thursday called for the restructuring of the
United Nations (UN) Security Council, South African Press
Association reported.
</P>
<P>
The restructuring and reform of the Security Council was
probably the single most important step to more equitable
international relations, he told the parliament.
</P>
<P>
Nzo repeated his call for the legislators to debate whether
South Africa should serve as a permanent member of the U.N.
Security Council. South Africa has been lobbying support in the
United Nations for it to become a permanent member of the U.N.
Security Council.
</P>
<P>
Egypt and Nigeria also reportedly vied for a permanent position
in the council, each regarding itself as most suitable to
represent the African continent in a reformed security council.
</P>
<P>
Nzo elaborated the government's diplomatic achievements since
it came to power in 1994, indicating that the country is now ready
for a more important role in international affairs.
</P>
<P>
He said Pretoria, the seat of South African government, had
become one of the busiest capitals in the world, with over 126
foreign missions.
</P>
<P>
South Africa had diplomatic relations with almost all countries
of the world and maintained these ties through a network of 90
missions, he said.
</P>
<P>
Since the abolishment of the apartheid system five years ago,
73 foreign heads of state or government had visited South Africa,
while President Nelson Mandela visited 83 foreign countries.
</P>
<P>
"This level and intensity is unsurpassed," Nzo said.

<HEADLINE> 22.8 Percent of S. African Pregnant Women HIV </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 4 (Xinhua) -- An estimated 22.8 percent of
South African women attending antenatal clinics last year were
infected with HIV virus, according to a survey.
</P>
<P>
This translates to approximately 3.6 million South Africans or
8.6 percent of the total population, the Government Communications
and Information Service said in a statement Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"In simple terms, roughly one in eight adult South Africans
were infected with HIV in 1998."
</P>
<P>
For the purpose of the report, an adult is defined as a person
of 14 years or older.
</P>
<P>
The survey, ninth of its kind, was based on 15,301 blood
samples of pregnant women who attended antenatal clinics during
October last year.
</P>
<P>
According to the survey, the overall HIV prevalence increased
by 33.8 percent in 1998 compared with 1997.
</P>
<P>
With special concern is the rapid increase of HIV infection
rate among sexually active teenagers.
</P>
<P>
Prevalence rate in teenage girls (15-19 years) has risen from
12.7 percent in 1997 to 21 percent in 1998. This represents an
increase of 65.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
The survey also found a high increase in HIV prevalence among
women in the twenties, with 26.1 percent and 26.9 percent for the
20-24 and 25-29 age groups respectively.
</P>
<P>
KwaZulu-Natal in the east of the country, is still the province
with the highest HIV infection rate with 32.2 percent, followed by
Mpumalanga in the northeast with 30 percent.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria to Address Problems in Oil-Producing Area </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABUJA, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian Head of State General
Abdulsalami Abubakar announced Thursday that his government had
set up a 22-member committee to review the development options in
the country's oil-producing Niger Delta area.
</P>
<P>
The Niger Delta area in southeastern Nigeria is the source of
the country's oil wealth and has recently been the scene of
violent protests by various communities in the area, especially in
Rivers and Bayelsa states.
</P>
<P>
Inaugurating the committee, the head of state said the
committee members include the administrators of the nine oil
producing states of the area as well as the ministers of
education, water resources, power and steel, works and housing.
</P>
<P>
Abubakar said the latest government initiatives targeted at
addressing the infrastructural inadequacies in rural Nigeria as
well as the oil producing area development commission had not met
this need.
</P>
<P>
Abubakar who is to hand over power to president-elect Olusegun
Obasanjo on May 29 noted that the latest attempt was part of the
government' s campaign to satisfy the development aspirations of
the area by resolving such problems as unemployment and lack of
infrastructure cited by the protesters.
</P>
<P>
"The government is determined to stem the tide of ceaseless
violence and threat to lives and property in the area following
incessant complaints of neglect and deprivation," he added.
</P>
<P>
The Niger Delta area has been racked by violent protests,
mostly by the ethnic Ijaw youths, hundreds of whom lost their
lives in clashes with Nigerian security personnel in December last
year in Bayelsa State.
</P>
<P>
The clashes forced the Nigerian government to postpone the
December local government elections in that state for fear that
the youths would disrupt the exercise.
</P>
<P>
Oil was first produced for export in Oloibiri in Bayelsa State
in 1957. Since then, the area has provided most of the country's
oil export.

<HEADLINE> Jordan, IMF Agree on New Reform Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Jordan and the Internatinal
Monetary Fund (IMF) have finalized discussions on a new
three-year reform program to reschedule the debt servicing and
bring down the budget deficit of the desert kingdom.
</P>
<P>
The new package, which is underpinned by an estimated 150
million U.S. dollars a year in IMF financing, is expected
to receive final approval from the IMF board and the
Jordanian government.
</P>
<P>
Reforms pledged by the Jordanian government under the new IMF
aid package include trade and tax reforms, tariff reductions and
tight fiscal restraint to keep the budget deficit below the
IMF-targeted seven percent.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, the budget deficit of Jordan grew nearly to 10
percent, well above the IMF-set 3.5 percent. Coupled with a sharp
slowdown of economic growth, the Jordanian government was forced
to extend a 10-year program with the IMF which ended in February.
</P>
<P>
Jordan's new three-year program with the IMF will help
reschedule the kingdom's debt payment, which has become a major
burden for the kingdom after its foreign debts amounted to
some 6.8 billion dollars in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Government officials hold out the hope that the new IMF aid
program will usher in a higher economic growth and encourage
foreign investment and bring down the two-digit unemployment
rate.

<HEADLINE> S. African Public Servants to Face New Pay Rules </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 4 (Xinhua) -- South African public
servants' annual pay rises based on length of service are to be
scrapped in favor of performance-linked incentives, Business Day
paper reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The new compulsory rules will apply to South Africa's 1.1
million public servants by April next year, including police,
teachers and health workers, Public Service Director-General Danie
du Toit said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
At present, public servants below the rank of director who
occupy a position for three years without promotion, irrespective
of performance, are automatically promoted to the next rank.
</P>
<P>
"Rank promotions cost the state 1.4 billion rand (233 million
U.S. dollars) in 1996," Du Toit said at the parliament. "This must
come to an end."
</P>
<P>
In the future managers in the public service sector would
reward achievers at the expense of under-performers, and the
annual increase for the reward would be decided in consultation
with the unions.
</P>
<P>
Salie Manie, chairman of the parliamentary public service
portfolio committee, said the old-style public service giving
people job security regardless of what they did, and where
promotion were guaranteed, is over.
</P>
<P>
The new assessment rules are "the least we can do for
tax-payers, who are paying the wages and salaries of public
servants," he said.
</P>
<P>
Du Toit said the implementation of the rules will start with
senior managers, from director upwards, at national and provincial
government levels.
</P>
<P>
They would have to sign their performance agreements by the end
of April this year, and the rest of the public service would have
to do the same until April next year.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Releases Former General for National </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABUJA, March 4 (Xinhua) -- The Provisional Ruling Council
(PRC), Nigeria' s highest policy-making body, approved Thursday
the release of former Chief of General Staff Lt. Gen. Oladipo Diya
and others to pursue national reconciliation in the country.
</P>
<P>
Chief of General Staff Okhai Akhigbe said that "we believe in
the spirit of national reconciliation, we want to leave our ugly
past."
</P>
<P>
Major General Tajudeen Olarenwaju, Major General Abdulkareem
Adisa, Col. Lawan Gwadabe and all those convicted of coup plots
were released together with General Diya.
</P>
<P>
While Diya, Olarenwaju and Adisa were jailed in connection with
an attempt to overthrow the regime of late General Sani Abacha in
1997, Owadabe was jailed for plotting to overthrow the same
regime in 1995.
</P>
<P>
President-elect General Olusegun Obasanjo and his late
second-in-command, Major General Shehu Yar'Adua, who were both
jailed in connection with the 1995 coup plot were earlier pardoned
by Nigerian Head of State General Abdulsalami Abubakar.
</P>
<P>
Akhigbe told reporters in capital Abuja that suspects of the
1990 coup attempt who were wanted for alleged complicity "now have
their names removed from the wanted list."
</P>
<P>
Recalling the 1995 incident, he noted that "those who have
completed their jail terms like Col. Nyam, major I.O. Ede, Capt.
Ogunsuyi and others have been granted pardon as well."
</P>
<P>
Diya, Adisa, Olarenwaju, Major O.O. IADIPE, IT,COL. Akiyode and
a civilian engineer O.O. Adebanjo were sentenced to death for
their roles in the December 1997 coup plot.
</P>
<P>
The death sentences were later commuted to life imprisonment by
the PRC after the sudden death of Gen. Sani Abacha in June 1998.
</P>
<P>
Nigerian President-elect General Obasanjo said on Tuesday that
his priority on assumption of office would be to reconcile
Nigerians and heal the nation's wounds.

<HEADLINE> Israel Denies Mossad Uses Lewinsky Affair to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 4 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli government Thursday
denied allegations that Israel's secret service Mossad had
wiretapped U.S. President Bill Clinton's phone-sex talks with
Monica Lewinsky and then blackmailed the White House to protect an
Israeli mole.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's spokesman dismissed as
"completely stupid" the allegations made by a British journalist
in a new book which is about the history of Mossad and due to be
published next week, Israel Radio said.
</P>
<P>
According to the book, Mossad director Danny Yatom collected
30 hours of sexually explicit conversations between Clinton and
Lewinsky by tapping Lewinsky's phone.
</P>
<P>
The Mossad then used the tapes to blackmail the U.S. president
into calling off an investigation into an Israeli mole, codenamed
"Mega," who was operating under deep cover within the White House,
according to the book.
</P>
<P>
David Bar-Illan, a senior adviser to Netanyahu, said Wednesday
that "we don't respond to every bit of nonsense published either
in newspapers or in book form."
</P>
<P>
Israel has denied conducting spying operations in the United
States since Jonathan Pollard, an ex-intelligence analyst in the
U.S. army was sentenced to life imprisonment in 1986 on conviction
of spying for Israel.

<HEADLINE> Archaeologists to Resume Excavation of Alexandria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 4 (Xinhua) -- French archaeologists will resume
next month excavation at the underwater site of the ancient
lighthouse of Alexandria, the Egyptian Gazette newspaper reported
on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The excavation in the next three months will involve removing
135 blocks of concrete, weighing a total of 2,700 tonnes,
Jean-Yves Empereur, director of the excavation team, said on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"Last year, during the month of March, we removed 45 blocks
which allowed us to find 300 antiquities and this time we will
complete the work," Empereur said.
</P>
<P>
Archaeologists have complained that blocks of concrete were
dumped over vestiges of the lighthouse and other antiquities when
a barrier was built near the Pharos peninsula to stop the erosion
of the coastline.
</P>
<P>
The underwater excavation which began five years ago has led to
the discovery of columns and a sphinx as well as vestiges of the
lighthouse built during the reign of Ptolemy II in 300 B.C.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptians plan to create an underwater archaeological
reserve at the site that can be viewed by tourists either diving
in scuba gear or travelling on glass-bottom boat.

<P>
KAMPALA, March 4 (Xinhua) -- The Uganda People's Defense Forces
(UPDF) have killed 15 Rwandan Interahamwe militiamen believed to
be part of the group that killed eight foreign tourists in
western Uganda on Monday
</P>
<P>
Two officers of the army's second division said Wednesday that
the rebels were killed in combat in the dense thicket of Bwindi,
Kisoro district where the tourists were murdered, the New Vision
newspaper reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
One UPDF soldier was injured and hospitalized, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The Interahamwe rebels were retreating from the scene of the
murder of the tourists, which included four British, two Americans
and two New Zealanders.
</P>
<P>
The UPDF also recovered an assortment of weapons and 69 head of
 cattle looted by the rebels.
</P>
<P>
Over 100 Interahamwe rebels attacked tented tourist camps in
Bwindi National Park and abducted 32 tourists after killing four
Ugandan park staff.
</P>

They killed eight tourists with clubs and machetes, with the
aim of getting western Uganda into a war zone to taint the
country's international image and undermine its tourism industry.

President Yoweri Museveni has called a press conference to
condemn the terrorist act of the rebels and has ordered the troops

<HEADLINE> Palestinians Stress Firm Stance on Statehood </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Speaker of the Palestinian
Legislative Council Ahmed Qureia said stressed Thursday the
Palestinians' firm stance on declaration of an independent state
on May 4.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Egypt's Voice of Arab radio, Qureia said
the stance is based on the resolve and determination of the
Palestinian people.
</P>
<P>
Qureia underlined that May 4 is a date enshrined in the
Palestinian-Israeli Oslo Accord in 1993 to end a five-year interim
Palestinian self-rule in the West Bank and Gaza, and a permanent
peace deal between the two sides should be signed by the deadline.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat announced that he
will declare an independent Palestinian state on May 4 regardless
of the results of the peace talks with Israel. Arafat is striving
to rally international support for the Palestinian cause.
</P>
<P>
Israel, however, opposes the possible Palestinian move,
threatening to take tough actions against the unilateral step,
including annexation of parts of the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Qureia also stressed in the interview that the Palestinians
reject Israel's procrastination of signed agreements and its
Jewish settlement construction on the occupied Palestinian land.
</P>
<P>
He urged Israel to honor its commitments under the signed
agreements.
</P>
<P>
The peace process between Israel and the Palestinians was
derailed in early December when Israel put on hold the
implementation of the Wye accord signed last October in Washington.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, Israel should have pulled out its troops
from another 13 percent of the West Bank by the end of January.

<HEADLINE> S. African Ruling Party Leaders Denied Amnesty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 4 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's Truth and
Reconciliation Commission (TRC) has rejected an amnesty bid by 27
senior African National Congress (ANC) leaders, a TRC spokesman
confirmed Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Those whose amnesty applications have been denied include
Deputy President Thabo Mbeki, Defense Minister Joe Modise, Justice
Minister Dullah Omar, Foreign Minister Alfred Nzo and Transport
Minister Mac Maharaj, according to South African Press Association
(SAPA).
</P>
<P>
It is understood that the applications were turned down on the
grounds that they did not fall within the ambit of the TRC act,
SAPA said.
</P>
<P>
A total of 37 ANC leaders applied for amnesty, 29 collectively
and the rest individually.
</P>
<P>
The 37 ANC leaders were granted "blanket amnesty" by the TRC in
November 1997, but the amnesty was nullified by the Cape High
Court in May 1998 at the request of the TRC following protests
from opposition parties.
</P>
<P>
SAPA quoted a source as saying that amendments to the current
TRC act are on the cards to accommodate the ANC leaders, as well
as former generals of the South African Defense Force and those
involved in the conflict in KwaZulu-Natal, in the east of the
country.
</P>
<P>
The source said the amendments were intended to avoid a
situation where Mbeki, the president-in-waiting, would be hauled
before courts after being sworn in as president.
</P>
<P>
"It will be embarrassing for Mr. Mbeki to be drawn into such a
controversy. The intended amendments are, therefore, looking at
avoiding plunging South Africa's constitution into a crisis," the
source was quoted as saying.

JOHANNESBURG, March 4 (Xinhua) -- South African Foreign
Minister Alfred Nzo Thursday urged the international community to
take strong action against those responsible for this week's
murder of eight tourists in Uganda.
</P>
<P>
The seriousness of the conflict in the Great Lakes region was
once again demonstrated by the brutal slaying of the tourists,
South African Press Association quoted Nzo as saying in
parliament.
</P>
<P>
The South African government "vigorously condemned" this
barbaric act, he said.
</P>
<P>
Nzo's statement follows Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni's vow
to capture or kill the rebels responsible for the murder.
</P>
<P>
The rebels are Hutu fighters who fled Rwanda in 1994 after
killing more than half a million Tutsis and politically moderate
Hutus in a horrible genocide in landlocked country.

<HEADLINE> Pay Phones Appearing on Cairo Streets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of red and yellow
telephone booths are appearing on Cairo's streets, the Egyptian
Gazette newspaper reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Two private firms, Menatel and Nile Telecom, have won 10-year
renewable licenses from state-owned Egypt Telecom in early 1998 to
install at least 20,000 units respectively in four years time.
</P>
<P>
While mobile telephones are all the rage among Egypt's elite,
the companies say there is an untapped market for card phone
booths for less wealthy users to supplement Egypt Telecom's
coin-operated telephone boxes.
</P>
<P>
"Independent research said Egypt needs 100,000 public pay
phones, so there is a lot of room for expansion," Hesham Gabr,
managing director of Nile Telecom, said.
</P>
<P>
Nile Telecom, which started installing public phones last June,
three months earlier than Menatel, focused initially on Cairo,
Gabr said.
</P>
<P>
"Now, we are targeting the whole Delta line and Alexandria," a
Mediterranean port city 220 kilometers northwest of Cairo, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Menatel's managing director, Aime Brial, has also said that his
company is confident that it can complete the 20,000 units in
three years.

<HEADLINE> US Accused of Fanning Flames in Banana Row with EU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, March 4 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) on
Thursday accused the United States of defying the World Trade
Organization (WTO) system by introduction a form of sanctions,
saying the U.S. is fanning the flames.
</P>
<P>
Sir Leon Brittan, vice-president of the European commission,
said that the U.S. sanctions have no WTO authorization whatsoever.
</P>
<P>
The EU executive head said at a news conference that the U.S.
action is a measure designed to have an immediate effect on
European exports. The WTO arbitrators made it clear on Wednesday
that they were in no way authorizing such an action, and stated
that they were not ready for the moment to take a decision on the
American request, Brittan pointed out.
</P>
<P>
A WTO panel on Tuesday asked the U.S. for more information
before ruling on whether its trade sanctions are in line with the
WTO rules, which foiled its plan to impose unilateral sanctions on
EU exports as of March 3.
</P>
<P>
The world trade body had asked both sides in the banana row to
provide enough information by March 15. But the United States
began on Wednesday notifying importers that they are liable for
hefty penalty tariffs on 520-million-dollar worth of EU goods.
"What the U.S. has done is therefore both unacceptable and
unlawful," Brittan said.
</P>
<P>
"Just at the time when we should both be working towards a
settlement, the U.S. is fanning the flames of this dispute. We are
immediately demanding urgent consultations with the U.S. in the
WTO, and will discuss our further response with the (EU) member
states," the trade head of the EU executive body said.
</P>
<P>
Now all signs showed it is harder to resolve the EU-US dispute
over banana trade since both sides are not willing to yield to
their rival. During their long-running row, the U.S. won a recent
ruling on EU banana import licensing and quota allocation
arrangement from a WTO panel in 1997. Though the EU change that
regime, the U.S. says the replacement system, which has been in
force since January this year, is still unlawful and threatened to
punish EU by sanctions.
</P>
<P>
EU has said the U.S. sanctions, in the form of 100 percent
duties, will hit unrelated member states' exports like cashmere
sweaters, biscuits, pasta, pecorino cheese and chandeliers.

<HEADLINE> France Proposes More Debt Cuts for Developing Countries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, March 4 (Xinhua) -- France proposed on Thursday that
developed countries reduce the debt owed by developing countries
by from 30 to 67 percent.
</P>
<P>
French Minister of Economy and Finance Dominique Strauss-Kahn
said at a press conference that he had sent a letter to his
counterparts in six other nations of the Group of Seven most
industrialized countries in presenting the proposal.
</P>
<P>
He said that the proposal is aimed at enlarging the number of
developing countries to benefit from an alleviation of debt, and
using cancelled debt to finance development projects.
</P>
<P>
The French proposals include the cancelling of interests of
debt for 30 years in respect of the most indebted countries, whose
number stands at from 23 to 41.
</P>
<P>
These countries should also have 67 percent of their debt
cancelled, instead of 50 percent as was previously proposed by
some developed countries, said Strass-Kahn.
</P>
<P>
As for countries with a medium-level of income such as Morocco
and Egypt, France proposes that from 30 to 50 percent of their
debt be turned into in investment fund by creditor countries.

<HEADLINE> GCC FMs Meet on Iranian Military Exercises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Foreign Ministers of the Gulf
Cooperation Council (GCC) member states held an emergency meeting
here on Thursday to discuss the ongoing Iranian military
exercises near three disputed islands.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was convened at the request of the United Arab
Emirates (UAE).
</P>
<P>
UAE Foreign Minister Rashid Abdullah al-Nuaimi, chairman of the
meeting, said at the opening ceremony that the UAE considered
Iran's naval and air war games near the islands of Abu Musa,
Greater and Lesser Tunbs as a violation of UAE's sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
"These are unacceptable acts which expose the region to danger
and instability and harm the good neighborly ties which the GCC
countries are aspiring to achieve," he said.
</P>
<P>
Iran's navy and air forces kicked off their nine-day war games,
code-named "Fateh (Victory)-77," on February 27.
</P>
<P>
At a time when the GCC nations sought to establish good
neighborly ties and intensified contacts to build confidence, Iran
carried out such "provocative acts," said the UAE official.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Iranian Interior Minister Abdolvahed Mousavi Lari
inaugurated a new city hall and an education center in Abu Musa on
February 5.
</P>
<P>
The move "is considered as a perpetuation of the occupation of
the islands and an attempt by Iran to change the island's
demographic structure."
</P>
<P>
The three islands, located near strategic shipping lanes in
the Gulf, are claimed by both the UAE and Iran, but controlled by
Iran.
</P>
<P>
The long-running dispute over the three islands continues to
block the full normalization of ties between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Following al-Nuaimi's speech, the ministers held a closed-door
meeting attended by GCC Secretary General Jamil Al-Hujailan.
</P>
<P>
GCC, a regional political and economic alliance, groups
Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the UAE.

<HEADLINE> Security Council Calls for Ceasefire Between </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 4 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security Council
on Thursday called for "an immediate ceasefire" between Ethiopia
and Eritrea in order to pave the way for the smooth implementation
of the Framework Agreement offered by the Organization of African
Unity (OAU).
</P>
<P>
In a statement read to the press, the president of the Security
Council, Qin Huasun of China, said, "Members of the Council
reiterated their demand to secure an immediate ceasefire by both
sides so as to create conditions to smoothly implement the OAU
Framework Agreement."
</P>
<P>
"Members of the Council expressed their concern at the
continuing fighting along the borders between Ethiopia and
Eritrea," the statement said, adding that "Members of the Council
noted that both Ethiopia and Eritrea already accepted the
Framework Agreement of the OAU."
</P>
<P>
"Members of the Council deplored that hostilities have not been
ceased and regretted that Ethiopia still continues its military
actions," the statement added.
</P>
<P>
Besides, Qin, speaking to reporters here in his capacity as the
Chinese permanent representative to the United Nations, said that
"China, which maintains friendly and cooperative relations with
both Ethiopia and Eritrea, sincerely hopes that the two Horn of
Africa countries can, through dialogue and peace talks, seek a
proper solution to the bilateral dispute on the basis of the OAU
Framework Agreement."
</P>
<P>
The Framework Agreement, a peace plan proposed by the OAU,
called on Eritrea to withdraw its troops back to positions before
the May 1997 breakout of the war between the two neighboring
nations over Badme region along their 1,000-kilometer, which has
never been clearly demarcated.
</P>
<P>
Under the OAU peace initiative, peacekeepers would be deployed
along the border ahead of neutral demarcation of the ill-defined
frontier.
</P>
<P>
The border differences simmered for nearly two decades before
they became a pretext for a fierce round of fighting in May and
June last year that left up to 1,000 dead.
</P>
<P>
Eritrea reported skirmishes on the western front of its border
war with Ethiopia on Thursday as Ethiopian President Negasso
Gidada declared Addis Ababa was determined to regain "invaded
territories."
</P>
<P>
Eritrea became independent from Ethiopia in May 1993 with the
Ethiopian blessing after the referendum.

<HEADLINE> Russia, Britain Remain Apart on Kosovo, Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Differences on Kosovo and Iraq
persisted Thursday between Russia and Britain following the talks
here of the two foreign ministers.
</P>
<P>
British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook, who is here on a
three-day visit, told a press conference after meeting his Russian
counterpart, Igor Ivanov, that he would heartily welcome Russia's
participation in any international presence in Kosovo to ensure
the implementation of the accords expected later this month.
</P>
<P>
Cook praised Russia for being a very valuable peace-keeping
partner in Bosnia and expressed the hope that it would be equally
instrumental in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Ivanov, for his part, insisted that Yugoslavia is a sovereign
state, and that an international presence in its Kosovo province
to ensure fulfillment of the peace accords will be possible only
with Belgrade's consent.
</P>
<P>
The main task now is to bring the conflicting sides back to the
negotiating table on March 15 to sign the political document,
Ivanov said.
</P>
<P>
On Iraq, the Russian minister reiterated Moscow's position that
air strikes should be stopped and that the Iraqi issue should be
resolved by the U.N. Security Council.
</P>
<P>
"Russia believes that efforts should be focused now in the U.N.
Security Council on seeking solutions" to the Iraqi issue, Ivanov
said.
</P>
<P>
He urged the parties involved "to refrain from activities which
could aggravate work in the U.N. Security Council."
</P>
<P>
Cook defended the British and U.S. air strikes in the so-called
"no-fly zones" in southern and northern Iraq as "self-defense."
</P>
<P>
"We are in no doubt that if he (Iraqi President Saddam Hussein)
was able to fly his planes in their zones he would have used it to
repress both the Kurdish and Shiite populations," Cook said.
</P>
<P>
The "no-fly zones," imposed by the United States and Britain,
were not recognized by the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Despite the differences, talks between the two ministers
"confirmed the proximity of fundamental strategic aims of Russia
and Great Britain in the issues of ensuring international
stability and security," Ivanov said.
</P>
<P>
The two sides signed a joint statement on cooperation in
training Russian managers and a momorandum on mutual understanding
between the foreign ministries, Itar-Tass reported.

PARIS, March 4 (Xinhua) -- The French Senate approved on
Thursday in a second reading a draft law presented by the

The National Assembly approved the law in two previous readings
but needed the green light from the Senate, which rejected the law
in its first reading, is to finally adopt the law.

<HEADLINE> Jordanian King Names New Prime Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Jordan's new King Abdullah Bin
Hussein has asked a veteran politician, Abdul-Raouf Rawabdeh, to
form a new government in the first major shakeup since King
Hussein died a month ago.
</P>
<P>
Rawabdeh, 60, held several cabinet posts during the past three
decades, including his first transportation portfolio in 1976. He
is known for his liberal outlook and a supporter of Jordan's 1994
peace treaty with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Rawabdeh has taken over the reign of the government from Prime
Minister Fayez Tarawneh who is expected to formally tender his
resignation to King Abdullah later Thursday, the Jordanian News
Agency Petra reported.
</P>
<P>
The Tarawneh-led government has been blamed by the media and
the public for a stagnant economic growth, a two-digit
unemployment rate, poor efficiency and rampant corruptions after
it came to power seven months ago.
</P>
<P>
The former government was set up on August 20, 1998 following
the resignation of the Majali cabinet, triggered by a serious
widespread water contamination scandal in Amman which saw dozens
of residents hospitalized.
</P>
<P>
The new monarch Abdullah, 37, is seen as apparently following
the traditional policy, though not written in law books, that a
government should step down following the proclamation of a new
king.
</P>
<P>
Newspapers in Amman had been preparing the public for a
possible power change in the government, clamoring that the
resignation of the Tarawneh government was a matter of days or at
most weeks after Abdullah acceded to the throne on February 7,
hours after his father Hussein died of cancer.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah has the constitutional rights to dissolve or form
governments.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Calls for Reform of UN Security Council </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 4 (Xinhua) -- South African Foreign
Minister Alfred Nzo Thursday called for the restructuring of the
United Nations (UN) Security Council, South African Press
Association reported.
</P>
<P>
The restructuring and reform of the Security Council was
probably the single most important step to more equitable
international relations, he told the parliament.
</P>
<P>
Nzo repeated his call for the legislators to debate whether
South Africa should serve as a permanent member of the U.N.
Security Council. South Africa has been lobbying support in the
United Nations for it to become a permanent member of the U.N.
Security Council.
</P>
<P>
Egypt and Nigeria also reportedly vied for a permanent position
in the council, each regarding itself as most suitable to
represent the African continent in a reformed security council.
</P>
<P>
Nzo elaborated the government's diplomatic achievements since
it came to power in 1994, indicating that the country is now ready
for a more important role in international affairs.
</P>
<P>
He said Pretoria, the seat of South African government, had
become one of the busiest capitals in the world, with over 126
foreign missions.
</P>
<P>
South Africa had diplomatic relations with almost all countries
of the world and maintained these ties through a network of 90
missions, he said.
</P>
<P>
Since the abolishment of the apartheid system five years ago,
73 foreign heads of state or government had visited South Africa,
while President Nelson Mandela visited 83 foreign countries.
</P>
<P>
"This level and intensity is unsurpassed," Nzo said.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Rejects to Amend Cease-fire Pact </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon on Thursday rejected an
Israeli proposal to amend the cease-fire agreement signed in 1996
between the two countries, the official National News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
"Lebanon is committed to the April Understanding in letter and
spirit and rejects any change in the mandate and mechanism of the
Monitoring Group," said Lebanese Prime Minister Salim Hoss while
meeting with Lebanese delegation chairman to the group Mahir
Toufeili.
</P>
<P>
Hoss made the remarks in response to Israeli Defense Minister
Moshe Arens' initiative to make some amendments to the pact in a
bid to enable the Israeli army to strike at Lebanon's anti-Israeli
group Hezbollah, or Party of God.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-brokered understanding, which ended a massive Israeli
bombing blitz that claimed more than 200 Lebanese lives in April,
1996, prohibits attacks on civilians or civilian areas on both
sides of the Lebanese-Israeli border.
</P>
<P>
Arens said the deal created a situation in which Hezbollah
guerrillas are free to launch attacks on Israeli targets in south
Lebanon while the Israeli army is denied to attack Hezbollah
bases because most of them are situated in villages.
</P>
<P>
Israel often complained to the Monitoring Group consisted of
representative from Israel, Lebanon, Syria, France and the United
States, that Hezbollah fired mortar or rockets on Israeli
outposts from Lebanese villages.
</P>
<P>
Arens produced the idea two days after Israel waged a massive
offensive against Hezbollah guerrillas in retaliation for the
killing of four Israelis, including a general, on February 28 in
south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a self-proclaimed security zone in south Lebanon
in 1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its north from
cross-border attacks by Lebanese guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Lebanon's resistance movement spearheaded by
Hezbollah has been fighting to drive Israeli troops out of the
country.

JOHANNESBURG, March 4 (Xinhua) -- An estimated 22.8 percent of
South African women attending antenatal clinics last year were
infected with HIV virus, according to a survey.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Nigeria to Address Problems in Oil-Producing Area </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABUJA, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian Head of State General
Abdulsalami Abubakar announced Thursday that his government had
set up a 22-member committee to review the development options in
the country's oil-producing Niger Delta area.
</P>
<P>
The Niger Delta area in southeastern Nigeria is the source of
the country's oil wealth and has recently been the scene of
violent protests by various communities in the area, especially in
Rivers and Bayelsa states.
</P>
<P>
Inaugurating the committee, the head of state said the
committee members include the administrators of the nine oil
producing states of the area as well as the ministers of
education, water resources, power and steel, works and housing.
</P>
<P>
Abubakar said the latest government initiatives targeted at
addressing the infrastructural inadequacies in rural Nigeria as
well as the oil producing area development commission had not met
this need.
</P>
<P>
Abubakar who is to hand over power to president-elect Olusegun
Obasanjo on May 29 noted that the latest attempt was part of the
government' s campaign to satisfy the development aspirations of
the area by resolving such problems as unemployment and lack of
infrastructure cited by the protesters.
</P>
<P>
"The government is determined to stem the tide of ceaseless
violence and threat to lives and property in the area following
incessant complaints of neglect and deprivation," he added.
</P>
<P>
The Niger Delta area has been racked by violent protests,
mostly by the ethnic Ijaw youths, hundreds of whom lost their
lives in clashes with Nigerian security personnel in December last
year in Bayelsa State.
</P>
<P>
The clashes forced the Nigerian government to postpone the
December local government elections in that state for fear that
the youths would disrupt the exercise.
</P>
<P>
Oil was first produced for export in Oloibiri in Bayelsa State
in 1957. Since then, the area has provided most of the country's
oil export.

<HEADLINE> S. African Public Servants to Face New Pay Rules </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 4 (Xinhua) -- South African public
servants' annual pay rises based on length of service are to be
scrapped in favor of performance-linked incentives, Business Day
paper reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The new compulsory rules will apply to South Africa's 1.1
million public servants by April next year, including police,
teachers and health workers, Public Service Director-General Danie
du Toit said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
At present, public servants below the rank of director who
occupy a position for three years without promotion, irrespective
of performance, are automatically promoted to the next rank.
</P>
<P>
"Rank promotions cost the state 1.4 billion rand (233 million
U.S. dollars) in 1996," Du Toit said at the parliament. "This must
come to an end."
</P>
<P>
In the future managers in the public service sector would
reward achievers at the expense of under-performers, and the
annual increase for the reward would be decided in consultation
with the unions.
</P>
<P>
Salie Manie, chairman of the parliamentary public service
portfolio committee, said the old-style public service giving
people job security regardless of what they did, and where
promotion were guaranteed, is over.
</P>
<P>
The new assessment rules are "the least we can do for
tax-payers, who are paying the wages and salaries of public
servants," he said.
</P>
<P>
Du Toit said the implementation of the rules will start with
senior managers, from director upwards, at national and provincial
government levels.
</P>
<P>
They would have to sign their performance agreements by the end
of April this year, and the rest of the public service would have
to do the same until April next year.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Releases Former General for National </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABUJA, March 4 (Xinhua) -- The Provisional Ruling Council
(PRC), Nigeria' s highest policy-making body, approved Thursday
the release of former Chief of General Staff Lt. Gen. Oladipo Diya
and others to pursue national reconciliation in the country.
</P>
<P>
Chief of General Staff Okhai Akhigbe said that "we believe in
the spirit of national reconciliation, we want to leave our ugly
past."
</P>
<P>
Major General Tajudeen Olarenwaju, Major General Abdulkareem
Adisa, Col. Lawan Gwadabe and all those convicted of coup plots
were released together with General Diya.
</P>
<P>
While Diya, Olarenwaju and Adisa were jailed in connection with
an attempt to overthrow the regime of late General Sani Abacha in
1997, Owadabe was jailed for plotting to overthrow the same
regime in 1995.
</P>
<P>
President-elect General Olusegun Obasanjo and his late
second-in-command, Major General Shehu Yar'Adua, who were both
jailed in connection with the 1995 coup plot were earlier pardoned
by Nigerian Head of State General Abdulsalami Abubakar.
</P>
<P>
Akhigbe told reporters in capital Abuja that suspects of the
1990 coup attempt who were wanted for alleged complicity "now have
their names removed from the wanted list."
</P>
<P>
Recalling the 1995 incident, he noted that "those who have
completed their jail terms like Col. Nyam, major I.O. Ede, Capt.
Ogunsuyi and others have been granted pardon as well."
</P>
<P>
Diya, Adisa, Olarenwaju, Major O.O. IADIPE, IT,COL. Akiyode and
a civilian engineer O.O. Adebanjo were sentenced to death for
their roles in the December 1997 coup plot.
</P>
<P>
The death sentences were later commuted to life imprisonment by
the PRC after the sudden death of Gen. Sani Abacha in June 1998.
</P>
<P>
Nigerian President-elect General Obasanjo said on Tuesday that
his priority on assumption of office would be to reconcile
Nigerians and heal the nation's wounds.

<P>
KAMPALA, March 4 (Xinhua) -- The Uganda People's Defense Forces
(UPDF) have killed 15 Rwandan Interahamwe militiamen believed to
be part of the group that killed eight foreign tourists in
western Uganda on Monday
</P>
<P>
Two officers of the army's second division said Wednesday that
the rebels were killed in combat in the dense thicket of Bwindi,
Kisoro district where the tourists were murdered, the New Vision
newspaper reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
One UPDF soldier was injured and hospitalized, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The Interahamwe rebels were retreating from the scene of the
murder of the tourists, which included four British, two Americans
and two New Zealanders.
</P>
<P>
The UPDF also recovered an assortment of weapons and 69 head of
 cattle looted by the rebels.
</P>
<P>
Over 100 Interahamwe rebels attacked tented tourist camps in
Bwindi National Park and abducted 32 tourists after killing four
Ugandan park staff.
</P>
<P>
They killed eight tourists with clubs and machetes, with the
aim of getting western Uganda into a war zone to taint the
country's international image and undermine its tourism industry.
</P>
<P>
President Yoweri Museveni has called a press conference to
condemn the terrorist act of the rebels and has ordered the troops
to catch or kill the killers.

<HEADLINE> S. African Ruling Party Leaders Denied Amnesty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 4 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's Truth and
Reconciliation Commission (TRC) has rejected an amnesty bid by 27
senior African National Congress (ANC) leaders, a TRC spokesman
confirmed Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Those whose amnesty applications have been denied include
Deputy President Thabo Mbeki, Defense Minister Joe Modise, Justice
Minister Dullah Omar, Foreign Minister Alfred Nzo and Transport
Minister Mac Maharaj, according to South African Press Association
(SAPA).
</P>
<P>
It is understood that the applications were turned down on the
grounds that they did not fall within the ambit of the TRC act,
SAPA said.
</P>
<P>
A total of 37 ANC leaders applied for amnesty, 29 collectively
and the rest individually.
</P>
<P>
The 37 ANC leaders were granted "blanket amnesty" by the TRC in
November 1997, but the amnesty was nullified by the Cape High
Court in May 1998 at the request of the TRC following protests
from opposition parties.
</P>
<P>
SAPA quoted a source as saying that amendments to the current
TRC act are on the cards to accommodate the ANC leaders, as well
as former generals of the South African Defense Force and those
involved in the conflict in KwaZulu-Natal, in the east of the
country.
</P>
<P>
The source said the amendments were intended to avoid a
situation where Mbeki, the president-in-waiting, would be hauled
before courts after being sworn in as president.
</P>
<P>
"It will be embarrassing for Mr. Mbeki to be drawn into such a
controversy. The intended amendments are, therefore, looking at
avoiding plunging South Africa's constitution into a crisis," the
source was quoted as saying.

South African Press Association quoted Nzo as saying in

Nzo's statement follows Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni's vow
to capture or kill the rebels responsible for the murder.
</P>

The rebels are Hutu fighters who fled Rwanda in 1994 after
killing more than half a million Tutsis and politically moderate

ADDIS ABABA, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Secretary General of the
Organization of African Unity (OAU) Salim Ahmed Salim Thursday
strongly condemned the killings of innocent tourists in Uganda, an
OAU press release issued here said.
</P>
<P>
The statement said Salim was "outraged and horrified" by the
killings of innocent tourists in Uganda which took place Monday.
</P>
<P>
"This wanton criminal act was committed by a group of people
who have no respect whatsoever for the sanctity of life and human
dignity," said the statement.
</P>
<P>
This act, according to reliable reports, was perpetrated by
some elements of the Intrahamwe militia - the very criminal
elements were responsible for the genocide and massacre of
innocent Tutsis and Hutus in Rwanda in 1994, it added.
</P>
<P>
It is the firm view of the secretary general that this sad and
despicable act should not only arouse our collective indignation
but should reinforce the will of the international community to
take all necessary measures to put an end to the criminal
activities of such elements, the statement noted.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 4 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli government Thursday
denied allegations that Israel's secret service Mossad had
wiretapped U.S. President Bill Clinton's phone-sex talks with
Monica Lewinsky and then blackmailed the White House to protect an
Israeli mole.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's spokesman dismissed as
"completely stupid" the allegations made by a British journalist
in a new book which is about the history of Mossad and due to be
published next week, Israel Radio said.
</P>
<P>
According to the book, Mossad director Danny Yatom collected
30 hours of sexually explicit conversations between Clinton and
Lewinsky by tapping Lewinsky's phone.
</P>
<P>
The Mossad then used the tapes to blackmail the U.S. president
into calling off an investigation into an Israeli mole, codenamed
"Mega," who was operating under deep cover within the White House,
according to the book.
</P>
<P>
David Bar-Illan, a senior adviser to Netanyahu, said Wednesday
that "we don't respond to every bit of nonsense published either
in newspapers or in book form."
</P>
<P>
Israel has denied conducting spying operations in the United
States since Jonathan Pollard, an ex-intelligence analyst in the
U.S. army was sentenced to life imprisonment in 1986 on conviction
of spying for Israel.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 4 (Xinhua) -- French archaeologists will resume
next month excavation at the underwater site of the ancient
lighthouse of Alexandria, the Egyptian Gazette newspaper reported
on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The excavation in the next three months will involve removing
135 blocks of concrete, weighing a total of 2,700 tonnes,
Jean-Yves Empereur, director of the excavation team, said on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"Last year, during the month of March, we removed 45 blocks
which allowed us to find 300 antiquities and this time we will
complete the work," Empereur said.
</P>
<P>
Archaeologists have complained that blocks of concrete were
dumped over vestiges of the lighthouse and other antiquities when
a barrier was built near the Pharos peninsula to stop the erosion
of the coastline.
</P>
<P>
The underwater excavation which began five years ago has led to
the discovery of columns and a sphinx as well as vestiges of the
lighthouse built during the reign of Ptolemy II in 300 B.C.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptians plan to create an underwater archaeological
reserve at the site that can be viewed by tourists either diving
in scuba gear or travelling on glass-bottom boat.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Momentum Rolls on: SADC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 4 (Xinhua) -- The Beijing momentum, which started
four years ago in the Chinese capital, continues to strengthen in
the southern African region as gender activists intensify their
lobby for equality and women's advancement, the Southern African
Development Community (SADC) Gender Monitor said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"Four years since the largest gathering of women in history,
the flame that was lit at Beijing is still burning around the
world. For southern Africa, the flame was activated with the
signing of the Gender and Development Declaration at the Southern
African Development Community summit in Malawi in 1997," said SADC
Gender Monitor, a forthcoming bulletin by the SADC Gender Unit in
collaboration with Women in Development Southern African Awareness
Program of the Southern African Research and Documentation Center.
</P>
<P>
The Gender Monitor is an annual publication which aims to track
and highlight progress on the implementation of pledges made at
the Fourth World Conference on Women held in China in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Soon after the Beijing conference, a Regional Gender Advisory
Committee held several workshops and drew up strategies for
networking as a region to implement the Plan of Action.
</P>
<P>
The SADC region identified four critical areas of concern
namely human rights, economic empowerment, power sharing and
decision-making and institutional mechanisms. It is these areas
as well as those of national priority that SADC governments and
women's organizations are striving to improve to ensure that women
achieve equality with men, the Monitor said.
</P>
<P>
As a result of the signing of the historical Gender and
Development Declaration by SADC heads of state in Malawi in 1997,
a Gender Unit was established at the SADC Secretariat in Gaborone,
Botswana, in 1998, to coordinate the mainstreaming of gender
issues into the SADC program of action and community-building
initiative.
</P>
<P>
In September of the same year, SADC leaders signed an addendum
to the declaration on violence at the 1998 summit in Mauritius.
The addendum calls for the eradication of some of the traditional
norms and religious beliefs, practices and stereotypes that
legitimatize the persistence and tolerance of violence against
women and children, the Monitor said.
</P>
<P>
Expressing their commitment to gender equality, the SADC
governments pledged to put in place regional policies, programs
and mechanisms to enhance the security and empowerment of women,
it said.

NAIROBI, March 4 (Xinhua) -- A textbook named Let Peace Begin
with Me is popular in some Somali primary schools, where children
who suffered the scourge of war receive basic eduction now with
the help of the regional office of the United Nations Educational,
Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO).
</P>
<P>
The textbook is the core of the Peace Education Program
sponsored by the UNESCO's Regional Program of Education for
Emergencies, Communications and Culture of Peace (PEER). The book
includes 38 activities based on five themes, namely "living with
ourselves", "learning to live together", "communication", "seeds
of peace" and "toward peace".
</P>
<P>
Syllabi and textbooks are being renewed or developed for the
primary schools in Somalia, which is a top priority in 1999,
Director Nureldin Satti of the PEER said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The PEER is determined to consolidate the implementation of
ongoing projects and start new projects in the field of civic
education, environmental education as well as culture of peace in
the Horn of Africa, the Great Lakes region and Central Africa,
Satti said.
</P>
<P>
Satti emphasized that the agency is committed to helping more
widows and orphans in the area to get basic eduction and
providing more courses on peace for them.
</P>
<P>
The activities sponsored by the PEER will also support people
in the private sector such as printers and book publishers, Satti
added.
</P>
<P>
According to the 1998 Annual Report of the PEER, the agency
has designed the peace education program that can be integrated
into the primary school curriculum.
</P>
<P>
The teaching method of the program encourages participatory
learning and is designed to build children's self-esteem as well
as respect of others, the report said.
</P>
<P>
UNESCO PEER was established in Somalia in 1993 when the eyes of
the world were focused on the tragic events in the country. In
1995 PEER program moved to Nairobi, where it continues its
mandate of supporting the education in the region.

<HEADLINE> S. African Envoys to Be Hamstrung by Budget Cut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 4 (Xinhua) -- South African Foreign
Minister Alfred Nzo warned Thursday that continuous budget cuts
would handicap South African envoys abroad.
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Ministry's budget had declined from 1,289 million
rand (215 million U.S. dollars) in the 1997/98 financial year to
1,137 million rand (190 million dollars) in the next financial
year, Nzo told parliament.
</P>
<P>
Taking into account the sharp devaluation of rand last year,
the ministry's budget had shrunk by 232 million rand (38.7 million
dollars) over the last two years, South African Press Association
quoted Nzo as saying.
</P>
<P>
Introducing debate on his budget vote, Nzo said South African
diplomats would not be able to serve the country's best interests
if the budget cuts continue.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Nzo repeatedly called for more funds for his
ministry, saying it is impossible to maintain standard of work
with limited input. Budget restraints had forced the ministry to
close more than ten consulates and offices abroad.
</P>
<P>
He said South Africa had made it its mission to ensure that the
needs of Africa were not ignored on the international stage.
</P>
<P>
Economic ties between South Africa and the rest of the
continent had more than doubled, from 10.9 billion rand (1.8
billion dollars) in trade volume in 1994 to 25.3 billion rand (4.2

<HEADLINE> Portuguese Living in Angola Wish to Go Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, March 4 (Xinhua) -- About 200 Portuguese citizens
living in Angola, mostly the elderly, women and children, Thursday
expressed their wish to return to their homeland due to the
escalating civil war in the southern African country.
</P>
<P>
Jose Manuel Bires, spokesman of the organization of overseas
Portuguese here, said these people live mainly in Chinguar and
Camacupa cities in the central Bie Province, where the fighting
between government army and the opposition National Union for the
Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) is the most fierce.
</P>
<P>
Most of their properties have been destroyed in the war and
they are now wandering around in Kuito, capital of the province.
</P>
<P>
Bires noted that these Portuguese are now in a very difficult
situation, with some suffering hunger while others in
mal-nutrition, making little difference from refugees.
</P>
<P>
He appealed to the Portuguese embassy in Angola to provide
these people with urgent relief and pay for their air fare to go
home.
</P>
<P>
Portugal used to be the former colonial ruler of Angola, with
its overseas citizens reaching 600,000 at one time. Many
Portuguese have returned home since Angola gained independence in
1975. But there still remain some 20,000 people.

WASHINGTON, March 4 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank approved on
Thursday a credit of 21 million U.S. dollars for the Electricity
Transmission and Distribution Project in Armenia.
</P>

The credit will be used to improve measurement and
accountability of electricity and revenue flows between
generation, transmission, and distribution companies, and within
the Yerevan Distribution Company, the bank said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The project also will reduce technical losses in the
electricity transmission and Yerevan Distribution Company, and

<HEADLINE> Minister Calls for Protection of S. African </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 4 (Xinhua) -- South African Agriculture
Minister Derek Hanekom Thursday called for adequate protection of
South African farmers against "damaging competition" from outside
the country.
</P>
<P>
While South Africa fought to lower overseas trade barriers, it
should also ensure domestic agriculture did not suffer from
damaging competition, South African Press Association quoted
Hanekom as saying in parliament.
</P>
<P>
The call was made at a time when the conclusion of a key free
trade agreement between South Africa and the European Union (EU)
seems in sight.
</P>
<P>
The deal, yet to be approved by the EU council of ministers,
seeks to open the EU market to 95 percent of South African exports
over ten years, and in return South Africa should allow free
access of 86 percent of EU exports over 12 years.
</P>
<P>
Hanekom said although the proposed trade pact would greatly
benefit South African farmers, it would also bring harsh
competition into the farming sector.
</P>
<P>
South Africa should use permissible measures, such as tariff
levels and quotas, to shield its domestic agriculture "in the
national interest", Hanekom said.
</P>
<P>
South African farmers are generally not subsidized while many
EU countries provide high subsidies to their farming product.
Tariffs on agricultural products have sparked some of the most
heated debate in the South African-EU negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Hanekom said the government's biggest challenge was to lift
rural poverty, and farming should be at the forefront of
government efforts to increase rural income.

<HEADLINE> Supporting Terrorism Not Help Solve Cyprus Issue: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Supporting terrorism by Greece and
Cyprus against Turkey will do no help to resolve the Cyprus
issue, a Turkish official said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Ministry deputy spokesman Sermet Atacanli told a press
conference that "without doubt, the support given to terrorism by
Greece and the Greek Cypriot administration, shows how insincere
they are in their search for a peaceful solution to the Cyprus
question."
</P>
<P>
Noting that Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan was carrying a
Greek Cypriot passport when he was captured, Atacanli said that
"such behaviors do nothing but increase the lack of confidence
which has already existed between the two countries."
</P>
<P>
"The Greek Cypriot administration, like Greece, must also stop
supporting terrorism," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that all existing problems between Turkey and Greece
should be solved by official talks and Turkey had made concrete
proposals to solve its problems with Greece, but Greece was never
cooperative.
</P>
<P>
Ocalan was arrested by Turkish commandos on February 15 in
Kenya, where he had been hiding in the Greek Embassy in Nairobi,
and was now being held captive in a jail on the Imrali Island in
Marmara Sea near Turkey's western province of Bursa.
</P>
<P>
He is to stand trial for leading the outlawed Kurdish Workers'
Party (PKK) in waging a 15-year war for independence in
southeastern Turkey that has claimed over 37,000 lives.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese former oil minister Shahe
Barsomian and former director-general of the Oil Ministry Nicolas
Nasr were taken into custody on Thursday for investigation into
alleged corruption cases.
</P>
<P>
The detention was ordered by Magistrate Khaled Hammound, a
public prosecutor for financial fraud, following the questioning
of several Lebanese oil companies' executives in the past two
days.
</P>
<P>
Barsomian was questioned in connection with a unlawful oil
deal and on charges of squandering public funds.
</P>
<P>
He is the first minister to be detained on suspicion of
corruption in the Lebanese judicial history.
</P>
<P>
Barsomian is suspected of having approved the selling of crude
oil at the low price of oil residues when he served as oil
minister in the previous government, which ended its mandate two
months ago.
</P>
<P>
His driver was also hauled into custody for hiding
information.
</P>
<P>
Nasr was detained as he allegedly charged a state-owned oil
refinery 250 U.S. dollars a month to pay for his housekeeper and
other amounts to pay for his and his family's health care costs,
according judicial sources.
</P>
<P>
The investigation into the ministry's former officials was

<HEADLINE> Egypt to Form Experts Committee on Atomic Energy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Egypt has decided to set up a
committee of experts for the peaceful use of atomic energy,
Minister of Electricity and Energy Maher Abaza said here on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Abaza made the remarks at a press conference held with
Director-General of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)
Mohamad El-Baradei.
</P>
<P>
He said that Prime Minister Kamal El-Ganzouri has agreed on the
formation of the committee grouping ministries involved in the
peaceful use of atomic energy.
</P>
<P>
The committee is aimed at laying down a system for cooperation
with IAEA, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
Experts in atomic energy are preparing a comparative study on
the most appropriate means of providing energy in Egypt up to the
year 2020 through a 200,000-U.S.-dollar aid offered by IAEA, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Egypt inaugurated in February 1998 a 22-megawatt nuclear
reactor, which was built with Argentine aid and technical
assistance, at Inshas, 120 kilometers north of Cairo.
</P>
<P>
The reactor, the second in Egypt, has 11 times the output of
its first Russian-built one, which went into operation in 1961.
The new reactor helps the country's health care system by
producing cobalt-60 radiotherapy.
</P>
<P>
El-Baradei praised the exceptional capability and know-how of
Egyptian atomic energy experts in the application of nuclear
energy for peaceful purposes.
</P>
<P>
His agency has reached an agreement with the concerned
organizations in Egypt on cooperation in the application of atomic
energy in search for subterranean water for land reclamation and
water desalination, he said.
</P>
<P>
El-Baradei arrived here on the weekend to attend a seminar
under the theme of "nuclear energy, its peaceful application in
the 21st century," co-sponsored by IAEA and the Arab League.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Rejects to Amend Cease-fire Pact </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon on Thursday rejected an
Israeli proposal to amend the cease-fire agreement signed in 1996
between the two countries, the official National News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
"Lebanon is committed to the April Understanding in letter and
spirit and rejects any change in the mandate and mechanism of the
Monitoring Group," said Lebanese Prime Minister Salim Hoss while
meeting with Lebanese delegation chairman to the group Mahir
Toufeili.
</P>
<P>
Hoss made the remarks in response to Israeli Defense Minister
Moshe Arens' initiative to make some amendments to the pact in a
bid to enable the Israeli army to strike at Lebanon's anti-Israeli
group Hezbollah, or Party of God.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-brokered understanding, which ended a massive Israeli
bombing blitz that claimed more than 200 Lebanese lives in April,
1996, prohibits attacks on civilians or civilian areas on both
sides of the Lebanese-Israeli border.
</P>
<P>
Arens said the deal created a situation in which Hezbollah
guerrillas are free to launch attacks on Israeli targets in south
Lebanon while the Israeli army is denied to attack Hezbollah
bases because most of them are situated in villages.
</P>
<P>
Israel often complained to the Monitoring Group consisted of
representative from Israel, Lebanon, Syria, France and the United
States, that Hezbollah fired mortar or rockets on Israeli
outposts from Lebanese villages.
</P>
<P>
Arens produced the idea two days after Israel waged a massive
offensive against Hezbollah guerrillas in retaliation for the
killing of four Israelis, including a general, on February 28 in
south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a self-proclaimed security zone in south Lebanon
in 1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its north from
cross-border attacks by Lebanese guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Lebanon's resistance movement spearheaded by
Hezbollah has been fighting to drive Israeli troops out of the
country.

<HEADLINE> Palestinians Stress Firm Stance on Statehood </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Speaker of the Palestinian
Legislative Council Ahmed Qureia said stressed Thursday the
Palestinians' firm stance on declaration of an independent state
on May 4.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Egypt's Voice of Arab radio, Qureia said
the stance is based on the resolve and determination of the
Palestinian people.
</P>
<P>
Qureia underlined that May 4 is a date enshrined in the
Palestinian-Israeli Oslo Accord in 1993 to end a five-year interim
Palestinian self-rule in the West Bank and Gaza, and a permanent
peace deal between the two sides should be signed by the deadline.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat announced that he
will declare an independent Palestinian state on May 4 regardless
of the results of the peace talks with Israel. Arafat is striving
to rally international support for the Palestinian cause.
</P>
<P>
Israel, however, opposes the possible Palestinian move,
threatening to take tough actions against the unilateral step,
including annexation of parts of the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Qureia also stressed in the interview that the Palestinians
reject Israel's procrastination of signed agreements and its
Jewish settlement construction on the occupied Palestinian land.
</P>
<P>
He urged Israel to honor its commitments under the signed
agreements.
</P>
<P>
The peace process between Israel and the Palestinians was
derailed in early December when Israel put on hold the
implementation of the Wye accord signed last October in Washington.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, Israel should have pulled out its troops
from another 13 percent of the West Bank by the end of January.

<HEADLINE> Jordan, IMF Agree on New Reform Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Jordan and the Internatinal
Monetary Fund (IMF) have finalized discussions on a new
three-year reform program to reschedule the debt servicing and
bring down the budget deficit of the desert kingdom.
</P>
<P>
The new package, which is underpinned by an estimated 150
million U.S. dollars a year in IMF financing, is expected
to receive final approval from the IMF board and the
Jordanian government.
</P>
<P>
Reforms pledged by the Jordanian government under the new IMF
aid package include trade and tax reforms, tariff reductions and
tight fiscal restraint to keep the budget deficit below the
IMF-targeted seven percent.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, the budget deficit of Jordan grew nearly to 10
percent, well above the IMF-set 3.5 percent. Coupled with a sharp
slowdown of economic growth, the Jordanian government was forced
to extend a 10-year program with the IMF which ended in February.
</P>
<P>
Jordan's new three-year program with the IMF will help
reschedule the kingdom's debt payment, which has become a major
burden for the kingdom after its foreign debts amounted to
some 6.8 billion dollars in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Government officials hold out the hope that the new IMF aid
program will usher in a higher economic growth and encourage
foreign investment and bring down the two-digit unemployment
rate.

ABU DHABI, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Gulf Arab foreign ministers on
Thursday condemned Iran's naval exercises near the contested
islands of Abu Musa and Greater and Lesser Tunbs and called for a
peaceful solution to the territorial dispute.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued at the end of an emergency meeting of
Gulf Cooperation Council here called by the United Arab Emirates,
the ministers urged Iran to immediately halt "provocative actions
that threaten the security and stability of the Gulf."
</P>
<P>
Iran began nine days of military exercises, code-named
"Fateh-77," on February 27 near the islands close to the strategic
Strait of Hormuz. The islands are claimed both by Iran and the UAE.
</P>
<P>
"This represents a source of grave concern that would not in
anyway help confidence building and a violation of the UAE
sovereignty as well as an attempt by Iran to bolster its
occupation of the three islands," the statement said.

town hall and an educational center on the island of Abu Musa by
Iran on February 5.
</P>
<P>
The ministers affirmed their rejection of "continued Iranian
occupation" of the three islands, stressing again the UAE's full
sovereignty over the islands, according to WAM, UAE's official

The ministers cited initiatives and true desire shown by the
UAE and other GCC states in order to remove obstacles and
establish close relations with Iran.

"Iran has responded to this approach by more consolidation of
its occupation and flagrant violation of the UAE sovereignty. It

<HEADLINE> Israel's Labor Party Broadens Campaign Slate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Israel's opposition Labor Party
broadened its coalition for the May elections on Thursday,
ratifying agreements which will bring former dovish Foreign
Minister David Levy into an umbrella list called One Israel.
</P>
<P>
According to the agreements, Levy's Gesher party and the
moderate religious faction Meimad will run together with Labor on
a united list.
</P>
<P>
The deal gave Levy the No. 3 slot on the alliance's list for
the next Knesset (Parliament), following Labor leader Ehud Barak
and former Prime Minister Shimon Peres.
</P>
<P>
This means he will be guaranteed a senior cabinet post if
Barak wins the May 17 elections. His Gesher party was also given
two more slots in the top 30 of the list.
</P>
<P>
For its part, Meimad was given three slots in the top 40 of the
Knesset list and a cabinet post, who will not be a Knesset member.
</P>
<P>
Although opposed by some Labor members who ranked very low on
the party's Knesset list and would be pushed further down by
newcomers, the deal was overwhelmingly approved by Labor's
central committee, Israel radio said.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that the joining of Levy will help Labor win
votes from Sephardic, or Middle Eastern, Jews since he himself is
a Sephardim. Labor's constituency is dominated by Ashkenazim, or
European Jews.
</P>
<P>
And the participation of Meimad in the alliance will help
Labor improve its relations with religious voters. Barak is
regarded by Orthodox Israelis as anti-religious politician.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Calls for Reform of UN Security Council </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 4 (Xinhua) -- South African Foreign
Minister Alfred Nzo Thursday called for the restructuring of the
United Nations (UN) Security Council, South African Press
Association reported.
</P>
<P>
The restructuring and reform of the Security Council was
probably the single most important step to more equitable
international relations, he told the parliament.
</P>
<P>
Nzo repeated his call for the legislators to debate whether
South Africa should serve as a permanent member of the U.N.
Security Council. South Africa has been lobbying support in the
United Nations for it to become a permanent member of the U.N.
Security Council.
</P>
<P>
Egypt and Nigeria also reportedly vied for a permanent position
in the council, each regarding itself as most suitable to
represent the African continent in a reformed security council.
</P>
<P>
Nzo elaborated the government's diplomatic achievements since
it came to power in 1994, indicating that the country is now ready
for a more important role in international affairs.
</P>
<P>
He said Pretoria, the seat of South African government, had
become one of the busiest capitals in the world, with over 126
foreign missions.
</P>
<P>
South Africa had diplomatic relations with almost all countries
of the world and maintained these ties through a network of 90
missions, he said.
</P>

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Calls for Reform of UN Security Council </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 4 (Xinhua) -- South African Foreign
Minister Alfred Nzo Thursday called for the restructuring of the
United Nations (UN) Security Council, South African Press
Association reported.
</P>
<P>
The restructuring and reform of the Security Council was
probably the single most important step to more equitable
international relations, he told the parliament.
</P>
<P>
Nzo repeated his call for the legislators to debate whether
South Africa should serve as a permanent member of the U.N.
Security Council. South Africa has been lobbying support in the
United Nations for it to become a permanent member of the U.N.
Security Council.
</P>
<P>
Egypt and Nigeria also reportedly vied for a permanent position
in the council, each regarding itself as most suitable to
represent the African continent in a reformed security council.
</P>
<P>
Nzo elaborated the government's diplomatic achievements since
it came to power in 1994, indicating that the country is now ready
for a more important role in international affairs.
</P>
<P>
He said Pretoria, the seat of South African government, had
become one of the busiest capitals in the world, with over 126
foreign missions.
</P>
<P>
South Africa had diplomatic relations with almost all countries
of the world and maintained these ties through a network of 90
missions, he said.
</P>
<P>
Since the abolishment of the apartheid system five years ago,
73 foreign heads of state or government had visited South Africa,
while President Nelson Mandela visited 83 foreign countries.
</P>
<P>
"This level and intensity is unsurpassed," Nzo said.

<HEADLINE> 22.8 Percent of S. African Pregnant Women HIV </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 4 (Xinhua) -- An estimated 22.8 percent of
South African women attending antenatal clinics last year were
infected with HIV virus, according to a survey.
</P>
<P>
This translates to approximately 3.6 million South Africans or
8.6 percent of the total population, the Government Communications
and Information Service said in a statement Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"In simple terms, roughly one in eight adult South Africans
were infected with HIV in 1998."
</P>
<P>
For the purpose of the report, an adult is defined as a person
of 14 years or older.
</P>
<P>
The survey, ninth of its kind, was based on 15,301 blood
samples of pregnant women who attended antenatal clinics during
October last year.
</P>
<P>
According to the survey, the overall HIV prevalence increased
by 33.8 percent in 1998 compared with 1997.
</P>
<P>
With special concern is the rapid increase of HIV infection
rate among sexually active teenagers.
</P>
<P>
Prevalence rate in teenage girls (15-19 years) has risen from
12.7 percent in 1997 to 21 percent in 1998. This represents an
increase of 65.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
The survey also found a high increase in HIV prevalence among
women in the twenties, with 26.1 percent and 26.9 percent for the
20-24 and 25-29 age groups respectively.
</P>
<P>
KwaZulu-Natal in the east of the country, is still the province
with the highest HIV infection rate with 32.2 percent, followed by
Mpumalanga in the northeast with 30 percent.

<HEADLINE> Jordanian King Names New Prime Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Jordan's new King Abdullah Bin
Hussein has asked a veteran politician, Abdul-Raouf Rawabdeh, to
form a new government in the first major shakeup since King
Hussein died a month ago.
</P>
<P>
Rawabdeh, 60, held several cabinet posts during the past three
decades, including his first transportation portfolio in 1976. He
is known for his liberal outlook and a supporter of Jordan's 1994
peace treaty with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Rawabdeh has taken over the reign of the government from Prime
Minister Fayez Tarawneh who is expected to formally tender his
resignation to King Abdullah later Thursday, the Jordanian News
Agency Petra reported.
</P>
<P>
The Tarawneh-led government has been blamed by the media and
the public for a stagnant economic growth, a two-digit
unemployment rate, poor efficiency and rampant corruptions after
it came to power seven months ago.
</P>
<P>
The former government was set up on August 20, 1998 following
the resignation of the Majali cabinet, triggered by a serious
widespread water contamination scandal in Amman which saw dozens
of residents hospitalized.
</P>
<P>
The new monarch Abdullah, 37, is seen as apparently following
the traditional policy, though not written in law books, that a
government should step down following the proclamation of a new
king.
</P>
<P>
Newspapers in Amman had been preparing the public for a
possible power change in the government, clamoring that the
resignation of the Tarawneh government was a matter of days or at
most weeks after Abdullah acceded to the throne on February 7,
hours after his father Hussein died of cancer.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah has the constitutional rights to dissolve or form
governments.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria to Address Problems in Oil-Producing Area </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABUJA, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian Head of State General
Abdulsalami Abubakar announced Thursday that his government had
set up a 22-member committee to review the development options in
the country's oil-producing Niger Delta area.
</P>
<P>
The Niger Delta area in southeastern Nigeria is the source of
the country's oil wealth and has recently been the scene of
violent protests by various communities in the area, especially in
Rivers and Bayelsa states.
</P>
<P>
Inaugurating the committee, the head of state said the
committee members include the administrators of the nine oil
producing states of the area as well as the ministers of
education, water resources, power and steel, works and housing.
</P>
<P>
Abubakar said the latest government initiatives targeted at
addressing the infrastructural inadequacies in rural Nigeria as
well as the oil producing area development commission had not met
this need.
</P>
<P>
Abubakar who is to hand over power to president-elect Olusegun
Obasanjo on May 29 noted that the latest attempt was part of the
government' s campaign to satisfy the development aspirations of
the area by resolving such problems as unemployment and lack of
infrastructure cited by the protesters.
</P>
<P>
"The government is determined to stem the tide of ceaseless
violence and threat to lives and property in the area following
incessant complaints of neglect and deprivation," he added.
</P>
<P>
The Niger Delta area has been racked by violent protests,
mostly by the ethnic Ijaw youths, hundreds of whom lost their
lives in clashes with Nigerian security personnel in December last
year in Bayelsa State.
</P>
<P>
The clashes forced the Nigerian government to postpone the
December local government elections in that state for fear that
the youths would disrupt the exercise.
</P>
<P>
Oil was first produced for export in Oloibiri in Bayelsa State
in 1957. Since then, the area has provided most of the country's
oil export.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon to Kick off Privatization Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, March 4 (Xinhua) -- The Lebanese government is
considering privatizing state-run companies in the next few months
in a bid to get more revenues to trim the ballooning public debt.
</P>
<P>
The country's ailing national flag carrier Middle East
Airlines (MEA) would most likely be the first to go on sale,
government sources said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
A special committee, consisted of top officials and experts
from the Central Bank and the Ministry of Transport and Public
Works, would be formed soon to prepare a report on MEA's possible
sell-off, the sources added.
</P>
<P>
The MEA, which is almost exclusively owned by the Central Bank,
has been running at a yearly loss of 30 to 40 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The privatization initiative was pushed forward when the
government led by Prime Minister Salim Hoss, at the helm for two
months, failed to resolve the huge public debt problem it
inherited from the former government.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon's public debt stood at around 18 billion U.S. dollars
at the end of last year, more than the country's gross domestic
product.
</P>
<P>
The Minister of Economy, Trade and Industry Nasser Saidi had
said that about 2.2 billion dollars were spent every year to cover
the interests of the debts.
</P>
<P>
He hoped that all of the proceeds from privatization will go to
address the debt issue.
</P>
<P>
However, economists here pointed out that the number of
state-owned companies to be offered to the private sectors was
limited and thus are barely enough for the debt relief.

LONDON, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Wall Street's strong showing
boosted European markets Thursday, but the high spirits were
tempered by uncertainty ahead of the release of key U.S. economic
data Friday.
</P>
<P>
The FTSE 100 Index closed up 53.1 points at 6,101.4, having hit
lows 26.9 under the previous close.
</P>
<P>
But trading was slow as the City counted the days to the Budget
and awaited the late announcement on base rates from the European
Central Bank.
</P>
<P>
Upwards pressure on the Footsie came from oil stocks after the
recent hardening of crude prices.
</P>
<P>
BP Amoco jumped 45p to 902p, helped by being tipped by brokers
at Lehman Brothers as the top European oil stock for the year.
</P>
<P>
German shares were firmer, supported by bargain hunting after
recent market weakness. The Xetra Dax ended up more than 1
percent, or 54 points higher, at 4,722.69.
</P>
<P>
But dealers are still cautious over the market's outlook. Some
of the dealers said expectations of rising interest rates in the
U.S. will continue to keep the German stock market under pressure
amid worries that the U.S. stock market could fall if investors
move into bonds.
</P>
<P>
Paris stocks ended higher on the day, after opening more
strongly than other European bourses. The Cac 40 was up 2 percent,
or 83 points, to 4,088.

<HEADLINE> GCC Condemns Iran's Naval Drill in Disputed Islands </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Gulf Arab foreign ministers on
Thursday condemned Iran's naval exercises near the contested
islands of Abu Musa and Greater and Lesser Tunbs and called for a
peaceful solution to the territorial dispute.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued at the end of an emergency meeting of
Gulf Cooperation Council here called by the United Arab Emirates,
the ministers urged Iran to immediately halt "provocative actions
that threaten the security and stability of the Gulf."
</P>
<P>
Iran began nine days of military exercises, code-named
"Fateh-77," on February 27 near the islands close to the strategic
Strait of Hormuz. The islands are claimed both by Iran and the UAE.
</P>
<P>
"This represents a source of grave concern that would not in
anyway help confidence building and a violation of the UAE
sovereignty as well as an attempt by Iran to bolster its
occupation of the three islands," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The foreign ministers of Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar, Oman, Saudi
Arabia and the UAE were also referring the reported opening of a
town hall and an educational center on the island of Abu Musa by
Iran on February 5.
</P>
<P>
The ministers affirmed their rejection of "continued Iranian
occupation" of the three islands, stressing again the UAE's full
sovereignty over the islands, according to WAM, UAE's official
news agency.
</P>
<P>
The ministers cited initiatives and true desire shown by the
UAE and other GCC states in order to remove obstacles and
establish close relations with Iran.
</P>
<P>
"Iran has responded to this approach by more consolidation of
its occupation and flagrant violation of the UAE sovereignty. It
has also gone further by turning the three islands into military
areas," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"This has become a source of grave concern to the GCC states
and shows a contradiction between Iranian words and actions," said
the ministers.
</P>
<P>
They urged Iran to respond positively to the "sincere and
serious calls of the UAE for resolving the dispute through
peaceful means as dictated by the international law and
conventions and by holding direct negotiations or resorting to the
International Court of Justice.
</P>
<P>
Iran has been striving to improve relations with the Gulf Arab
countries, but its dispute with the UAE over the three islands
remain a big obstacle.

<HEADLINE> Israel's Labor Party Broadens Campaign Slate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Israel's opposition Labor Party
broadened its coalition for the May elections on Thursday,
ratifying agreements which will bring former dovish Foreign
Minister David Levy into an umbrella list called One Israel.
</P>
<P>
According to the agreements, Levy's Gesher party and the
moderate religious faction Meimad will run together with Labor on
a united list.
</P>
<P>
The deal gave Levy the No. 3 slot on the alliance's list for
the next Knesset (Parliament), following Labor leader Ehud Barak
and former Prime Minister Shimon Peres.
</P>
<P>
This means he will be guaranteed a senior cabinet post if
Barak wins the May 17 elections. His Gesher party was also given
two more slots in the top 30 of the list.
</P>
<P>
For its part, Meimad was given three slots in the top 40 of the
Knesset list and a cabinet post, who will not be a Knesset member.
</P>
<P>
Although opposed by some Labor members who ranked very low on
the party's Knesset list and would be pushed further down by
newcomers, the deal was overwhelmingly approved by Labor's
central committee, Israel radio said.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that the joining of Levy will help Labor win
votes from Sephardic, or Middle Eastern, Jews since he himself is
a Sephardim. Labor's constituency is dominated by Ashkenazim, or
European Jews.
</P>
<P>
And the participation of Meimad in the alliance will help
Labor improve its relations with religious voters. Barak is
regarded by Orthodox Israelis as anti-religious politician.

<P>
The new monarch Abdullah, 37, is seen as apparently following
the traditional policy, though not written in law books, that a
government should step down following the proclamation of a new
king.
</P>
<P>
Newspapers in Amman had been preparing the public for a
possible power change in the government, clamoring that the
resignation of the Tarawneh government was a matter of days or at
most weeks after Abdullah acceded to the throne on February 7,
hours after his father Hussein died of cancer.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah has the constitutional rights to dissolve or form
governments.

<P>
The semi-official Anatolia News Agency reported that the woman

<HEADLINE> GCC Condemns Iran's Naval Drill in Disputed Islands </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Gulf Arab foreign ministers on
Thursday condemned Iran's naval exercises near the contested
islands of Abu Musa and Greater and Lesser Tunbs and called for a
peaceful solution to the territorial dispute.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued at the end of an emergency meeting of
Gulf Cooperation Council here called by the United Arab Emirates,
the ministers urged Iran to immediately halt "provocative actions
that threaten the security and stability of the Gulf."
</P>
<P>
Iran began nine days of military exercises, code-named
"Fateh-77," on February 27 near the islands close to the strategic
Strait of Hormuz. The islands are claimed both by Iran and the UAE.
</P>
<P>
"This represents a source of grave concern that would not in
anyway help confidence building and a violation of the UAE
sovereignty as well as an attempt by Iran to bolster its
occupation of the three islands," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The foreign ministers of Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar, Oman, Saudi
Arabia and the UAE were also referring the reported opening of a
town hall and an educational center on the island of Abu Musa by
Iran on February 5.
</P>
<P>
The ministers affirmed their rejection of "continued Iranian
occupation" of the three islands, stressing again the UAE's full
sovereignty over the islands, according to WAM, UAE's official
news agency.
</P>
<P>
The ministers cited initiatives and true desire shown by the
UAE and other GCC states in order to remove obstacles and
establish close relations with Iran.
</P>
<P>
"Iran has responded to this approach by more consolidation of
its occupation and flagrant violation of the UAE sovereignty. It
has also gone further by turning the three islands into military
areas," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"This has become a source of grave concern to the GCC states
and shows a contradiction between Iranian words and actions," said
the ministers.
</P>
<P>
They urged Iran to respond positively to the "sincere and
serious calls of the UAE for resolving the dispute through
peaceful means as dictated by the international law and
conventions and by holding direct negotiations or resorting to the
International Court of Justice.
</P>
<P>
Iran has been striving to improve relations with the Gulf Arab
countries, but its dispute with the UAE over the three islands
remain a big obstacle.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese Senior Officials Detained on Corruption </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese former oil minister Shahe
Barsomian and former director-general of the Oil Ministry Nicolas
Nasr were taken into custody on Thursday for investigation into
alleged corruption cases.
</P>
<P>
The detention was ordered by Magistrate Khaled Hammound, a
public prosecutor for financial fraud, following the questioning
of several Lebanese oil companies' executives in the past two
days.
</P>
<P>
Barsomian was questioned in connection with a unlawful oil
deal and on charges of squandering public funds.
</P>
<P>
He is the first minister to be detained on suspicion of
corruption in the Lebanese judicial history.
</P>
<P>
Barsomian is suspected of having approved the selling of crude
oil at the low price of oil residues when he served as oil
minister in the previous government, which ended its mandate two
months ago.
</P>
<P>
His driver was also hauled into custody for hiding
information.
</P>
<P>
Nasr was detained as he allegedly charged a state-owned oil
refinery 250 U.S. dollars a month to pay for his housekeeper and
other amounts to pay for his and his family's health care costs,
according judicial sources.
</P>
<P>
The investigation into the ministry's former officials was
carried out two months ago.

<HEADLINE> Supporting Terrorism Not Help Solve Cyprus Issue: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Supporting terrorism by Greece and
Cyprus against Turkey will do no help to resolve the Cyprus
issue, a Turkish official said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Ministry deputy spokesman Sermet Atacanli told a press
conference that "without doubt, the support given to terrorism by
Greece and the Greek Cypriot administration, shows how insincere
they are in their search for a peaceful solution to the Cyprus
question."
</P>
<P>
Noting that Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan was carrying a
Greek Cypriot passport when he was captured, Atacanli said that
"such behaviors do nothing but increase the lack of confidence
which has already existed between the two countries."
</P>
<P>
"The Greek Cypriot administration, like Greece, must also stop
supporting terrorism," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that all existing problems between Turkey and Greece
should be solved by official talks and Turkey had made concrete
proposals to solve its problems with Greece, but Greece was never
cooperative.
</P>
<P>
Ocalan was arrested by Turkish commandos on February 15 in
Kenya, where he had been hiding in the Greek Embassy in Nairobi,
and was now being held captive in a jail on the Imrali Island in
Marmara Sea near Turkey's western province of Bursa.
</P>
<P>
He is to stand trial for leading the outlawed Kurdish Workers'
Party (PKK) in waging a 15-year war for independence in
southeastern Turkey that has claimed over 37,000 lives.

<HEADLINE> Egypt to Form Experts Committee on Atomic Energy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Egypt has decided to set up a
committee of experts for the peaceful use of atomic energy,
Minister of Electricity and Energy Maher Abaza said here on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Abaza made the remarks at a press conference held with
Director-General of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)
Mohamad El-Baradei.
</P>
<P>
He said that Prime Minister Kamal El-Ganzouri has agreed on the
formation of the committee grouping ministries involved in the
peaceful use of atomic energy.
</P>
<P>
The committee is aimed at laying down a system for cooperation
with IAEA, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
Experts in atomic energy are preparing a comparative study on
the most appropriate means of providing energy in Egypt up to the
year 2020 through a 200,000-U.S.-dollar aid offered by IAEA, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Egypt inaugurated in February 1998 a 22-megawatt nuclear
reactor, which was built with Argentine aid and technical
assistance, at Inshas, 120 kilometers north of Cairo.
</P>
<P>
The reactor, the second in Egypt, has 11 times the output of
its first Russian-built one, which went into operation in 1961.
The new reactor helps the country's health care system by
producing cobalt-60 radiotherapy.
</P>
<P>
El-Baradei praised the exceptional capability and know-how of
Egyptian atomic energy experts in the application of nuclear
energy for peaceful purposes.
</P>
<P>
His agency has reached an agreement with the concerned
organizations in Egypt on cooperation in the application of atomic
energy in search for subterranean water for land reclamation and
water desalination, he said.
</P>
<P>
El-Baradei arrived here on the weekend to attend a seminar
under the theme of "nuclear energy, its peaceful application in
the 21st century," co-sponsored by IAEA and the Arab League.

<HEADLINE> Angola Asks Belgium to Aid in Mining </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Angola hopes that Belgium could
provide technical cooperation to assist it in its mining industry,
 Angolan Minister of Geology and Mines Manuel Bunge said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Bunge expressed his hope when meeting with the Belgian
Ambassador to Angola, Leon Doyan here, briefing him on Angola's
1998/2000 development plan on mineral industry.
</P>
<P>
Bunge said Angola needs advanced foreign technology to overcome
the difficulties in the industry and that Belgium should, like it
does with some other African countries, offer help to Angola,
which abounds in mineral resources,

especially diamond.
</P>
<P>
Doyan said Belgian mineral companies are very interested in
cooperating with Angolan firms in this field, adding that Belgium
has great investment in the Democratic Republic of Congo,
controlling development in diamond, copper and gold industries in
the country.
</P>
<P>
On diamond smuggling by the National Union for the Total
Independence of Angola (UNITA), the Belgian ambassador said that
his government is taking measures to curb possible diamond
smuggling by UNITA through Belgian firms.
</P>
<P>
The Angolan government has for several times accused some
European companies of buying diamond from UNITA, thus providing
the rebel group with money for waging the civil war.
</P>
<P>
Angola is an important diamond producer in Africa. It produced
about two million carat of diamond, worth 450 million U.S.
Dollars, by the government-controled mines alone in 1998.

<P>
MAPUTO, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Robert Mcnamara, Chairman of the
Political Forum of the Global Coalition for Africa reiterated
Thursday his organization's continued support of the
anti-corruption effort in Africa, including Mozambique.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference here, Mcnamara said that African
leaders have been paying great attention to the struggle against
corruption these years, knowing that corruption is the root cause
of poverty and weakening in the relationship between the
government and the people, and that corruption affects the
development of their countries greatly.
</P>
<P>
TMcnamara said Mozambique is the seventh African country he
visits with an aim of anti-corruption, but he did not specify the
other six countries he has visited.
</P>
<P>
Taking the former Zaire, Nigeria and Indonesia as examples,
Mcnamara said that corruption has become a fatal disease to a
country's development.
</P>
<P>
Global Coalition for Africa sponsored a meeting in Holland in
1995 designed to discuss issues concerning the development of
member countries of the Organization of Ecomonic Cooperation and
Development, but it turned out to be a meeting focusing on the
discussion of corruption, Mcnamara said.
</P>
<P>
Global Coalition for Africa also discussed corruption at
several other occasions, Mcnamara said.
</P>
<P>
He mentioned the 1997 meeting in Maputo, which was attended by
some African leaders. The anti-corruption measures passed at the
meeting demanded among others, transparency in appointing
government officials, in financing activities, formation of
anti-corruption structures and encouraging the media to expose
corruption cases, etc.

<P>
BEIJING, March 5 (Xinhua) -- The Second Session of the Ninth
National People's Congress (NPC) which was attended by 2,869
deputies including top Party and state leaders including Jiang
Zemin, Li Peng, Zhu Rongji, Li Ruihuan, Hu Jintao, Wei Jianxing,
Li Lanqing, was inaugurated in the Chinese capital Friday. The
highlights of Xinhua reports on the first day of the annual NPC
session are as follows:
</P>
<P>
-- Premier Zhu Rongji Delivers Government Work Report
</P>
<P>
At the opening of the new NPC session, Premier Zhu Rongji
delivered a 32-page and 15,000 -Chinese characters report on the
work of the government in 1998 and put forward general
requirements on the work of the government in 1999.
</P>
<P>
China has scored great achievements in the face of the
complicated and grim economic environment at home and abroad over
the past year, and the targets for reforms and development set at
the beginning of last year were basically attained, said the
Chinese premier in his report.
</P>
<P>
Zhu pledged to continue the efforts to expand domestic demand
and implement a pro- active fiscal policy in 1999, to promote the
reform of state-owned enterprises, to expand exports and attract
more overseas funds, implement the strategies of invigorating
China through science and education and maintaining sustainable
development, and implement the basic principle of rule of law and
building an honest, diligent, pragmatic and efficient government.
</P>
<P>
-- Chinese President Stresses Ethnic Unity
</P>
<P>
In a panel discussion with the deputies from south China's
Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region to attend the current NPC session,
Chinese President and General Secretary of the Communist Party of
China Jiang Zemin said that it is in the fundamental interest of
people of all ethnic groups in China to improve ethnic solidarity,
safeguard national unity and promote common development.
</P>
<P>
He told the legislators, "The entire Party, army and people
across the country must boost confidence, keep unity and work hard
to preserve the current fine situation for reform, development and
stability and achieve new successes for the socialist
modernization drive."
</P>
<P>
Jiang promised that the central government would continue to
give all-out support to poverty-alleviation efforts in Guangxi and
other regions in the central and western parts of China.
</P>
<P>
-- Top Legislator Confident of China's Economy in 1999
</P>
<P>
Li Peng, Chairman of the NPC Standing Committee expressed his
confidence in the country's economy this year, saying that the
targets set for the year may be achieved, when he joined the
Beijing delegation in examining the government work report.
</P>
<P>
He said that there should be a full estimation of the existing
difficulties, referring to the negative impacts of the Asian
financial crisis on China's economy and the challenges and
opportunities the economic globalization poses to the country.
</P>
<P>
State-owned enterprises are the mainstay of the country's
economy and efforts must be made to help them explore good ways of
enterprise reform, he said, urging the city government of the
Chinese capital to mobilize all social organizations to help the
layoffs of state firms get re-employed as soon as possible.

<HEADLINE> Premier's Government Work Report Hailed (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Punctuated by 18 rounds of
applause from the NPC deputies, Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji's
government work report to the 2nd session of the Ninth National
People's Congress (NPC) this morning was hailed by the deputies as
"concise, comprehensive, truthful and pragmatic."
</P>
<P>
"Premier Zhu's report clearly reflected the work style of the
new government," commented Jia Zhijie, Party Secretary of the
central China's Hubei province." The Premier devoted only one
sixth of the report to the achievements, and talked all the
problems, which showed his resolve to overcome them."
</P>
<P>
Another deputy, Li Zhensheng from north China's Shanxi province
said: "there are no empty words, trumpery, and jargons in the
report, and the premier has been truthful in referring to the
achievements, which can be seen from the frequent use of words
such as 'basically' and 'preliminary'."
</P>
<P>
Chai Songyue, governor of east China's Zhejiang province, said
that the report takes expanding domestic demand and following a
pro-active fiscal policy as priorities and this accords with the
current economic situation in China.
</P>
<P>
Wu Shuqing, a professor from the prestigious Beijing University,
pointed out: "China's economy grew 7.8 last year, and this is
unimaginable in other countries given the impact of the Asian
financial crisis and severe summer flooding."
</P>
<P>
The NPC deputies also appreciated the non-evasion about
problems in the report, saying that "Only when the situation is
correctly sized up and problems are discovered, could they be
solved."
</P>
<P>
They added that the report reflected the pragmatic work style
of the new government to address problems such as the sluggish
market, rampant duplication in construction projects, increasing
difficulties of the state enterprises, and heavy burden on farmers.
</P>
<P>
Fan Zengsheng, a Taiwan native, said non-evasion about problems
and difficulties is the most prominent characteristic of the
report. "It illustrated that our government is mature and capable
of taking timely and correct measures to solve all the problems."

from members of the Ninth National Committee of the Chinese People'
s Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), who attended the
session as observers.
</P>
<P>
All agreed that the report is practical, concise and respects
facts.
</P>
<P>
The consensus among members of the CPPCC National Committee is:
that the report uses modest wording to sum up the country's
economic achievements last year; and that achievement of an
economic growth rate of 7.8 percent last year, made against the
growing impact of the Asian financial crisis and severe flooding
in some parts of the country, was quite a feat.
</P>
<P>
"The premier's report is inspiring. Repeated applauses from
the audience reflect the NPC deputies's endorsement of, and
support for, government work,"
said Deng Li, a CPPCC National Committee member and a former
deputy auditor-general.
</P>
<P>
Many members expressed appreciation for the government work
report for its good analysis of existing problems and the many
practical measures it offers for their solution.
</P>
<P>
Said Guo Xizhang, "We are relieved to see that the government
work report fully addresses such issues as farmers' low income,
difficulties of state enterprises and the fight against corruption.
"
</P>
<P>
Xiao Zhuoji, a noted economics professor with the Beijing
University, commented that the growth target suggested in the
report is attainable and leaves some margin, indicating that the
government has a sound understanding of domestic and international
situations.
</P>
<P>
Zha She, a former deputy director of the economic planning
commission of Sichuan Province, said he fully supports the
sustainable development strategy mentioned in the government work
report and suggests the enactment of a law in this regard.
</P>
<P>
Most members said they are impressed with the government's
resolve to wipe out corruption, crack down on crimes and pledge to
build up a clean, honest and highly efficient government.

<HEADLINE> Mekong Countries Discuss Ways to Reduce Malaria Mortality </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Six Mekong countries have decided to
halve malaria deaths in the region by 2010, despite facing a
daunting task of changing people's attitudes both in taking
preventive measures and the right treatment.
</P>
<P>
Representatives from the six countries - China, Myanmar,
Thailand, Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam - discussed ways to reduce
the severe impacts of malaria at a three-day meeting in Ho Chi
Minh City that ended Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The regional anti-malaria fight will be spearheaded by the
Mekong Roll-back Malaria Initiative which aims to bring together
all concerned organizations, promote joint efforts and break down
barriers.
</P>
<P>
Malaria is a major curse for families and communities, and a
constraint on development. A total of 130 million inhabitants of
the six countries are at risk of the disease.
</P>
<P>
Malaria deprives families of much needed income and food and
more than 15,000 die as a result of the disease each year.
</P>
<P>
In Cambodia, Laos and Myanmar, malaria continues to be a major
cause of death of children aged less than five years and of low
nutritional status.
</P>
<P>
The Mekong Roll-back Malaria Initiative will build on
experience gathered within the region, where considerable progress
has been made in reducing the impact of the disease in recent
years.
</P>
<P>
It will encourage prompt and effective treatment and use simple
tests to diagnose malaria so that community-based health workers
can make a reliable diagnosis.
</P>
<P>
The initiative is being developed by governments in the region
to respond to the concerns of all their peoples at risk of
malaria.

<HEADLINE> WTO to Hold Special Meeting on EU-US Banana Dispute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, March 5 (Xinhua) -- The World Trade Organization (WTO)
decided here Friday to hold a special meeting of the General
Council on March 8 to examine trade measures taken by the United
States against the European Union's imports.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was requested by the EU after a U.S. decision on
Thursday to effectively impose provisional tariffs on EU goods
worth of over 500 million U.S. dollars, said WTO Director-General
Renato Ruggiero in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. claimed that the EU's modified banana import regime,
implemented on January 1, 1999, was inconsistent with the WTO
rules.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, a WTO panel said in a vague statement that it
needed additional information to decide if the revised EU banana
import regime was in consistency with the WTO ruling in 1997. It
said that it would issue a final decision soon, probably before
April 12.
</P>
<P>
Also on Tuesday, the WTO set up a panel to examine the United
States' controversial "Section 301" trade law at the EU's request.
</P>
<P>
Section 301 of the U.S. Trade Act was recently used by the U.S.
as the basis of its threat to impose heavy trade sanctions on the
EU in the two sides' dispute over banana imports.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan, Kazakhstan to Enhance Bilateral Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan and Kazakhstan agreed
on Friday to enhance bilateral cooperation in many areas including
banking, aviation, economic and commercial interaction,
people-to-people contact and culture.
</P>
<P>
The agreement came at formal talks held here between visiting
Kazakh Foreign Minister Kasymzhomart Tokaev and his Pakistani
counterpart Sartaj Aziz.
</P>
<P>
Their discussions covered the entire range of bilateral matters
and regional issues of mutual concern, particularly Afghanistan,
said a statement issued by the Pakistani Foreign Office.
</P>
<P>
It was agreed that the fourth session of a joint ministerial
commission between the two countries will be held shortly in
Astana, capital of Kazakhstan.
</P>
<P>
The two foreign ministers noted that with the opening of the
Karakorum highway in May under the Quadrilateral Agreement on
Traffic in Transit, the shortest possible route to the sea would
be available to Kazakhstan.
</P>
<P>
This would give an impetus to the augmentation of bilateral
trade between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The two sides also agreed on the need for restoring durable
peace and stability in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
"This would unlock the enormous potential for economic and
commercial cooperation between Pakistan and Central Asian region,"
the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The two sides emphasized the need to recognize the ground
realities in Afghanistan and expressed the hope that a
multi-ethnic government would emerge through an indigenous peace
process.
</P>
<P>
Tokaev, accompanied by Kazakh businessmen, arrived in Islamabad
Friday morning for a two-day visit to Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
He will proceed to Lahore Saturday where he will hold further
talks on ways to expand bilateral cooperation between the two
countries.

<HEADLINE> NPC Chairman Confident of China's Economy in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 5 (Xinhua)-- China's top lawmaker Li Peng today
expressed his confidence in the country's economy this year,
saying that the targets set for the year may be achieved.
</P>
<P>
The chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's
Congress (NPC) made the remark when he joined the Beijing
delegation in examining the government work report Premier Zhu
Rongji delivered to the 2nd Session of the NPC which opened here
this morning.
</P>
<P>
"China's achievements last year were hard-attained and the
targets set for this year may be reached through our hard work,
and we should be confident of this," Li Peng said.
</P>
<P>
But, he pointed out, at the same time there should be a full
estimation of the existing difficulties.
</P>
<P>
The impact of the Asian financial crisis on China's economy is
still there, and the economic globalization poses challenges as
well as opportunities to China. Moreover, China still lacks a
sound financial management and system, he elaborated.
</P>
<P>
"We should not drop our guard and treat the problems lightly,
but take effective measure to cope with them instead," Li said.
</P>
<P>
Responding to some deputies who discussed the reform of the
state-owned enterprises, he praised Beijing's progress in
reforming such enterprises and stressed that state-owned
enterprises are the mainstay of the country's economy and efforts
must be made to help them explore good ways of enterprise reform.
</P>
<P>
Li pointed out that the environment quality in Beijing is not
ideal and does not comply with its status as the country's capital.
He said all Beijing residents should be mobilized to create a
better environment as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
Many workers from Beijing's state-owned businesses have been
laid off, Li noted, adding that this does not necessarily mean
these people are not skilled nor well educated, but because their
enterprises are not well geared to the market demand.
</P>
<P>
He urged the city government and all social organizations to
help them get re-employed as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
"Beijing has great potential in expanding community services
which may create many job opportunities for the laid-off workers,"
Li added.
</P>
<P>
The commercialization of housing can help boost economy, but
housing prices in Beijing are too high, he said, adding that
central government institutions and the city government should
work out concrete and feasible measures to promote the reform in
this regard.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Remembers Call to "Learn From Lei Feng" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Residents of this economic and
commercial center of China today marked the 36th anniversary of
late Chairman Mao Zedong's call to "Learn from Lei Feng" by
donating blood, cleaning streets and helping others.
</P>
<P>
Lei Feng is China's most famous symbol of selfless sacrifice
for others. He was a squad leader in an army engineering corps in
northeast China and joined the Communist Party of China and the
army in 1960.
</P>
<P>
A total of 391 of the 400-plus employees of the Shanghai branch
of the Ping'an Insurance Company applied to donate blood, and 245
were physically qualified and able to do so.
</P>
<P>
Many others from all walk of life also participated in blood
donations and other activities to mark the special day.
</P>
<P>
Lei Feng, a native of Changsha County, in central China's
Hunan Province, died on August 15, 1962 in a construction accident
at the age of 22. During his short life Lei Feng performed many
good deeds for others.
</P>
<P>
On March 5, 1963, Chairman Mao Zedong wrote the inscription "
Learn from Comrade Lei Feng" as a call to the Chinese people to
learn from this young outstanding soldier.
</P>
<P>
Also today a home page of stories describing the heroic deeds
of Lei Feng was put on-line by Fushun Mass Telecommunications in
northeast China's Liaoning Province.
</P>
<P>
Internet users accessing the page will find many photos of Lei
Feng along with examples of his personal calligraphy, and be able
to hear recordings of speeches before his death and visit
discussion sites at the "Lei Feng Forum" at the website address:

<HEADLINE> Acid Rain Severely Damages Swedish Forestry: Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Severe acid rain damage to
forests in southern Sweden, causes losses of tens of billions of
Swedish kronor, a survey conducted by the Lund University of
Sweden shows.
</P>
<P>
In the 1980s, half of the forests in southern Sweden were
assaulted by acid rains exceeding relevant standards, according to
results of the survey.
</P>
<P>
Up to six million hectares, or three quarters of the forests in
the south of the country, have been heavily affected by acid rain
exceeding relevant standards, the survey finds.
</P>
<P>
The survey quoted local experts as saying that acid rain causes
a loss of 60 billion kronor (7.5 billion U.S. dollars) each year.
</P>
<P>
The survey attributed the deterioration of the nation's forests
to the acid rain from other parts of the European continent in
addition to the small quantity of acid rain caused by waste gas
emissions of local industry.

<P>
BEIJING, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-President Hu Jintao
called on people in Tibet to focus on economic growth and the
maintenance of stability in Tibet.
</P>
<P>
Hu, also a member of the Standing Committee of the Chinese
Communist Party Central Committee Political Bureau, made the call

</P>
<P>
"Agriculture and livestock farming have always been the focal
point of economic development in Tibet," he said. "At no time
should efforts be slackened for their development."
</P>
<P>
Speaking about work in agricultural and pastoral areas in Tibet,
he said the Party's basic policies for rural areas should be fully

<HEADLINE> Kenya Acts on Oil Dumping </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 5 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government is taking
tighter measures to prevent dumping of oil products meant for
export in domestic market, Permanent Secretary Crispus Mutitu of
the Ministry of Energy told Xinhua here Friday.
</P>
<P>
The measures include higher and more deterrent penalties
against the culprits, arrest of truck drivers, truck owners and
businessmen involved in dumping, escort of all trucks transporting
oil products for export by security officers up to the
Kenya-Uganda border and that oil export trucks are required with a
complete set of valid documents.
</P>
<P>
According to a statement from the Ministry of Energy, the
dumping is construed as diversion to local outlets of duty free
oil products destined for export.
</P>
<P>
Mutitu said dumping services through dishonest operations by
public employees in collision with unscrupulous oil traders and
transporters were to rob the government's tax revenue and distort
domestic oil trade.
</P>
<P>
He said the Ministry of Energy, the Kenya Revenue Authority and
oil companies have regularly met to map out strategies to contain
and curtail the illegal trade.
</P>
<P>
The new measures followed complaints by fuel dealers that the
labeling of "oil product for export" on tankers introduced in
1998 was prone to abuse, Mutitu said, adding that the decline of
extra revenue in January 1999 to 109.8 million shillings (some
1.8 million U.S. dollars) might also be an indication that the
system currently in place was losing integrity.
</P>
<P>
Other measures, Mutitu said, are being developed to further
tighten the noose against illegal traders. For example, if it is
established that a company is engaging in illegal trade, its
licence for export trade would be cancelled forthwith.
</P>
<P>
Mutitu urged oil companies in the country to stop the illegal
dumping trade and embark on honest legal business for the good
of Kenya and their trade.

<HEADLINE> Enzyme May Cause Diabetes: Canadian Scientists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Canadian scientists have found an
enzyme that may be the cause of diabetes, the journal Science
reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Montreal team, led by molecular biologist Dr. Brian Kennedy
of the Merck Frosst Center for Therapeutic Research and biochemist
Dr. Michel Tremblay of McGill University discovered the enzyme
called PTP-1B, which is believed to make the body resistant to
insulin, which leads to type two diabetes in roughly 35 million
people around the world.
</P>
<P>
Beyond diabetes, the discovery is already being touted as a
promising treatment for obesity, high blood pressure and
cholesterol.
</P>
<P>
The Montreal team "knocked out" a gene from laboratory mice
that produces PTP-1B, a class of enzyme called phosphatases that
tends to shut off certain metabolic processes in the body.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Kennedy wanted to see what happened to mice that could not
make PTP-1B, a complex enzyme almost identical to one found in
humans.
</P>
<P>
The researchers had shown in test-tube studies that PTP-1B
removes key phosphates that help insulin signal to a cell to
absorb glucose-sugar from the bloodstream. If the PTP-1B was
removed, the mice would be able to absorb sugar into their cells
normally.
</P>
<P>
"That was the way to show whether the enzyme was important or
not, "Dr. Tremblay said.
</P>
<P>
After 10 weeks of feeding them a high-fat diet, the researchers
found the mutant mice did not lose their sensitivity to insulin.
In fact, they would not gain excess weight.
</P>
<P>
Despite the diet, the mice also had normal blood sugar and
insulin levels.
</P>
<P>
"These enzyme-deleted mice required half the amount of insulin
to maintain normal glucose or slightly lower glucose," said
Kennedy.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Germany Strikes Two Golds, America Takes More Medals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAEBASHI, March 5 (Xinhua) -- German snatched the first golds
of the World Indoor Athletic Championships while the United States
came away with the most medals in the first day of the tournaments
in Maebashi, Japan Friday.
</P>
<P>
Germany's triple jumper Charles Friedek, winner of the 1998
World Cup, tasted the sweetness of the first gold as he spanned 17.
18 meters in his first attempt for the title.
</P>
<P>
The 27-year-old jumper's performance equaled his personal best
and the best jump of the indoor season, although it represented
the poorest winning mark in the history of these championships.
</P>
<P>
Women's pole vault title also went to Germany as Nastja Ryshich,
21, set a championship best 4.50 meters with her final attempt in
a dramatic and high-quality battle.
</P>
<P>
Before this competition, only eight women had ever managed to
clear 4.35 meters, which was beaten for another eight times in
four hours on Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
Vala Flosadottir of Iceland ended on 4.45 metres to take silver,
followed by Nicole Rieger-Humbert of Germany, the world indoor
record-holder, who tied for bronze with Zsuzsa Szabo of Hungary at
4.35 meters.
</P>
<P>
It was also Colin Jackson's day when the triple-time world
indoor silverlist  finally realized his gold medal dream in the
60 meters hurdles.
</P>
<P>
Jackson, the British holder of the indoor world record, clocked
7.38 seconds, beating Reggie Torian of the United States to second
at 7.40 and Falk Balzer of Germany third in 7.44.
</P>
<P>
United States recorded the biggest medal tally as they took
away one gold, two silvers and two bronzes in the opening day of
the meet.
</P>
<P>
American DeDee Nathan posted a sequence of personal bests as
she won the women's pentathlon title at the world indoor
championships, setting an American record of 4,753 points in what
she said was "the biggest win of my career".
</P>
<P>
Russian Irina Belova took silver with 4,691 points and Urszula
Wlodarczyk of Poland the bronze with 4,596.
</P>
<P>
United States collected its first medal at the triple jump
where Lamark Carter placed third at 16.98 meters, 0.07 meters
behind the runner-up Rostislav Dimitrov of Bulgaria.
</P>
<P>
John Godina of the United States spoiled an otherwise clean
sweep of Ukraine, collecting the silver at the men's shot put with
a distance of 21.06 meters as Aleksandr Bagach and Yuriy
Belonog, both from Ukraine, took away the gold and bronze
respectively.
</P>
<P>
Kazakhstan also got Asia's first gold through Olga Shishigina,
the 1995 world indoor silver medallist, in the women's 60 meter
hurdels in 7.86 seconds. Shishigina was competing in her first
major championships since returning from a two-year drug
suspension.
</P>
<P>
In the 3,000 meters final, Haile Gebrselassie of Ethiopia
claimed his seventh world title by timing seven minutes 53.57
seconds, half a minute off the world record.
</P>
<P>
Paul Bitok of Kenya placed second with a time of 7:53.79 and
Million Wolde of Ethiopia third in 7:53.85.
</P>
<P>
In the women's high jump, Monica Dinescu of Romania, who was
last year's world number one after winning the World Cup as well
as the European titles, indoors and out, failed to win a medal as
the unheralded Khristina Kalcheva, 21, of Bulgaria, stole the
spotlight.
</P>
<P>
Kalcheva managed to clear a height of 1.99 meters, equalling
her outdoor best. Czech's Zuzana Kovacikova-Hlavonova came in
second at 1.96 for less missing times with American Tisha Waller
third, also in 1.96.

<P>
BUENOS AIRES, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Racing, one of the oldest
soccer clubs of Argentina, will be forced into bankruptcy if no
bidders are willing to take their monstrous debts within 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
The local court ruled on Thursday that the assets of the club
should be liquidated immediately and sold by auction to pay off at
least 34,000,000 U.S. dollars in debts, according to reports on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
On receiving the court ruling, the Argentina Footbll
Association responded by disqualifying the club from the domestic
Serie A league this Autumn.
</P>
<P>
Angered by the harsh decision, hundreds of fans gathered in
front of the club headquarters to voice their support.
</P>
<P>
The club also decided to appeal for the dislodging decision,
calling an emergency meeting with the players to work out a
solution to the present predicament.
</P>
<P>
Racing, founded in 1903, was the first Argentina club to sweep
three-peat league titles and bring home the first international
trophy.

<HEADLINE> Japan Renews Call for Early Signing of CTBT by Pakistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Japanese ambassador to Pakistan
Minoru Kubota Friday urged Pakistan to sign the Comprehensive Test
Ban Treaty (CTBT) early, saying it would enable Japanese
businessmen to invest in the South Asian country.
</P>
<P>
"We are eagerly looking forward to progress on
non-proliferation. We wish for the early signing of CTBT by the
government of Pakistan," Kubota said to a group of journalists at
his residence.
</P>
<P>
He said that during the recent talks between Japanese Deputy
Foreign Minister Minoru Tamba and Pakistani Foreign Secretary

would sign CTBT by September, 1999, said Kubota.
</P>
<P>
Referring to Pakistan's economy, he said he was "very
optimistic that the dark cloud (over Pakistan's economy) will be
over this year."
</P>
<P>
The ambassador said Japan has already lifted some sanctions
against Pakistan. "Because of many reasons including the one of
simpler investment permission procedure Pakistan was better placed
than India."
</P>
<P>
Kubota said Japanese investors should be confident about the
immediate future of Pakistan as a result of the efforts of both
Pakistani and Indian leaders to mitigate tensions in the region.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong has set up 16 red tide
monitoring stations, covering wider areas of its waters, in
preparation for the red tide season this spring, an official of
the Agriculture and Fisheries Department (AFD) said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Patsy Wong, senior fisheries officer of the AFD, said the
phytoplankton monitoring program "serves as a means to detect
possible development of red tide within Hong Kong waters."
</P>
<P>
In case of a harmful red tide occurrence, she said, AFD staff
would be mobilized to analyze samples on site and there would be
aerial survey to assess its spread and extent.
</P>
<P>
Noting that existing technology was still far from being able
to predict or control red tide occurrences, Wong stressed that a
practical approach was to strengthen monitoring and early
detection so that mariculturists would have sufficient time to
take mitigatory measures to minimize loss.

SINGAPORE, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Singapore will invite travelers
to the Lion City for attractive millennium celebrations at the
world's biggest international tourism show this week in Berlin,
Germany, according to a press release Friday by the Singapore
Tourism Board (STB).
</P>
<P>
It said a STB delegation, consisting of 46 organizations, will
explain to the world during the International Tourism Exchange ITB
Expo '99 the island state's ambitious scenario for the new
millennium.
</P>
<P>
Yeo Khee Leng, Chief Executive of STB as well as head of the
delegation, said his team will promote the country as the place to
see and be seen for the remainder of this century and the 21st
century. "We have a lot of special promotions and features to
offer visitors to Singapore," added Yeo.
</P>
<P>
Yeo said the STB will stage 15-month-long millennial promotions
from June 1999 to August 2000, which will stir the tidy island

and music festivals, sports and entertainment occasions, a massive
street countdown on the New Year's Eve and a live, global
broadcast of a fund-raising concert.
</P>
<P>
Yeo expected visitor arrivals to rise by between one and three
percent this year.
</P>

To add to the temptation, the STB also has launched Once In A
Millennium, a campaign featuring a series of promotional offers
such as cheaper air tours to Singapore and daily prize draws for
458 days between the 15-month period.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Rejects U.S. Human Rights Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, March 5 (Xinhua) -- The Myanmar government Friday
rejected the assessment report of the United States on the human
rights situation in Myanmar, saying it was based on unfounded
facts.
</P>
<P>
"The assessment is nothing more than a politically motivated
document aimed at interfering in the internal affairs of Myanmar,"
the Myanmar Foreign Ministry said in a press release.
</P>
<P>
Recently, the U.S. issued a 1998 report on the human rights
situation in the world which includes references to Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. report neglects the positive developments taking
place in the country and does not reflect the true situation of
Myanmar," the press release said, adding that the report also
ignores the fact that Myanmar is enjoying unprecedented peace and
stability.
</P>
<P>
"It seems that the U.S. has turned a blind eye to these facts
and is using the pretext of human rights and democracy to
interfere in the internal affairs of other nations," it said.
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. speaks of human rights but ignores the right of other
sovereign and independent nations to lead their own lives and to
shape their own destinies without interference or pressure," it
pointed out.
</P>
<P>
It stressed that all countries, large or small, strong or weak,
rich or poor, have the right to choose their political system
according to the U.N. Charter and the norms of the international
law.
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. speaks of democracy but tries to dictate how a
country should be run or even who should run the nation without
paying heed to the actual situation in that country or its
challenges and potentials," the press release added.

LUSAKA, March 5 (Xinhua) -- The Angolan government has remained
silent since the bomb blasts in Lusaka last Sunday, in which one

the other seriously injured.
</P>
<P>
Chief government spokesman Newstead Zimba said in a press

Minister, confirmed the arrival in the country of the United

<P>
CANBERRA, March 5 (Xinhua) -- The Australian stock market
finished higher Friday with the help of a stronger gold sector but
failed to maintain the early momentum sparked by the Thursday
night gold price rise on Wall Street, brokers said.
</P>
<P>
The benchmark all ordinaries ended the day 17.2 points up at
2,902.5, drifting back from an intra-day high of 2,914.7 points.
</P>
<P>
"It was a firmer market following a strong lead from Wall
Street, however confidence weakened in the afternoon session as
the market focused on the implications of U.S. employment data,"
Morgan Stockbroking adviser Simon Reed said.
</P>
<P>
He said stronger employment figures will add further fuel for a
change in U.S. interest-rate policy.
</P>
<P>
Reed said trade on the local bourse was relatively subdued
ahead of the release of the U.S. employment data.
</P>
<P>
National turnover on the Australian Stock Exchange was 358.89
million shares traded for 967.33 million Australian dollars
(604.58 million U.S. dollars), with 632 shares rising, 531 falling
and 422 remaining steady.
</P>
<P>
The all industrials index added 24 points to 5,256.3, while the
all resources strengthened 13.8 points - or 1.45 percent - to
966.9 on the back of improvements in gold, oil and base metal
prices.
</P>
<P>
The gold index surged 31.3 points to 1,020.1 on the improved
precious metal prices.
</P>
<P>
The price of gold bullion closed at 288.75 U.S. dollars an

<HEADLINE> Kuwaiti Crown Prince to Visit Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Kuwaiti Crown Prince and
Prime Minister Sheikh Saad Al-Abdullah Al-Sabah is due in Tehran
Saturday for talks with Iranian leaders on regional issues and
means of enhancing bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
Saad's trip to Tehran is part of his four-nation tour, which
also includes Egypt, Lebanon and Syria, the Kuwait News Agency
reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Kuwaiti-Iranian ties have been developing since the 1991
Gulf War, which ended Iraq's seven-month occupation of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Iran, which fought an eight-year war with Iraq from 1980-88,
extended firm support to Kuwait during the Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
Iran and Kuwait have in recent years increased exchange of
visits by high-level officials, through which bilateral ties have
been greatly boosted.
</P>
<P>
Iranian President Mohammad Khatami and other Iranian officials
have expressed welcome to Saad's visit.
</P>
<P>
"Sheikh Saad's trip to Tehran will be a new step towards
expanding bilateral political, economic and cultural relations,"
Iranian Minister of Culture and Islamic Guidance Ataollah
Mohajerani has said.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Closes the Week on a High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, March 5 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar finished
the week on a high, gaining more than half a U.S. cent on the back
of improved commodity and gold prices.
</P>
<P>
Buying of the Australian dollar against the Japanese yen also
helped the local currency's cause, pushing it to a higher close of
62.74 U.S. cents compared to 62.09 previously.
</P>
<P>
Commonwealth Bank of Australia senior manager Stavros Nitis
said the Australian dollar could be on its way back up to the
63.50 U.S. cents level.
</P>
<P>
"The risk is that we go back up to 63.40-50 U.S. cents over the
course of the next week or so rather than heading back below 62.00
U.S. cents," he said.
</P>
<P>
Nitis said offshore interest had driven the Australian dollar
during the session.
</P>
<P>
"The local session was not driven by the corporate market, but
instead international flows," he said.
</P>
<P>
"They appear to be, in the short term, positive for the
Aussie."
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar was also buying 0.5795 euro from 0.5713.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Australian dollar was buying 76.89 Japanese yen,
from 75.89 Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Nitis said there was a great amount of demand for the
Australian dollar out of Europe and the U.S.

ISLAMABAD, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan is concerned over
reports that Israel has occupied the Lebanese village of Arnoun
and thus expanded its so-called "security zone" in southern
Lebanon, a Pakistani Foreign Office spokesman said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Continuing Israeli occupation of Southern Lebanon runs counter
to the relevant U.N. Security Council resolutions, the spokesman
said, adding that the occupation of Arnoun village constitutes
another violation of internationally accepted norms and the U.N.
charter.

Pakistan calls for complete Israeli withdrawal and respect for

<HEADLINE> Jiang Zemin on Ethnic Unity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin said
here today that it is in the fundamental interest of people of all
ethnic groups in China to improve ethnic solidarity, safeguard
national unity and promote common development.
</P>
<P>
"We must adhere to and further improve the system of regional
ethnic autonomy, consolidate and develop socialist ethnic
relations featuring equality, unity and mutual assistance, and
promote common prosperity for all ethnic groups," Jiang, also
general-secretary of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central
Committee, told legislators from south China's Guangxi Zhuang
Autonomous Region during a meeting this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Home for a variety of ethnic minorities, Guangxi is one of
China's five provincial-level autonomous regions. It celebrated
its 40th founding anniversary last year.
</P>
<P>
The Guangxi deputies to the Ninth National People's Congress (
NPC) are here attending this top Chinese legislature's second
session, which opened this morning.
</P>
<P>
Jiang, who has visited Guangxi twice in recent years, spoke
highly of the region for its successful maintenance of solidarity
and harmony among all ethnic groups living there.
</P>
<P>
"It took long-time efforts to achieve the current fine
situation of ethnic unity and you must particularly cherish it,"
he told the lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
Over the past decade, Jiang said, Guangxi has achieved
sustained growth for the regional economy, maintained ethnic unity,
border peace and social stability, and further improved people's
living standard. In 1998, an additional 1.1 million needy people
in the region shook off poverty.
</P>
<P>
After reviewing China's accomplishments in 1998, Jiang noted
that the year of 1999, in which the People's Republic will
celebrate its 50 founding anniversary and Macao will return to its
motherland, will turn out to be one of great significance in
Chinese history.
</P>
<P>
"The entire Party, army and people across the country must
boost confidence, keep unity and work hard to preserve the current
fine situation for reform, development and stability and achieve
new successes for the socialist modernization drive," he said.
</P>
<P>
He suggested that Guangxi, which has a nice climate and rich
natural resources, make full use of its own advantages and play
the role of a major gateway to the sea for the entire southwestern
region.
</P>
<P>
He also promised that the central government would continue to
give all-out support to poverty-alleviation efforts in Guangxi and
other regions in the central and western parts of China.
</P>
<P>
The president went on to highlight the importance of fostering
a contingent of high-quality officials and building a clean
government.
</P>
<P>
"We must regard the work of punishing corruption as a matter of
utmost importance that can determine the fate of our nation," he
said. "We must make long-lasting and unswerving efforts to combat
corruption."

</P>

He said that China is now able to be competitive with the
United States and European countries in developing hybrid strains,
and that there are many ways China and Cuba can cooperate in
agriculture including investment, technology transfers, and the
exchange of agronomists.
</P>
<P>
The Cuban agricultural minister is expected to visit China soon
to discuss agricultural cooperation on a wider scope with his
Chinese counterpart, Gomez said.

signed three important agreements here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Thai Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai and his visiting counterpart
Sisavat Keobounphan witnessed the signing of the three agreements
on visa exemption for service passports, extradition of criminals
and road transportation.
</P>

Laos also asked Thailand to purchase electricity from its dams
earlier than originally planned, and agreed to allow Thai
commercial flights to overfly on route to the southern Chinese
town of Jinghong.
</P>
<P>
Thailand asked Laos to take back remaining hill tribe refugees
who fled to camps in Thailand after 1975.
</P>
<P>
During their talks, Chuan and Sisavat also discussed the master
plan for economic cooperation between the two Southeast Asian
neighbors in the fields of electricity, communication and
transportation, agriculture and agro-industry and investment.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, March 5 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading French newspapers on Friday:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- The corruption scandal involving former French Foreign
Minister Roland Dumas was relaunched by the accusation by his
former girlfriend Christine Deviers-Joncour that Dumas benefited
from a 300,000 franc (50,000 U.S. dollars) bribe from the Elf oil
group in 1990. The money was spent to buy 12 ancient Greek
statuettes.
</P>
<P>
-- As the report by three judges mandated by the United Nations
to study the feasibility of putting on trial former Khmer Rouge
leaders in Cambodia will be published on Monday, a diplomatic
quarrel between Phnom Penh and Washington is becoming exacerbated.
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said during her brief
stay in Bangkok that Washington rejects the proposal by the
Cambodian government to set up a Commission of Truth and
Reconciliation to settle account with the Khmer Rouge, but
supports a trial of these men in an international tribunal.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- Eight weeks after the euphoric birth of the euro, the
European Union which is under the German presidency is undergoing
a period of strong turbulences, while the single currency
continues to drop against the U.S. dollar, the confrontation over
the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy showed profound
differences between France and Germany.
</P>
<P>
-- The United States and Germany are at odds over the demand by
Bonn for the regaining of the secret archives of the former East
German intelligence department Stasi, which were bought by the CIA
from the KGB years ago with 1-1.5 million U.S. dollars.
Washington has rejected the demand by the German government for
the return of the documents.

<P>
BEIJING, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Vice Chairman of China's Central
Military Commission (CMC) Zhang Wannian met here today with
visiting former United States defense secretary William Perry who
just attended the second Sino-U.S. Security Seminar in Hangzhou.
</P>
<P>
The overall progress in Sino-U.S. relations has been fine,
except for several problems, said Zhang. He voiced his confidence
in the future development of bilateral ties, noting that healthy
and stable Sino-U.S. relations are not only in accord with the
interests of both countries, but are good for global development
as well.
</P>
<P>
The Taiwan issue has always been the core problem in bilateral
relations, noted Zhang, stressing that China's refusal to give up
the option of the use of force is not directed at the Taiwan
people, but at the force of Taiwan independence and external
interference. The Taiwan issue is China's internal affair, he
reiterated.
</P>
<P>
He said he hopes the U.S. will abide by principles set forth in
the three Sino-U.S. joint communiques, as well as corresponding
promises.
</P>
<P>
Perry said the U.S. wants to keep good relations with China not
only because of the American people's love for China and the
Chinese people, but also because such a relationship accords with
the fundamental interests of the American people.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Export Finance Facilities Decline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Utilization of general export
finance facilities available at the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe
declined by 27 percent in the last quarter of 1998 from the third
quarter of the year due to poor export performance.
</P>
<P>
The central bank said in its monthly review for January that
some 116 million U. S. dollars were utilized by the end of 1998
compared with 159 million U .S. dollars during the previous
quarter.
</P>
<P>
"The fall in the utilization of the trade finance was largely
due to poor export performance during the period under review, "
the bank said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
On the foreign exchange market, the central bank said that in
December total foreign exchange inflows amounted to 59 million
U.S. dollars against outflows of 159 million U.S. dollars,
creating a deficit interbank market position.
</P>
<P>
But the exchange rate has since stabilized at 38.3 Zimbabwean
dollars against the U.S. dollar from 45 Zimbabwean dollars to the
greenback in January as commercial banks reached an understanding
last week to realign the troubled local unit, the bank said.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Regrets India's Stockpiling of Chemical Arms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Foreign Minister
Sartaj Aziz Friday expressed regrets over India's large chemical
weapons stockpiles.
</P>
<P>
"Despite the fact Pakistan and India, through a joint
declaration of August 1992, had agreed not to acquire or develop
chemical weapons, India has made large chemical weapons
stockpiles," Aziz said when meeting with Jose Mauricio Bustani,
director general of the Organization for the Prohibition of
Chemical Weapons (OPCW).
</P>
<P>
Bustani, who is currently on an official visit to Pakistan, was
assured that Pakistan fully agrees with the aims and objectives of
the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) and has ratified the
convention with complete sincerity, according to a Pakistani
Foreign Office press release.
</P>
<P>
Aziz, while welcoming Bustani to Pakistan, appreciated his
effort in giving a strong international character to the OPCW and
establishing credibility as a disarmament organization in a very
short span of time, said the press release.
</P>
<P>
So far over 450 inspections have been conducted by the OPCW
inspectors in different countries and there have been no
complaints from any quarter, said Bustani.
</P>
<P>
While discussing the implementation of the CWC in Pakistan,
Aziz sought OPCW's assistance in educating the domestic industry
on the industrial implications of the CWC, about which Bustani
promised to organize a national seminar in the country for
creating awareness.

<HEADLINE> Philippines' Inflation Rate Lowered to 9.9 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 5 (Xinhua) - Lower food prices softened
Philippines' inflation in February as it hit a single-digit rate
at 9.9 percent after nine months of consecutive double digit
inflation, National Statistics Office said Friday.
</P>
<P>
According to the office, last month's inflation figure was
below the government's forecast of 10.1 to 10.7 percent and the
private sector's 10.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
The National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA)
expressed satisfaction over the improving price situation as shown
in last month's "better-than-expected" inflation figure.
</P>
<P>
It noted that the slowdown in inflation from 11.5 percent in
January may be attributed mainly to the improved food, beverages
and tobacco price index, which slid from 13 to 11.2 percent in
February.
</P>
<P>
"In particular, there was a substantial price reduction for
fruits and vegetables of 5.5 percent which was the main cause of
the sustained double digit figure from May 1998 to January 1999,"
NEDA Acting Director General Isagani Valdellon said in a report to
the president.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the price of meat also came down by 0.6 percent in
February, while only moderate increases were observed in the
prices of corn, up 4 percent, cereal preparations, 1.5 percent,
and rice, 0.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Government data also show the prices of nonfood items likewise
generally slowed down. The housing and repairs index marked a
lower inflation rate of 9.7 percent in February from 10.5 percent
in the previous month.

<HEADLINE> Improving Sino-US Relations Beneficial to Both: Jiang </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 5 (Xinhua)-- Chinese President Jiang Zemin said
here today that the improvement of relations between China and the
U.S. has not only brought great benefits to their peoples, but has
also been conducive to peace and stability in Asia and the world
as a whole.
</P>
<P>
Jiang's remarks came from a meeting with former US Defense
Secretary William Perry this afternoon at the Diaoyutai State
Guesthouse. The president noted that since he exchanged visits
with president Clinton, bilateral relations have progressed.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the Taiwan issue has always been the most
sensitive and important in overall bilateral ties, and so long as
the principles enshrined in the three Sino-US joint communiques be
strictly pursued, relationship between the two countries can move
forward in a healthy and steady way.
</P>
<P>
Due to different national situations and concepts of value, it'
s no surprise that divergence of views of this kind or that exists
between the two countries, however, Jiang pointed out, the key is
to treat the divergence with caution and seek proper solutions in
the spirit of equality and mutual respect.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed the conviction that the upcoming US visit by
Premier Zhu Rongji would further push forward bilateral relations.
The president also voiced the hope that more dialogues through non-
government channels would be conducted, saying this would help
deepen mutual understanding.
</P>
<P>
Perry said the exchange of visits between heads of the two
countries has encouraged cooperation in various fields. A sound
bilateral relationship is in the fundamental interest of both
countries, and the US side is happy to note that high-level visits
are on the rise. He confirmed that the American public are looking
forward to Premier Zhu's visit to the US.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed the hope that the two countries would
increase non-governmental contact so as to promote the development
of bilateral relations.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Ships Nuclear Waste Back to US </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Thailand has shipped nuclear waste
back to the United States, the first country in Asia to do so, the
Thai News Agency reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted Kriengsak Bhadrakom, secretary-general of the
Office of Atomic Energy for Peace, as saying that the shipment
contained 31 spent fuel rods from a nuclear research reactor in
Thailand, where it had been stored for 36 years.
</P>
<P>
The nuclear waste removal was under the control of two experts
from the International Atomic Energy (IAEA), Kriengsak said.
</P>
<P>
Thailand shipped the nuclear waste back to the United States
under a special project being carried out under the
Non-Proliferation Treaty, which allows countries buying nuclear
fuel from the United States to send the spent fuel back by 2006.
</P>
<P>
The nuclear waste vessel, leaving Thailand's Laern Chabang Port
in the eastern province of Chonburi, will also collect nuclear
wastes from Indonesia, the Philippines and Taiwan before heading
to the United States.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Investment Keeps Flowing to Asian Countries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, March 5 (Xinhua) -- The flow of foreign direct
investments (FDI) to five Asian cuntries, namely, Malaysia,
Indonesia, Thailand, the Philippines and the Republic of Korea,
have been kept resilient, said the United Nations Conference on
Trade and Development (UNCTAD) in a statement here Friday.
</P>
<P>
UNCTAD said that on yearly average, FDI flows to the group of
five only fell slightly to 15.4 billion U.S. dollars from 17.5
billion U.S. dollars each recorded in 1996 and 1997.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the flow of FDI in each year between 1995 and
1998 was much higher than the annual average between 1991 and
1995.
</P>
<P>
Nineteen Ninety-five and 1996 registered 17.5 billion U.S.
dollars each and 1998 at 15.4 billion U.S. dollars compared with
1991 to 1995 annual average of 10.8 billion U.S. dollars, UNCTAD
said.
</P>
<P>
Individually, in 1998 FDI into Malaysia stood at 3.6 billion
U.S. dollars, Thailand 7 billion U.S. dollars, the Philippines 1
billion U.S. dollars and South Korea 5.1 billion U.S. dollars.
Indonesia, however, suffered divestment of 1.3 billion U.S.
dollars in the same period.
</P>
<P>
UNCTAD believed that the FDI into the group of five is likely
to remain stable in the next two years ending the decade, between
10 to 17 billion U.S. dollars each year with Malaysia as the
largest FDI recipient.
</P>
<P>
The FDI flows were stronger than funds arriving from foreign
banks' lending and portfolio equity investments, it said, adding
that the economic crisis and currency devaluation have made Asian
countries attractive.
</P>
<P>
UNCTAD said that transnational corporations with production
lines in Asia took the opportunity to increase their stakes in
their Asian affiliates and focus on exports on the back of
declining domestic sales.
</P>
<P>
This has also helped affiliated companies of foreign firms to
end their distress as their parent companies will be more
committed and alleviate financial difficulties in the wake of the
crisis.
</P>
<P>
UNCTAD attributed the increase in FDI inflows to liberal
approach by Asian governments in wooing foreign capital into their
countries through relaxation of FDI policies.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Minister Condemns Terrorist attacks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Interior Minister Cahit
Bayar Friday in Istanbul strongly condemned the terrorist attacks
in the country.
</P>
<P>
A bomb planted in a truck exploded at Republic district of
Cankiri province near Ankara Friday morning, seriously wounding
the province's governor Ayhan Cevik and killing four others, the
Anatolia News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Cevik has been sent to the Hospital of the Medical Faculty of
the Hacettepe University in Ankara for treatment.
</P>
<P>
Labeling "this is very loathed attack," Bayar said the bomb
exploded when Cevit was on his way to a meeting in Istanbul, the
largest city of Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The Friday bombing is the latest in a series of attacks in
Turkey. On Thursday, a Kurdish woman threw a hand grenade at a
police station in southeastern province of Batman, killing herself
and wounding three others.
</P>
<P>
She was believed by the Turkish officials as a suicide bomber
in protest of the capture of Abdullah Ocalan, leader of the
outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK), which has been fighting a
15-year-old war for independence in southeastern Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, unidentified assailants Thursday threw bombs at a
branch of the Motherland Party in Sarigazi district and a branch
of the National Movement Party in Umraniye of Istanbul.

<P>
BANGKOK, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Thailand will propose to other
ASEAN members that the grouping welcome and treat outside
investors as equally as those in the organization, a Thai
investment official said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Board of Investment Deputy Secretary-General Chakramon
Phasukavanich told reporters that Thai delegates would propose the
idea at the first meeting of ASEAN Industrial Areas Council (AIAC)
being held Friday in Thailand's southern province of Phuket.
</P>
<P>
The idea was aimed at persuading and attracting more outside
investors into the region to help regenerate economic activities
contracted by the economic downturn, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the AIAC meeting would also consider a list of
industries each ASEAN country wanted to temporarily reserve for
its local firms before they would be liberalized under the ASEAN
Free Trade Area (AFTA) by 2005.
</P>
<P>
The forum will discuss the so-called sensitive lists of
products submitted by member countries which want these products
to be exempted from any AFTA liberalization program, said
Chakramon.
</P>
<P>
The meeting will also consider admitting Cambodia into ASEAN
later this year as well, he said.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) currently groups
Brunei, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines,
Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.

<TEXT>
<P>
WARSAW, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Polish Prime Minister Jerzy Buzek
appointed Jerzy Widyk as his new chief of staff Thursday in what
the press here seen as the first step of cabinet reshuffle.
</P>
<P>
Widyk was the first one to step in to help polish the cabinet's
image by replacing Wieslaw Walendziak, who heralded three days ago
the dismissal of eight others around Buzek, including spokesman
Jaroslav Sellin.
</P>
<P>
As more changes are expected at health, agriculture, justice
and telecommunications ministries and other institutions, the
reshuffle could be the most drastic one since the Solidarity Trade
Union came to power in October 1997.
</P>
<P>
Officials who are considered incompetent in carrying out duties
or their institutions unnecessary for the cabinet's functioning
would be likely to go.
</P>
<P>
Political observes said Buzek was prompted to make such move as
socio-economic indexes so far this year, especially those of
February, have turned out to be disappointing, and the cabinet's
health care and institutional reforms turned haywire.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics showed that Poland's economy grew by 4.8
percent in 1998, short of the cabinet's revised goal of 5.1
percent and its initial projection of 6.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Entering this year, the country's industrial output was down 10.
9 percent and the jobless rate up 11.4 percent in the first month
compared to the same period last year, resulting in a dip of per
capita disposable income for the first time in years.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 5 (Xinhua) -- The Industrial and Commercial Bank
of China (ICBC) has recently urged all its branches to take strong
measures in loan interest collection.
</P>
<P>
The ICBC will make a list of enterprises which default more
than one million yuan of loan interest and punish them by
degrading their credit ratings or stopping extending further loans.
</P>
<P>
The ICBC will also single out from the list some enterprises
and submit their names to the central bank to list as hostile
defaulters while bringing suits against some others.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, ICBC will ask the central government to cancel some
defaulters' qualifications as key state enterprises and make
public some of the defaulting companies.
</P>
<P>
Liu Tinhuan, president of ICBC, asked every branch head to take
direct responsibility in collecting loan interest from big
defaulters, adding that their annual performance will be largely
decided by the results of the interest collection.

<HEADLINE> Gaddafi Arrives in Cairo for Talks Over Lockerbie </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Libyan leader Maummar Gaddafi
arrived in Egypt Friday by land for talks with Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak on an array of issues, especially the Lockerbie
crisis.
</P>
<P>
Gaddafi arrived at the northern coastal city of Mersa Matruh
Friday morning, where he was greeted by Minister of Rural
Development Mahmoud Sherif, Matruh governor Kamal Amar and the
commander of the military western zone.
</P>
<P>
After performing the Friday's prayers there, Gaddafi will drive
on to Cairo to meet Mubarak.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa said Thursday that the
Lockerbie issue will figure high on the agenda of talks between
Gaddafi and Mubarak.
</P>
<P>
The U.S., Britain and Libya has long been locked in the dispute
over Libya's refusal to hand over for trial two Libyans suspected
of exploding a Pan Am airliner over Lockerbie, Scotland and
claiming the lives of 270 passengers on board.
</P>
<P>
Last August, Libya accepted in principle a U.S.-British
proposal to allow the two suspects to go on trial in the
Netherlands before Scottish judges, but it later balked at the
prospect that the men, if convicted, serve the jail term in
Scotland.
</P>
<P>
The Libyans also want guarantees that the suspects will not be
interrogated by the Americans and Britishs while they are in the
Netherlands or "kidnaped" to the U.S. and Britain.
</P>
<P>
Last Tuesday, Gaddafi said he has got the guarantees recently
from South African President Nelson Mandela and Saudi Arabian
Crown Prince Abdullah Ibn Abdul-Aziz, which might be sufficient to
solve the issue.
</P>
<P>
Moussa also said Thursday that it is felt that a solution of
the Lockerbie crisis is near in order to put an end to the
sufferings of the libyan people, who have been under
U.N. sanctions since 1992.
</P>
<P>
Gaddafi is expected to stay in Egypt for several days.

<HEADLINE> Market Economy Unites Different Ethnic Groups In Tibet (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Jiang Tianlin, a farmer in China's
Sichuan Province working temporarily in Tibet Autonomous Region's
Qamdo county, was suffering from acute hepatitis and was sent to a
local hospital practicing Tibetan traditional medicine where he
received treatment free of charge.
</P>
<P>
Like many across Tibet, doctors in the hospital have always
treated patients of other ethnic groups like members of their own
families.
</P>
<P>
In northern Tibet, relations between locals and merchants of
the Hui ethnic group are becoming more harmonious. They respect
each other's customs and habits and greet each other in their
traditional festivals.
</P>
<P>
With the market economy developing, economic exchanges between
Tibet and other parts of the country are becoming more frequent
and a new type of relations, featuring equality, unity and mutual
help, among different ethnic groups is enjoying further
development.
</P>
<P>
Legqog, chairman of the regional government, explained that
Tibet has a population of more than 2.47 million with 38 ethnic
groups, including Tibetans, Hans and Mongols, and Tibetans making
up the majority of the population.
</P>
<P>
He said that the development of Tibet's economy needs the
participation of all ethnic groups, and the selfless help from
different ethnic groups across the country plays an important role
in developing the local economy.
</P>
<P>
Tibet is abundant in natural resources, such as minerals,
forests and medicine, and there are over 20 trading posts along
its 3,800 kilometer-long border.
</P>
<P>
Neighboring Qinghai and Sichuan provinces and Xinjiang Uygur
Autonomous Region, Tibet occupies an area of 1.2 million sq. km
accounting for one-eighth of China's total.
</P>
<P>
The democratic reform in Tibet, which started 40 years' ago,
initiated a massive construction of the region. Teachers and
technicians of different sectors nationwide were sent to help
Tibetans and people of other ethnic groups to build homes and
develop the economy.
</P>
<P>
Since China's reform and opening up, the local market economy
has witnessed great development. Business people from China's
hinterland have swarmed into Tibet and set up restaurants and
shops, which also persuaded many local Tibetans to go into
business.

<P>
In Lhasa, the region's capital, thousands of shops and service
facilities run by the local Tibetans or the inland Han people have
sprung up, making the city a commercial and trade center.
</P>
<P>
The central government and other autonomous regions and
provinces have aided Tibet in constructing 105 projects, which has
narrowed the economic gap between the region and inland areas and
speeded up the transformation of the local economy into a foreign-
oriented one.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of cadres and technicians from the hinterland have
contributed selflessly to Tibet's construction and many have given
their lives, acts which have been deeply cherished by Tibetans.
</P>
<P>
To accelerate the market economy, Tibet has adopted and listed
a series of policies and projects to attract inland business
people to Tibet.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Tibet also send delegations to other parts of the
country such as Beijing and Shanghai every year to learn from such
experiences and to negotiate business deals. Tibetan entrepreneurs
have now opened more than 200 businesses in the inland market,
finding great potential there.
</P>
<P>
Through exchanges, Tibetan and Han Chinese entrepreneurs have
enhanced their cooperation as well as their unity. Meanwhile,
Lhasa has established friendly ties with 11 cities across the
country.
</P>
<P>
In Lhasa's Bargor Street, known as Tibet's biggest distribution
center for commodities, there are more than 1,000 merchants of
different ethnic groups. They do business during the day and live
in Tibetans' homes at night.
</P>
<P>
Lham, a local Tibetan merchant, said," We talk not only about
competition and money-making but also about friendship and unity."
</P>
<P>
Puncog Cering, a farmer in the suburbs of Lhasa, rented his
land to a inland farmer a few years ago, and then he hired a man
from Sichuan and set up a garage. Later, he set up Tibet's first
Hada (a piece of silk used as a greeting gift among the Tibetan
and the Mongolian nationalities) workshop after his tour to
Chengdu city, capital of Sichuan.
</P>
<P>
"To run an enterprise in Tibet, you cannot do without inland
technicians," he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's Secretary for
Transport Nicholas Ng said here Friday that the Special
Administrative Region government would continue its firm
commitment to developing transport infrastructure so as to cater
for the daily transport needs of commuters as well as to enhance
future economic development and to provide job opportunities.

<HEADLINE> African Leaders Urged to Make Policy on Scientific </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, March 5 (Xinhua) - The African leaders should
invite scientists in their policy making process to avoid
disasters that usually result from ignoring scientific knowledge,
a senior Tanzanian official has challenged.
</P>
<P>
Minister for Science, Technology and Higher Education Pius
Ng'wandu, made the remarks Wednesday when closing the conference
on Basic Sciences for Development in Eastern and Southern Africa
in the nothern town of Arusha.
</P>
<P>
Local English newspaper Daily Mail Friday quoted Ng'wandu as
telling participants to the conference that it is true that in
Africa today scientists have little or no influence over policy
making.
</P>
<P>
"I dare say many policy decisions are arrived at with little
regard for scientific knowledge or methods," he said. "The result
has often times been catastrophic."
</P>
<P>
 He said it is time scientists take up the challenge and
assume their rightful role in influencing and guiding policy
making to prove their worth.
</P>
<P>
The three-day conference that attracted scientists from the
eastern and southern Africa has deliberated on several important
issues related to the role of basic sciences in developing
national economies.
</P>
<P>
They stressed that basic and applied science and research are
inseparable, because there is no applied science or research if
there is no basic science to be applied.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan President Blasts IMF over Aid Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi
has criticized the international Monetary Fund (IMF) for keeping
his country in the cold for over eight years while setting tough
conditions before releasing its aid.
</P>
<P>
Moi made the remarks Thursday after attending the opening of a
national commodity show in the city of Eldoret in western Kenya.
</P>
<P>
He said each time Kenya thought it had met all conditions for
resumption of aid, new requirements were set, local media reported
Friday.
</P>
<P>
"For eight years, they have been shifting their position. If
they don't want to give us money, they should say so," Moi said.
</P>
<P>
The President also mentioned that it would have been better for
the IMF to be forthright and say it would not give Kenya any aid
in the future instead of continuing giving conditions "even after
we have tried to cope with what they are asking us to do."

<HEADLINE> Desalinization Plant To be Built in Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, March 5 (Xinhua) -- The Cypriot government and an
Israeli joint venture have signed a contract for the construction
of a desalinization plant, the Cyprus Weekly newspaper reported on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus Deputy Director of the Department of Water Christos
Markoullis said at Thursday's signing ceremony that the new
desalinization plant will ease a great deal the water problem in
Cyprus, in particular the water supply to households.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus entered its fourth straight year of drought, and the
House of Representatives (parliament) has passed a legislation
imposing tough actions against anyone found wasting water.
</P>
<P>
The new desalinization plant, at an estimated cost of nearly 20
million Cyprus pounds (40 million U.S. dollars), will supply
Nicosia and Larnaca districts with 13.14 million cubic meters of
water annually.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli joint venture, made up of the companeis IDE and
OCEANA, will assume all the cost for the provision and
installation of electronic and mechanical equipment, and all
necessary construction to complete the project.
</P>
<P>
The contract stipulates that the Israeli venture will run the
plant at its own expense for 10 years and sell the desalinized
water to Cyprus at 42.2 Cyprus cents (84.4 cents) per cubic meter.
</P>
<P>
The plant will automatically become the property of the
Cypriot government after 10 years, but the contract also provides
for the possibility to buy the plant before the 10-year period is
over.
</P>
<P>
This unit is the second such plant on the island and is part
of Cyprus' government plan to ease the water problem.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Concerned about Kurdish Protests in Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Turkey has expressed concern about
the continuing protests by Kurds in Lebanon over the capture of
the Kurdish Workers Party's (PKK) leader Abdullah Ocalan, the
Daily Star reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
"I mentioned our concern about the increasing PKK activities
in Lebanon, which proved how right we are in asking for security
cooperation in Lebanon," Turkish Ambassador Nazim Dumlu told
reporters after meeting with Lebanese Foreign Ministry's
Director-general Zafer Hassan Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Dumlu blasted the supporters of the PKK, a Turkish separatist
group seeking self-determination in southeastern Turkey, for
"carrying PKK flags and banners, and even bringing children" to
the demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
Around 200 Kurdish children, mostly aged five-10 years, staged
protests in Beirut Wednesday. They danced and chanted Kurdish
songs while holding banners and pictures with Ocalan's nickname
Apo.
</P>
<P>
The gathering was the latest in a series of protests in
Lebanon by Kurds, most of whom reside in the country's eastern
area of Bekaa.
</P>
<P>
Ankara has asked Lebanon to permit Turkish inspectors to visit
western Bekaa, which was used as training bases by PKK fighters
during Lebanon's 1975-1990 civil war.
</P>
<P>
Arguing that the bases were closed in the early 1990s, Lebanon
has so far rejected the Turkish request.
</P>
<P>
Syria, which gave asylum to Ocalan for around 15 years, has
reached a security agreement with Turkey to ban PKK fighters from
being trained in the country.
</P>
<P>
Turkey is seeking to reach a similar pact with Lebanon where
tens of thousands of Kurds are living, about 25,000 of which have
been granted the Lebanese nationality since the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
Ocalan was captured by Turkish commandos in Kenya and brought
back to Turkey in mid-February.

<HEADLINE> Climate Change to Blame for Drying Up of Yellow River </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists say dramatic
climate changes on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau are the main reasons
for the ecological deterioration and drying up of the Yellow River,
according to Science Times.
</P>
<P>
Scientists have studied data collected in 13 meteorological
stations in the southern part of Qinghai Province over the past 30
years, and found that carbon dioxide and other green house gases
in the region have increased rapidly.
</P>
<P>
The statistics show that although the annual rainfall in the
pasture areas has remained in overall terms stable over the 30
years, more rain falls in winter and spring and less in summer.
</P>
<P>
The climate change has brought more snow storms to the region
in winter and made the summer dryer. Scientists say the growth
period of the pasture's grass has been shortened, causing
deterioration of the ecological system.
</P>
<P>
The disappearance of grasslands on the upper reaches of the
Yellow River has decreased the water storage capacity of the soil
with less water running into the river every year.
</P>
<P>
So far more than 1.13 million hectares of grassland on the
upper reaches of the river have been turned into desert, which is
increasing annually by 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Yellow River meanders for 5,464 km across China from its
source in the Bayanhar Mountains in Qinghai and flows east through
nine provinces and autonomous regions, emptying into the sea in
Shandong.
</P>
<P>
The river has been drying up more frequently in certain
sections and for longer periods of time since the first stoppage
was reported in the lower reaches in 1972, and then in 1997 it
stopped flowing for 272 days.
</P>
<P>
The interrupted flow is largely blamed on insufficient water
supply at the source, a sharp increase in water consumption, a
serious waste of water in daily use, and lack of management
aligned with pollution.

<HEADLINE> Provincial Leaders on Ways to Boost Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Four provincial governors, who are
here attending the ongoing annual session of the National People's
Congress, talked about ways to develop the economies of their
respective provinces.
</P>
<P>
Northeast China's Liaoning Province is going to boost the
local economy by promoting progress in science and technology and
developing education, especially with funds from the private
sector, said Provincial Governor Zhang Guoguang.
</P>
<P>
Governor Li Jiating of Yunnan Province, southwest China, said
the provincial government will give priority to increasing farmers'
income, enterprises' economic returns and government's tax revenue.
</P>
<P>
Jiang Zhuping and Niu Maosheng, governors of the northern Hebei
Province and central Hubei Province, both attached great
importance to stimulating domestic demand to accelerate local
economic growth.
</P>
<P>
The development strategies as revealed by the governors seem
different, but they aim to achieve the same purpose, that of
achieving fast economic growth in 1999 in the light of local
conditions. The four provinces are either economically
underdeveloped or burdened with a difficult state sector.
</P>
<P>
Like other parts of the country, the four provinces are turning
to local consumers to find a way out for their respective
economies.
</P>
<P>
The governor of Hubei said that efforts will be made to
increase people's income and activate the local consumer market.
</P>
<P>
The province plans to invest 139 billion yuan in agriculture,
water conservancy, energy, transport and telecom sectors this year,
Governor Jiang Zhuping said.
</P>
<P>
His counterpart from Hebei, Niu Maosheng, listed three
strategies for developing the local economy: developing science,
technology and education; taking advantage of Hebei's geographical
proximity to Beijing, Tianjin and the sea; and aiming at a
sustainable development.
</P>
<P>
Hebei will make strenuous efforts to attract overseas
investment and increase exports, Niu said.
</P>
<P>
For Liaoning, an old industrial base, high hopes have been
pinned on the development of hi-tech industries, relying on its
strong industrial capacity and abundant resources. A large number
of hi-tech projects have been or will be launched in the province,
Governor Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
Liaoning will pioneer the setting up of a risk fund for hi-tech
projects and grant loans to local small and medium-sized hi-tech
companies, the governor said. "Firms that are too outdated for
technical upgrading will be reinvigorated through the introduction
of mature high technology in the form of technology transfers,
technology investment as equity or joint production," he said.
</P>
<P>
For Yunnan Province, the forthcoming World Horticulture
Exposition, which will last from May 1 through December 31, could
be the best opportunity to boost its backward, agriculture-based
economy.
</P>
<P>
This year Yunnan plans to reduce the number of local poverty-
stricken population by one million and deal with money-losing
state enterprises in real earnest, the provincial governor said.

CAIRO, March 5 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items

claiming the lives of 270 passengers.

<HEADLINE> Manila Issues Asia's First Euro-Denominated Bonds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Philippine Finance Secretary
Edgardo B. Espiritu announced here Friday that his country has
launched Asia's first sovereign euro-denominated bond issue.
</P>
<P>
Jointly book-run by J.P. Morgan, Warburg Dillon Read and
Deutsche Bank, with Goldman Sachs as joint lead manager, the
euro-denominated bond offering was increased immediately from 250
million euro to 300 million euro when the bonds were freed to
trade Thursday in London, he said.
</P>
<P>
The issue was priced at par to yield 425 basis points over the
bond due in July 2004 for an 8-percent coupon and 5.5-year
maturity, he said.
</P>
<P>
The first stage of the transaction was carried out last week
when government officials participated in a six-city road show by
visiting European investors. The majority of the investors
targeted were new ones to the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
"The transaction is strategically important to the republic as
it allows the republic to tap a completely new Pan-European
investors base following the 1.2-billion-U.S.-dollar global
offering earlier this year," the secretary said.
</P>
<P>
"I am very pleased with the results of the sale's
distribution," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Finance Department said that the Philippines'
euro-denominated bonds are currently strongly at par in the
secondary market, a tribute to the borrower and underscoring the
country's reputation as an experienced "market pragmatist."

<HEADLINE> Duma Speaker Welcomes Berezovsky Removal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Russian State Duma Speaker Gennady
Seleznyov on Friday welcomed President Boris Yeltsin's decision to
sack Boris Berezovsky as executive secretary of the Commonwealth
of Independent States (CIS).
</P>
<P>
"This is a correct decision because Berezovsky has recently
been more involved in political intrigues than attended to his
duties at the executive structure of the CIS," the head of the
lower house of parliament said.
</P>
<P>
Berezovsky was fired because he had exceeded his
responsibilities as chief administrator of the loose 12-nation
alliance of former Soviet republics, the Kremlin said on Thursday,
adding that Yeltsin would seek the approval of the other CIS
leaders.
</P>
<P>
"I believe that if Russia has such an opinion, Berezovsky
cannot remain in his post," Seleznyov said.
</P>
<P>
Technically, if any country of the CIS is against Berezovsky's
dismissal, he cannot be removed, but none is likely to protest the
move. Azerbaijan and Georgia have expressed surprise at Yeltsin's
decision.
</P>
<P>
Primakov has publicly criticized Berezovsky for meddling in the
Cabinet's work, and several recent police raids. Probes have
targeted companies believed to be controlled by Berezovsky, who
was named CIS executive secretary last March.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin named Ivan Korotchena of Belarus, the previous
executive secretary, as the acting replacement.

<HEADLINE> Share Prices Soar in Tokyo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, March 5 (XINHUA) -- Stock prices skyrocketed in Tokyo on
Friday for the third trading day of advance, with the key Nikkei
index jumping above 14,800 for the first time in 12 weeks.
</P>
<P>
The Nikkei stock average of 225 selected issues on the First
Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange registered the largest one-day
gain this year, rising 710.55 points, or 5.01 percent, from
Thursday's close to end at 14,894.00.
</P>
<P>
The big jump was attributed to the sharp rise of stock prices
Thursday on Wall Street and favorable moves in the bond and
foreign exchange markets.
</P>
<P>
The broader-based Tokyo Stock Price Index (TOPIX), covering all
First Section issues, advanced 41.61 points or 3.77 percent to 1,
146.72.
</P>
<P>
Turnover on the major section ballonned to 669.85 million
shares from 389.44 million shares Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Toshiba Corp., which said it plans to set up a joint company
with Sony Corp. to produce a 128-bit central processing unit for
Sony Corp.'s next video machine, was the day's most heavily traded
issue.
</P>
<P>
Investors' appreciation to the application by Japan's 15 major
banks for more than 7 trillion yen (57 billion dollars) in public
funds to liquidate their bad loans also lead bank issues higher, a
dealder said.
</P>
<P>
Of the issues listed on the First Section, gainers overwhelmed
losers 1,146 to 89, with 71 issues ending unchanged.

<HEADLINE> Beijing, Provinces to Boost Infrastructure Construction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Chinese capital Beijing and two
provinces are to boost the construction of infrastructure projects
and hi-tech industries to drive the growth of their economies this
year, according to their leaders who are here attending the Second
Session of the Ninth National People's Congress (NPC), the country'
s highest lawmaking body.
</P>
<P>
Beijing plans to pump some 120 billion yuan (about 15 billion U.
S. dollars) into the infrastructure projects this year, mayor Liu
Qi said here this morning.
</P>
<P>
The money will go mainly to urban utilities, technical
upgrading efforts and residential housing projects, and will
surely serve as a shot in the arm to the city's economy, Liu said.
</P>
<P>
"The massive investment will drive the local economy to grow by
about six percent," the mayor said. The city's growth target for
1999 is projected at 9 percent.
</P>
<P>
Jiangxi Province in east China, which is relatively weak in
economic strength and local infrastructure is far from
satisfactory, responded to the central government's pro-spending
policy.
</P>
<P>
"We will seize the opportunities to throw up infrastructure
facilities to stimulate our future development," said governor Shu
Shengyou who head the provincial delegation to the current NPC
session, which opened here this morning.
</P>
<P>
Jiangxi has got some funding from the central government for
resettling the people displaced by last summer's devastating
floods, said Shu.
</P>
<P>
The provinces have also set to develop hi-tech industries.
Beijing, for example, will give its full support to the
development of hi-tech zone Zhongguancun, known as the capital's
"silicon valley".
</P>
<P>
The municipal government is considering to give a freer hand to
Zhongguancun in its management by letting them adopt more flexible
policies in such areas like cross-shareholding and distribution.
</P>
<P>
Shandong province in east China will earmark 80 million yuan (
about one million U.S. dollars) as loans to the hi-tech industries
and key projects, said provincial governor Li Chunting.

<HEADLINE> Kazakhstan Calls For Broad-Based Government in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Kazakhstan Foreign
Minister Kasymzhomart Tokaev Friday called for the establishment
of a broad-based government in war-ravaged Afghanistan that serves
the interests of all warring groups.
</P>
<P>
"A government should be established in Afghanistan that
fulfills the interests of all parties in the conflict," Tokaev
told reporters upon arrival on a three-day official visit to
Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
He said he will meet the Taliban's top spokesman Wakil Ahmed
Mutawakkil during his stay in Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Mutawakkil, a close aide of Mulla Muhammad Omar, the Taliban's
paramount leader, arrived in Islamabad Thursday for talks with
Tokaev.
</P>
<P>
"It will be the first contact of Kazakhstan with the Taliban,"
Tokaev said.
</P>
<P>
He expressed support for the efforts of U.N. Special Envoy on
Afghanistan Lakhdar Brahimi for the restoration of peace and
tranquillity in the strife-worn country.
</P>
<P>
"We hope for the success of the United Nations efforts," he
said. "We are sincerely looking for restoration of peace in
Afghanistan."
</P>
<P>
He also voiced support for the proposed meeting between the
Taliban and the Northern Alliance due to take place in Asghabad,
Turkmenistan, on March 10 under the aegis of the United Nations.

<HEADLINE> More Options Available to Chinese Cell Phone Users </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 5 (Xinhua) -- China is gaining importance in the
mobile communications world, as major manufacturers of the
industry are designing and marketing the latest products catering
to Chinese consumers.
</P>
<P>
This month Motorola plans to launch its new series of double-
frequency cell phones for the Chinese market, which aims at
maximum usage of available communications capacities.
</P>
<P>
In its objectives for the Chinese market, Motorola expects to
continue its development of full display in the Chinese language.
</P>
<P>
All components of Motorola cell phones marketed in China are
manufactured and assembled in its Chinese production facilities.
</P>
<P>
Finland-based Nokia, which has the largest cellular phone
market share in China, launched right before the traditional
spring festival last month a new product model with metallic
appearance and full Chinese screen display.
</P>
<P>
The silver machine represents an obvious improvement on the
signal transmission performance and power capacity.
</P>
<P>
Sweden's Erricsson, following Nokia closely in terms of the
market share in China, have also presented the Chinese consumers
with more colors for their cell phones.
</P>
<P>
In addition to maroon, yellow, indigo and dark green, Erricsson
phones have another three colors in the market: orange, tiel and
bright green.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that China is the third largest mobile
communications market in the world, with 11 million people
subscribing to its mobile telecom systems in 1998, bringing the
total subscribers to 24 million.
</P>
<P>
However, there is still much potential to be tapped, experts
say, since the coverage of cell phones of the country is merely 2
percent, as compared to the 40 percent in developed countries.
</P>
<P>
But the demand is not simply quantity. Chinese people are
increasingly aware of the looks and the performance/price ratio.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that is why major manufactures are paying more
attention to products that represent uniqueness and individual
taste.
</P>
<P>
While the Chinese cell phone market is dominated by foreign
giants, Chinese electronics businesses are eyeing this field.
</P>
<P>
Konca, Haier and TCL are well ahead with their development
plans. TCL said it will turn out 2.5 million handsets in the
coming five years.
</P>
<P>
In order to help the growth of China's own production of cell
phones, the Ministry of Information Industry has recently
announced that it will give support to 18 domestic manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
Domestic brands have competitive prices, but they need to
improve their performance so as to be able to gain a larger market
share.

<P>
TOKYO, March 5 (Xinhua) -- The Japanese government on Friday
adopted a plan to create 770,000 new jobs in fiscal 1999 and 2000

The plan was adopted by a newly established task force on

the task force held Friday.

The plan targets health and welfare, information and
telecommunications, housing and tourism as key contributors to job
creation.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 5 (xinhua) -- The Kenyan government will soon
launch a national poverty eradication plan, said Kenyan President
Daniel arap Moi.
</P>
<P>
President Moi made the remarks at the opening ceremony of the
ASK Eldoret National Show in western Kenya Thursday.
</P>
<P>
He said that the success of the plan would depend on the
Kenyans who are required to be closely cooperated in tackling the
problem, the East African Standard newspaper reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
He said that poverty is afflicting many Kenyans to an extent
that many families are unable to meet their needs. Time for
excessive talking is over and actions are required to solve
problems facing the people, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Referring to negotiations with donors, President Moi said that
policies presented to donors must be in accordance with the ruling

the money for the intended purpose and they will be closely

<HEADLINE> Kenya Gives New Directive to Curb Abuse of Credit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 5 (Xinhua) -- The Central Bank of Kenya (CBK)
Thursday urged directors of banking institutions to restrain from
getting loans from their own organizations.
</P>
<P>
"Central Bank recommends that directors of institutions should
seek their personal or commercial loans outside their
institutions to avoid conflict of interest", the East African
Standard quoted a CBK statement as saying Friday.
</P>
<P>
The statement, issued by John Murugu, director of CBK's bank
supervision, said that the loans and other credit facilities to
other staff members will be governed by schemes approved by the
board of directors.
</P>
<P>
The new directive is aimed at curbing abuse of credit by the
bank's chief officers.
</P>
<P>
Murugu said relevant bank laws required that all loans to
directors should be unanimously approved by the board directors
of the institution upon being satisfied of viability.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the loans should be made in the normal course of
business and under terms similar to those offered to ordinary
customers of the institution, the bank official said.
</P>
<P>
Murugu reminded them that once such approval was given by the
board of directors, the CBK should be informed within seven days.
</P>
<P>
Early last year, former chief executive of Kenya Commercial
Bank Alexander Kaminchia was removed from office on allegation of
getting huge loans from the bank.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHENGYANG, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Stories describing the heroic
deeds of Lei Feng, China's most famous symbol of selfless
sacrifice to the revolutionary cause, were put online today by
Fushun Mass Telecommunications of northeast China's Liaoning
Province.
</P>
<P>
Surfers may find a large number of photos of Lei Feng along
with examples of personal calligraphy, listen to recordings of
speeches before his death or visit the discussion sites at the "
Lei Feng Forum" under the website address of http://www.leifeng.
com.
</P>
<P>
Lei Feng, a native of Changsha County, in central-south China's

<HEADLINE> China to Become Third Largest Optical Cable Producer by 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 5 (Xinhua) -- China will need six million
kilometers of optical fibers or 300,000 kilometers of optical
cables by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
This will make China the world's third largest optical cable
manufacturer, according to the Ministry of Information Industry (
MII).
</P>
<P>
The MII expects the optical cable projects under construction
in Hainan Province, Chengdu in Sichuan Province and Nanjing in
Jiangsu Province to upgrade the country's overall production level.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the MII show China will be the second largest
producer of TV cables, with an annual output of 700,000 kilometers.
</P>
<P>
An official with the China National Posts and
Telecommunications Industry Corp. said the Chinese government has
put much emphasis on building optical cable networks.
</P>
<P>
Though China cannot keep up with the pace of developed
countries to extend "fiber to the home" (FTTH), which means
optical fibers are attached to end users nationwide, by 2030 due
to its low starting point, "fiber to the road" projects are being
carried out in major cities such as Beijing and Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
FTTH is expected to be a reality by 2030 in China's big cities
and will gradually extend to smaller cities.

<HEADLINE> Dangerous Rise in Beijingers' Blood Pressure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Medical analysts fear that one in
every five Beijingers suffers from high blood pressure, something
like two million people. And the incidence rate is reckoned to be
the highest in China.
</P>
<P>
In recent years the disease has emerged as the No.1 cause of
death in China and is responsible for 40 percent of illness-
related fatalities with related stroke and coronary heart disease
annually affecting 1.5 million and 750,000 Chinese people
respectively.
</P>
<P>
Now the Chinese capital is to initiate a massive blood pressure
survey among its residents in a bid to prevent the spread of
hypertension cases and related deaths.
</P>
<P>
Monitoring stations to measure people's blood pressure free of
charge are to be set up in more than 3,200 of Beijing's
residential communities and trained staff will pinpoint the
hypertense patients for treatment.
</P>
<P>
A total of one million pamphlets detailing information on
disease control will be handed out and 50,000 posters distributed
around the communities.
</P>
<P>
"Together with the operational 400 monitoring units, Beijing is
to form a hypertension-prevention network covering more than four
million urban dwellers," Jin Dapeng, deputy director of the
Beijing Municipal Bureau of Health, said today.
</P>
<P>
Over the whole country it is estimated there are more than 100
million hypertension patients with three million new cases
reported each year.
</P>
<P>
Research results suggest that 75 percent of hypertension cases
and the subsequent complications can be brought under control if
people adopt a healthy lifestyle and take preventive measures.
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately, only half of the Chinese people have had their
blood pressures measured," said Liu Lisheng, chairwoman of the
Chinese Hypertension League.
</P>
<P>
Experts attribute the rising susceptibility of Chinese to the
disease to improper lifestyles and dramatic social changes. They
point to specific causes such as obesity, high levels of
cholesterol in blood, an excessive intake of salt, smoking, mental
fatigue and the lack of physical exercise.

<HEADLINE> Manila Says Peace Process With MILF to Continue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 5 (Xinhua) -- The ceasefire agreement between the
government and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) is still
in force, along with the continuation of the peace talks between
the two sides, despite the cancellation of the meeting between
Philippine President Joseph Estrada and MILF Chairman Hashim
Salamat.
</P>
<P>
National Security Adviser Alexander Aguirre said Friday that
goodwill and rapport still exist between the government and the
MILF, as shown by their willingness to meet again later this month
to discuss the agenda of formal peace negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Aguirre said in a radio interview Friday morning that this
existing truce has allowed the government to continue its
socio-economic projects for Mindanao, which President Estrada has
pledged to transform into the country's food basket and new
industrial hub.
</P>
<P>
"What we need now is to continue with the socio-economic
development while there is a cessation of hostilities for the good
of the people in Mindanao," he said.
</P>
<P>
Estrada concluded last Monday a grueling but successful
five-day visit to Mindanao, where he inspected or launched several
government projects to spur economic growth there and determined
for himself what more still needs to be done to accelerate the
island's development.
</P>
<P>
Estrada's scheduled meeting with Salamat, however, did not push
through due to last-minute technical difficulties involving
security arrangements.
</P>
<P>
Despite the cancellation of the meeting, the peace panels of
both sides have agreed to meet again on March 25 and 26 to set the
agenda for the start of formal peace talks.

<HEADLINE> Manila Adopts New Program to Boost Tourism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 5 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine Tourism Department
(DOT) has adopted a new comprehensive program that will make
tourism a major economic sector and help the Philippines catch up
with other Asian countries in the competition for international
and domestic markets.
</P>
<P>
DOT Secretary Gemma Cruz Araneta said Friday, "The Philippines
is positioned at the epicenter of global travel and tourism growth
and development. Yet among ASEAN countries, the Philippines comes
fifth after Thailand, Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia."
</P>
<P>
To bring the Philippines out of this predicament, Araneta cited
a "rediscovery" program, consisting of the following major policy
thrusts:
</P>
<P>
- A combination of the niche and mass market strategies to
develop both special interest tourism and vacation resort
destinations oriented to both domestic and international markets;
</P>
<P>
- A cluster development approach based on the gateway and
satellite destination concept -- to develop destinations in Luzon,
Visayas and Mindanao;
</P>
<P>
- A balance development of domestic and foreign markets;
</P>
<P>
- An institutional streamlining of tourism management to ensure
the changes necessary for long term sustained growth;
</P>
<P>
- An improvement of support systems and services, such as
transport services, ground infrastructure, existing tourism plan,
and the overall peace and order climate in the country; and
</P>
<P>
-- Equal focus on resort, cultural and heritage tourism.
</P>
<P>
The DOT will also focus on developing community-based
eco-tourism and a nationwide-scale cultural tourism.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian President Meets Albright </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President B.J. Habibie
Friday gave his assurance to visiting U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright that the upcoming general elections in the
country will be conducted fairly and honestly.
</P>
<P>
The United States agrees with the Indonesian move that the
forthcoming general elections, scheduled for June 7, should take
place fairly, honestly and openly, Albright told reporters
following her two-hour meeting with Habibie here.
</P>
<P>
She also said that Indonesia might benefit from various
technical assistance offered by several nations under the
coordination of the United Nations Development Program (UNDP).
</P>
<P>
Concerning the economic situation in Indonesia, Albright said
that Washington hailed recent agreements between the Indonesian
government and the International Monetary Fund (IMF), particularly
on the bank restructuring program.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Albright conveyed President Bill Clinton's
message to Habibie, hailing the Indonesian leader's decision to
seek a peaceful solution to the East Timor issue.
</P>
<P>
East Timor was a Portuguese colony before 1975. Indonesia
announced the integration of East Timor into the country in 1976
and declared it as the 27th province, but the United Nations never
recognized the move.
</P>
<P>
In January, the Indonesian government announced a major shift
in its policy on East Timor, offering independence if the
territory rejects Indonesia's offer of special, broad autonomy
package.
</P>
<P>
When queried about the human rights situation in Indonesia, the
U.S. secretary of state said that Washington has seen an improved
rights situation in the country.
</P>
<P>
Albright arrived here Thursday from Bangkok and is here until
Friday evening.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Liu Xiaozhi walked into an office
of the Shanghai Branch of the Industrial and Commercial Bank of
China (ICBC) this morning with just an ID card and other documents
but returned home with a new personal computer.
</P>
<P>
Liu, a young company employee in this economic and financial
center of China, bought the computer, an item he has long sought,
with 5,871.60 yuan in individual consumer loans granted by ICBC.
</P>
<P>
Liu is among the first beneficiaries of a new consumer credit
program introduced by the bank to encourage spending to help boost
economic growth.
</P>
<P>
"I am planning to buy several big-ticket items this year and
this new type of loan will enable me to fulfill my will," Liu said,
adding that he will apply for more consumer credit this year.
</P>
<P>
"This is like realizing today's dream with tomorrow's money,"
Liu said joyfully.
</P>
<P>
The People's Bank of China, the country's central bank, on
Wednesday gave approval to all Chinese commercial banks to offer
consumer credit in an effort to help reactivate economic growth.
</P>
<P>
"The promotion of consumer credit will be conducive to the
sustained growth of the national economy since it will help
stimulate demand and boost industrial production," said a
spokesman for the central bank.
</P>
<P>
Because of insufficient domestic demand and sliding export
growth partly caused by the Asian financial crisis, China's
economic growth slowed to 7.8 percent in 1998. This rate was 0.2
percentage points below the official target and was low in
comparison with growth in recent years.
</P>
<P>
In anticipation of sluggish export growth this year, China has
increased its effort to boost economic growth through more
investment and greater consumption.
</P>
<P>
Along with sanctioning direct consumer credit for housing, cars,
household appliances, education, and tourism, the central bank has
also permitted a wider use of credit cards.

<P>
Loans can be extended to buyers of all types of housing, and
down payments for houses and automobiles may be reduced to less
than 20 percent of the total cost, according to the central bank.
</P>
<P>
The ICBC, China's largest commercial bank, is the first to gain
approval from the central bank to issue loans to buyers of
commodities priced at 3,000 yuan or higher. However, this new line
of credit currently is restricted to Shanghai and Tianjin.
</P>
<P>
Loan borrowers must have stable incomes and obtain a mortgage
or third party guarantees, according to official regulations
</P>
<P>
In Shanghai, mortgage-backed housing loans have totaled more
than 10 billion yuan, with an average of 300 families moving into
new houses through the use of bank loans.
</P>
<P>
The introduction of consumer credit indicates that Chinese
banks are moving their focus of financial support from
manufacturers to consumers, one economist said.
</P>
<P>
As the income level of Chinese residents rises rapidly after
two decades of market reforms, the market potential of individual
consumer credit is tremendous, he added.
</P>
<P>
However, consumer credit has run into opposition from some who
say that it is not the traditional practice of the Chinese people
to mortgage their future through borrowing.
</P>
<P>
"If I do not have enough money, I'd rather postpone my
purchasing, and I will not apply for a bank loan," said a middle-
aged man who gave only his surname, Xu.
</P>
<P>
Unlike Xu, some others complained about the complexity of
applying for a consumer loan.

<P>
WASHINGTON, March 5 (Xinhua) -- American Jan-Michael Gambill
stunned his compatriot world number one Pete Sampras 4-6, 6-3, 6-4
in the Templeton Tennis Classic in Scottsdale, Arizona Thursday
night.
</P>
<P>
About 24 hours earlier, 18-year-old Lleyton Hewitt of Australia
upset two-time U.S. Open champion Patrick Rafter, the world's No.
5 player.
</P>
<P>
Gambill handed Sampras his first loss of 1999 while winning for
the first time in three matches against the player who has been
ranked No. 1 in the world for a record six consecutive years.
Sampras, who had to withdraw from the tournament in San Jose,
California, because of an ankle injury, dropped to 4-1 this year.
</P>
<P>
During the afternoon, Goran Ivanisevic beat qualifier Hernan
Gumy of Argentina 6-4, 6-4.
</P>
<P>
In other early matches, Mark Woodforde of Australia defeated
Francisco Clavet of Spain 6-3, 3-6, 6-1 and American Justin
Gimelstob beat Fernando Vicente, another Spaniard, 7-6 (7-5), 6-2.
</P>
<P>
Ivanisevic, a left-handed Croat who has led the ATP Tour in
aces five of the last seven years, double-faulted eight times. But
he held serve all the way and needed to break Gumy just once in
each set to advance past the second round for the second time in
as many appearances in this tournament.
</P>
<P>
A three-time Wimbledon finalist who has never won a tournament
in the United States, Ivanisevic last played in Scottsdale in 1989,
when he lost to Ivan Lendl in the quarter-finals.

<HEADLINE> WB Attaches Conditions for Loan to Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, March 5 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank (WB) has attached
conditions for providing a proposed 600 million-U.S.-dollar loan
for Bangladesh's power sector reform, press reports here said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Officials were quoted as saying that the WB prescribed
immediately reforming the country's energy sector and fully
privatizing both power generation and distribution systems for
fresh lending by the donors in this field.
</P>
<P>
The WB tagged the condition to a phase-wise Adaptable Program
Lending worth 600 million dollars for carrying out the reforms,
the reports said.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, the WB offered the loan for Bangladesh's power
sector reform, ending a nine-year suspension slapped after the
country's power authorities failed to cut down high system loss
that once was as high as 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
A WB team put forward the conditions at a meeting with State
Minister for Energy and Mineral Resources Rafiqul Islam, the
reports said, quoting Energy Ministry sources.
</P>
<P>
In offering the funds, the WB said if the government made its
firm commitment that it would go by the conditions, the bank would
start disbursing the first "sub-loan" of the multi-phase loan
program.
</P>
<P>
Under the WB's "Proposal for Partnership," the government would
have to unbundle the Bangladesh Power Development Board during the
first sub-loan period, and to privatize the distribution and
generation companies during subsequent sub-loan periods, the
reports said.
</P>
<P>
According to Economic Relations Division (ERD) sources, the
Adaptable Program Lending was proposed by the WB for funding the
long-term reform action plan proposed by the bank. "Any future
World Bank lending will depend on implementation of the action
plan," an ERD official said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a high official of the Energy Ministry said that
total privatization of power generation was impossible. "We have
ensure private sector's participation in generation and
distribution....that is what we can," he said.

<HEADLINE> Small Rural Towns Boost Economic Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Small rural towns account for
approximately 25 percent of China's total GDP and are rapidly
emerging as important bases for boosting rural economic
development.
</P>
<P>
A senior official with the Ministry of Construction recently
noted that China has developed more than 55,000 small rural towns
which are home to over 50,000 specialized and wholesale markets
with accumulative annual trade volume of more than 450 billion
yuan.
</P>
<P>
Some one million township enterprises have annual output values
of over 500 million yuan each.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics show that township enterprises in small
rural towns employ over 150 million farmers and account for over
70 percent to the country's total rural output value.
</P>
<P>
The township employers will be able to hire an average seven to
eight million surplus rural laborers annually.
</P>
<P>
The rapidly increasing number of small towns will not only help
absorb large numbers of surplus rural laborers, but will also
stimulate efforts to restructure agriculture. They will also play
an important role in reducing the random migration of the rural
population to large cities.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that some 60 percent of the country's 20
million township enterprises are concentrated in small rural towns.
In addition, a large number of enterprise groups in developed
areas have annual output values of over one billion yuan each,
with the figure for some rising as high as several billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Plans call for China to develop 10,000 key satellite towns
nationwide in order to raise social and economic development in
rural areas to a new level.

<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, March 5 (Xinhua) -- World Formula One champion Mika
Hakkinen of Finland has walked away unhurt from a high speed crash
during practice for Sunday's Australian Grand Prix at Albert Park
in Melbourne.
</P>
<P>
Hakkinen lost control of his McLaren Mercedes at Turn 16 and
careered heavily into a safety barrier late in the session.
</P>
<P>
The car suffered extensive front and rear damage and was taken
back to the pits on a recovery truck.
</P>
<P>
Hakkinen slid backwards into the barrier but escaped uninjured
and walked back to the team garage.
</P>
<P>
At the time he had been setting the pace in the closing
practice session of the day and was ahead of the field by almost
half a second.
</P>
<P>
Team-mate David Coulthard was in second place when the session
was stopped due to Hakkinen's crash while the Jordan of Damon Hill
was running third.
</P>
<P>
Team boss Ron Dennis said the crash would not be too much of a
problem for McLaren.
</P>
<P>
"It just depleted the stock a little bit," Dennis said.
</P>
<P>
Ferrari star Michael Schumacher had earlier spun but then
managed to improve his time in the second practice period to lie
fifth best behind the Stewart Ford of Johnny Herbert.
</P>
<P>
The crash could cause a problem for McLaren because their spare
car did not arrive in Melbourne until Thursday.
</P>
<P>
However Dennis said the team had brought four cars to Melbourne
for the opening race.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Firms to Establish Wood-Based Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Two Myanmar state and private
timber  enterprises, in cooperation with the Yangon municipal
authorities, will jointly establish a wood-based industry in
Shwepyitha, a newly-established town in Yangon, to boost the
manufacture of value-added finished wood products in the country.
</P>
<P>
According to an agreement signed here Thursday between the
Myanma Timber Enterprise (MTE) of the Ministry of Forestry, the
Forestry Products Joint-Venture Corporation Ltd and the Yangon
City Development Committee, a wood-based industry will be
established to produce furniture for offices, schools and gardens
for local sales and export, official newspaper The New Light of
Myanmar reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
In June last year, the MTE also signed an agreement with a
local private firm to establish a wood-based industrial zone in
Dagon Myothit, another newly-established town in the capital.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, seven foreign firms from China, France, South Korea,
 Malaysia, Norway and Thailand have also reached agreements with
the MTE, setting up plywood, moulding and furniture factories in
Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
The MTE is the sole organization allowed to extract timber out
of forests in the country and it undertakes logging,
transportation, milling, processing, distribution of products
within the country, and exportation.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar restricts export of logs and bans the private sector
from exporting teak logs after the enactment of the country's
forest law in 1992. However, export of value-added wood products
is encouraged.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar is rich in forest resources with forest covering about
50 percent of its land area. Myanmar's forestry sector rose 1.3
percent in production in the 1997-98 fiscal year, accounting for 1
percent of the country's gross domestic product in the output
value.

BRUSSELS -- A February survey published on Thursday by the
European Commission showed "Buoyant" consumer confidence and
disappointing industrial confidence both in the 11-country euro
zone and the 15-nation European Union region.
</P>
<P>
The February survey results show the consumer confidence
indicator rose for the EU as a whole, whereas it remained
unchanged in the euro zone. The strong confidence among consumers
was largely due to the positive attitude towards making major
purchases at present, the survey said. (EU-Indicator)

<HEADLINE> Singaporean PM Holds Grave Fears for World Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Singaporean Prime
Minister Goh Chok Tong said Friday he had grave fears for the
world economy, particularly the "huge bubble" of the U.S. stock
market.
</P>
<P>
Goh told a business lunch in Melbourne that while Singapore had
come through the Asian crisis with its structures largely intact,
he was apprehensive about future prospects, the Australian
Associated Press reported.
</P>
<P>
"Looking into the future, I remain quite apprehensive in the
short term; I am not sure how the world economy will shape up."
</P>
<P>
"I think it will be OK for the next 12 months but the 12 months
(after) I am a little anxious," he said.
</P>
<P>
Goh, who arrived in Sydney Sunday for a state visit, said the
stock market was heavily over-capitalized.
</P>
<P>
"It is a very huge bubble ... the question is whether there
will be a soft landing or it will be a sudden panic and capital
flow-out of the stock market with consequences for Europe, Asia
and all of us," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said he saw Singapore's future in investing in its people's
education and computers, and building a knowledge-based economy,
although Singapore had fared better than other countries in the
region due to its fundamentals.

<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka earned 6.7 billion
rupees (97.1 million U.S. dollars) from fish exports last year,
recording a 49-percent growth over the previous year, the official

</P>
<P>
Frozen fish exports have also increased significantly to 3,680
metric tons from 2,676 metric tons in 1997.
</P>

export oriented fisheries and aquiculture projects, said the
report.
</P>
<P>
Among ongoing programs are the development of infrastructure
facilities, provision of fiscal incentives and relaxation of
investment procedures.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh Court Disposes Case Against PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, March 5 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladesh Supreme Court has
disposed of a petition seeking contempt proceedings against Prime
Minister Sheikh Hasina for her reported remarks concerning the
highest court of justice, press reports said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Chief Justice A.T.M. Afzal pronounced a brief judgment on
Thursday at a full bench of the Appellate Division with the
remarks: "The application is disposed of with observation."
</P>
<P>
Details of the judgment with the observation were not
immediately available.
</P>
<P>
Supreme Court Bar Association President Habibul Islam Bhuiyan
filed a contempt petition against Hasina in early February,
charging her of making remarks in late January against the
judiciary.
</P>
<P>
Hasina reportedly told a press conference that the High Court
Division had granted bails to 1,200 people in two days on August
25 and 26. The High Court had granted bails to only 367 people
before it went on vacation, according to Bhuiyan.
</P>
<P>
Following the petition, the Supreme Court passed an order
asking for a signed statement from the prime minister within two
weeks. This was the first time in the country that a contempt
petition had been moved against an incumbent prime minister and
the country's highest court had asked for a written statement from
the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Hasina's reply was submitted by the attorney general on
February 17, but the court did not pass any order on that day.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Tibet Sees Great Changes in Ownership of Material Wealth (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, March 5 (Xinhua) -- In north Tibet's Baingoin County at
the side of Nam Co Lake, Herdsman Conyi's family now has more than
200 yaks and 300 sheep and last year, he spent about 100,000 yuan
to buy a truck.
</P>
<P>
The Conyi is just one of thousands of herdsman households in
Nagqu Prefecture where there are now more than six million
domestic animals. Statistics show that number of domestic animals
per capita in Nagqu have reached more than 200.
</P>
<P>
But four decades ago before the democratic reform started in
Tibet, herdsmen like Conyi had no cattle and they had to work as
herdsmen for serf owners to make a living.
</P>
<P>
Under the serfdom system, which started in the 13th century in
Tibet, an overwhelming proportion of material wealth was in the
hands of the serf owners who accounted for less than five percent
of Tibetans.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics from the early Qing Dynasty (
1644-1911), there were then about 200,000 hectares of arable land
in Tibet; 30.9 percent belonged to local government officials, 29.
6 percent owned by aristocrats and 39.5 percent by lamaseries. The
serf owners also owned almost all of the domestic animals.
</P>
<P>
Under the serfdom system, represented by feudal lords having
possession of production materials and wealth, Tibetan serfs were
deprived of basic living conditions and were in bondage to the
serf owners.
</P>
<P>
Sociologists noted that the ownership of material wealth in old
Tibet is a mixed product of a slave system and a feudal system. It
was essentially a feudal exploitation system based on a land
system where landlords own lands as well as serfs.
</P>
<P>
The major means for Tibet's feudal suzerains to seize the
region's wealth involved usury and more than 30 kinds of
exorbitant taxes and levies imposed on serfs.
</P>
<P>
Every lord, Dalai lama and living Buddha in old Tibet were debt
collectors and the Dalai lama especially had two debt collecting
agencies working on his behalf.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Tibet Sees Great Changes in Ownership of Material Wealth (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Nearly all serfs in old Tibet owed debts to their owners. In
Dagze County, Cering Zhoima's father once borrowed 56 kilograms of
seeds from Gandain Monastery. At the time when democratic reform
was carried out in Tibet in 1959, Cering Zhoima was told that the
amount of the seeds owed, including capital and interest, had
increased to 3,500 kilograms.
</P>
<P>
Once the democratic reform had been implemented the feudal
serfdom system came to an end and ownership of material wealth has
undergone fundamental changes.
</P>
<P>
About one million serfs, which accounted for 95 percent of the
Tibetan population, won their basic human rights. Some 190,000
hectares of arable land and other means of production which were
confiscated or bought out from feudal lords were re-distributed to
the serfs.
</P>
<P>
Due to the weak economic foundation in Tibet, the Central
Government has allocated more than 40 billion yuan to the
development of infrastructure projects, farming, livestock,
industry, and cultural, educational and medical services in the
past four decades.
</P>
<P>
Since 1980, the Central Government adopted a preferential
policy toward Tibetan farmers and herdsmen. The policy is for
farmers to cultivate land independently and for herdsmen to own
the domestic animals they raise. Farmers and herdsmen are exempt
from agricultural and livestock taxes.
</P>
<P>
The preferential policy and the financial aid from the Central
Government have laid a solid foundation for Tibetan farmers and
herdsmen to get rid of poverty and become well off.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to economic development in the past four decades, the
value of property of an average Tibetan household is on the
increase.
</P>
<P>
In 1950, about 90 percent of Tibetans had no houses. Now the
floor space per capita in the rural areas is 20 square meters and
that in the urban areas around 14 square meters.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, the fixed value for production in every Tibetan
household reached more than 8,000 yuan; for per 100 households in
the rural areas, there were nine automobiles, six tractors, three
wheat threshers and 12 horse-drawn carriages. There are also a
number of households whose fixed value exceeded one million yuan.
</P>
<P>
The success in democratic reform and the social and economic
development in Tibet have made the people become the real owners
of the wealth they created.

<TEXT>
<P>
ZAGREB, March 4 (Xinhua) -- More than 10,000 people die from
cigarette smoking every year in Croatia. The habit is also
believed to be responsible for 90 percent of cancer cases and may
result in an annual financial loss of 1.6 to 3.5 billion kuna (
258 to 565 million U.S. dollars), reported the official Courier
newspaper on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Parliamentary members, who are discussing a draft of the
Smoking Limitation Act, are deliberating on the consequences
brought on by smoking. The Croatian government has appropriated 5
million kuna (806,000 dollars) from this year's budget for
relevant medical funds.
</P>
<P>
Smoking is prevalent throughout Croatia, especially among young
girls. Many school students start smoking in elementary school.
The draft legislation will demand government measures to prevent
juveniles from smoking by establishing an age limit that will bar
persons under the age of 18 from smoking and purchasing cigarettes.

<HEADLINE> Premier Zhu on China's Diplomatic Work </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 5 (Xinhua) -- China will unswervingly take
strengthening and consolidating unity and cooperation with the
vast number of developing countries as the basis of its diplomatic
work, said Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji today when delivering his
government work report to the Second Session of the Ninth National
People's Congress (NPC).
</P>
<P>
Reviewing the successes in China's diplomatic work in 1998, the
Chinese premier said: "The Chinese government will continue to
implement Deng Xiaoping's thinking on diplomatic work, and will,
as always, adhere to an independent foreign policy of peace,
resolutely defend China's independence, sovereignty, territorial
integrity and national dignity, oppose hegemonism and maintain
world peace."
</P>
<P>
"We will continue to develop good neighborly relations with the
surrounding countries. We will further improve and develop
relations with developed countries on the basis of the Five
Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. We will engage in exchange and
cooperation with all other countries in the world in economic,
trade, science and technology, cultural and other fields on the
basis of equality and mutual benefit," added the Premier.
</P>
<P>
Zhu continued to say that China will play an active part in the
affairs of the United Nations and participate in multilateral
cooperation with a positive and pragmatic attitude, work with the
countries concerned to prevent and defuse financial risks and
promote steady Asian and even global economic growth, and work to
expedite the establishment of just and equitable new international
political and economic orders and make contributions to the lofty
cause of peace and development of mankind.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of the international situation, Zhu said the year 1998
witnessed further development of the trend toward multipolarity in
the world and economic globalization and the ongoing changes in
state-to-state relations, especially in the relations among big
countries.
</P>
<P>
"The international situation on the whole has become less tense,
but crises arose frequently and turbulence erupted one after
another and the world was far from peaceful and tranquil," the
Chinese premier said, adding that hegemonism and power politics
still exist, sometimes in salient forms.
</P>
<P>
"The impacts of the Asian financial crisis spread to the rest
of the world, sending strong shock waves throughout the world
economy. Safeguarding economic security has become an urgent issue
for many countries, especially the developing countries." stressed
Zhu in his government work report.

<P>
He then said that China continued to develop science,
technology, education, and other social undertakings during the
period, and the living standards of both urban and rural residents
improved further.
</P>
<P>
Pointing to various difficulties and problems China faces today,
Zhu cited the sluggish market, difficulties of some state-owned
enterprises, deteriorating environment, severe official corruption,
and increasing uncertainties on the world financial market and in
global economy.
</P>
<P>
He then listed numerous favorable factors and promised to do a
better job in every field in 1999.
</P>
<P>
About one-ninth of the report was devoted to further increasing
domestic demand and following a pro-active fiscal policy, which
were described by the Premier as "effective means to stimulate
economic growth when overall demand is sluggish."
</P>
<P>
China's fiscal deficit is set at 150.3 billion yuan in 1999, up
54.3 billion yuan from last year, and the infrastructure sector
will continue to benefit the most from the increased fiscal
spending this year, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
As for the agriculture sector, the Premier proposed to readjust
and optimize the agriculture structure, strengthen capital
construction in agriculture, promote reforms of the grain
marketing system, restructure the township enterprises and promote
the development of small towns, reduce the burden on farmers and
maintain rural stability.
</P>
<P>
He also promised increased effort in reducing poverty, saying
that China will strive to reduce its poverty-stricken population
by more than ten million this year.
</P>
<P>
On state enterprise reform, the premier focused on three key
points, which spelled out to be putting a stop to redundant
development and accelerating industrial restructuring and
reorganization, guaranteeing the basic needs of workers laid off
from the state enterprises and helping them find new jobs, and
separate the functions of the government from those of the
enterprises, improve the supervisory system and consolidate the
leadership of the enterprises.

BEIJING, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji today
promised that his government would do a better job in every field
this year, in spite of the numerous difficulties and uncertainties
ahead both at home and abroad.
</P>
<P>
"The targets for reforms and development set at the beginning
of last year were basically attained," said Premier Zhu in his
government work report, adding that his government will "work hard
to do a better job in every field in 1999."
</P>
<P>
Zhu delivered his government work report to the Second Session
of the Ninth National People's Congress (NPC) which opened here
this morning.
</P>
<P>
The 32-page report, totaling more than 15,000 Chinese
characters, has ten parts: review of the work in 1998 and general
requirements for the work in 1999; continuing to expand domestic
demand and implementing a pro-active fiscal policy; promoting all-
round development of agriculture and the rural economy; redoubling
efforts to promote the reform of state-owned enterprises; working

difficulties and scored great achievements," said the Premier in
his government work report.
</P>
<P>
China's economy grew 7.8 percent last year, a little below the
goal of eight percent. "Attaining 7.8 percent in economic growth
was not easy given the impact of the Asian financial crisis and

the financial order and prevent financial risks.
</P>
<P>
Pointing to China's pledge not to devalue the Renminbi yuan,
Premier Zhu stressed: "experience has shown that it was entirely
correct not to devalue the Renminbi. A stable Renminbi
contributes not only to economic stability and development in
China but also to financial and economic stability in Asia and
even in the world as a whole." He reiterated that China will
adhere to this stand of not devaluing the Renminbi this year.
</P>
<P>

technology with the economy and make education a strategic

government will continue to straighten out the economic order,
crack down on economic crimes, and improve social security to

</P>
<P>
Emphasizing the necessity to keep the government strictly in
line, the Chinese premier called for governments at all levels and
all government departments further modify functions and improve
efficiency, and greater efforts be made to build a clean and
honest government, punish corruption, and further carry on the
institutional restructuring program in local governments.
</P>
<P>
He also touched on topics such as the nationalities, religion
and national defense, saying that the reduction of China's armed
forces by another 500,000 has been going on smoothly.
</P>
<P>
When talking about the peaceful reunification of the motherland,
Premier Zhu pointed out that the principle of "one country, two
systems" has been fully implemented since the return of Hong Kong
to the motherland. He also expressed his belief in a smooth
return of Macao this December, reiterated China's firm opposition
against the "independence of Taiwan", and called for "practical

<P>
Raising the level of the dialogue and reinforcing mutual
understanding; contributing to the harmonious development of
energy policy worldwide; creating conditions for an expanded
presence of European companies in China are the fundamental
elements for a new dimension in EU-China energy relations at the
dawn of the 21st century, he said.
</P>
<P>
The discussions at the energy conference covered electricity,
coal, gas, oil, renewable and energy efficiency. It will be
regarded as a major opportunity for consolidating existing EU-
China links, establishing new ones, and providing an update on the
most recent developments, EU officials said.
</P>
<P>
Energy cooperation between EU and China dates back to the early
1980s, one of the cooperation fields explicitly mentioned in the
Trade and Economic Cooperation Agreement signed between the then
European Community and China in 1985.

<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka and India are making
great efforts to reach a compromise on the endangered free trade
agreement bewteen the two countries signed last December, informed
sources said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Indian officials expressed confidence that such a compromise
could be achieved regarding to the negative list of goods for
which concessionary tariffs will not be granted, said the sources.
</P>
<P>
On the question of the controversial inclusion of tea, rubber
and coconut in India's negative list, Indian officials said that
the lists were not final.
</P>
<P>
A Sri Lankan Foreign Ministry spokesperson said that
consultations were under way and that "a finality has not been
reached."
</P>
<P>
The negative lists were informally exchanged early this week
and the free trade agreement, which was to have come into effect
on March 1, was suspended pending the approval of the negative
lists.
</P>
<P>
India is faced with allegations of bad faith from all quarters
of Sri Lankan business who charged that India given its enormous
production base could smother Sri Lanka's domestic industry.
</P>
<P>
At present Sri Lanka exports to India value only at 42 million
U.S. dollars while imports from India total 560 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
With the exclusion of tea, rubber, coconut and textiles,

<HEADLINE> Iran Views Khatami's Visit to Italy as Turning-point </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Mohammed Khatami's
March 8-11 visit to Italy represents "a turning point not only for
relations between Iran and Italy but with Europe as a whole,"
Iranian Ambassador in Rome Ali' Ahani said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
He said that Europe and the West are "showing a better
understanding of Iran. In the past, they were perhaps influenced
by negative propaganda on the Iranian reality."
</P>
<P>
He also added that Khatami's polices, in favor of detente and
dialogue between different cultures, are being followed with
greater interest.
</P>
<P>
"Those who do not want to see this dialogue develop," Ahani
said, "Say there is no democracy in Iran, that we do not respect
human rights, that women are segregated, but the facts show
differently."
</P>
<P>
Business will be an important subject during Khatami's visit,
Ahani said. "Businessmen invest where they know their investments
return profits. Thus, if businessmen go to Iran, that means there
is profit to be had. If there was instability, no one would have
invested there."
</P>
<P>
Last Monday, Italy's national fuels group Eni, and ELF of
France, struck a close to one-billion-dollar deal with Iran to
pump crude from the Doroud off-shore reserve in the northern
Persian Gulf.
</P>
<P>
President Khatami chose Italy for his first visit to Europe,
and the first-ever by an Iranian president since the 1979 Islamic
Revolution, "because Italy has always played a constructive role
for dialogue between Iran and Europe," explained Ahani.
</P>
<P>
The election of Khatami as Iranian president two years ago has
contributed significantly to softening the European Union's line
with Iran and paving the way for restored economic and political
links.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Thrift Banks' Problem Loans Reported </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Manila, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Soured loans or so so-called
nonperforming loans (NPLs) of the Philippines' thrift banks
increased to 16 percent of the total loans last year from only 10
percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
This was disclosed Thursday by Deputy Governor Alberto V. Reyes
of the Central Bank of the Philippines (BSP) at the national
convention of the Chamber of Thrift Banks.
</P>
<P>
Based on the latest BSP data, thrift banks' NPLs amounted to
some 21.968 billion pesos (549.2 million U.S. dollars) against a
total loan portfolio of 137.3 billion pesos (3.43 billion dollars)
at the end of September 1998.
</P>
<P>
Reyes attributed the sharp increase in NPLs to the Asian
contagion which made it difficult for even small-scale borrowers
to meet obligations and to new government rules designed to shield
the banking system from further harm.
</P>
<P>
However, thrift banks "continue to be in good financial health"
despite the sharp increases in NPLs, Reyes said.
</P>
<P>
In a bid to strengthen its financial soundness, the thrift bank
sector over-complied in its loan-provisioning, allocating a
weighted 4.12 percent of banks' total loan portfolio as of
September 1998, according to data furnished by the Philippine
Deposit Insurance Corp.

RIO DE JANEIRO, March 4 (Xinhua) -- The Interamerican

help finance growth and expansion endeavors for new and existing
small Brazilian firms, an IDB official said on Thursday.

fund will be available within the next 18 months.
</P>
<P>
He said small companies concentrated in economically dynamic
sectors could provide more job opportunities and reduce the high
rate of unemployment in the South American country.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, small companies usually do not have enough
capital and sufficient capacity to augment their competitiveness.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 5 (Xinhua) -- The 2nd Session of the Ninth
National People's Congress (NPC), China's highest lawmaking body,
opened at the Great Hall of the People here this morning.
</P>
<P>
A total of 2,869 NPC deputies attended the opening session to
hear a government work report delivered by Premier Zhu Rongji.
</P>
<P>
At 09:00 (Beijing Time), Li Peng, executive chairman of the 2nd
Session of the Ninth NPC and executive member of the presidium of
the current session, declared the opening of the session, which
was followed by the playing of the Chinese anthem.
</P>
<P>
Top Chinese Communist Party and state leaders including Jiang
Zemin, Zhu Rongji, Li Ruihuan, Hu Jintao, Wei Jianxing, Li Lanqing
and members of the Presidium of the current session were seated at
the podium.
</P>
<P>
At 9:05 (Beijing Time), Premier Zhu Rongji started to deliver a
report on the work of the government in 1998.
</P>
<P>
China has scored great achievements in the face of the
complicated and grim economic environment at home and abroad over
the past year, and the targets for reforms and development set at
the beginning of last year were basically attained, said Premier
Zhu Rongji in his report.
</P>
<P>
China's gross domestic product (GDP) grew 7.8 percent last year
over the 1997 figure, a little lower than the planned goal of
eight percent.
</P>
<P>
"Attaining 7.8 percent in economic growth was not easy given
the impact of the Asian financial crisis and the catastrophic
floods in China," Zhu Rongji said.
</P>
<P>
At present, he said, uncertainties at the world financial
market and global economic trend are increasing, and many
unresolved and hidden problems still exist in the country. However,
he pointed out that there are also a lot favorable factors.
</P>
<P>
"We must work to unify our thinking, strengthen our confidence,
seize opportunities, press ahead despite difficulties, unite as
one and work hard to do a better job in every field in 1999." the
Chinese premier pledged in his report.

<P>
Talking about the strengthening of capital construction in
agriculture with focus on water conservancy, Zhu said allocations
for investment this year in water conservancy projects and
projects to protect natural forests in the central budget will
again increase by a sizable amount; allocations in local budgets
for this type of investment should also increase.
</P>
<P>
He warned, "We must be fully prepared to prevent major flooding
and combat heavy disasters. Before the flood season comes, we must
repair projects that were previously destroyed by floods,
reinforce dikes in key areas of the Yangtze River, the Yellow
River and other big rivers and shore up reservoirs in poor
condition in order to ensure safety in the high water season."
</P>
<P>
China needs to strengthen urban flood-prevention projects and
sea dikes and lose no time in building projects to tame major
rivers, he said, noting that the country should develop farmland
improvement and water conservancy projects which involve the
general public, encouraging farmers to work collectively or
individually to build and operate small-scale water conservancy
facilities in a variety of forms.
</P>
<P>
The premier said that China should pay close attention to
making planned and sparing use of water and spreading the use of
various types of water-saving techniques. "We must work to prevent
and control pollution and protect water resources," he said,
adding that, while paying due attention to preventing floods, the
country should prevent and fight drought as well.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that China must put in practice a strict land
management system and take measures to protect forest resources.
Logging in natural forests in the middle and upper reaches of the
Yangtze River and the Yellow River will be stopped, while in
forest areas in the northeast and Inner Mongolia and in other
natural forest areas, logging will be either restricted or
terminated, according to the premier.
</P>
<P>
He pledged that the government must not allow any more land
reclamation at the expense of forest land or land reclamation
which destroys lakes. "In places with excess reclamation of this
kind, we should restore reclaimed land to forests, grasslands or
lakes step by step. We should continue to do a good job of
rebuilding following the floods. We need to develop large-scale
afforestation and grass-growing projects and successfully carry
out major ecological projects and control soil erosion so that
future generations can enjoy green mountains and rivers," he said.

In accordance with the principle of separating government
functions from enterprise management, grain collection and storage
enterprises should become independent in operation and be made
responsible for their own profits and losses so that they truly
change the way they operate, improve their services and make it
more convenient for farmers to sell their grain, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We need to further reform the purchase and sales system for
cotton to ensure that the price of cotton is governed by the
market under the guidance of the government," he said.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said that work will proceed to restructure town and
township enterprises and promote the development of small towns.
</P>
<P>
Development of town and township enterprises will be combined
with the promotion of industrial management of agriculture.
Efforts will be made to develop the processing of grain and other
farm produce to stimulate the conversion of grain into other
products and increase its value, he said.
</P>
<P>
Accelerating the development of small towns is a major strategy
for economic and social development, he noted, saying, "We should
do a good job of carrying out the experiment with reform of the
household registration system in small towns and formulate
investment, land and real estate policies to support small town
development."
</P>
<P>
In developing small towns, it is necessary to make scientific
plans, aim for rational distribution, ensure the economical use of
land and work to protect the ecological environment, avoiding
rushing headlong into action, he said.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that China should lighten burdens on farmers
and maintain rural stability. "The pressing task at hand is to
stop the practices of the arbitrary levying of charges, arbitrary
fund-raising, arbitrary imposing of quotas and arbitrary levying
of fines, resolutely canceling all such charges the state has
ordered to be banned," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
The premier made it clear that farmers will still be subject to
a fixed number of rational and limited charges and fees which will
remain unchanged for three years. "We should lose no time in
formulating and implementing plans for changing these charges and
fees into taxes, protect the legitimate rights and interests of
farmers and completely resolve the problem of heavy burdens they
bear," he said.
</P>
<P>
Efforts will be made to expand democracy at the grassroots
level in rural areas, promote the self-government of villagers and
ensure that village affairs are made known to villagers, he said,
calling on rural cadres at the grassroots level to change their
work style and maintain close ties with the masses.
</P>
<P>
He said the government should step up its efforts to fight
poverty. "This year, we should strive to decrease the number of
poor people in rural areas by 10 million or more and ensure that
those who have shaken off poverty will not become poor again," he
said.

<HEADLINE> Premier on Reform of State-Owned Enterprises (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Premier Zhu Rongji said that the
goal set by the Party Central Committee to get most large and
medium-sized state-owned enterprises operating at a loss out of
their plight within three years will be reached.
</P>
<P>
The premier expressed his confidence in a government work
report he delivered at the Ninth National People's Congress, which
begins its annual session here today.
</P>
<P>
The year before, the Party Central Committee proposed that
within three years, through reform, reorganization, upgrading and
improved management, most large and medium-sized state-owned
enterprises operating at a loss should get out of their plight.
</P>
<P>
"This is a crucial year for achieving the objective," he said.
"We are now clear about the general approach and principles and
policies for reform of state-owned enterprises."
</P>
<P>
A group of enterprises have developed and grown strong in the
midst of market competition and some enterprises have gotten out
or are now getting out of difficulty, accumulating a great deal of
useful experience along the way, he noted.
</P>
<P>
"So long as we work together and do solid work, we are
confident that we can achieve our reform and development
objectives for state-owned enterprises," he said. "The most
important thing for us now is to unify our thinking and
unswervingly carry out principles and policies formulated by the
Party Central Committee."
</P>
<P>
This year governments at all levels should focus on the
following objectives, he said:
</P>
<P>
First, redundant development should be stopped and industrial
restructuring and reorganization accelerated. With the exception
of a number of projects designed to raise the technological level
of production, upgrade products and manufacture marketable
products, governments at all levels should stop examining and
approving industrial development projects and banks should stop
granting loans to them.
</P>
<P>
The government should continue to reduce excess production
capacity in the textile, coal, metallurgical, petrochemical,
building materials, machine-building, electronics and light
industries. "We should resolutely eliminate small enterprises
which are technologically backward, waste resources, produce
inferior products and cause serious pollution," he said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the premier said, following the principle of
breaking up monopolies and encouraging competition, the government
should form technologically advanced, competitive enterprise
groups through association, merger and reorganization. He said, "
If we persist in this effort for a few years, we shall gradually
form a mechanism for selecting the superior and weeding out the
inferior, thus creating a good macro environment and good market
conditions for the development of enterprises."

<P>
Third, the government should promote a separation of the
functions of the government from those of the enterprise, improve
the supervisory system and consolidate and improve the leadership
of enterprises, he said.
</P>
<P>
The various departments of the State Council have ended
administrative relationships with enterprises under their
jurisdiction and no longer exercise direct management of them, he
said, noting that this year local governments should also carry
out corresponding reform according to the same principle.
</P>
<P>
In addition, he said, the state must tighten its supervision
over enterprises to protect the owners' rights and interests and
the safety of state-owned assets. This year the government should
continue to send special inspectors to key state-owned enterprises,
he said.
</P>
<P>
The key to the proper operation of state-owned enterprises is
to improve their leadership, Zhu stressed, saying that it is
necessary to adhere to the principle of choosing personnel with
both political integrity and professional competence.
</P>
<P>
The government should rely on the working class wholeheartedly,
he said. "Workers should play their role in exercising democratic
supervision, and we should adhere to the system of evaluating the
leaders of enterprises at workers' conferences. We should improve
the work of evaluating the leadership of enterprises, and if the
leadership of an enterprise cannot meet set standards, it should
be reorganized within a specific term."
</P>
<P>
He stressed that leaders of enterprises operating at a serious
loss because of poor operation and management will be shown a
yellow warning card in one year and be dismissed from their posts
in two years. The government will resolutely punish in accordance
with law corrupt officials who embezzle funds and accept bribes,
he said.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that those whose enterprises yield good
economic returns and make great contributions to society should be
given rewards.
</P>
<P>
Zhu urged the establishment of a unified accounting system and
a modern enterprise management system throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
The government should continue to relax control over and
invigorate small state-owned enterprises in various ways, he said,
noting that selling them off should not be the main way to reform
them.
</P>
<P>
"We must resolutely stop erroneous practices such as selling
them off for a nominal price while in fact simply giving them away,
half selling them off and half giving them away, evading bank
debts and state taxes and not making proper arrangements for laid-
off workers," he said.
</P>
<P>
In addition to promoting reform of state-owned enterprises, the
government should adopt policies and measures to encourage and
support a sound development of collectively-owned, individual
proprietorship and private enterprises, he said.

<HEADLINE> Premier on Preventing Financial Risks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji called
for improving China's financial order and minimizing financial
risks.
</P>
<P>
Delivering a government work report to the annual session of
the National People's Congress that opened here today, Zhu
outlined the following four guidelines for financial work in years
to come:
</P>
<P>
-- to improve the country's financial system by separating the
operation and administration of the banking, securities, insurance
and trust sectors, and implement a responsibility system for
financial supervision and control;
</P>
<P>
-- to accelerate reform of state-owned commercial banks, ensure
autonomy in the operation of banks, continue to make progress in
the establishment of bank branches and sub-branches based on
economic division and workloads, streamline institutions, cut the
size of their staff, tighten internal control, and gradually set
up financial assets management companies to handle non-performing
loans now held by banks while implementing a strict responsibility
system for the quality of new loans;
</P>
<P>
-- to do a good job of operating non-commercial banks, carry
out state industrial policies and raise efficiency in fund
utilization;
</P>
<P>
-- to standardize and safeguard the financial order according
to law, inspect and rectify non-banking and local financial
institutions and reduce the risks of financial institutions; to
promote a steady development of other commercial banks and credit
cooperatives in both urban and rural areas in the process of
reform; to earnestly implement the Securities Law to standardize
and develop the securities market, rectify and standardize the
insurance market to promote a sound development of the insurance
industry, deal severely with actions of financial institutions
that violate regulations or codes of conduct, and punish financial
crimes.
</P>
<P>
The premier said that China's finances have operated smoothly
and that substantial progress has been made in financial reform.
</P>
<P>
"With the impact of the Asian financial crisis widening, the
world's financial markets in turmoil and deep-seated problems in
our own country's economic activities gradually emerging,
improvement in the performance of China's financial sector is of
vital importance to the overall interests of reform, development
and stability," Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
Banks should work hard to improve their financial services,
provide more services and use the lever of bank credit to
stimulate domestic demand and exports with a view to supporting
growth of the national economy, he said.

<P>
PANAMA CITY, March 4 (Xinhua)-- The Organization of American
States (OAS) Secretary-General Cesar Gaviria said here on Thursday
that U.S. unilateral certification on the "war against drugs" is
triggering tensions in the international community.
</P>

The OAS cheif, who was the main speaker during a gathering of
representatives from the Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA),
is anticipating a multilateral re-evaluation of the drug battles

</P>
<P>
"I have the hope that a multilateral grading system would bear
great credibility, great legitimacy and in some way will leave
behind those tensions produced by unilateral certification," he
said.
</P>
<P>
During the American states summit held in Santiago last year, a
multilateral certification was recommended and approved and
procedures and standards were to be negotiated.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that by next year all the countries will be able to
receive an evaluation of their anti-drug efforts based on
negotiated and agreed guidelines," the Colombian diplomat said.

possible to achieve an increase in exports and use more foreign
funds, Premier Zhu Rongjin said in a government work report he

</P>
<P>
The country will do its utmost to expand exports by improving
the quality of export products, diversifying market outlets and

</P>
<P>
It will also concentrate on increasing the export volume of
machinery and electronic products, products with high added value
and high-quality and famous-brand products.

more producers will be allowed to engage in export on their own to
encourage them to increase export volumes, Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
Through funding, technology and personnel training, the
country will help and encourage qualified enterprises to develop
processing trade overseas in places with potential markets, with a
view to promoting exports, he said.
</P>
<P>
He urged foreign trade firms to press forward in spite of
difficulties, deepen reform, improve management, improve economic
performance and strengthen competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
China will also increase necessary imports, improve trade
balance and integrate importing with the adjustment and upgrading
of domestic industries and technology imports, Zhu said, noting
that efforts will be made to develop international tourism and
increase foreign exchange earnings through non-trade channels.
</P>
<P>
Talking about foreign investment, the premier said the country
will take full advantage of its social and political stability and
sound macroeconomic conditions to try to absorb as much foreign
investment as possible, particularly investment from famous
transnational corporations, and improve the way foreign funds are
used.
</P>
<P>
It will properly guide the orientation of foreign investment
and optimize the utilization of foreign funds in terms of their
structure and geographical distribution.
"We will continue to improve the environment for foreign
investment, gradually open more fields to foreign investment and
improve our management of foreign-funded enterprises in accordance
with law," Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
He said the central government will strengthen overall
management of foreign debts, work to control their scale, optimize
their structure, tighten supervision and improve early warning
methods. It will strengthen the ability to repay foreign debts.
</P>
<P>
He pledged to keep exchange rates for Renminbi stable, saying
that China will strengthen management of foreign exchange revenue
and spending, maintain equilibrium in its balance of payments and
keep foreign exchange reserves stable.
</P>
<P>
It will strengthen the system of exchange settlement and sales,
ban illegal foreign exchange transactions and severely deal with
all cases of obtaining foreign exchange under false pretenses, not
turning over foreign currency owed to the government and illegal
arbitrage of foreign exchange.
</P>
<P>
"We should strengthen the forces engaged in the fight against
smuggling and extensively and persistently combat smuggling," the
premier said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 5 (Xinhua) -- China will continue to advance
science and technology, promote scientific,technological
renovation and develop education.
</P>
<P>
 Delivering a government work report to the annual session of
the National People's Congress that opened here today, Premier Zhu
Rongji said implementation of the strategy of developing the
country by relying on science and education is a major strategy
for ensuring vitality in the economy and for modernizing the
country.
</P>
<P>
"This also represents an extremely important task for the
government of this term," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the most important things to do are to vigorously
promote reform, accelerate the establishment of a state innovation
system, integrate science and technology with the economy, speed
up the translation of scientific and technological advances into
practical productive forces and widely apply them.
</P>
<P>
Enterprises should be encouraged to engage in technological
progress to enhance their technological development and innovation
abilities. While giving more guidance to major industries and key
enterprises in their technological development, the country will
upgrade traditional industries with high and new technologies,
speed up the process of using domestically-produced key equipment
in place of imports and the application of high and new technology
to production and cultivate new growth areas in the economy such
as the information industry.
</P>
<P>
According to the premier, China will promote the integration
of production, teaching and research, deepen reform of the
management of research institutes by introducing competition and
encouraging scientific and technical personnel in research
institutes and institutions of higher learning to work with
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
"Institutes engaged in applied research should be encouraged to
become science-and-technology enterprises independently or in
cooperation with others, thus remedying the problem of most
scientific and technical personnel being divorced from enterprises
and markets," Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
 He noted China will lose no time in formulating and
implementing industrial and technical policies. Efforts should be
concentrated on tackling a number of key technological problems.
</P>
<P>
Research on how to utilize scientific and technological
advances in production should be strengthened and support must be
given to developing medium-sized and small science-and-technology
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
More should be invested in research projects which have
potential markets and will yield good economic returns. Efforts
should be made to improve the protection of intellectual property
rights, the premier said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that China will try to strengthen basic research,
concentrate efforts to successfully implement plans for key basic
research projects and try to make continued progress in fields
where the country has been doing well and promote sustained
progress in science and technology.
</P>
<P>
Continuous efforts should be made to improve working and
living conditions for scientific and technical personnel, and to
establish and improve mechanisms for training and utilizing
scientific and technical personnel and for developing qualified
personnel.

"We should continue to make education a strategic priority," he
said. "We will be working to make nine-year compulsory education
available in more areas this year so that more than 80% of the
total population is covered and we will reduce the number of
illiterate young and middle-aged people by about 3 million."
</P>
<P>
China will actively work to develop vocational and adult
education in various forms, improve the overall quality of
students by ensuring that they improve in terms of their moral,
intellectual and fitness level as well as in their appreciation of
aesthetics.
</P>
<P>
"The government will be increasing investment in education in
accordance with law, making good use of educational resources and
working to raise the overall efficiency of schools," the premier
said.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said the government needs to do a number of things to
improve education. First,it should intensify reform, that is, to
modify concepts of education. Reform of the management system for
education should be made and course contents and teaching methods
renovated.
</P>
<P>
Following a scheme involving joint administration, adjustments,
cooperation and mergers, the government will further modify the
existing educational system under which schools are run by
specialized departments of the government, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We will be speeding up transition to a new system of
management for institutions of higher learning under which they
are operated at both the central and provincial levels, with most
operated by provincial governments under the guidance of the state'
s macro-control policy."
</P>
<P>
"We should deepen reform of the system of internal management
for institutions of higher learning and other kinds of schools and
explore ways for non-governmental sectors to run schools," Zhu
said.
</P>
<P>
"We should improve the quality of education in all kinds of
schools at all levels, especially primary and secondary education.
We should be strict with standards for teachers, and improve the
political and professional quality of teachers."
</P>
<P>
Zhu called for more attention to be paid to ideological,
political and moral education by educating students in Marxism-
Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought and particularly Deng Xiaoping Theory
to instill in them socialist ideals and beliefs to improve the
overall quality of the new generation.

Premier Zhu Rongji elaborated on the strategy in a government
work report he delivered at the Ninth National People's Congress,
which begins its annual session here today.
</P>
<P>
"We should always bear in mind our responsibility to the people
and our future generations...improving planning for resources and
their management, avoiding waste of resources for short-term gains,
protecting resources and making a more comprehensive use of
resources," he said.
</P>
<P>
Efforts should be made to enhance the public awareness of the
importance of environmental protection and investment should be
increased to intensify efforts to control and treat pollution in
major cities, regions, valleys and sea areas.
</P>
<P>
The premier stressed that enterprises that discharge
pollutants in levels that exceed stipulated standards should
remedy the situation within a specified time. Those that fail to
do so must be closed down.
</P>
<P>
He said control of air pollution in Beijing, the capital, is a
major task being tackled this year and asked relevant departments
of the State Council to give full support to this effort.
</P>
<P>
"We should do a better job of formulating urban and rural
development plans and strictly implement them, punishing those who
violate stipulations of the plans," he said.
</P>
<P>
Zhu called for further efforts to improve the responsibility
system for attaining population and birth control targets, adding
efforts should be focused on rural areas and the floating
population.
</P>
<P>
"We should work to overcome difficulties and solve problems
confronting family planning work at the grassroots level, truly
making people responsible for family planning work, and making
sure that proper measures are adopted and that adequate funding is
available," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to the premier, China will reform the medical
insurance system for urban workers, speed up reform of the
internal management system for medicine and public health and
develop community medical services.
</P>
<P>
In rural areas, the target is to make primary health care
available and successfully carry out epidemic prevention work in
flood-hit areas.
</P>
<P>
Zhu urged conscientious work to ensure that senior citizens be
properly cared for and the disabled be properly cared and treated.
</P>

<HEADLINE> China to Unfold Local Government Restructuring </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 5 (Xinhua) -- China will press ahead with reform
of local governments this year, following the success of central
government restructuring in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Premier Zhu Rongji expounded on strategies for local government
restructuring in his government work report he delivered to the
National People's Congress which begins its annual session here
today.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said reform of government establishments under the State
Council proceeded smoothly, with the number of ministries and
central departments having been reduced to 29 from the previous 40,
institutes within the ministries and departments having been cut
by one fourth and total staff size by half.
</P>
<P>
"The administrative set-up and government work style has taken
on a new look," Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
Talking about local government restructuring, the premier said
concrete arrangements and methods will be decided by local
governments on their own in light of general central government
guidelines and actual local conditions.
</P>
<P>
Institutions under the jurisdiction of provincial governments
should in principle cut their staff by fifty percent step by step
and in stages.
</P>
<P>
Provinces, autonomous regions and centrally-administered
municipalities will determine the percentage by which the
administrative size of cities (prefectures), county and township
(town) governments in their individual jurisdictions is to be
reduced and this percentage should be examined and approved by
authorities of the central government, Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
To ensure that things go smoothly, reform of county and
township government institutions is to be implemented next year,
he said.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that restructuring of local governments should
be well organized and well planned and that the work to redirect
redundant employees must be carried out in a careful manner so
that they will not become disheartened and that government work
can proceed in normal good order.

<HEADLINE> Premier Stresses Rule Of Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji said
today that the Chinese government will promote the rule of law,
intensify law enforcement and crack down on crimes to safeguard
social stability.
</P>
<P>
Delivering a government work report to the annual session of
the National People's Congress that opens here today, Zhu said the
central government is determined to put an end to non-enforcement
and lax enforcement of laws and relentlessly punish economic
criminals in accordance with law.
</P>
<P>
"We should strictly enforce financial and economic discipline,
tighten auditing and supervision, safeguard on-bank credit and
other types of financial agreements and strictly investigate and
prosecute people who keep nonstandard or falsified account books
and evade repayment of bank debts," Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
Great efforts should be made to put an end to all kinds of
arbitrary charges, fund-raising, fines and quotas. Administrative
charges and income from imposition of fines and confiscation of
funds should be managed by "separating revenue form expenditures,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Zhu called for tightening supervision and management of the
market, rectifying market order and severely punishing those
involved in illegal activities such as the production and sale of
fake and shoddy good.
</P>
<P>
"We should crack down on criminal offenses such as tax evasion,
tax fraud and refusal to pay taxes. Laws, statutes and
administrative regulations should be strictly enforced upon
promulgation and we should oppose regional and departmental
protectionism and see to it that all laws and administrative
decrees are carried out promptly and to the letter," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
The premier urged government authorities at all levels to make
the work of safeguarding stability a top priority, saying all
relevant departments should make a concerted effort to carry out
the responsibility system for maintaining stability.
</P>
<P>
The premier pledged to fight against violent crimes, mafia-like
criminal gangs, drug-related crimes, theft, robbery, trading in
women and children and other criminal forces and activities and to
"take the utmost precautions against sabotage by domestic and
foreign hostile forces and combat them with all our might."
</P>
<P>
Legal, economic and administrative methods should be integrated
with thorough and painstaking ideological and political work to
properly address contradictions among the people in the new
situation and resolve them promptly, eliminating such problems
before they become full-blown.
</P>
<P>
"Under no circumstances should we use dictatorial means against
the people," Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
He called governments at all levels to take the initiative to
strengthen contacts with committees of the Chinese People's
Political Consultative Conference at all levels, earnestly listen
to the opinion of the democratic parties, federations of industry
and commerce, personages without party affiliation and mass
organizations.
</P>
<P>
"We should fully promote democracy and constantly work to
improve the mechanism for promptly reporting social conditions and
popular sentiment so as to truly embody people's wishes in
government work," Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
"When deciding on important policies, especially those
involving the interests of the broad masses of the people, we must
be prudent and adopt a proper method of soliciting a wide range of
opinions," he said.
</P>
<P>
The role of the workers' conferences, urban neighborhood
committees and rural villagers' committees should be brought into
play to improve grassroots democracy. Government affairs should be
made public to strengthen democratic administration and
supervision by society, the premier said.

<P>
TEGUCIGALPA, March 4 (Xinhua)-- Central American Economic
Integration Bank President Alejandro Arevalo Thursday expressed
his confidence that U.S. President Bill Clinton's visit to Central
America would promote investment in the countries in the region
affected by Hurricane Mitch.
</P>
<P>
Arevalo said the visit would be important as it provides
opportunities for the United States and Central America to discuss
issues of migration, reconstruction and trade, such as free entry
of Central American products into North American markets.
</P>
<P>
He said that the U.S.-Central American trade should benefit
from the Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) as well as the Caribbean
Basin Initiative which favors the Isthmus.
</P>
<P>
Arevalo also urged the international financial institutions of
the World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank, to support
the Central American countries including Honduras, which have been
battered by Hurricane Mitch last October, in their economic
recovery.
</P>
<P>
Clinton is scheduled to start a four-day visit to Central
America on March 8.
</P>
<P>
The Central American nations expect the U.S. government to
lower trade barriers and give their businesses access to U.S.
market as Mexico has got from the NAFTA, not merely the 956-
million-dollar emergency aid proposed by Clinton.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Tibet Sees Great Changes in Ownership of Material Wealth (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, March 5 (Xinhua) -- In north Tibet's Baingoin County at
the side of Nam Co Lake, Herdsman Conyi's family now has more than
200 yaks and 300 sheep and last year, he spent about 100,000 yuan
to buy a truck.
</P>
<P>
The Conyi is just one of thousands of herdsman households in
Nagqu Prefecture where there are now more than six million
domestic animals. Statistics show that number of domestic animals
per capita in Nagqu have reached more than 200.
</P>
<P>
But four decades ago before the democratic reform started in
Tibet, herdsmen like Conyi had no cattle and they had to work as
herdsmen for serf owners to make a living.
</P>
<P>
Under the serfdom system, which started in the 13th century in
Tibet, an overwhelming proportion of material wealth was in the
hands of the serf owners who accounted for less than five percent
of Tibetans.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics from the early Qing Dynasty (
1644-1911), there were then about 200,000 hectares of arable land
in Tibet; 30.9 percent belonged to local government officials, 29.
6 percent owned by aristocrats and 39.5 percent by lamaseries. The
serf owners also owned almost all of the domestic animals.
</P>
<P>
Under the serfdom system, represented by feudal lords having
possession of production materials and wealth, Tibetan serfs were
deprived of basic living conditions and were in bondage to the
serf owners.
</P>
<P>
Sociologists noted that the ownership of material wealth in old
Tibet is a mixed product of a slave system and a feudal system. It
was essentially a feudal exploitation system based on a land
system where landlords own lands as well as serfs.
</P>
<P>
The major means for Tibet's feudal suzerains to seize the
region's wealth involved usury and more than 30 kinds of
exorbitant taxes and levies imposed on serfs.
</P>
<P>
Every lord, Dalai lama and living Buddha in old Tibet were debt
collectors and the Dalai lama especially had two debt collecting
agencies working on his behalf.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Tibet Sees Great Changes in Ownership of Material Wealth (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Nearly all serfs in old Tibet owed debts to their owners. In
Dagze County, Cering Zhoima's father once borrowed 56 kilograms of
seeds from Gandain Monastery. At the time when democratic reform
was carried out in Tibet in 1959, Cering Zhoima was told that the
amount of the seeds owed, including capital and interest, had
increased to 3,500 kilograms.
</P>
<P>
Once the democratic reform had been implemented the feudal
serfdom system came to an end and ownership of material wealth has
undergone fundamental changes.
</P>
<P>
About one million serfs, which accounted for 95 percent of the
Tibetan population, won their basic human rights. Some 190,000
hectares of arable land and other means of production which were
confiscated or bought out from feudal lords were re-distributed to
the serfs.
</P>
<P>
Due to the weak economic foundation in Tibet, the Central
Government has allocated more than 40 billion yuan to the
development of infrastructure projects, farming, livestock,
industry, and cultural, educational and medical services in the
past four decades.
</P>
<P>
Since 1980, the Central Government adopted a preferential
policy toward Tibetan farmers and herdsmen. The policy is for
farmers to cultivate land independently and for herdsmen to own
the domestic animals they raise. Farmers and herdsmen are exempt
from agricultural and livestock taxes.
</P>
<P>
The preferential policy and the financial aid from the Central
Government have laid a solid foundation for Tibetan farmers and
herdsmen to get rid of poverty and become well off.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to economic development in the past four decades, the
value of property of an average Tibetan household is on the
increase.
</P>
<P>
In 1950, about 90 percent of Tibetans had no houses. Now the
floor space per capita in the rural areas is 20 square meters and
that in the urban areas around 14 square meters.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, the fixed value for production in every Tibetan
household reached more than 8,000 yuan; for per 100 households in
the rural areas, there were nine automobiles, six tractors, three
wheat threshers and 12 horse-drawn carriages. There are also a
number of households whose fixed value exceeded one million yuan.
</P>
<P>
The success in democratic reform and the social and economic
development in Tibet have made the people become the real owners
of the wealth they created.

<HEADLINE> D'Alema Disconcerted by Acquittal of U.S. Pilot of Charge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Italian Prime Minister Massimo D'
Alema said on Thursday that he was disconcerted by the acquittal
of a U.S. marine pilot of the charge of involuntary manslaughter
for slicing a ski lift cable in Italy last year which killed 20
people aboard.
</P>
<P>
D'Alema, in Boston, Massachusetts, for an official visit, was
commenting on the verdict handed down earlier Thursday by a jury
of eight Marine officers in Camp Lejeune, North Carolina, on
charges against Marine Captain Richard Ashby.
</P>
<P>
D'Alema told Italian reporters that he wanted to get an
understanding of the meaning of the verdict "whether
responsibility is canceled or sent up to superiors."
</P>
<P>
He said he would raise the issue with U.S. President Bill
Clinton on Friday in the "opportune form." "But this is not a
problem just in relations between Italy and the United States,
because among the victims there were also citizens of other
nationalities," he added.
</P>
<P>
Ashby, 31, was charged following the February 3, 1998, incident
in which his EA-6B Prowler military plane severed the support
cables of the Mount Cermis cable car system near Calvalese, Italy,
killing 20 people.
</P>
<P>
The verdict was met with indignation across Italy. Italian
Interior Minister Rosa Russo Jervolino called the verdict "an
absolutely unacceptable decision."
</P>
<P>
Italian Defense Minister Carlo Scognamiglio said the verdict
runs counter to "the expectations of those who believe in justice,
and this is an unsettling result."
</P>
<P>
Head of the Committee February 3 For Justice, Beppe Pontrelli,
said that "may this deplorable verdict be a lesson for those who
applauded the justice, speed and severity of the American military
court."
</P>
<P>
Klaus Stampfl, whose mother was killed in the disaster, said "
it seems like the 20 Cermis victims are of no value, so no one is
to blame for the tragedy."
</P>
<P>
After disclosing that he attended some of the hearings in Camp
Lejeune, the young man said, "I sometimes had the impression
during the trial that they (the defendants) were almost amusing
themselves, sure that it was not a serious trial like what could
have been held in Italy."

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Plywood Exports Fall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's plywood and other wood
panel exports fell by 35 percent in 1998 to 2.5 billion U.S.
dollars due to a sluggish overseas market, the Jakarta Post
reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Tjipto Wignjoprajitno, executive director of the Association of
Indonesian Wood Panel Producers (Apkindo), said in terms of
volume, plywood exports dropped by only 3.6 percent to 8 million
cubic meters from 8.3 million cubic meters in 1997.
</P>
<P>
"The lower export value was due to weak demand and depressed
prices rising from economic crises affecting several main
importing countries, particularly Japan and South Korea," he said.
</P>
<P>
The association initially projected 3 billion dollars in
earnings from exports in 1998. Plywood exports were valued at 3.9
billion dollars in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Tjipto estimated that the world's depressed plywood market
would recover in the second quarter of this year and Indonesia's
exports would also pick up during this period.
</P>
<P>
"I am confident that we can export over 8 million cubic meters
of plywood this year," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, he said he could not predict Indonesia's foreign
exchange earnings from the exports because prices would remain
uncertain.
</P>
<P>
He said the demand for Indonesian plywood has risen in the last
two months, especially after Malaysian plywood producers cut their
exports due to the scarcity of logs.
</P>
<P>
The higher orders mostly came from Japan, he said, adding that
plywood prices in Japan currently ranged between 380 and 540
dollars per cubic meter.
</P>
<P>
Demand for plywood from other Asian countries, particularly
China, is also expected to increase significantly in April, he
added.

<HEADLINE> Premier on Government Work in 1999 (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji set
forth general requirements for government work in 1999 at the
Ninth National People's Congress in session here.
</P>
<P>
The nation should hold high the great banner of Deng Xiaoping
Theory and follow the spirit of the 15th National Congress of the
Communist Party of China and the Third Plenary Session of the 15th
CPC Central Committee, he said .
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government will continue to promote reform and
opening up, step up its efforts to implement the strategy of
developing the country by relying on science and education and the
strategy of working for sustainable development, promote economic
growth mainly through the expansion of domestic demand, stabilize
and strengthen agriculture, and deepen reform of state-owned
enterprises, he said in a government work report he delivered at
the NPC session today.
</P>
<P>
The government will continue to restructure the economy, make
great efforts to open up more urban and rural markets, do
everything possible to increase exports, take precautions against
and minimize financial risks, rectify economic order, and maintain
a sustained, rapid and sound development of the national economy,
he said.
</P>
<P>
The government will conscientiously strengthen democracy and
the legal system and promote cultural and ethical progress, work
for all-round social progress, further improve the balance of
reform, development and stability, ensure social and political
stability and greet the fiftieth anniversary of the founding of
New China with outstanding achievements in reform, opening up and
the socialist modernization drive.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said that the projected economic growth rate this year
will be around 7%. "Achieving this growth rate through optimizing
the economic structure and improving quality and economic
performance will not be easy," he said. "But it is predicted that
it can be achieved with diligent effort."
</P>
<P>
This growth rate serves as a guide which applies to the country
as a whole, but due to different local conditions, the rates of
growth for individual localities may be higher or lower, he noted.

<TEXT>
<P>
Analyzing existing difficulties and problems as well as
favorable conditions and opportunities to meet the general
requirements, the premier said, "we are fully aware of the fact
that there are not a few difficulties and problems in our way
forward." He listed main difficulties and problems as follows:
</P>
<P>
Demand for goods and services on the market is feeble and
proving somewhat difficult to stimulate. As a result, owing to
redundant development in past years, there is overcapacity in most
industries. Structural problems in the economy have become more
conspicuous, and the operation of the economy is inefficient with
low returns.
</P>
<P>
Some state enterprises have been experiencing greater
difficulties in operation, and the financial risks accumulated
over the years cannot be overlooked. Financial discipline is lax
and economic order is somewhat in disarray. Arbitrary charges,
fund-raising, quotas and fines are still a prevalent problem
despite repeated attempts to put a stop to such practices,
resulting in intolerable burdens on farmers and enterprises in
certain areas. "Life is still difficult for some of our people,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Deterioration of the ecological environment remains a glaring
problem. Some undesirable practices and corruption are still
serious and public order in some areas is not good. "We are paying
very close attention to all these problems and are taking measures
to gradually resolve them," he said.
</P>
<P>
"To achieve faster economic growth this year, we must first of
all expand domestic demand and continue to follow a pro-active
fiscal policy. As shown by last year's experience, these are
effective means to stimulate economic growth when overall demand
is sluggish," the premier said.
</P>
<P>
 Zhu pointed out that factors that lead to uncertainties in
international financial markets and the world economy have been on
the increase lately, and that international competition is
becoming increasingly fiercer, making it more difficult for China
to expand exports.
</P>
<P>
In addition, there are still quite a few unresolved and hidden
problems in China, he said, adding, "We must have a clear
understanding of these and be prepared for even more formidable
obstacles."
</P>
<P>
"At the same time, we should be aware of the many favorable
conditions," he said, noting that the policies and measures
adopted since last year, such as increasing domestic demand, are
continuing to produce positive results.
</P>
<P>
There is more potential to be tapped in the domestic market.
The premier said, "We still have relatively ample materials
reserves and foreign exchange reserves. We have gradually become
more experienced in exercising macro-control and promoting
economic development under new circumstances and developed
effective methods."
</P>
<P>
"Finally, political and social stability, sustained economic
development and deepened reform in China provide a good
environment for opening our country wider to the outside world,"
Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed, "We should unify our thinking, strengthen our
confidence, seize opportunities, forge ahead despite difficulties,
pull together as one and work hard in order to do a good job on
every front in 1999."

<P>
The premier stressed that infrastructure projects should, first
of all, be placed under overall planning, rationally distributed,
well selected and meticulously examined, and no project should be
launched rashly.
</P>
<P>
In addition, he said, "The quality of projects must be
guaranteed." He noted that recently a number of accidents have
occurred due to serious quality problems in certain projects and
resulted in heavy losses to the state. "This deserves our close
attention," he said.
</P>
<P>
The premier called for implementing the Construction Law in
real earnest.
</P>
<P>
Efforts will be made to reform, reorganize and standardize the
building market and to vigorously implement the legal person
responsibility system for projects, and the systems of public
bidding and monitoring for projects, he said.
</P>
<P>
He pledged to ban multi-level contracting and illegal
subcontracting. "We should work earnestly to implement the
leadership responsibility system at all levels, combining the use
of economic, legal and administrative means and supervision by
public opinion to ensure project quality; persons and leading
cadres who are responsible for accidents must be subjected to
strict investigation and punishment, up to and including criminal
sanctions," he said.
</P>
<P>
Misappropriation and diversion of funds raised from state bond
issues will be strictly prohibited, he said. The government will
never allow the use of such funds to make up for shortages in
routine expenditures, to initiate other construction projects or
even to finance the development of office buildings and hotels, he
said.
</P>
<P>
He said that major projects should be subject to special and
follow-up auditing. "We should strengthen law enforcement and
severely punish corruption in construction activities in
accordance with law," he said.

He said that the government should intensify tax collection and
management, plug loopholes and clear up and collect taxes in
arrears to ensure that taxes are levied according to law and that
all due taxes are collected.
</P>
<P>
The government will advocate hard work and plain living and
building the country through thrift and diligence, oppose
extravagance and waste, cut all unnecessary administrative
expenses, and ensure funding for priority areas. Financial and
economic discipline should be strict and management of extra-
budgetary funds should be standardized and tightened, he said.
</P>
<P>
The government will continue to optimize the financial and
taxation systems through reform, focusing on an overall review and
standardization of the collection of charges and gradually "
transforming administrative fees into taxes."
</P>
<P>
"This is a major move designed to straighten out the way these
funds are distributed, enhance our macro-control capability and

reform of transport and vehicle fees, then use the experience
gained for carrying out further reforms.
</P>
<P>
The premier pointed out that the decision to implement a pro-
active fiscal policy is one that has been taken under special
circumstances. "In the medium and long term, we should still
adhere to the principle of maintaining a basic balance between
revenue and expenditures, follow a moderately tight financial
policy, and strictly control and gradually reduce the deficit," he
said.

<HEADLINE> Premier on Agriculture, Rural Economy (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 5 (Xinhua) -- In 1999, the Chinese government
will stabilize its basic rural policies, increase investment in
agriculture and increase farmers' income.
</P>
<P>
Premier Zhu Rongji made the pledge in a government work report
he delivered at the 9th National People's Congress, which begins
its annual session here today.
</P>
<P>
The government will consolidate and improve the two-tier system
of unified and independent management based on household contracts,
he said.
</P>
<P>
He listed five concrete measures, namely, adjusting and
optimizing agricultural structure; reinforcing capital
construction in agriculture with focus on water conservancy;
actively promoting the restructuring of the grain distribution
system to activate the circulation of farm products; adjusting the
restructuring of township and village-based enterprises and
speeding up the construction of small towns; and alleviating
burden on farmers and maintaining stability in rural areas.
</P>
<P>
Regarding the adjusting and optimizing of the agricultural
structure, Zhu said, because of good harvests for several
consecutive years, the supply of many types of farm produce has
exceeded demand, causing their prices to fall and slowing down
growth in incomes for farmers.
</P>
<P>
This is a new problem occurring against a backdrop of increased
agricultural production and improvements in people's living
standards, he said, pointing out that China's agricultural
development has entered a new stage following two decades of rural
reform.
</P>
<P>
"In order to meet the needs of this new stage, we must shift
the focus of our rural work to restructuring and optimization
efforts and to the improvement of product quality and economic
performance.
</P>
<P>
"While maintaining the overall level of grain production this
year, we should encourage farmers to produce more high-quality and
more marketable grain varieties," he said.
</P>
<P>
The government should rationalize the distribution of cotton
farms by stabilizing cotton-growing areas in Xinjiang and reducing
those in Hebei, Shandong and Henan provinces and the Yangtze River
valley. China should also adjust the pattern of production in the
livestock industry, fishery industry and other sectors of greater
agriculture and improve product quality to keep up with changes on
the market, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We should vigorously work to develop agriculture through
science and education, strengthen the development and use of
biotechnology, information technology and other high and new
technologies, accelerate breed improvement and spread the use of
advanced, applicable techniques which can increase production and
income," he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 5 (Xinhua) -- The Second Session of the Ninth
National People's Congress (NPC), China's highest law-making body,
opened here this morning.
</P>
<P>
A total of 2,869 NPC deputies attended the opening session at
the Great Hall of People to hear a government work report
delivered by Premier Zhu Rongji.
</P>
<P>
At 09:00 (Beijing Time), Li Peng, executive chairman of the
meeting and executive member of the presidium of the Second
Session of the Ninth NPC, declared the opening of the meeting,
which was followed by the playing of the Chinese anthem.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Communist Party and state leaders including Jiang Zemin,
Zhu Rongji, Li Ruihuan, Hu Jintao, Wei Jianxing, and Li Lanqing
were present at today's meeting.
</P>
<P>
At 09:05, Premier Zhu Rongji started to deliver a report on the
work of the government in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The targets for China's reforms and development set at the
beginning of last year were basically attained and China scored
great achievements in the face of the complicated and grim
economic environment at home and abroad, said the Premier in his
report.
</P>
<P>
More than 2,000 National Committee members of the Chinese
People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) who are

<HEADLINE> N.Irish Unionist Support for Peace Deal Slumps </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 4 (Xinhua) -- A clear majority of unionists in
Northern Ireland are now opposed to the peace agreement signed
last April, according to a poll for BBC Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
The survey, which will be broadcast on BBC Two's Hearts and
Minds program at 19:30 GMT on Thursday, revealed that the pro-
British unionist support for the peace deal had fallen to 41
percent of those who responded -- a drop of 14 percent from the
estimated 55 percent who voted for the agreement in the referendum.
</P>
<P>
However, key figures in the process still continue to achieve
high approval ratings across both communities, with the assembly's
second minister, Seamus Mallon, rating top with 64 percent of
respondents judging his performance "very good" or "quite good".
</P>
<P>
Northern Ireland Secretary Mo Mowlam was second with 61 percent
and the assembly's first minister, David Trimble, third with 60
percent. Sinn Fein's Gerry Adams received 45 percent approval.
</P>
<P>
But the same survey -- one of the largest ever conducted in the
province - found that nationalist opinion remained overwhelmingly
behind the deal.
</P>
<P>
The poll also found that the contentious issue of
decommissioning paramilitary weapons continues to divide the two
communities, with a large majority of unionists against allowing
Sinn Fein to sit in the assembly without the IRA handing over any
weapons.

<HEADLINE> China Stimulating Consumer Market (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 5 (Xinhua) -- The People's Bank of China (PBOC),
the country's central bank, announced Wednesday that domestic
commercial banks will be allowed to get involved in the consumer
credit business to stimulate consumer demand.
</P>
<P>
Economists say that this signals a shift in China's economic
policy from relying on increased government spending to combining
government spending with stimulating the consumer market because
of the drop in exports, a sluggish market, and falling retail
prices.
</P>
<P>
China's fixed assets investment grew 14.1 percent last year,
contributing 63.1 percent to economic growth and playing an
important part in reversing the downward trend in the economy. But,
economists point out, the increased spending did not help consumer
spending. In 1998, the retail price index fell 2.6 percent from
the previous year and the consumer price index, 0.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
In spite of the central bank's three interest cuts last year,
individual savings deposits grew to more than five trillion yuan,
a jump of 17.1 percent or 2.5 times the growth in retail sales.
</P>
<P>
Economists say that since China now has a buyers market and the
planned economy is giving way to market forces, government
spending is not enough to stimulate domestic demand.
</P>
<P>
Consumer demand accounts for 60 percent of total market demand,
and only by generating consumer demand, can the market keep
economic growth stable, they say.

<HEADLINE> Former World Champion Leblanc Retires </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Former world road race champion Luc
Leblanc of France has retired and says he is considering suing
Italian team Polti for breaking his contract.
</P>
<P>
Leblanc, who won the world cycling championship in 1994 in
Sicily, was dropped by Polti shortly after the Tour de France
doping scandal and failed to find a new team in time for this
season.
</P>
<P>
Leblanc pulled out of the Tour when the scandal reached its
climax to protest against police raids on team hotels. He has been
one of the most outspoken advocates of tough dope tests and
sanctions.
</P>
<P>
The 32-year-old rider retired from cycling for one season, the
year after his world title, following the collapse of his
Groupement team.
</P>
<P>
His world title in 1994 was the highlight of his 12-year career,
but he also won two Tour de France stages and held the yellow
jersey in 1991.

A senior PBOC official explains that the decision to diversify
and increase consumer credit services followed last year's policy
to support commercial loans for individuals to buy housing and
automobiles.
</P>
<P>
Wang Wei, of the State Council's Development Research Center,
says that the policy of increasing consumer credit is helpful for
increasing domestic demand and will benefit the consumer market in
the long term. People with medium-level incomes, who account for
45 percent of urban residents, will most likely want consumer
credit, he says.
</P>
<P>
But, the reduced expectations of consumers as a result of the
slowdown in wage increases coupled with the housing and medicare
reforms, will hinder the development of consumer credit a great
deal, Wang adds.

<HEADLINE> 1998's Goal for Growth Basically Reached, Premier (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji said
today that in the face of a complicated and grim economic
environment at home and abroad over the past year, people of all
ethnic groups in China worked hard together, surmounted numerous
difficulties and scored great achievements in carrying out reform
and opening up policies and in the socialist modernization drive.
</P>
<P>
"The objectives for reform and development defined at the
beginning of the year were basically attained," Zhu announced.
</P>
<P>
The premier made the remark while delivering a report on the
work of the government to the National People's Congress now in
session in the Chinese capital.
</P>
<P>
Last year the national economy continued to grow at a
relatively rapid speed, with the gross domestic product for 1998
increasing by 7.8% over the previous year. He noted that the
increase was slightly lower than the targeted figure of 8%, but
attaining 7.8% was not easy given the impact of the Asian
financial crisis and catastrophic floods in China.
</P>
<P>
"To protect ourselves against the effects of the Asian
financial crisis, we adopted a policy of increasing investment and
boosting domestic demand at the beginning of last year. However,
the crisis became broader and deeper than we had anticipated,
exerting more of an impact on China than we had expected," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to the premier, in the first half of 1998, the
economic growth rate slowed down because of a sharp decline in
export growth and inadequate domestic demand to keep the economy
growing.
</P>
<P>
To address this problem, the central authorities resolutely
made a decision to adopt a pro-active fiscal policy. After the
National People's Congress approved necessary changes in the
budget for 1998, the State Council issued an additional 100
billion yuan worth of treasury bonds for investment in
infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
As a result, growth of fixed-asset investment in state-owned
enterprises was much more rapid in the second half of the year,
increasing by 19.5% for the year as a whole. National fixed-asset
investment in all segments of the economy increased by 14.1%. This
considerable increase in investment played an important role in
fueling economic growth.

<HEADLINE> Over Five Tons of Marijuana Seized in Venezuela </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, March 4 (Xinhua)-- The Venezuelan National Guard has
seized 5.54 tons of marijuana, the largest quantity so far this
year, said military sources on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The drugs were hidden in 300 packs of potatoes transported in a
bus, which was stopped in the municipality of Paracal in Tachira,
some 30 kilometers from the border with Colombia and about 710
kilometers west of the capital, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The soldiers held the driver and his helper as they presented
forged customs' documents when inspected.
</P>
<P>
Jose Rosales Mendoza, head of the regional command of the
National Guard, said that the seizure came about after an
intelligence operation joined by the Colombian National Police.

Zhu said that flooding of a severity seldom seen before in the
valleys of the Yangtze, Nenjiang and Songhua rivers caused a
direct economic loss of over 200 billion yuan. Many mines and
industrial enterprises suspended operations and some sections of
the Yangtze were closed to navigation for more than a month, he
said. All this greatly affected production, development and
domestic and foreign trade, he added.
</P>
<P>
Under the strong leadership of the Party and the government,
soldiers and civilians struggled together and won a great victory
in the battle against the floods, minimizing losses, he said.
</P>
<P>
The premier said that the work of resuming production and
rebuilding after the floods proceeded smoothly. Despite these
major calamities, harvests were generally good, he noted.
</P>
<P>
"When many neighboring countries devalued their currencies by a
large margin, we weighed the pros and cons and decided not to
depreciate the Renminbi" he said.
</P>
<P>
In order to avoid serious fluctuations in the level of foreign
trade and the utilization of foreign funds, the government adopted
a wide range of policies, he said. These included: encouraging
exports, attracting foreign funds, and stepping up efforts to
crack down on smuggling and other illegal practices such as
obtaining foreign currency under false pretenses, not turning over
foreign currency owed to the government and illegal arbitrage, he
said.
</P>
<P>
As a result, China's foreign exchange reserves increased
slightly. "Experience has shown that it was entirely correct not
to devalue the Renminbi," he said. "A stable Renminbi contributes
not only to economic stability and development in China but also
to financial and economic stability in Asia and even in the world
as a whole."

<HEADLINE> Smooth Going for Enterprise, Gov't Reforms: Premier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 5 (Xinhua) -- In 1998, China continued to carry
out successfully reform programs that include restructuring state-
owned enterprises and streamlining the government, and the reform
programs played a positive role in building a social market
economy and promoting economic and social progress.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji made the remarks in a government
work report he delivered at the Ninth National People's Congress
now in session in the Chinese capital.
</P>
<P>
Regarding reform of state-owned enterprises, the premier said
that last year fresh progress was made in efforts to restructure
and reorganize the textile, coal, petroleum and petrochemical,
metallurgical and national defense industries. Some preliminary
results were seen in the State Council's experiment to assign
special inspectors to some key enterprises of the state, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to the premier, greater efforts were made throughout
the country to ensure a minimum standard of living for laid-off
workers and to re-employ them. Most of these workers registered
with re-employment centers and received basic allowances. Over 6
million laid-off workers were re-employed in 1998. Retired
employees from enterprises for the most part received their
pensions on time and in full.
</P>
<P>
Reform of the grain distribution system progressed steadily,
and state-owned enterprises engaged in grain purchasing and
storage basically stopped operating at a loss. Great strides were
made in efforts to reform the financial system and guard against
financial risks.
</P>
<P>
The institutional reform of the State Council progressed
smoothly and its objectives were attained. The number of
departments of the State Council was cut from 40 to 29 and the
number of internal divisions within the departments were reduced
by one-quarter. Over 200 functions were delegated to enterprises,
intermediary organizations or local authorities.
</P>
<P>
"With its staff cut by half, the system and style of work of
the State Council assumed a new look," the premier said.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said that the central authorities decided that the army,
the armed police and the procuratorial, judicial and public
security institutions should no longer engage in business and that
Party and government institutions at the central level should cut
all business ties with economic entities set up by them and
enterprises under their jurisdiction. That policy decision has
been carried out, he said.
</P>
<P>
Further achievements have been scored in efforts to strengthen
and reform the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and the work of
reducing the country's armed forces by 500,000 men is going
smoothly, he said.
</P>
<P>
Programs for reforming the urban housing system and the system
of medical insurance for urban workers are being implemented. A
system to ensure a minimum standard of living for city residents
has been established in most cities, according to Zhu.

<P>
BEIJING, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Last year, China made further
progress in the fields of science and technology, education and
all other social undertakings, Premier Zhu Rongji said in a
government work report he delivered at the National People's
Congress now in session in the Chinese capital.
</P>
<P>
The premier said that the State Council has established a State
Leading Group for Science and Technology and Education to give
them more effective guidance and that the government increased
investment in these areas from the central finance.
</P>
<P>
Further progress was made in efforts to establish an innovation
system for science and technology. More advances were made in
research in key technology areas. Many major state science
projects were launched and basic research strengthened. Progress
was made in strengthening the various types of education at all
levels, he said.
</P>
<P>
Reform of the management system for higher education and its
restructuring were speeded up; goals set for 1998 in terms of
making nine-year compulsory education more or less universal
throughout the country and in basically eliminating illiteracy
among young and middle-aged people were met.
</P>
<P>
 He said development of ecological projects in key areas and
development of projects to protect natural forests in the upper
reaches of the Yangtze and the Yellow River are in full swing.
Initial results have been achieved in curbing pollution in the
Huaihe River and Taihu Lake, he said. "We intensified our efforts
to improve and protect the environment," the premier said.
</P>
<P>
Further achievements were scored in literature and art, the
press, publishing, radio, film and television, social sciences,
family planning, public health, sports and all other social
undertakings, the premier said.
</P>
<P>
Regarding efforts to push ahead with development of democracy
and a legal system, the premier said governments at all levels
improved their abilities to perform their official duties in
accordance with law.
</P>
<P>
"We intensified our efforts to strengthen democracy at the
grassroots level in rural areas," he said, adding that efforts to
improve all facets of public security produced positive results
and that social stability was maintained. Fresh progress was made
in the effort to build a clean and honest government and in the
struggle against corruption, the premier said.

<HEADLINE> Maritime Organizations Prepare for Millennium Bug </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Representatives from 16
international maritime trade associations on Thursday have reached
consensus on a code of good practice to deal with possible Year
2000 disruptions in their industry.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was reached at the end of a two-day meeting which
concluded at the International Maritime Organization headquarters
here in London.
</P>
<P>
It came after more than nine of the associations had worked for
three months preparing the code for the meeting, a United States
representative attending the meeting said.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, co-hosted by the U.S. Coast Guard and the British
Maritime and Coastguard Agency, sent two clear messages in its
documents.
</P>
<P>
First, the global maritime transportation system is a
tremendously interconnected industry with stakeholders relying on
the readiness of others. A ship entering port must be assured that
the port facilities are ready for the Y2K, the millennium bug on
computer systems, just as the port must be assured that the ship
is prepared for any Y2K incident.
</P>
<P>
Second, a simple, straightforward and consistent approach is
needed around the globe for ports and ships to assess and
communicate their Y2K readiness to one another.
</P>
<P>
The meeting called on all maritime organizations in the world
to get ready for the Y2K to avoid serious loses.

<P>
STOCKHOLM, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Top-seeded Marc Rosset of
Switzerland lost 7-6 (8-6), 6-4 to unseeded Canadian Daniel Nestor
in the Copenhagen Open tennis tournament on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The fast carpet suits Rosset's powerful serve-and-volley game
well. But he made several easy mistakes throughout the match,
especially with his forehand.
</P>
<P>
Defending champion Magnus Gustafsson, one of the heroes on
Sweden's winning Davis Cup team last year, struggled to a 6-3, 6-7
(4-7), 7-5 win over South African Neville Godwin in another second-
round match.
</P>
<P>
Also advancing were qualifier Max Mirnyi of Belarus, who edged
No. 8 seed Gianluca Pozzi of Italy in another tough three-setter,
winning 7-5, 4-6, 7-6 (7-3).
</P>
<P>
Byron Black, the second seed from Zimbabwe, gained the last
eight with a 7-6 (7-5), 3-6, 6-3 victory over Nicklas Kulti, a
qualifier who's been on several Swedish Davis Cup champion teams
as a doubles player.
</P>
<P>
In a late second-round match, Sebastien Grosjean of France beat
Frederik Fetterlein of Denmark 6-2, 7-5. The semi-retired Dane,
ranked 686th in the world going into the tournament, upset last
year's finalist David Prinosil of Germany in the first round.

<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, March 5 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright has said the U.S. continued to view Indonesia as an
important country in the Asia Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters following a meeting with her Indonesian
counterpart Ali Alatas shortly after arriving here for a two-day
visit on Thursday night, Albright said the U.S. fully supported a
democratic, free, fair and peaceful general election in Indonesia
on June 7.
</P>
<P>
"I am here to show support for the government of Indonesia ...
I support the evolution of the democratic and economic reforms,"
she said, adding that the international community was behind
Indonesia in carrying out fair, peaceful and democratic elections.
</P>
<P>
A peaceful and democratic conduct of the elections, she said,
would be very significant to the Indonesian people as well as to
the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
She expressed the hope Indonesia's economy would recover in the
not too distant future.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Alatas said during his one-and-a-half hour meeting
with Albright, he discussed with her a series of domestic and
international issues including Indonesia's planned general
election and the East Timor question.
</P>
<P>
On the East Timor issue, Albright said the U.S. government
wished the problem to be settled peacefully regardless of the
options that the East Timorese people would choose for their
future.
</P>
<P>
During her first official visit here, Albright was scheduled to
meet with President B.J. Habibie, Defense Minister/Chief of the
Armed Forces General Wiranto on Friday.

<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Hungarian Agnes Kovacs won the 50 and
200 meters World Cup short-course breaststroke in Imperia, Italy,
on Thursday to complete her second successive hat-trick of the
series.
</P>
<P>
The 200 meters breaststroke world champion clocked two minutes
23.79 seconds over the distance to romp home by almost three
seconds.
</P>
<P>
American Amanada Beard was second in 2:26.57.
</P>
<P>
Kovacs, who swam the sixth fastest time in history to win the
100 on Wednesday, then triumphed in the 50m in 31.42 seconds.
</P>
<P>
The Hungarian also took all three breaststroke events in
Gelsenkirchen, Germany, last weekend.
</P>
<P>
The two day-event was the last on the World Cup calendar. The
swimmers now turn their attention to next month's world short-
course championships in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Ukrainian world long-course champion Denis Silantiev won the
100 meters butterfly to claim his second victory and confirm
himself as undisputed World Cup champion.
</P>
<P>
Reigning European short-course champion Marcel Wouda won the
200m individual medley to add to his 400m success the previous day.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Canada's B.C. Premier Denies Wrongdoing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Glen Clark, the premier of Canada's
British Columbia province, denied any wrongdoing Wednesday night,
a day after the Royal Canadian Mounted Policy (RCMP) raided his
east Vancouver house, newspapers here reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The raid is part of an investigation into the conditional grant
of a casino license to a man now accused of running an illegal
gambling operation.
</P>
<P>
After spending the day huddled in cabinet offices with advisors,
Premier Clark emerged to admit that a man charged with running an
illegal gambling den was a friend and neighbor.
</P>
<P>
But Clark said he did not influence a government decision that
awarded Dimitrios Pilarinos a license to run a lucrative casino.
</P>
<P>
Dimitrios, who has been charged with keeping a common gaming
house, had close ties to the premier.
</P>
<P>
The National Post newspaper said that not only did their
children play together, but Dimitrios did 16,000 Canadian dollars
(10,560 U.S. dollars) worth of renovations to Clark's home last
year, shortly before winning provincial approval for a casino.
</P>
<P>
That link may explain why commercial crime investigators
searched the premier's home Tuesday night, just three hours after
more than 40 RCMP officers raided the North Burnaby Inn during an
undercover investigation into illegal gambling. It was that raid
that led to Dimitrios's arrest.
</P>
<P>
Clark released a copy of a memorandum prepared by his staff,
confirming his instructions to be insulated from any decision on
the application by Pilarinos for a charity casino license.
</P>
<P>
Shortly before Clark's statement, the RCMP issued a brief
statement confirming that their raid on the premier's home was
connected to their continuing investigation of an application for
a charity casino license.
</P>
<P>
The statement also said the search warrant involved did not
allege any criminal activity on the part of Clark.

WASHINGTON, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Turner Sports wants the first
Winter Goodwill Games to be held in New York, the Games
spokeswoman said an official announcement would be made Next
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"It's the most talked-about, worst-kept secret going," a sports
official said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The first winter edition of the Goodwill Games, an
international multi-event festival, is planned for February.
Turner announced in December that it was exploring the idea of a
winter version of the games, Turner Sports president Harvey
Schiller said they likely would be staged in Lake Placid.
</P>
<P>
Lillehammer, Norway, site of the 1994 Winter Olympics, is the
other contender.
</P>
<P>
The Winter Games is likely to include events in ice climbing,
snow bicycling and super-modified shovel racing. Other sports on
the program include Alpine skiing, figure skating, speedskating,
bobsled, luge and at least one cross-country ski event.
</P>
<P>
Dates have not been set. About 20 million U.S. dollars project
has been under way for more than two weeks.
</P>
<P>
The Goodwill Games were the brainchild of Ted Turner, held
first in Moscow in the summer of 1986 to avoid the sports cold war
between East and West that had produced two straight Olympic
boycotts.

<HEADLINE> British Warplanes Strike Iraqi Site </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 4 (Xinhua) -- British warplanes on Thursday
attacked an air defense site near the southern Iraqi city of
Basra, a British defense official said.
</P>
<P>
"All our planes returned safely," a ministry spokesman told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
The attack was confirmed by a report from the United States,
which said a British Tornado jet attacked an Iraqi military radar
site in the southern no-fly zone on Thursday in response to two
Iraqi violations in the exclusion zone.
</P>
<P>
Britain had earlier announced that its joint patrols with the
United States of the no-fly zones in Iraq have been changed in
response to an increasing numbers of Iraqi attacks on their
pilots.
</P>
<P>
British Defense Secretary George Robertson told parliament that
the operations were still "purely defensive" in nature and strikes
on Iraqi sites were in response to precise attacks on allied
pilots.
</P>
<P>
"We cannot simply ignore these attacks. We have therefore
tailored the rules of engagement to reflect the escalation of the
Iraqis in their systematic attacks on and threats to our
aircraft," he said.
</P>
<P>
Local reports here said that British and U.S. pilots in Iraq
had extended their attacks to command and control bases in the
region rather than just missile launch sites.
</P>
<P>
In his speech to the parliament, Robertson defended the bombing
of an Iraqi oil pipeline over the weekend by United States forces.
He alleged that the pipeline appeared to have a dual function.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, The Iraqi news Agency INA quoted a senior Arab League
official as saying that U.S. attacks on the pipelines were
unjustifiable.
</P>
<P>
"There is no justification for what the United States and
Britain are doing against Iraq," INA quoted the Arab League's
visiting Assistant Secretary-General Ahmed Ben Hilli as saying.
</P>
<P>
Iraq does not recognise the zones, which were set up in the
north and south part of its territory after the 1990-91 Gulf War,
and has stepped up its challenge to the U.S. and British planes.
</P>
<P>
Before the raids the pipeline had been exporting about a
million barrels a day of crude, or half Iraq's sales under a
humanitarian exchange permitted by the United Nations in exchange
for food and medicine.

<HEADLINE> Euro Sinks to Record Low </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 4 (Xinhua) -- The euro sank to a record low
against the dollar on the currency markets in London on Thursday,
leaving it over 6 percent below the value at which it was
launched.
</P>
<P>
A euro is now worth 1.08 U.S.dollars, but those charged with
looking after the new currency's fortunes say it is more a matter
of dollar strength than euro weakness.
</P>
<P>
The European Central Bank (ECB) decision to leave interest
rates unchanged at 3 percent did little to improve the euro's
exchange value. A rate cut would have only served to weaken the
currency further.
</P>
<P>
It was only the ECB's second meeting since the launch of
Europe's single currency. A lack of apparent inflationary pressure
did not persuade bank chiefs to cut rates, despite intense
pressure from German finance minister Oskar Lafontaine.
</P>
<P>
Concern about the condition of the German economy may be one of
the factors undermining the euro's value. Its unemployment is
relatively high and there have been worrying signs about rapidly
slowing economic growth.
</P>
<P>
One of the main arguments in favor of a rate cut is the
continuing fall in euro zone inflation which was only 0.8 percent
in January, compared with 1.1 percent a year earlier. It was
unchanged from a month earlier.
</P>
<P>
The rate is strongly influenced by the situation in Germany,
whose economy accounts for a third of the region. Inflation there
was just 0.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
The dollar's strength has continued to put pressure on the
euro. This boosts the prospects for European exporters, although
the prospects for growth this year in the eurozone are projected
to be less than 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
A cut in European rates at the moment could only worsen the
euro's decline, especially if US interest rates look like they
will rise.
</P>
<P>
ECB President Wim Duisenberg blamed the strength of the U.S.
economy for the currency's decline, saying the euro's fall
represented dollar strength rather than euro weakness.
</P>
<P>
However, he also blamed European politicians who have tried to
exert political pressure on the ECB's monetary policy.
</P>
<P>
Some central bankers oppose a rate cut for political reasons,
not wanting to be seen to be compromising the bank's independence
by giving in to pressure.
</P>
<P>
Duisenberg said the outlook for inflation was "favorable," but
that developments in credit markets needed to be closely watched.
</P>
<P>
Interest rates were at historically low levels, but exchange
rates needed close monitoring, he said.

<HEADLINE> UK Protests US Move on Banana Imports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 4 (Xinhua) -- British Trade Secretary Stephen
Byers summoned the U.S. ambassador to receive a protest over
Washington's actions in the dispute over European Union banana
imports.
</P>
<P>
Byers branded the U.S. announcement that importers would need
to buy bonds to cover a range of European goods "irrational and
unacceptable", saying the British Government will step in and
guarantee the bonds being demanded by US customs on cashmere
imports.
</P>
<P>
The British Department of Trade and Industry sources said the
bonds effectively amounted to 100 percent tariffs, As such they
may pose a threat to jobs in the E.U. and the U.K, a BBC report
said, quoting Byers as stating that "We've taken steps to protect
jobs and industry".
</P>
<P>
British Prime Minister Tony Blair later added his voice to the
government's chorus of determination to stand up to the United
States on this issue.
</P>
<P>
During a visit to Glasgow, Blair said he would do everything
possible to protect the Scottish textile industry from trade
tariffs.
</P>
<P>
"No one should be in any doubt about our determination to make
sure British jobs and Scottish jobs are protected," he said. "As
a result of what we have already done, we have managed to get this
decision postponed."
</P>
<P>
More than 2,000 Scottish jobs depend on the cashmere industry,
which made exports worth about 18 million pounds (about 29 million
U.S. dollars) to the United States last year.
</P>
<P>
Responding earlier to an emergency Commons question, Byers told
members of parliament that the British cashmere knitwear industry
could be badly affected by "completely unauthorised" U.S. actions.
</P>
<P>
The row over bananas centres on American complaints that the
E.U. gives unfair import preference to bananas from former British
and French colonies in the Caribbean. They say this comes at the
expense of U.S. firms seeking to export bananas from the dollar
economies of Latin America.
</P>
<P>
Byers explained that the dispute had been put to the World
Trade Organisation arbitrator, which has delayed a final ruling.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. argued the duties would not be applied until after the
arbitrator had ruled.
</P>
<P>
"I deplore the action which the US has taken," Byers said. "It
is completely unauthorised by any WTO procedures and wholly
ignores the arbitrator's appeal for discussions to continue."
</P>
<P>
"Even now it is not too late for the US to reverse this
decision in the interests not only of E.U.-U.S. relationships, but
to safeguard the whole framework of dispute settlement in the
WTO."

<HEADLINE> National Squad Goalie Turns Down Offers, Stays with Istanbulspor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, March 4 (Xinhua) - National squad goalie Zdravko
Zdravkov will probably renew his contract with Turkish
Istanbulspor.
</P>
<P>
The three Turkish powerhouses, Fenerbahce, Galatasaray and
Besiktas, are interested in him, but the new offer of his current
club is much more lucrative.
</P>
<P>
Zdravkov had an offer to play in the Bundesliga but such a
transfer would entail a number of personal inconveniences.
According to him at present the only championship where a
goalkeeper's labour is properly assessed is the English
Premiership.
</P>
<P>
Istanbulspor is one of the few powerhouses which offer good
living conditions, and this made Zdravkov remain with the club.
</P>
<P>
In a poll conducted among Istanbulspor fans Zdravkov was named
the best player for February.
</P>
<P>
"Now nobody wants to recall the problems of the World Cup
finals and the atmosphere is friendly," Zdravkov said when
commenting on the present state of the national team.
</P>
<P>
According to him the players on the national team have
excellent football qualities, but they lack experience and self-
confidence as a team, which was revealed during the matches in
Hong Kong. To overcome these problems quickly friendlies should
be organized more frequently.
</P>
<P>
"The players have to understand that the frequent friendlies
are necessary to recover more quickly the fame of Bulgarian
national soccer. We do not play soccer all our lives and we have
to be proud when we represent Bulgaria,"

NEW YORK, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Wall Street stocks moved higher
Thursday after IBM announced a 16 billion U.S. dollar sales
agreement with Dell computer and the Commerce Department reported
a surge in new orders for U.S. factory goods.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average was up 191.52 to 9,467.40. The
index lost 48.90 points in the previous two sessions.
</P>
<P>
The technology heavy Nasdaq composite index finished up 27.69
to 2,292.89 and Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was up 18.94 at
1,246.64.
</P>
<P>
The market opened stronger after IBM announced that it agreed
to sell 16 billion dollar worth of equipment to Dell in 7 years,
which will eventually lead to develop new computer technology
jointly by the two giants. Stocks for the two companies were up.
</P>
<P>
The market were also boosted by the report on recovery in U.S.
manufacturing. The Department of Commerce said new orders to U.S.
factories increased by 1.7 percent in January for the second
consecutive month, signaling the start of recovery in U.S.
manufacturing after a year of struggling. The orders rose 2.3
percent last December.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE index rose 8.20 to 590.75 and the American Stock
Exchange index rose 4.07 to 698.52. The Russell 2000 index of
smaller companies rose 2.07 to 394.02.
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 13-to-9 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, with 1,723 up, 1,195 down and 611
unchanged. NYSE volume totaled 768.79 million shares vs. 745.22
million in the previous session.

<HEADLINE> WTO Chief Urges US, EU to Be "Positive" in Banana Dispute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, March 4 (Xinhua) -- World Trade Organization (WTO)
chief Renato Ruggiero has urged the United States and the European
Union to show "a positive spirit" in resolving their escalating
banana dispute.
</P>
<P>
In a statement here Thursday following a U.S. decision to
effectively impose provisional tariffs on EU goods worth of over
500 million U.S. dollars, Ruggiero said that the WTO's own dispute
settlement system "can provide a legal answer to all the legal
issues involved in this dispute".
</P>
<P>
"I believe that we are now really approaching the end of a long
and complex dispute on the banana issue," declared Ruggiero, who
steps down at the end of April after four years as WTO
Director-General.
</P>
<P>
"I would like to invite both parties to act in this period of
time with a positive spirit in order to find as soon as possible a
mutually-acceptable solution," he said.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, a WTO panel said in a vague statement that it
needed additional information to decide if the revised EU banana
import regime was in consistency with the WTO ruling in 1997. It
said that it would issue a final decision soon.
</P>
<P>
Also on Tuesday, WTO set up a panel to examine the United
States' controversial "Section 301" trade law at the EU's request.
</P>
<P>
Section 301 of the U.S. Trade Act was recently used by the U.S.
as the basis of its threat to impose swinging trade sanctions on
the EU in the two sides' dispute over banana imports.
</P>
<P>
U.S. trade envoy Rita Hayes told the meeting that the EU's
interpretation of the Section 301 was "factually and legally
inaccurate", according to WTO officials.
</P>
<P>
She said the EU's move was an attempt to distract attention
from the banana dispute itself. The U.S. says the 15-nation bloc's
banana import regime breaks free trade rules by discriminating in
favor of former European colonies.

<HEADLINE> Dole Leaves for Kosovo on Peace Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Former Sen. Bob Dole said on
Thursday that he would urge Kosovar Albanians to sign a proposed
peace deal so that the United States and its allies could mount
greater pressure on Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, forcing
him to accept NATO presence in the province.
</P>
<P>
Upon leaving Washington for Pristina, the Kosovar capital, Dole
warned that "time has already been lost and further delays in
signing this agreement can only work to the benefit of Slobodan
Milosevic."
</P>
<P>
"I will ask the Albanian leadership to put their people first
-- without thought to their own position, power or personal gain,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
Dole is due to meet ethnic Albanian leaders on Friday and is
expected back in Washington on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, in Jakarta for meeting
with Indonesia officials, said she had talked to Dole this
morning. "He's someone who has a very good relationship with the
Kosovar Albanians and he has taken a great personal interest in
this subject," she said. "I'm very pleased that he's able to
undertake this mission."

<HEADLINE> EU Survey Shows Imbalanced Economic Indicators </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, March 4 (Xinhua) -- A February survey published on
Thursday by the European Commission showed "Buoyant" consumer
confidence and disappointing industrial confidence both in the
11-country euro zone and the 15-nation European Union region.
</P>
<P>
The February survey results show the consumer confidence
indicator rose for the EU as a whole, whereas it remained
unchanged in the euro zone. The strong confidence among consumers
was largely due to the positive attitude towards making major
purchases at present, the survey said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, managers in industry were less optimistic in
February. The industrial confidence indicator fell in both EU and
the euro zone. "This can to a large extent be attributed to the
worsened assessments regarding the level of order-books," it said.
</P>
<P>
With the outlook in industry still subdued, the economic
sentiment indicator fell in February. The decline was more
pronounced in the euro zone than for the EU as a whole.
</P>
<P>
Currently, euro zone countries include Belgium, Germany, Spain,
France, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Astria,
Portugal and Finland. Britain, Sweden, Denmark and Greece are
still outside the European Monetary Union team.

<HEADLINE> Stress Is Likely The Factor Leading to Heart Attack </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 4 (Xinhua) -- A ten year large-scale study
shows that people living in New York may be 55 percent more likely
to die of a heart attack than people living in other U.S. cities.
</P>
<P>
The study, conducted by psychologist Nicholas Christenfeld of
the University of California at San Diego, also suggests that
tourists who visit New York are 34 percent more likely to die of a
heart attack than visitors to other cities.
</P>
<P>
While New Yorkers' risk of dying of a heart attack drops by 20
percent when they are outside the city, says the research.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. researcher based his finding on U.S. death
certificates from 1985 to 1994.
</P>
<P>
On the cause of the above situation, he said that life in New
York full of stress, excitement, pressure and density are to be
blamed.
</P>
<P>
"This won't cause a heart attack in a healthy young person,
but if you are at high risk and teetering on the edge of a heart
attack, it could push you over," said the researcher.

<HEADLINE> Test on Hair Can Show Risk of Breast Cancer: Study </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Differences in hair structure could
lead to a simple screening test for breast cancer, scientists in
Australia have suggested.
</P>
<P>
Veronica James and colleagues of the University of New South
Wales, Sydney, Australia, have found that the X-ray diffraction
from the patterns of hair of women with breast cancer are
different from that of healthy women.
</P>
<P>
Hair from women diagnosed with breast cancer revealed rings of
X-ray intensity in the diffraction pattern not seen in healthy
subjects' hair, they reported Thursday in the scientific journal
Nature.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, all hair samples from women carrying a faulty BRCA1
gene, which is associated with a high risk of breast cancer,
showed the same structural anomaly.
</P>
<P>
"Because our results are so consistent, we propose that such
hair analyses may be used as a simple, non-invasive screening
method for breast cancer," the scientists wrote in a letter to
Nature.

<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Turkey's Bayindir FIBA
corporation is currently building in Bucharest the biggest
commercial center of Romania, with an investment of more than 35
million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
According to a Thursday report of the national Rompres, this

four-storey building, to count more than 70 shops, 10 cinema
halls, game arcades, cafes and restaurants, besides a parking lot
for 1,000 cars.
</P>
<P>
"The same as commercial centers worldwide, the one in Bucharest
will not only give everybody the opportunity to buy goods at
available prices but also offer a different life style. And this
is because people will come here not only for shopping, but also
to relax," Bayindir FIBA General Manager Fahim Tabur said.
</P>
<P>
The commercial center will create more than 800 jobs. Its
commercial area will spread over more than 30,000 sqm.
</P>

foreign companies, such as Steilman, Minolta/Polaroid, Riken,
Flanco, McDonald's, are to open shops there. Other companies are
to enter the Romanian market there for the first time.

<HEADLINE> EU Trade Tsar on China WTO Accession Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, March 4 (Xinhua) -- European Commission
Vice-President Sir Leon Brittan said here on Thursday that both
the European Union (EU) and the United States have taken a
particular interest in the World Trade Organization (WTO)
accession talks with China, but it should not be forgotten that
WTO accession talks are a multilateral process.
</P>
<P>
The EU executive trade tsar seems to reminded the US of not
taking unilateral action in world trade affairs and also put on
certain presure on China. He said the EU attaches particular
importance to the principle that the WTO accession talks is to
remove trade discrimination, not introduce new preferential
distortions.
</P>
<P>
In view of this week's discussions on China's application to
join the WTO between the US and China in Beijing, Brittan pointed
out in a statement that no one party to the talks can determine
the outcome on its own, and no bilateral agreement between China
and a third country can be imposed on other member of the WTO as a
basis for a final accession deal.
</P>
<P>
"Indeed, it is fundamental to the success of the talks that all
bilateral concessions made by China to individual countries should
be extended on a non-discriminatory basis to all other parties to
the talks," he said.
</P>
<P>
The EU has provided its own distinctive contributions to the
talks, Brittan said, not least as an early supporter of the use of
transition periods. "This was a crucial innovation that will allow
China to benefit fully from market access and other WTO rights
from the day of accession, while allowing China to maintain
derogations from certain requirements for a fixed period of time
so that liberalization can be introduced in a manner consistent
with China's domestic reform program and state of development,"
the trade head said.
</P>
<P>
Brittan also mentioned his forthcoming China visit in April,
which he said is for pushing ahead with the China's accession
negotiations. "This will serve as a valuable preparatory exercise
for the next EU-China Summit which will be held in China in mid
May," he added.

<HEADLINE> Dell Agrees to Buy IBM Equipment in $16 Billion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Dell Computer Corp. agreed
Thursday to buy equipment from International Business Machines
Corp. for 16 billion U.S. dollars in 7 years, which will
eventually let the two computer giants to join in developing new
computer technology.
</P>
<P>
The agreement to this effect was announced by the two companies
here. The equipment Dell will buy from IBM includes disk drives,
flat-panel displays and memory chips.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, Dell, the No. 2 personal-computer in the
U.S., could benefit from hiring IBM to support its customers with
computer services. Dell Chief Executive Michael Dell said recently
that his company's focus in 1999 would be on services and
providing computers for small and medium-size businesses.
</P>
<P>
The company has recently been moving to provide larger
computers, such as servers and work stations but lacks a powerful
services organization to support these machines. IMB's service
business from computer consulting to installation and maintenance
is one of its fastest-growing sectors, generating about 30 billion
U.S. dollars in revenues annually.
</P>
<P>
IBM, the world's largest computer company, has been struggling
for several years to cope with rapidly declining PC prices and a
flock of competitors like Dell. The company dropped its PC market
share last year to 8.2 percent from 8.6 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Dell is one of the most efficient and profitable PC makers. The
company reported net income of 1.46 billion dollars last year on
revenue of 18.24 billion dollars.

<P>
MOSCOW, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
Thursday fired Boris Berezovsky as executive secretary of the
Commonwealth of Independent States, the Kremlin press service
said.
</P>
<P>
Berezovsky, an oligarch widely believed to be behind a recent
media campaign claiming corruption in the government of Yevgeny
Primakov, was sacked "for regular actions exceeding the limits of
his authorities as CIS executive secretary and for failing to
implement instructions by the chairman of the Council of the CIS
Heads of State," the presidential press service said.
</P>
<P>
Ivan Korotchenya was appointed as acting executive secretary of
the CIS, Itar-Tass reported.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin, in his capacity as chairman of the CIS Council of
Heads of State, told Berezovsky, who is visiting Azerbaijan, to
cut short his tour of CIS member nations and return to Moscow,
Interfax reported.
</P>
<P>
Berezovsky's ouster was welcomed by Russian cabinet ministers,
who accuse the oil-to-media tycoon of making statements
incompatible with his status of an international figure and
spending too much time on activities unrelated to consolidation of
the CIS, Interfax reported, quoting sources in the government.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Mortgage Rates Reach Nine-Month High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 4 (Xinhua) -- The mortgage company, Freddie
Mac, said Thursday that the average interest rate on 30-year
fixed-rate mortgages rose above 7 percent this week, the highest
level in nine months.
</P>
<P>
The average increased to 7.06 percent, the highest level since
the the end of May, as compared with 6.89 percent in the previous
week.
</P>
<P>
Economists said this week's increase, if sustained, will
slightly cool home sales and sharply reduce mortgage refinancing,
a key support for consumer spending during the past year.
</P>
<P>
The average reached a 31-year low of 6.49 percent in early
October as worried world investors poured their money into U.S.
financial markets. That helped send sales of both new and existing
homes to record highs last year.
</P>
<P>
But even with the recent climb, the average remains low by
historical standards, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
Fifteen-year mortgages, a popular option for refinancing,
averaged 6.70 percent this week, the highest since mid-June and up
from 6.51 percent last week.
</P>
<P>
On one-year adjustable-rate mortgages, lenders were asking an
average initial rate of 5.74 percent, up from 5.71 percent the
previous week and the highest in 21 months.

<HEADLINE> Angola Asks Belgium to Aid in Mining </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Angola hopes that Belgium could
provide technical cooperation to assist it in its mining industry,
 Angolan Minister of Geology and Mines Manuel Bunge said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Bunge expressed his hope when meeting with the Belgian
Ambassador to Angola, Leon Doyan here, briefing him on Angola's
1998/2000 development plan on mineral industry.
</P>
<P>
Bunge said Angola needs advanced foreign technology to overcome
the difficulties in the industry and that Belgium should, like it
does with some other African countries, offer help to Angola,
which abounds in mineral resources,

especially diamond.
</P>
<P>
Doyan said Belgian mineral companies are very interested in
cooperating with Angolan firms in this field, adding that Belgium
has great investment in the Democratic Republic of Congo,
controlling development in diamond, copper and gold industries in
the country.
</P>
<P>
On diamond smuggling by the National Union for the Total
Independence of Angola (UNITA), the Belgian ambassador said that
his government is taking measures to curb possible diamond
smuggling by UNITA through Belgian firms.
</P>
<P>
The Angolan government has for several times accused some
European companies of buying diamond from UNITA, thus providing
the rebel group with money for waging the civil war.
</P>
<P>
Angola is an important diamond producer in Africa. It produced
about two million carat of diamond, worth 450 million U.S.
Dollars, by the government-controled mines alone in 1998.

<HEADLINE> New Orders for U.S. Factory Goods Rise in January </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 4 (Xinhua) -- New orders to U.S. factories
rose 1.7 percent to a seasonally adjusted 349.6 billion U.S.
dollars in January, the Commerce Department said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The increase, for the second consecutive month, reflected the
start of a rebound in U.S. manufacturing after a year of
struggling with fallout from Asia's economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
It followed an even stronger 2.3 percent increase in December.
Before December, there were only weaker increases during five of
the six months.
</P>
<P>
Manufacturers have been hurting from loss of export sales to
Asia and other economies in recession and factories shed more than
200,000 jobs last year. But U.S. consumer demand has remained
brisk and January's increase helps confirm other signs of recovery
in the sector.
</P>
<P>
Much of the new factory orders was concentrated in aircraft,
which doubled from 7.8 billion dollars in December to 15.9 billion
dollars in January. The 102.7 percent increase was the largest in
five years. Excluding the volatile transportation segment, orders
fell 0.3 in January, the first decline in three months.
</P>
<P>
However, aircraft wasn't the only high point for the month.
Orders rose 4.9 percent for electronic equipment, including a 13
percent increase for communications equipment. Orders for stone,
clay and glass products rose 0.7 percent, reflecting robust
construction in most parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
Computer and office equipment orders dropped 4.8 percent; steel
orders, 8 percent, and engines and turbines, 27.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
Orders for durable goods jumped 3.6 percent while orders for
non-durable goods fell 0.8 percent, pulled down by a decline in
chemicals.
</P>
<P>
Shipments of factory goods, a barometer of current production,
fell 0.8 percent, the first drop since October, after an identical
increase in December.
</P>
<P>
The backlog of unfilled orders surged 1.6 percent, the first
increase since August. And inventories of factory goods fell 0.3
percent, the third drop in a row.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Military Jury Acquits Marine Pilot </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 4 (Xinhua) -- A U.S. military jury acquitted
a Marine pilot Thursday of all charges that he recklessly flew his
jet into an Italian gondola cable, killing 20 people last year.
</P>
<P>
A whoop went up in the courtroom at the Camp Lejeune Marine
base in North Carolina State of the United States when the verdict
was announced.
</P>
<P>
Captain Richard Ashby, 31, was charged with 20 counts of
involuntary manslaughter and one count each of destroying
government property, destroying private property, dereliction of
duty and failure to plan the flight properly. The crash and its
aftermath strained relations between the United States and Italy,
a NATO ally.
</P>
<P>
The pilot faced a possible sentence of 206 years if he had been
convicted of all charges.
</P>
<P>
During the four-week trial, prosecutors alleged Ashby was
"flat-hatting" -- intentionally flying too low and too fast on the
low-altitude training mission through the Italian Alps.
</P>
<P>
However, defense witnesses said Ashby was unaware lift cables
were strung across the path plotted out for the flight, his final
training mission in an EA-6B electronic-surveillance jet before
transferring to fighter-pilot school.
</P>
<P>
The accident caused an uproar in Europe. People living in the
Alpine ski area said they had long complained about low-flying
jets from Aviano air base and their "Top Gun" antics.
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman Joe Lockhart would not comment on the
verdict, citing the ongoing court proceedings, but said the matter
could come up Friday during President Bill Clinton's meeting with
Italian Prime Minister Massimo D'Alema.
</P>
<P>
Lockhart also said the fact that U.S.-Italy relations had
weathered the incident was "a testament to the strength that we
can work through a tragedy like this and remain allies and
friends."

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Rejects to Amend Cease-fire Pact </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon on Thursday rejected an
Israeli proposal to amend the cease-fire agreement signed in 1996
between the two countries, the official National News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
"Lebanon is committed to the April Understanding in letter and
spirit and rejects any change in the mandate and mechanism of the
Monitoring Group," said Lebanese Prime Minister Salim Hoss while
meeting with Lebanese delegation chairman to the group Mahir
Toufeili.
</P>
<P>
Hoss made the remarks in response to Israeli Defense Minister
Moshe Arens' initiative to make some amendments to the pact in a
bid to enable the Israeli army to strike at Lebanon's anti-Israeli
group Hezbollah, or Party of God.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-brokered understanding, which ended a massive Israeli
bombing blitz that claimed more than 200 Lebanese lives in April,
1996, prohibits attacks on civilians or civilian areas on both
sides of the Lebanese-Israeli border.
</P>
<P>
Arens said the deal created a situation in which Hezbollah
guerrillas are free to launch attacks on Israeli targets in south
Lebanon while the Israeli army is denied to attack Hezbollah
bases because most of them are situated in villages.
</P>
<P>
Israel often complained to the Monitoring Group consisted of
representative from Israel, Lebanon, Syria, France and the United
States, that Hezbollah fired mortar or rockets on Israeli
outposts from Lebanese villages.
</P>
<P>
Arens produced the idea two days after Israel waged a massive
offensive against Hezbollah guerrillas in retaliation for the
killing of four Israelis, including a general, on February 28 in
south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a self-proclaimed security zone in south Lebanon
in 1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its north from
cross-border attacks by Lebanese guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Lebanon's resistance movement spearheaded by
Hezbollah has been fighting to drive Israeli troops out of the
country.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Urges Govt-Rebels Talks to End Congo (K) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania Thursday called on
the government of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) to hold
direct talks with its rebels to end the intensified crisis.
</P>
<P>
President Benjamin Mpaka told the visiting United Nations
Children's Fund (UNICEF) Regional Director for East and Southern
Africa, Urban Johnson, at the State House that the only solution
is for the government to sit in the negotiation table with the
rebels.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa said that the expectations by Congolese government for
the rebels'
</P>
<P>
withdrawal before any negotiations are unrealistic since
withdrawal is practically the consequence of negotiations.
</P>
<P>
"It is not proper for the DRC to say that it cannot talks
directly to rebels because it would mean no solution to the
crisis," an official statement quoted the president as saying.
</P>
<P>
"Call them puppets or anything but they control one-third of
the country where 25 million people are living and the mineral
wealth is concentrated," Mkapa told the UNICEF leader.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa said the world must admit that there is a rebellion in
DRC which enjoys support from somewhere, warning that if a
solution is not worked out, the war will continue.
</P>
<P>
The president called on elder statesmen to intervene by holding
 consultations with the warring parties for settlement of the
crisis.
</P>
<P>
Since its breakout last August, the war in Congo (K) has so far
already drawn in Angola, Namibia, Zimbabwe and Chad on Congolese
President Kabila's side while the Tutsi-led rebels are backed by
Rwanda and Uganda.
</P>
<P>
Claiming to be neutral in the conflict, Tanzania has recalled
its military advisors from the DRC and urged the withdrawal of
all foreign troops and a peaceful solution to it.

BUCHAREST, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Romania's President Emil
Constantinescu Thursday confirmed that there is indeed a
strategic partnership between Romania and Poland.
</P>
<P>
He added that the current visit of his Polish counterpart would
surely be a step forward in developing the bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Constantinescu made the remarks at a joint press conference
held after talks with Aleksander Kwasniewski, who arrived here
Thursday on a two-day visit to Romania.
</P>
<P>
According to Constantinescu, the talks were very dense and
referred to bilateral issues in the first place. He remarked that
the trade between the two countries had risen by 19 percent in
1998 on 1997, which he considered insufficient compared with the
possibilities offered by the two countries.
</P>
<P>
He also referred to the scientific and military cooperation,
which work well and efficiently.
</P>
<P>
A decision had been made to widen the cooperation in fighting
corruption and organized crime, he added.
</P>
<P>
The Polish president stressed that the Romanian-Polish
political dialogue was very active and that it was not by chance
that he came to Romania on an official visit for the second time
since he was elected president of Poland.
</P>
<P>
Referring to Poland's joining NATO, he expressed the strong
belief that NATO would continue to expand and that Romania would
join the alliance at a certain stage. He added that Poland would
grant Romania full help to join NATO.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, the Polish president will deliver a speech at the
Bucharest University and meet Romanian Prime Minister Radu Vasile
and Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies Ion Diaconescu.

WASHINGTON, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Italian Prime Minister
Massimo D'Alema said in Boston Thursday that he was "baffled" by a
