<HEADLINE> France Warns Against "Conflagration" If Congo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, September 16 (Xinhua) -- France today warned against
grave consequences from a failure of mediation by Gabon and the
United Nations in the conflict of the Congo Republic, saying that
a failure of peace efforts could result in the "conflagration" of
the country.
</P>
<P>
French Foreign Ministry spokesman Jacques Rummalhardt said that
"a failure of the on-going (peace) efforts" made by Gabonese
President Omar Bongo and U.N. envoy Mohamed Sahnoun, who were
backed by seven other African heads of state, will be "very
grave".
</P>
<P>
"We hope that the renewed efforts of the African countries
would convince the Congolese parties to renounce at last violence
and resolve by dialogue the last points in dispute," said the
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Renewed heavy fighting broke out today in Brazzaville, capital
of Congo Republic, between troops loyal to Congolese President
Pascal Lissouba and the militiamen of former president, General
Denis Sassou-Nguesso.
</P>
<P>
The heads of state of eight African states and the U.N. envoy
meeting in Libreville appealed on Monday to the conflicting sides
to agree to an "effective and definite" ceasefire.
</P>
<P>
They also said that a peace-keeping force should be deployed in
Brazzaville by the end of this month under the auspices of the
United Nations.

<HEADLINE> More Irish People Seek Legal Aid on Divorce </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 16 (Xinhua) -- The number of people to seek
legal advice on divorce in Ireland has doubled since the
legislation on divorce was officially implemented in February,
according to press reports from Dublin.
</P>
<P>
Some 3,000 people are waiting for their first divorce
consultation with a Legal Aid Board solicitor, compared with 1,500
in February, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
The clients at one center would now have to wait almost a year
to be seen and the situation across the country was getting worse.
</P>
<P>
Legal Aid Board chief Frank Goodman was reported as saying that
some 1,000 people sought legal advice on divorce before it was
officially legalized.
</P>
<P>
"We have seen 700 of these but a further 500 have since made
contact -- which means 1,000 people are now on the waiting list in
respect of divorce," he said.
</P>
<P>
Ireland, which was the only West European country where divorce
was still illegal, staged a national referendum on whether to
legalize divorce in November 1995 and eventually divorce was
legalized by only a half per cent margin.
</P>
<P>
In January, a dying man secured Ireland's first divorce of
modern times when he successfully appealed to the country's High
Court that his rights were being infringed by the delay.

<HEADLINE> Kazakhstan, Italy Pledges to Boost Economic Relations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALMA ATA, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Kazakh President Nursultan
Nazarbayev and Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi today expressed
a mutual desire to expand bilateral trade and economic ties.
</P>
<P>
Nazarbayev said the two countries' two-way trade was up 30
percent to 300 million U.S. dollars in 1996; and surged 70 percent
in the first half of this year over the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
The Kazakh leader noted, during a meeting here with the Italian
premier, that there were 18 Italian companies and 46
Kazakh-Italian ventures operating in this central Asian country.
</P>
<P>
There would be good prospect for Italy, the most successful
European country in boosting small and medium-sized businesses, to
work with Kazakhstan and help it achieve in the same area, he said.
</P>
<P>
Prodi, here since Monday on a three-day visit, said his country
was willing to further its cooperation with Kazakhstan, a former
Soviet republic now entering a new political and economic stage.
</P>
<P>
Italy, he said, also hoped to expand direct trade links with
Kazakhstan, rather than going through Germany, Switzerland and
Turkey as much of the bilateral transactions currently do.

<HEADLINE> US Consumer Prices Up Moderately in August </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 16 (Xinhua) -- U.S. consumer prices
increased by a moderate 0.2 percent in August despite the fact
that gasoline prices soared by the biggest amount since the
Persian Gulf crisis in 1990.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Labor Department reported that the Consumer Price
Index (CPI) increase matched a similar 0.2 percent rise in July.
</P>
<P>
The report said that energy prices rose by 1.7 percent in
August, the biggest monthly advance since a 3 percent rise in
April 1996. Gasoline prices were up 5.4 percent, the biggest
one-month increase since a 7 percent spike in October 1990.
</P>
<P>
Food prices increased 0.4 percent in the month, compared with a
0.2 percent rise in July.
</P>
<P>
Through August, the core rate of inflation has been rising at
an annual rate of 2.2 percent, even better than 2.6 percent rise
in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The good performance in the underlying inflation rate in August
reflected a 1 percent plunge in clothing costs, the biggest
one-month drop since August 1989.
</P>
<P>
New vehicle prices were also down in August, dropping 0.1
percent. Used car prices were down an even larger 0.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
For the first eight months of this year, U.S. inflation at the
consumer level has been rising at an annual rate of just 1.6
percent, less than half of the 3.3 percent increase turned in
during 1996.
</P>
<P>
This exceptional performance on inflation has been the primary
reason that the U.S. Federal Reserve has held off increasing
interest rates even though strong economic growth has pushed
unemployment below 5 percent for five straight months.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: From Emancipation of Mind to Unified Thinking (1) (By Zhou Shuchun) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 16 (Xinhua) -- The warm response to Jiang
Zemin's report at the on-going Party Congress has proven that the
2000-plus delegates have reached a consensus on a series of key
issues.
</P>
<P>
Reaching unified thinking through emancipation of the mind has
been an outstanding characteristic of the current 15th National
Congress of the Communist Party of China, which opened on
September 12.
</P>
<P>
Jiang Zemin gave a profound exposition of a wide-range of
issues concerning different aspects of reform and opening-up as
well as the socialist modernization drive. The greatest responses
have come from the proposal to write down Deng Xiaoping Theory
into the Party Constitution as the Party's guiding ideology, the
affirmation to the primary stage of socialism and the
breakthroughs in understanding the meaning of public ownership.
</P>
<P>
The series of important proposals put forward by Jiang Zemin at
the congress on behalf of the 14th Communist Party Central
Committee have been recognized by delegates who are working as
senior officials at the central government level, celebrities
engaged in theoretical rearch, scientists, teachers, artists,
workers, farmers, army officers and rank-and-file.
</P>
<P>
Their consensus has constituted the most important achievement
of the congress, observers say.
</P>
<P>
The proposal to amend the CPC Constitution is also a key step
to holding high the great banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory.
</P>
<P>
As a matter of fact, China's reform and opening-up has been
guided by the theory from the very beginning, and the 14th CPC
Central Committee with Jiang Zemin at the core has affirmed the
guiding position of Deng Xiaoping Theory in the whole Party.

<TEXT>
<P>
The congress delegates pointed out that the third generation of
the CPC Central Committee leadership has clearly inscribed Deng
Xiaoping Theory on the Party flag not long after Deng Xiaoping
passed away. The significance and impact of this move is "fairly
profound," "far-reaching" and "immeasurab," the delegates said.
</P>
<P>
It is true that the Party members, cadres and the general
public have seen the hopes from the results of reform and
opening-up in the past 20 years. That's also something to be
expected that they share the view in the current Party Congress to
hold high the banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory.
</P>
<P>
Owing to the above factors, they unanimously hailed the third
generation of collective leadership with Jiang Zemin at the core
as "staunch and firm successor of Deng Xiaoping Theory."
</P>
<P>
The definition of the "primary stage of socialism" was put
forward in the 13th Party congress ten years ago. However,
delegates held that the affirmation to the definition in the
current congress has enriched the theory. The congress has, for
the first time, made a systematic exposition of the basic guiding
principle of the primary stage of socialism, which is of important
immediate significance.
</P>
<P>
The reasons are clear: there are still some dubious or wrong
understanding of the current state situation. Meanwhile, with
reform heading to the critical period, contradiction of various
kinds are becoming more obvious and must be properly handled
according to China's reality.
</P>
<P>
That's why the delegates pointed out that the significance of
the exposition of the primary stage of socialism is not only the
perfection in theory but the guidance in practice.

<P>
The report pointed out China is currently in the primary stage
of socialism and will remain in the stage for a long time to come.
</P>
<P>
More importantly, the report called for top priority to
concentrating on the development of productive forces, a historic
process that will last at least a century.
</P>
<P>
One of the fundamental reasons why major errors occurred prior
to the country's reforms and opening-up lay in the fact that some
tasks and policies set forth at that time had overstepped the
primary stage of socialism.
</P>
<P>
Once thorough agreement has been reached throughout the Party
and the country in this regard, it is highly likely that the basic
line of the Party will be upheld for another century, literally as
what the Party has anticipated.
</P>
<P>
The delegates also shared the view that the congress has
offered a definite, clear and creative explanation of the issue of
public ownership, one that touches upon the most sensitive part of
the on-going economic restructuring in the country.
</P>
<P>
As far as delegates from the economic and theoretical circles
are concerned, the theoretical breakthrough concerning ownership
has pointed a way out for the economic restructuring, especially
the reform of state-owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Though the realization of diverse forms of public owership may
give rise to a drop in the proportion of the state sector to the
entire economy, the delegates agreed that it will not change the
socialist nature of China.
</P>
<P>
As the delegates indicated, the exposition of these important
issues in the report embodies the spirit of "emancipating the mind
and seeking truth from facts."
</P>
<P>
This principle should continue to receive utmost attention, the
delegates noted. Whatever undertakings conducive to reforms,
development and stability of the country should be bravely tried,
they said.
</P>
<P>
For delegates from regions where reforms began ahead of other
places, the theoretical breakthrough concerning ownership has been
no less a blessing.
</P>
<P>
Besides, delegates have shown universal approval of the major
parts of the report, including those on building a country ruled
by law, developing socialist democracy, building socialist culture
with Chinese characteristics, promoting peaceful unification of
the motherland, and cutting the size of the armed forces by
500,000.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the delegates are considering how to translate the
common understanding reached at the congress into unified will and
action throughout the Party and the whole country.

<HEADLINE> Non-Communist Parties Hail CPC National Congress (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 16 (Xinhua) -- The central committees of all
non-communist parties in China and the All-China Federation of
Industry and Commerce have sent letters of congratulations on
the convening of the 15th National Congress of the Communist
Party of China (CPC), which opened here last Friday.
</P>
<P>
A letter of congratulations from the Central Committee of the
Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang said the CPC
congress is a new milestone in the history of China for holding
high the great banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory for an all-round
advancement of the cause of building socialism with Chinese
characteristics to the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
Facts have proved that Deng's theory is a guideline for all
trades, the theoretical foundation for formulating line,
principles and policies and the spiritual support of the Chinese
nation to revitalize the country, it said.
</P>
<P>
The CPC Central Committee with Jiang Zemin as the core is a
staunch collective leadership which enjoys the love and trust of
the people of all nationalities in China, it added.
</P>
<P>
The China Democratic League said in its letter of
congratulations that the CPC congress is bound to draw up a
blueprint for China's reforms and opening-up and lead the Chinese
people to push forward the great cause of building socialism with
Chinese characteristics into the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
To achieve this objective, it will continue to adhere and
improve the political consultative system of multi-party
cooperation under the leadership of the CPC and make fresh
contributions to the prosperity and reunification of China, it
said.
</P>
<P>
The CPC is worthy of the core of leadership of the Chinese
revolution and construction. Deng Xiaoping Theory is the only
correct theory guiding the Chinese people to achieving
modernization in the course of reforms and opening-up, it said.
</P>
<P>
The basic line for the primary stage of socialism is the
guarantee for the healthy development of the cause of socialism,
it added.

<HEADLINE> WHO: Five Million Children's Lives Can Be Saved </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, September 16 (Xinhua) -- More than 11 million children
under the age of five die annually but at least five million of them
can be saved, the World Health Organization (WHO) said in a press
release here today.
</P>
<P>
70 percent of the 11 million children, around eight million, die
from one or more of five causes: pneumonia, diarrhea, measles,
malaria and malnutrition, WHO said.
</P>
<P>
However, with the joint strategy of Integrated Management of
Childhood Illness (IMCI), health workers will be more capable in
detecting the onset of the five greatest killers of children under
five.
</P>
<P>
The successful worldwide implementation of IMCI could prevent
the deaths of at least five million children, WHO said in its
press release issued after the First Global Review and
Coordination Meeting on IMCI, held in Santo Domingo, Dominican
Republic, from September 9 to 12.
</P>
<P>
Participants at the meeting also learned that doctors' current drug
usage costs could be reduced by almost 80 percent using IMCI. Families
taking their children for treatment were substantially more satisfied
with the care the children received when they were looked after by
IMCI-trained health workers.
</P>
<P>
Recent studies have been carried out in three districts in Uganda.
The three main goals of IMCI are to train health workers, improve the
ability of health systems to deliver quality care, and improve family
and community practices in relation to health care. IMCI advocates
that health workers adopt a holistic approach to examining and
treating children so that a child being treated for one illness is
also checked and treated for the other major childhood killers.

<HEADLINE> Lloyds Expects Impending Revolution in European </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 16 (Xinhua) - Aging populations in Europe
will cause large shifts in savings patterns in the first part of
the 21st century, Lloyds Bank expects.
</P>
<P>
Patrick Foley, Economic Adviser of the Lloyds Bank Group, told
a seminar here today that the direct effect of aging will be to
raise European saving rates by around 2 percent until around 2010,
and thereafter to reduce saving, compared with today's levels.
</P>
<P>
The direct effect will be swamped by the indirect impact on
saving resulting from growing crises in public pension systems, he
expected, saying that eventually governments will be forced to
reduce the generosity of pension payments, with profound effects
on private saving.
</P>
<P>
Foley estimated that average European private rates may rise
sharply in the next ten year - by perhaps 5 percent - in
anticipation of reduced public pensions.
</P>
<P>
In the longer term, he said, a switch from public to private
provision for retirement will result in much lower saving rates,
falling to zero in some countries, as the growing elderly
population draws down past savings.
</P>
<P>
The initial savings surge is likely to depress demand, causing
slow growth and high unemployment in many European countries.
Inflation is likely to fall even further from current levels, and
interest rates will be very low, Foley added.
</P>
<P>
However, Foley argued that the longer term collapse in
aggregate saving will strengthen demand relative to potential
output, especially given the decline in workforces.
</P>
<P>
European economies will need to borrow externally to finance
labor saving investment, and the period of low inflation may come
to an end, he conclude.

<HEADLINE> UK Women Still Lag Behind Men in Pay, Job Status </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 16 (Xinhua) -- British women still lag far
behind men in earnings and job status, according to a report today
by the Equal Opportunities Commission.
</P>
<P>
The report, Facts About Women and Men 1997, said that although
women make up 51 percent of the country's population and 45
percent of the paid workforce, they make up only 33 percent of
managers and administrators, six percent of police sergeants and
15 percent of legal partners.
</P>
<P>
It noted that women comprise only 18 percent of members of
Parliament and 31 percent of public appointments, and only one in
10 of the judiciary is a woman.
</P>
<P>
In the field of pay, although the gap has narrowed, it has done
so by only seven percent in the past 20 years. Working full time,
women continue to earn only 80 percent of men's average hourly
wage.
</P>
<P>
The situation is not changed even in retirement. The average
personal income of women aged 65-plus is only 58 percent of the
average for men in the same age group.
</P>
<P>
The report added that 67 percent of the country's women and 77
percent of men of working age have jobs. However, 45 percent of
women employees work part-time, compared to eight percent of men.
</P>
<P>
The commision's chairman Kamlesh Bahl said that these figures
show that women are becoming more visible, but that there is no
cause for complacency about their progress towards equality.

LONDON, September 16 (Xinhua) -- The coming weekend would be
the last chance for some one third of the lifters in British
Amateur Weightlifters Association who refused to take doping test,
an anti-doping official said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Michele Verroken, director of the ethics and anti-doping
section of the UK Sports Council, told a news conference on
Tuesday she had held "deep discussions" with the BAWA about the
adequacy of their testing program.

Verroken said she would hold crisis talks with the BAWA this
weekend and expects the association to accept responsibility for
testing lifters.
</P>
<P>
Verroken was unveiling her section's 1996/7 annual report which
showed positive tests for anabolic steroids had risen to 27 from
15 in 1995/96.
</P>
<P>
Five weightlifters received bans for positive tests last year
and Verroken highlighted the high percentage of weightlifters who
had made themselves unavailable for testing -- a rise to 31
percent from 23 last year.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Offers Apologies for Forest Fires </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President Soeharto
 apologized here today for woodland and forest fires in several
parts of the country, which have had a negative impact on
neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
"To the communities of neighboring countries which have been
disturbed by fires in our territory, Indonesia offers its most
sincere apologies," the president said when opening the Seventh
ASEAN Ministerial Meeting on the Environment.
</P>
<P>
He said Indonesia has actually done its utmost to prevent the
fires.
</P>
<P>
"However, the sheer vastness of our bushes and forests,
together with the prolonged drought, has created insurmountable
obstacles in the efforts to prevent and control the fires," he
told the three-day meeting.
</P>
<P>
At least 300,000 hectares of forest, mostly in Sumatra and
Kalimantan, have been destroyed by fire in Indonesia this year.
</P>
<P>
The haze caused by the fires has reached unhealthy levels here
and in Malaysia and Singapore.
</P>
<P>
State Minister of Environment Sarwono Kusumaatmadja said
earlier that about 20 million people are in danger of respiratory
problems due to the thick smoke.
</P>
<P>
On economic development as it concerns environmental
preservation efforts, Soeharto said environmental issues have been
incorrectly used by certain parties as a condition for
international trade.
</P>
<P>
In face of environmental, democracy and human rights questions,
the ASEAN should take concerted steps, which are reasonable, he
said.

<HEADLINE> French PM Wishes Good Result from Albright Mideast Tour </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, September 16 (Xinhua) -- French Prime Minister Lionel
Jospin said today that he wishes "positive consequences" from
the tour made last week by United States Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright in the Mideast.
</P>
<P>
He made the statement during a dinner with former Israeli Prime
Minister Shimon Peres, who was on a visit here.
</P>
<P>
Peres said that he was not optimistic about the perspective of
the Mideast peace process in a short term period, but he was
optimistic for a long-term period.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that Arabs and Israelis had fought five wars in
the past, but neither side wants to have a sixth.
</P>
<P>
He said that Israel won the five wars militarily but not
politically, while the Arabs lost the wars both militarily and
politically.
</P>
<P>
"Another war will not solve any problem... There should be an
intervention of reality and real choices," he said.
</P>
<P>
On the severe criticism launched last week by French Foreign
Minister Hubert Vedrine on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu, Peres said that the foreign minister could "also save
the declaration".
</P>
<P>
Vedrine accused Netanyahu of adopting a "catastrophic policy"
toward the Palestinians and had driven the latter to the
"unprecedented level of exasperation and despair".
</P>
<P>
Peres said that he also discussed with Jospin his plan to
launch a joint economic aid program for Palestinian cities by
Israel and Europe.
</P>
<P>
The plan includes economic aid by eight Israeli cities and
eight European cities (four French and four German) to eight
Palestinian cities, he said.

<HEADLINE> Food Production Varies in Kenya's Different Areas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 16 (Xinhua) -- The estimated maize
production in Rift Valley and Nyanza provinces may decline while
food supply has increased significantly in other provinces during
the current long rain season.
</P>
<P>
The Daily Nation today said that the maize production in Rift
Valley Province was estimated at 1.24 million tons in the long
rains, compared with 1.35 million tons in 1996 and 1.5 million
tons in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Irregular rainfall has hit the north Rift Valley where maize
and wheat crop might lose up to 50 percent production if more
rains are not received in the next two weeks, the paper added.
</P>
<P>
A senior agricultural official was quoted as saying "if the
dry weather continues to the end of this month, we might have a
crop failure of up to 40 percent in the whole of north Rift
region."
</P>
<P>
Market analysts predicted that due to the fall of food
production, the price of maize, the staple food for the Kenyans,
is expected to increase to 2,000 Kenyan Shillings a bag,
compared to last year's 1,200 Shillings and
600 Shillings in the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The paper noted that delayed long rains, mid-season flooding
and a prolonged dry spell after May had resulted in a significant
reduction in output in Nyanza province.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, food supply has increased significantly at the
markets in the early harvesting areas of Eastern, Coast and
Western provinces where maize price has declined by between 10 to
25 percent.
</P>
<P>
In the key maize producing districts like Uasin Gishu, Trans
Nzoia, Nandi, Kericho and Bungoma, harvesting is not expected
until November and December.
</P>
<P>
The six districts are expected to produce up to 40 percent of
the long rains national output of the east African country.
</P>
<P>
Kenya had suffered a serious drought during last two rain
seasons and the government has imported 375,000 tons of maize in
the past two months in order to meet the shortage of food supply
caused by the drought.

<TEXT>
<P>
ALMA ATA, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Troops from three Central
Asian countries, the United States, Turkey and Russia have started
a military exercise codenamed "97-Central Asian Peace-keeping
Battalion".
</P>
<P>
The war game, starting on Monday, involved 1,400 soldiers from
Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, the United States, Turkey and
Russia.
</P>
<P>
As a highlight of the drill, said a Kazakhstan Telegraph Agency
report today, 500 soldiers of the U.S. 82th Airborne Division and
40 Central Asian peace-keepers took a 17-hour non-stop flight.
</P>
<P>
The "unprecedented" long-distance airlift operation began in

<HEADLINE> ASEAN Members Urged to Cooperate in Handling Haze </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia today hoped that the
ASEAN spirit would serve as a basis for cooperation in tackling
the thick haze which has been enveloping some countries in the
region.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the Seventh ASEAN Meeting on the Environment here,
Malaysian Minister of Science, Technology and Environment Law
Hieng Ding noted that the haze, which has hit Malaysia and
Singapore, was caused by thousands of forest and bush fires raging
across Sumatra and Kalimantan, Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
The result has been an air pollution surpassing healthy ranges,
he said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the air pollution resulting from the thick haze
has reached Malaysia and is registering a reading of 390 on the
air pollution indicator (API).
</P>
<P>
Under the Malaysian API, readings from zero to 50 indicate good
air quality, 51 to 100 moderate, 101 to 200 unhealthy, 201 to 300
very unhealthy and 300 to 500 hazardous.
</P>
<P>
"What's most important now is how such problem, which tends to
occur every year, can be settled as soon as possible," he said.
</P>
<P>
During the three-day meeting, he said, the Malaysian government
will suggest that the Indonesian government find the best solution
to the problem, including the establishment of a special force
group by all ASEAN countries and giving it the task of putting out
the fires.
</P>
<P>
He also said Malaysia wants a memorandum of understanding on the
problem with Indonesia and hopes Singapore and Brunei will support
the measure.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, opened by Indonesian President Soeharto today, is
attended by representatives from the nine member countries of the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) -- Brunei,
Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, the Philippines, Laos,
Myanmar and Vietnam.

<HEADLINE> Diana's Bodyguard Capable of Communication: Doctor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Trevor Rees-Jones, the
bodyguard of the late Princess of Wales Diana and her friend Dodi
al Fayed, is "perfectly conscious" and can communicate, said
doctors of the French emergency medical rescue group Public
Assistance today.
</P>
<P>
But investigators in charge of the Diana case are still not
expecting to have his testimony in the coming weeks, because
Rees-Jones is extremely week from his injury.
</P>
<P>
Rees-Jones, who is being treated in the heavily-guarded
Pitie-Salpetriere Hospital in Paris, is the only survivor of the
crash of the Mercedes S-280 sedan in which Diana, Dodi, Rees-Jones
and the car's driver Henri Paul was traveling in the mid-night
between August 30 and 31 in downtown Paris.
</P>
<P>
"The state of Mr. Trevor Rees-Jones has noticeably improved. He
could be separated from the artificial ventilation and the
infection of his pulmonary contusion has been put under control,"
said Public Assistance in a communique.
</P>
<P>
It said that Rees-Jones, who is suffering from moderate brain
contusion, severe facial traumatism and pulmonary contusion, can
communicate well although he gets tired easily.
</P>
<P>
Previous reports said that he could not speak and only
communicate by blinking, and doctors had earlier warned that he
could suffer from amnesia.
</P>
<P>
Doctors conducted a 10-hour operation on his face on September
4.

<HEADLINE> Proposal to Reshuffle Cambodia's Cabinet Fails at Congress </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, September 16 (Xinhua) -- A proposal to partly
reshuffle the cabinet of Cambodia failed to go through the
country's National Assembly, or congress, today.
</P>
<P>
The 67 votes for the proposal, presented by the cabinet last
Tuesday, are not enough for its passage, which requires votes by
two-thirds of the 120 assembly members, of whom 97 voted today.
</P>
<P>
After the vote, Second Prime Minister Hun Sen told the press
that the result of the ballot demonstrated democratic spirit, with
which every congressman has the right to support or oppose.
</P>
<P>
But Hun Sen said the assembly will vote again on the proposal
after he and First Prime Minister Ung Huot return from the 52nd
U.N. General Assembly opening later this month in New York.
</P>
<P>
Under the proposal, the number of deputy prime ministers will
be increased from two to five and ministers of state from four to
10. Some ministers and secretaries of state will be replaced.
</P>
<P>
Local media believed that the failure of the proposal to be
approved by the National Assembly reflected disputes within the
royalist FUNCINPEC party, led by ousted Prince Norodom Ranariddh.
</P>
<P>
Some of the proposed new cabinet members belong to a separatist
faction of the FUNCINPEC party while most of the FUNCINPEC members
of the National Assembly are from the mainstream faction.

<HEADLINE> Lesotho Parliament Opens For Journalists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Media reporters in
Lesotho today resume coverage of parliament proceedings, after a
ban of nearly three weeks due to political tension.
</P>
<P>
Radio Lesotho, however, said members of the public will
continue to be prevented from attending sessions of the National
Assembly until further notice.
</P>
<P>
Reporters and the public were barred from parliament toward
the end of last month by the Speaker, Teboho Kolane, following
tension among legislators.
</P>
<P>
The situation was caused by an announcement by Prime Minister
Ntsu Mokhehle, calling members of the Basotoland Congress Party
(BCP) as the opposition in parliament.
</P>
<P>
Mokhehle broke away from the party in June to form the Lesotho
Congress For Democracy and declared it the governing political
body.
</P>
<P>
But the BCP law makers insist they are not the opposition in
parliament because they were duly elected under their party
ticket.
</P>
<P>
The radio said the expulsion of the journalists and the public
from the National Assembly is the first such incident in the
history of the Lesotho parliament.

<HEADLINE> Albanian Government Approves Plan to Hike Tax </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, September 16 (Xinhua) -- The Albanian government
approved a package of tax plans on Monday to raise the value-added
tax (VAT) from 12 percent to 22 percent beginning from October 1.
</P>
<P>
The Council of Ministers also decided to increase business tax
on cigarettes, imported No. 89 gasoline and lubricant to 70
percent, 60 percent and 80 percent respectively, local newspapers
reported today.
</P>
<P>
Though increase of business taxes on other items will be
smaller, it is widely believed here that the rise of VAT and
business tax will result in an overall hike of price index.
</P>
<P>
The package is pending the approval of Albanian parliament
scheduled for session today. It is reported that the Socialist
Party, which constitutes a majority in parliament, has different
opinions about the package and many Socialist congressmen have
expressed their opposition.
</P>
<P>
The VAT hike, aiming at cutting the huge budget deficit, was
proposed by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) as one of the
main conditions for providing economic aid to the country.
</P>
<P>
Albania's budget deficit reached 30 billion lek (1 U.S. dollar
equals to 143 lek) at the beginning of 1997.
</P>
<P>
Albanian Prime Minister Fatos Nano is scheduled to present the
tax package, if it get through in the parliament, to the IMF and
World Bank annual meeting in Hong Kong on September 20.

<HEADLINE> Iranian President Voices Support to Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Mohammad
Khatami today voiced support to Lebanon and hoped that Lebanon
would become more stronger to stand against Israel.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with visiting Lebanese Parliament Speaker Nabih
Berri, Khatami said that not only Lebanon's domestic unity is
needed but also Muslim and Arab world is required to stand by
Lebanon so as to achieve the goal.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian president noted that south Lebanon pays the
heaviest price for the Israeli aggressions and the people in
south Lebanon are resisting bravely.
</P>
<P>
He added that "the aggressive and expansionist nature of the
Zionist regime is the greatest danger to the region."
</P>
<P>
On the upcoming joint military exercise of the U.S., Turkey and
Israel and the Middle East and North Africa Economic Summit
scheduled to be held in Qatar in November with participation of
Israel, he said "such moves are aimed at sowing discord among the
Muslims."
</P>
<P>
The 54-year-old president warned "the enemies are trying to
sow discord among the Arab and Muslim states in a bid to
strengthen the position of Zionism."
</P>
<P>
He noted that the joint military exercise was not only an
insult to the regional nations but also a threat to the peace,
stability and the development of the region.
</P>
<P>
Khatami expressed his hope that the Qatari government would
cancel the scheduled summit in the interest of Qatar and the
entire region.
</P>
<P>
Nabih Berri arrived here Monday and held talks with Iranian
Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi and his Iranian counterpart Ali
Akbar Nateq-Nouri on bilateral ties, key regional issues and
developments in Lebanon Monday evening.

CAIRO, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Twenty-nine children were
killed and 54 others injured a truck ran off a road and overturned
in north of Cairo today, the Middle East News Agency (MENA)
reported.
</P>
<P>
Police said the victims were travelling to work when their
truck rolled into a canal in the village of Maseer, near Kafr

in the government-owned cotton fields in Kafr el-Sheikh. The
victims were rushed to a nearby hospital.

<HEADLINE> Demirel: Turkey Wants Good Ties with All Arabs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Trying to allay Arab worries
over Turkey's growing ties with Israel, President Suleyman Demirel
today said Ankara is keen to deepen ties with all Arab countries
"for the good of the region."
</P>
<P>
"Turkey sees that the prospects of peace are great and should
be invested," Demirel said after talks with Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak in Egypt's Mediterranean port city of Alexandria.
</P>
<P>
He said there is a lot of misunderstanding in respect of the
relations between Turkey and Israel. Turkey is to join the
U.S. and Israel in a three-way naval exercise in eastern
Mediterranean in mid-November.
</P>
<P>
The planned maneuvers under a military cooperation accord
concluded between Turkey and Israel in February 1996 provoked
outcries from Arab countries, especially Syria which regards
itself as the imaginary enemy of the war games.
</P>
<P>
"The Turkish-Israeli relations are not directed against any
country," Demirel said, adding the Turkey-Israel joint defense
agreement is just one of similar agreements Ankara signed with 28
countries.
</P>
<P>
Demirel reaffirmed the military agreement has no other purpose
than training on search and rescue operation.
</P>
<P>
"It is illogical to think of probable future military
operations between Turkey and Israel because, as I have explained
before, Turkey has no problems whatsoever with the Arab world," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Mubarak said Egypt does not object to Turkey's
relations with Israel so long as their relations and agreements,
as Demirel has asserted, are not targeted against anyone.
</P>
<P>
"At first we were worried by the Turkish-Israeli military
maneuvers but now I accept President Demirel's assertions that
their exercises are only for search and rescue purposes," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Ankara-Cairo relations are very good, Mubarak said, "We
want relations to continue in the same way and even better."
</P>
<P>
Demirel arrived in Alexandria this morning for a one-day visit
to Egypt aimed at enhancing relations with the Arab world.
</P>
<P>
The Egypt-Turkey summit, which was previously set for May, was
postponed after Turkey announced its decision to hold joint
military maneuvers with Israel.

<P>
HARARE, September 16 (Xinhua) -- The work has started to draft
regulations which will control the use of imported chemicals
which deplete the ozone layer, Zimbabwe's Mines, Environment and
Tourism Minister Simon Moyo said here today.
</P>
<P>
He said the work is being done in conjunction with the Ministry of
Health and Child Welfare together with the Attorney General's
Office.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks during the celebrations of the
International Ozone Layer Day which was set by the United Nations
General Assembly on December 19, 1994.
</P>
<P>
Moyo said, "Our industry, particularly the refrigeration
service industry, should take the necessary measures to stop
venting or emitting chlorofluorocarbons (CFCS) into the
atmosphere."
</P>
<P>
Those servicing refrigerators and air conditioning equipment
should use the recovery and reclamation equipment available in
the country to avoid emitting dangerous chemicals into the
atmosphere, Moyo said.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe has a program strategy of a 100 percent reduction of
all CFCS by year 2010.

<HEADLINE> Evidence Show German, U.S. Planes Collide over </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Evidence so far available
indicated that two German and United States military planes that
went missing late Saturday over the South Atlantic had collided in
mid-air, said German Defense Ministry today.
</P>
<P>
International search has found debris of the American C-141
Starlifter among the wreckage from the crashed German Tupolev 154,
according to the ministry. This confirmed the assumption that the
two missing aircraft collided in mid-air.
</P>
<P>
No further details were immediately available, said the
ministry.
</P>
<P>
Searchers saw little hope of finding survivors of the air
collision. There were altogether 33 people aboard the German and
U.S. military planes, 24 of them aboard the German Tupolev,
including three women.
</P>
<P>
Defense Minister Volker Ruehe said earlier today that the body
of a woman had been recovered, the identity of whom was still to
be confirmed.
</P>
<P>
More debris were found today 30 kilometres north off the area
where the first pieces were discovered on Monday, which was 255
kilometres (142 nautical miles) northwest off Walvis Bay of
Namibia.
</P>
<P>
Ruehe said the location where the German aircraft went down has
now been clearly identified.
</P>
<P>
The German Air Force Tupolev 154 went missing late Saturday en
route from Cologne to Cape Town. The plane had sent no emergency
signal and the last radio signal from it was registered when it
was about 1,500 kilometres west off Angola. It did not land in
Windhoek at 18:30 Saturday as planned for a stopover.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. military transport plane with nine people on board was
on its way from Windhoek to Ascension island when it disappeared
on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the U.S. plane took off 90 minutes ahead
of schedule, but the German Tupolev was not informed of this for
reasons yet unclear.

LONDON, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Ireland should grasp the
unique opportunity to guard against the kind of racism found
throughout the rest of Europe, according to Ireland's new
representative to the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR).
</P>
<P>
Addressing the annual general meeting of the Irish Refugee
Council in Dublin, Ms Hope Hanlan was quoted by press reports
reaching here as saying that Ireland, which had not been
corrupted, "should have the opportunity to do the right thing
before racism rears its ugly head".
</P>
<P>
It is commonly regarded that Ireland had been an "oasis" in
Europe in its treatment of refugees, but it now stood "at a
crossroads".
</P>
<P>
The Dublin Council meeting repeated its call on the Irish
government to fully implement the Refugee Act, and to develop
support and integration services for refugees without delay.
</P>
<P>
John O'Neil, director of the Refugee Agency, said that he
regretted the lack of a strong voice in the Irish government
opposing racism and promoting a positive image of refugees and
multi-culturalism.
</P>
<P>
The Irish government is planning to appoint more than 70
retired gardai (policemen) and civil servants to process
applications for asylum.

KHARTOUM, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Sudanese President Omar
Al-Bashir announced today that the Sudanese Armed Forces are all
set to restore the territories occupied by the Eritrean troops in
east Sudan.
</P>
<P>
During his visit today to the Tokar governorate in the east
Sudan's Red Sea state, the president said the morale of the armed
forces was high, according to the Sudan news agency.
</P>
<P>
Tokar has been the scene of military operations mounted by the
Eritrea-backed Sudanese opposition forces. Eritrea severed its
ties with Sudan in December 1994, accusing Sudan of interfering in
its internal affairs and supporting the Eritrean "Islamic Jihad"
opposition movement.
</P>
<P>
The accusation was promptly denied by Sudan. However, the
Sudanese opposition forces have been using Eritrean territory as a
launching pad for cross-border attacks deep into Sudan.
</P>
<P>
Al-Bashir's eastward tour also covered Port Sudan, which he
visited Monday, and Senkat. He was accompanied by Defense Minister
Hassan Abdul-Rahman Ali and a number of senior Army officers.
</P>
<P>
The president is also scheduled to visit the Halayeb region, a
disputed area with Egypt. There has been mounting tension over the
past two weeks in the disputed Halayeb triangle, where the
Sudanese authorities accused Egypt of undertaking military
operations.
</P>
<P>
During his visit to Tokar, Al-Bashir also announced to release
political prisoners in the Red Sea state as well as the opposition
elements which have taken up arms against the government.

<P>
KUWAIT CITY, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian Crown Prince
Hassan Ibn Talal arrived in the Red Sea port city of Jeddah today
on a two-day official visit to Saudi Arabia in a bid to improve
bilateral relations, Kuwait News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Hassan, who is accompanied by a high-ranking delegation
including Foreign Minister Fayez Tarawneh, paid the visit at the
invitation of Saudi Crown Prince and Deputy Prime Minister Prince
Abdullah Ibn Abdel-Aziz, the report said.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in Saudi Arabia, Hassan and his Saudi
counterpart Abdel-Aziz are expected to hold talks on further
improving relations between the two countries that became
estranged from each other following the Gulf war which was
triggered off by Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
During the Gulf war, Saudi Arabia and other Arab countries
sided with Kuwait, while Jordan and Palestine supported Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Relations between the two countries made a breakthrough in
1996 when Jordanian King Hussein visited Saudi Arabia and met
King Fahd Ibn Abdul-Aziz. Hussein made his second visit to the
Gulf Kingdom last January.
</P>
<P>
Jordan has also inched to a restoration of relations with Kuwait
as the two countries have exchanged visits of officials over the
past two years and resumed direct air links last July.
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic sources were quoted as saying Hassan is likely to
hold talks with Fahd on the latest development in the Middle East
region.
</P>
<P>
Prince Hassan's visit to Saudi Arabia came two days after the
end of U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright's visit to the
region, which took her to Israel, the Palestinian self-rule
areas, Syria, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Jordan and Lebanon.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Ruling Party Resolves to Campaign for Moi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 16 (Xinhua) -- The ruling Kenya African
National Union (KANU) resolved today to campaign for President
Daniel arap Moi's re-election and commit constitutional reforms
package drafted by both KANU and opposition lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
KANU is committed to the reforms and "ready for peaceful
elections which should be free and fair and may the best win,"
KANU Secretary-General Joseph Kamotho said after Moi formally
accepted his nomination as KANU's sole presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
The one-day KANU Special National Delegates Conference,
attended by around 5,000 people from all tribes in all the eight
provinces of the east African state, approved the nomination
unanimously with jubilant chanting this morning.
</P>
<P>
The multi-party general election is coming soon, Kamotho
added. Local analysts say the election is most likely to be held
in mid-November.
</P>
<P>
Moi, 74 and in power for 19 years, is widely believed to win
his last campaign for the five-year-term presidency mainly due to
the opposition's split as well as strong support for him by
various small tribes and Asian Kenyans who weigh heavily on the
country's economic lifelines.
</P>
<P>
However, the party elections failed to be held at today's
conference, causing some delegates' complaints. Kamotho said
after the general election, another KANU national delegates
conference will be convened for the issue.
</P>
<P>
The last KANU national delegate conference was held in
December 1991 also for the same agenda on the eve of the
first-ever multi-party election in Kenya in the following year.
</P>
<P>
More than two-third parliamentary members, at least 40 of them
from the opposition, last week approved Inter-Parties
Parliamentary Group's package on a raft of constitutional and
social reforms.
</P>
<P>
The package recommended the repeal or revision of 12 laws
described as "oppressive", the expansion of Kenya's Electoral
Commission to bring in members nominated by the opposition, and
the equal access to state media for the opposition.

<HEADLINE> Meeting Held on Improving African Communications </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TUNIS, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Communications ministers of
African countries met here today to study the projected African
submarine cable known as "Africa One."
</P>
<P>
The three-day meeting was organized by the project's
coordination committee in cooperation with the International
Communications Union.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, the ministers are to join specialists and
African and foreign investors to examine ways and means to
accomplish this project at the earliest possible date.
</P>
<P>
The project was designed to improved communications between the
African continent and the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
Addressing today's meeting, Ahmed Laouyan, chairman of the
project's coordination committee, said the "Africa One" represents
a completely integrated regional communications system comprising
a 39,000-kilometer-long cable of optical fibers linking all
African states with the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the project was launched in late 1993 on
the initiative of the International Communications Union, with the
joint efforts of the African Satellite Communications
Organization and the African Communications Union.
</P>
<P>
He added that the "Africa One" project will link some 29 points
in coastal African states, while land-locked states will plug in
through ordinary or satellite lines. The total cost of the project
amounts to 1.6 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The coordination committee of the "Africa One" project
comprises representatives of the International Communications
Union, the African Satellite Communications Organization, the
African Communications Union, and delegates from Tunisia,

<HEADLINE> Gap between Rich and Poor Widening in Germany </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, September 16 (Xinhua) -- The gap between the rich and
poor is widening in Germany with the numbers of the social welfare
recipients and those of the top income bracket both increasing
sharply within the past ten years.
</P>
<P>
According to Ursula Engelen-Kefer, vice-chairperson of the
German Federation of Labour Unions, the number of people who are
dependent on social welfare benefits had grown by about 800,000 to
nearly 2.5 million in western Germany over the past decade.
</P>
<P>
In the eastern half of the country, the figures also had jumped
by 20 percent to about 300,000 since 1991.
</P>
<P>
In Germany as a whole, there were about 2.8 million social
welfare recipients in 1996, with the hardest-hit being the jobless
people, divorced women and families with many children.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the number of people with a monthly net income of
more than 10,000 German marks (about 5,600 U.S. dollars) had also
increased six times over the past decade, the union leader said.
</P>
<P>
The widening division between the rich and poor had aroused
many social problems and is becoming the catalyst for
right-extremist and xenophobic sentiments in Germany, she warned.

<P>
WASHINGTON, September 16 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Senate today
unanimously confirmed Army General Henry Shelton to be the next
chairman of the U.S. military Joint Chiefs of Staff.
</P>
<P>
Shelton, who led U.S. forces in Haiti and now the head of the
U.S. Special Operations Command, replaces General John
Shalikashvili, who will retire at the end of this month.
</P>
<P>
The 55-year-old Shelton will be the third Army general in a row
to be the two-year term chairman that traditionally has rotated
among Army, Navy and Air Force officers.
</P>
<P>
At his nomination hearing before the Senate Armed Services
Committee earlier this month, Shelton said he supported President
Bill Clinton's plan to remove troops from Bosnia in mid-1998. He
also expressed hied support for efforts to modernize U.S. weaponry
for the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
Shelton's nomination in July came after Air Force General
Joseph Ralston, vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs, withdrew from
the running due to revelations he had an adulterous affair in the
past.

<HEADLINE> Medicare Computer Overhaul Canceled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 16 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Government has
canceled a multimillion-dollar computer system overhaul meant to
simplify its Medicare program billing and help root out fraud.
</P>
<P>
Medicare is the federal health insurance program covering
millions of elderly and disabled Americans.
</P>
<P>
"The cost and pace of work were unacceptable," Medicare
spokesman Chris Peacock said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Medicare's current computer setup -- 10 separate systems used
by 72 private insurance companies that process Medicare claims --
turned out to be more difficult to reorganize than expected.
</P>
<P>
Members of Congress criticized the project earlier this year
after discovering it was over budget and behind schedule.
</P>
<P>
The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) ordered the
main private contractor, GTE, to end the job last month, after
rethinking the project during a summer-long suspension of most
work.
</P>
<P>
Department officials said they have decided to make incremental
improvements over time, some building on GTE's work.
</P>
<P>
GTE had assigned 90 employees to the Medicare project. The
company has been paid 43 million dollars to date, according to
Medicare. GTE's original contract was for 19 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
HHS officials had trumpeted the modernization as a way to speed
payments, improve customer service and cut out fraud in the
Medicare program, which overpaid health care providers by 23
billion dollars last year, according to a recent audit.

<HEADLINE> Angola Places Mineral Industry as Major Pillar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Angolan Minister of Geology
and Mines Marcos Samondo said today that the geological and
mineral industry will become a major pillar in the country's
economic development.
</P>
<P>
He made the statement to the Angola News Agency in the central
city of Sumbe.
</P>
<P>
The minister believed that the geological and mineral sectors
have fine prospects for bringing an economic boom to Angola.
</P>
<P>
Angola is rich in such minerals as diamond, iron, gold and
copper, he said, adding that tapping these resources will make
the industry a pillar in the country's economy.
</P>
<P>
The Angolan government has made a preliminary plan for the
industry, with the first phase focusing on iron mines, to be
followed by the development of phosphate, mineral water, copper
and other minerals, Samondo noted.
</P>
<P>
Angola's mineral industry has been devastated by long years of
civil war, and the key issue for restoring the production is
capital, which is now in dire need.
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, Angola has reached an agreement
with the Southern African Development Community (SADC) member
states to promote regional cooperation in this regard.
</P>
<P>
Samondo also revealed that his ministry is now undertaking a
comprehensive survey on the country's mineral resources, which
will lead to minute professional maps for future investment in
the sector.

<HEADLINE> Canada's Living Standard Drops, Study </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Canada is the only major
industrial country this decade to have suffered a drop in its
standard of living, according to an economic think tank here.
</P>
<P>
The living standard in Canada plummeted from second to that of
the United States to seventh place over the 1989-96 period, the
Center for Study of Living Standards says in a soon-to-be-released
report.
</P>
<P>
Canada was the only one of the group of 13 industrial countries
to experience an absolute fall in living standards, the study
notes.
</P>
<P>
Its gross domestic product (GDP) per capita dropped 0.4 percent
in the seven-year period, while the average growth in per capita
GDP for the 13 countries was 9.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
This fall in per capital GDP has pushed Canada from the ranks
of wealth per individual to seventh behind the U.S., Norway,
Japan, Germany, Denmark and Belgium.
</P>
<P>
In 1989, Canada's per capita GDP was 81.7 percent of that in
the U.S. By 1996, it slipped to 76.7 percent of the U.S. figure.
</P>
<P>
On the productivity front, Canada's performance was equally
disappointing.
</P>
<P>
The country's productivity rose only 4.3 percent over the
period. This was the smallest increase among the 13 countries. The
average increase for the group was 12.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
The study says Canada's economic problems during the period are
largely of its own making.
</P>
<P>
One of the major reasons for the results is the severe impact
of Canada's monetary policy during the period when the Bank of
Canada conducted a high-interest rate policy to combat inflation.
</P>
<P>
The high interest rates led to the Canadian economy
underperforming compared with other countries, the study says.

<HEADLINE> WFP Warns of Widespread Hunger in Tanzania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 16 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations World
Food Program (WFP) today warned that three million Tanzanians
might face severe food shortages over the next several months due
to drought-induced crop failure in most regions of the country.
</P>
<P>
The Tanzania government announced Monday that the country's
national food deficit is estimated to be as high as 916,000 tons,
according to a report released today by the U.N. DHA Integrated
Regional Information Network.
</P>
<P>
Ten percent of this deficit, said the report, will be required
as emergency food aid, which amounts to 92,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
The alarmingly high deficit is compounded by the problem of
Tanzania's low level of stocks in its Strategic Grain Reserve for
which the recommended level is 150,000 tons, but which has now
dwindled to just 17,000 tons, WFP said in an official statement.
</P>
<P>
Tanzanian President Benjamin Mpaka Monday declared a national
food emergency and banned all food exports.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, WFP is preparing an emergency food aid operation in
response to the drought. The U.N. agency today appealed to donor
countries to make immediate contributions to ensure that relief
food would quickly reach those most in need.
</P>
<P>
"Food donations typically takes a minimum of three to four
months to arrive in Tanzania," stressed Irene Lacy, WFP Country
Director for Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
"However," she added, "it is crucial that relief food
distributions get underway as early as September when food stocks
are expected to be exhausted."

</P>
<P>
The three-day conference will dwell on the difficulties
encountered in organizing the May 17, 18 and August 3 legislative

</P>
<P>
Other issues to be discussed at the conference would be the
assessment of voters' registration.
</P>
<P>
The last conference of governors held in March this year had
focused on security matters. Although the circumstances under
which today's conference is convened may not be the same, public
security, peace and tranquility would still be the concern for

<HEADLINE> Air Crash Rescue in Namibia Enters Second Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 16 (Xinhua) -- A multi-nation search
operation for two planes which collided in mid-air off the
Namibian coast has ended its second day with little success.
</P>
<P>
Reports reaching here from Windhoek, the Namibian capital
said, so far only one unidentified body has been recovered from
the sea.
</P>
<P>
An American air force cargo plane, with nine people on board,
and a German military aircraft, with 24 passengers, crashed off
the northern Namibian coast late on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The planes went down in an area 50 kilometers south of the
mouth of the Kunene river at the Angolan-Namibian border, and 90
kilometers off the coast.
</P>
<P>
The search and rescue mission has managed to recover more
debris belonging to the German aircraft.
</P>
<P>
Seven more planes from German and American air force have
arrived in Windhoek, to assist the recovery of any wreckage,
bodies and survivors.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Police Station in Northern Ireland Damaged by Bomb </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 16 (Xinhua) -- A police station in Northern
Ireland was badly damaged by bomb today, the BBC television
reported.
</P>
<P>
The blast at Markethill, Co Armagh, came as police were
clearing the area.
</P>
<P>
There were no reports of injures, but several people were
treated for shock.
</P>
<P>
The bomb is believed to have been placed in a blue transit van
outside the station.
</P>
<P>
None has admitted the attack but it has disrupted multi-party
talks on the future of Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
The Ulster Unionists want Sinn Fein, the political arm of the
Irish Republican Army (IRA), to be thrown out of the multi-party
talks.
</P>
<P>
But the IRA has said it is not responsible for the bomb attack.
</P>
<P>
Northern Ireland security minister Adam Ingram said it was too
early to establish which group was responsible.
</P>
<P>
He said he wanted to fully establish the facts before making a
judgement.

<HEADLINE> US Industrial Production Rises Strongly in August </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 16 (Xinhua) -- The industrial production
in the U.S. increased by 0.7 percent in August, the U.S. Federal
Reserve (Fed) reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Fed said that the strong advance in production pushed the
operating rate at U.S. factories, mines and utilities to 83.9
percent of capacity, the highest since September 1995.
</P>
<P>
Manufacturing output increased by 1 percent in August after a
0.5 percent gain in July. The increase -- the most since April
1996 -- pushed the operating rate at U.S. factories to 83.1
percent, also the highest since September 1995.
</P>
<P>
The acceleration in U.S. industrial production between July and
August was concentrated in manufacturing, much of which was
related to the 10 percent jump in the assembly of autos and light
trucks, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Led by a 2.1 percent advance in the production of durable
goods, the overall output of consumer goods grew 0.6 percent in
the month. The production of nondurable goods increased by 0.3
percent.
</P>
<P>
But the operating rate at U.S. mines decreased by 1.0
percentage points in August to 92.2 percent, while the rate at
utilities was down by 1.1 percentage points to 87.4 point.
</P>
<P>
Some analysts said that it's time to get concerned when the
operating rate in the U.S. factories, mines and utilities is above
83 percent of capacity.

<HEADLINE> Canada's Defense Industry Employs 50,000: Study </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, September 16 (Xinhua) -- A new study has found that
Canada's defense industry employs up to 50,000 people and
generated more than 5 billion Canadian dollars (3.6 billion US
dollars) in sales last year alone.
</P>
<P>
Quebec and Ontario, particularly the Ottawa area, accounted for
a substantial number of defense jobs, according to the study
released today.
</P>
<P>
The study, commissioned by the Canadian Defense Preparedness
Association (CDPA), indicated that the defense industry directly
employed 28,619 workers last year in 1,500 defense-related firms.
</P>
<P>
With economic spinoffs, about 50,000 jobs depend on the
industry across the country.
</P>
<P>
The CDPA, which represents Canadian companies in defense work,
commissioned the study because it is unhappy about the way the
sector is categorized in government data.
</P>
<P>
Ottawa needs more accurate information about the defense sector
because of impending policy decisions about restructuring Canada's
military, the CDPA said.
</P>
<P>
The CDPA clearly hopes to use the study to influence the
shaping of the country's defense industry policy.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Determined to Protect National Industries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, September 16 (Xinhua) -- A senior Zambian official
declared here today that the Zambian government is determined to
protect its industries from subsidized imports, according to
Zambia News Agency Zana.
</P>
<P>
After a conducted tour with two visiting Tanzanian deputy
ministers in the capital, Ackim Nkole, deputy minister of
commerce, trade and industry, said no more industries in Zambia
will be closed down as measures are being put in place to arrest
the situation.
</P>
<P>
Many companies in the manufacturing sector in particular have
been bankrupt since the country's economic liberalization in
early 1990s, due to "unfair competition" from foreign goods,
President Frederick Chiluba was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
"The government is doing everything possible to ensure that
local manufacturing companies are protected from cheap subsidized
imports," said Nkole.
</P>
<P>
He cited the government's ban on the importation of wheat
flour as one of the many measures to be taken to protect local
producers.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, Zambia issued an order with immediate
effect to ban the importation of wheat flour on grounds that the
country's milling capacity can meet the demands of its
population.
</P>
<P>
The government has complained that Zambia is being turned into
a "dumping ground" for cheap goods from neighboring countries
such as South Africa and Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
Local industrialists and manufacturing organizations have
urged the government to counteract and slap reasonable duty on
all imported goods into the country to protect its national
industries.

<HEADLINE> Common People Praise Jiang's Report (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Jiang Zemin's report to the
the 15th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, which
began on September 12, has been a daily topic of conversation
amongst common Chinese people who have benefited from the reform
and opening effort.
</P>
<P>
Most share the view that the report has instilled greater
confidence about the third generation leadership of the CPC with
Jiang Zemin at the core, who have pledged to uphold the great
banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory and continue the reform and opening
drive initiated by Deng.
</P>
<P>
"Jiang told the congress that Chinese people have witnessed the
greatest ever improvements in their living standards over the past
five years," according to Qiang Ziqiang, an engineer from
Shanghai. "We feel it personally and foreigners visiting my family
are fully cognizant of the fact."
</P>
<P>
Qiang's residence is known as a so-called "open house" in
Shanghai, the largest metropolitan area in China. Qiang's family
has hosted over 20,000 foreign visitors who want to learn about
the daily life of an ordinary Chinese family since 1980s.
</P>
<P>
"Our country has adhered to a development goal and a constant
ideological direction," said Qiang, adding that people's lives
have been enriched, along with their access to knowledge and
entertainment.
</P>
<P>
Qiang spoke highly of Jiang's special note on economic
diversity based on the state economy.
</P>
<P>
Qiang's family, in fact, represents a "diverse economy". He and
his wife retired from state enterprises. Their eldest son works in
a Sino-foreign joint venture, while their second son, who
completed his studies abroad, has opened his own company, and
their daughter, the youngest of the three children, works for a
state firm.
</P>
<P>
"All Chinese, both young and old, regard the reform and opening
policy as good luck," said Qiang.

Hao Peisheng, an employee of the Shanghai Southern Railway

Theory."

Locals in Wenzhou, east China's Zhejiang Province which is
widely viewed as a pioneering reform city, have expressed profound
feelings about the ongoing Party Congress.

good policies of state." said Wu Xiaomei.

Wu started her business recycling plastic products. She
currently owns property valued at over 10 million yuan and last
year alone paid taxes of over 980,000 yuan.
</P>
<P>
"Business people in Wenzhou have taken advantage of
opportunities since the country adopted the reform and opening
policies," said Wu, adding that she believes that the policy will
be further expanded after the Party Congress and the private
economy will enjoy further development.
</P>
<P>
The Handan Steel Complex, in north China's Hebei Province, a
reform model for state companies, has increased its capital assets

Li Yuning, deputy director of the company's enterprise
management department, said: "Every change has resulted from the
guidance of Deng Xiaoping Theory, and it is the will of the whole
Party and the whole people that Jiang has proposed adherence to
the Deng Xiaoping Theory as the guiding principle of the Party."
</P>
<P>
Deng Yuehua, a worker at the Dagang Oil Field which is located
near Tianjin in north China, said Jiang's report "represented a
theoretical and ideological upgrade and his proposal that public
ownership can be realized in diverse forms represents "a new

<HEADLINE> Reemployment To Be Handled Seriously: Delegates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Delegates to the on-going
Party congress agreed that it is an effective way to reemploy
redundant and laid-off workers by assigning them to the service
trades.
</P>
<P>
The delegates urged practical measures to be taken to reduce
unemployment, a worsening problem to many firms which are going to
be merged or go bankrupt as a result of the deepening reforms.
</P>
<P>
State-owned businesses have so far laid off approximately
ten million workers.
</P>
<P>
But Sources say another 70 million are to compete for jobs in
the Ninth Five-Year Plan period (1996-2000). Together with 15
million workers diverted from state-owned businesses, the supply
of total labor force will exceed demand in a long time to come.
</P>
<P>
However, maintaining a specific unemployment rate can offer a
loose environment for continued reforms in the state sector, as
well as opportunities for laid-off workers to get new jobs
provided there is a complete social security system, said Wen
Shizhen, governor of Liaoning province where state-owned
businesses are concentrated and the number of laid-off workers
topped most other areas.
</P>
<P>
Wen said that special attention should be paid to four aspects:
promote the change of concept of choosing jobs, develop employment
channels, organize the training of the laid-off workers for new
employment, and improve the labor market.
</P>
<P>
Liu Hongren, vice chairman of the Shandong Provincial Committee
of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, added
that the state-owned enterprises and the government should not be
solely responsible for providing jobs only.
</P>
<P>
The delegates gave full appreciation of the achievements China
made in reemploying redundant and laid-off workers in the past
two years.
</P>
<P>
A total of 1.5 million laid-off workers were reemployed in 1996
and meanwhile about 22 provinces, regions and municipalities have
worked out specific methods for reemployment.
</P>
<P>
So far, over 4,000 employment agencies have been set up across
the country.

<HEADLINE> New Topic on an Old Lane </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Zhuanta Lane, less than one
kilometer from Zhongnanhai, the headquarters of the Communist
Party of China (CPC) and central government, is the oldest
residential street in Beijing, the national capital.
</P>
<P>
These days, the ongoing 15th National Congress of CPC has
become a constant topic of conversation amongst residents living
on the lane which is known for towers built in the Yuan Dynasty
(1271-1368) and centuries old trees.
</P>
<P>
Zhong Jianguo, an employee of the Capital Steel Works, and his
family are concerned about the restructuring of state-owned
enterprises. "My company has over 200,000 employees, and the fate
of the firm directly relates to the life of its workers," said
Zhong.
</P>
<P>
"Clarification of the direction for restructuring state firms
in Jiang Zemin's report made me feel better," said Zhong.
</P>
<P>
Wang Yichao, a local resident and retired teacher, said that
"Jiang's report greatly encouraged teachers since he called for
more respect for teachers and placing priority on education."
</P>
<P>
Xie Shimin, who retired from the Beijing Higher People's Court
and lives at the No.86 Courtyard, told Xinhua: "Jiang carefully
detailed legislative work in his report.
</P>
<P>
"China must reinforce its legislative sector and establish a
healthy and complete socialist legal system as the guarantee for
economic development and restructuring state-owned enterprises."
</P>
<P>
Feng Zhi'an, governor of Hebei Province under the old regime
and an anti-Japanese military leader, also lived on the lane. Feng
died years ago in Taiwan, but his grandson Feng Yongpeng still
lives on the lane. He said that his grandfather's last will was to
be buried in his hometown. He noted that his grandfather's request
has not been fulfilled due to the present cross-Straits separation.
</P>
<P>
"All Chinese people hope that the reunification of the
motherland will be realized at the earliest possible date, and
Jiang has outlined a clear direction for tackling the complicated
Taiwan Question. I believe that my grandfather's will will
eventually come true," said Feng.
</P>
<P>
Liu Jianju, a restaurant manager, said: "The congress has
convinced me that the country's reform and opening will not
change. It has also encouraged the further development of the
private sector."

<HEADLINE> China to Organize First International Service Trade Group </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 17 (Xinhua) -- China announced today that
five Shanghai-based state-owned foreign trade companies will join
hands and organize the country's first international service
trade group.
</P>
<P>
Zhu Xiaoming, director of the Shanghai Foreign Economic
Relations and Trade Commission, who is here attending the ongoing
15th National Party Congress, said the new enterprise group will
be established later this month.
</P>
<P>
The five companies are the Shanghai Foreign Services Co. Ltd,
Shanghai Arts and Crafts Import and Export Corporation, Shanghai
Advertising Co. Ltd, Shanghai Foreign Economic Relations and Trade
Industrial Co. and Shanghai Foreign Economic and Trade and
Exhibition Co..
</P>
<P>
These five companies' sales volume in 1996 hit a total of 2.751
billion yuan with their total assets reaching 2.635 billion yuan,
495 million yuan of which were in net assets.
</P>
<P>
Though Shanghai is short of natural resources, it has lots of
talents and this is very good for developing service trades such
as finance, posts and telecommunications, transportation,
consultancy, tourism, and real estate, international service trade
in particular.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of the new enterprise group will facilitate
the city to participate in competition at the domestic and

<HEADLINE> Japanese Officials Arrested for Involving Financial Scandal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Prosecutors today arrested one
current and four former officials of a major Japanese securities
brokerage for allegedly paying off a corporate racketeer.
</P>
<P>
The Tokyo District Public Prosecutors Office said those
arrested are suspected of passing on some 79 million yen (660,000
U.S. dollars) of the brokerage's profits in 1995 to Ryuichi Koike.
</P>
<P>
The arrestees included Hidekuni Lyama, a former senior managing
director of Yamaichi Securities Co., and the four others were also
related to the securities operation, one of the largest in Japan.
</P>
<P>
Koike, a notorious racketeer known as "sokaiya" in the Japanese
language, is also a major suspect of another illegal payoff
scandal involving Nomura Securities Co. and Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank.
</P>
<P>
The prosecutors issued a fresh arrest warrant today to Koike,
who already has been in police custody.
</P>
<P>
Investigation indicated that Koike opened an account at
Yamaichi in June 1994 through a real estate company owned by his
younger brother and became the company's "special shareholder."
</P>
<P>
Then, Koike asked the brokerage to undertake illegal
discretionary trading on his behalf.
</P>
<P>
He demanded compensation from Yamaichi in December 1994 after
the discretionary trading resulted in losses totalling some 30
million yen (250,000 dollars).
</P>
<P>
Yamaichi reimbursed Koike, through company officials, for the
losses with the profits it gained from futures trading on the
Singapore International Money Exchange.
</P>
<P>
Payoff to a "special shareholder" is banned under Japan's
Commercial Code, and the reimbursement of stock transaction losses
and discretionary securities trading are prohibited under the
Securities and Exchange Law.

HARARE, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe has already declared
its ivory stockpile to the Convention On International Trade In
Endangered Species (CITES) Secretariat and can start selling when

<P>
Minister of Mines, Evironment and Tourism Simon

</P>
<P>
Moyo said in the statement that in its proposal to CITES,
Zimbabwe declared it had 33.4 tonnes of ivory in its stores.
According to the statement, the Zimbabwean government asked to
trade 20 tonnes of its ivory with Japan. Another 8.8 tonnes and
a further 4.6 tonnes were declared for a buy-out arrangement and
for sale to the local ivory carving industry.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Entitled to Check Subsidized Imports: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, September 17 (Xinhua) -- The Common Market For
Southern and Eastern Africa (COMESA) said here today Zambia, one
of its members, has the right to check the dumping of subsidized
imports.
</P>
<P>
COMESA acting Secretary General Erastus Mwencha said if Zambia
has proved that some imports into the country are
subsidized by the exporting country, it has the right, under the
World Trade Organization and COMESA provisions, to retaliate to
ensure that local industries are protected.
</P>
<P>
He said that when such proof is made, Zambia like any other
country, will be free to impose higher tariffs on such products
found to be subsidized and competing unfairly with local
products.
</P>
<P>
Mwencha was responding to outcries by Zambian manufacturing
industries that Zambia's over liberalization of economy has given
them unfair competition with subsidized imports that have flooded
the market, mostly from South Africa.
</P>
<P>
One major example is the recent closure of Dunlop Tire Company
after failing to cope with subsidized tires from South Africa.
</P>
<P>
To protect local milling companies, Zambia recently imposed a
ban on the importation of wheat flour into the country.

SHENYANG, September 17 (Xinhua) -- The number of overseas
tourists visiting northeast China's Liaoning Province is expected
to witness double-digit growth during the Ninth Five-Year Plan
period (1996-2000).
</P>

</P>
<P>
The province is rich in tourism resources, including seven
state-level scenic areas and 13,000 historical sites.

LUSAKA, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Zambia Democratic Congress
(ZDC) has withdrawn from the opposition National Patriotic
Coalition (NPC), saying that it was gaining nothing from its
association with the UNIP-led coalition.
</P>
<P>
ZDC Deputy General-Secretary Azwel Banda said here Tuesday
that the party has decided to extend this action from Lusaka to
the rest provinces because of what he called wrong perceptions
that ZDC was operating under the UNIP (The United National
Independence Party), Zambia Daily Mail reported today.
</P>
<P>
He lashed out NPC chairman Roger Chongwe for his alleged fears
about ZDC's participation in the umbrella coalition and what he
termed Chongwe's faulty prediction that ZDC president Dean
Mungomba will quit politics after party general secretary Derrick
Chitala resigned from the party last week.
</P>
<P>
"Dr Chongwe suffers from paranoiac xenophobia about the status
of our party in the National Patriotic Coalition," he said.
</P>
<P>
Lusaka province ZDC senator Langstone Sichone announced the
suspension of ZDC ties with the NPC Monday.
</P>
<P>
Times of Zambia today also quoted Banda as saying that "we
feel betrayed by some of our colleagues in the coalition and
cannot allow a situation where programs of coalition are going to
be imposed on us by individual parties."

HARARE, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe has already declared

Minister of Mines, Environment and Tourism Simon Moyo said

The minister's statement was provoked by reports emanating

</P>
<P>
The country would have been forced to make a last ditch effort

</P>
<P>
During the 10th CITES conference, it was agreed that all
countries wishing to trade in ivory, when trade resumed, would

Another 8.8 tons and a further 4.6 tons were declared for a

industry.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe has detailed data on all stocked tusks. If stocks
were not registered, it would be assumed they did not exist, and
consequently no trade in them could be undertaken.

Moyo promised to ensure Zimbabwe fulfilled trade requirements
in all three categories.

bordering Uganda and Burundi, a report from the west said today.
</P>
<P>
Intelligence sources in western Uganda could not determine the
motive of the deployment -- to deal with the remnants of the
Allied Democratic Forces (ADF) or to guarantee peace in south and
north Kivu provinces from ethnic clashes.

ADF is a rebel group acting in western Uganda with some 350

<P>
LAGOS, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's head of state
general Sani Abacha has assured Nigerians that his military
administration will quit office on October 1 next year as
scheduled.
</P>
<P>
While receiving periodic reports from the Tranistion
Implementation Committee (TIC) in the capital Abuja Tuesday,
Abacha said the military government was committed to the
implementation of the transition program to enthrone enduring
democracy in the country.
</P>
<P>
The TIC reports on the transition to civil rule program
covered October 1 last year and June 30 this year.
</P>
<P>
TIC Chairman Mamman Nasir said earlier his committee was
satisfied with the activities of the National Electoral
Commission of Nigeria (NECON).
</P>
<P>
NECON had, during the period, registered voters and conducted
the local government elections.
</P>
<P>
Some amendments have been made in the three-year transition
program, with the date of state governor and assembly elections,
for example, changed from the third quarter of this year to next
year.
</P>
<P>
Abacha has repeatedly said his administration would usher in
democracy in 1998.
</P>
<P>
But according to observers, what Abacha said Tuesday would be
the first time he pointedly promised the administration would
hand over power to an elected government in 1998.
</P>
<P>
This seems to be helpful in clearing the doubts surrounding
his presumed intention to contest next year's presidential
election.

said, noting that it had caused major concern among the police
that violent crime from Johannesburg is spilling over Pretoria.
</P>
<P>
Johannesburg, about 50 km south of Pretoria, is one of the
major cities in South Africa where crimes and violent activities
have become rampant in recent years.

Lusaka, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Zambian president Frederick
Chiluba has said that no country has the right to dictate to
another sovereign state the mode of democracy it should follow.
</P>
<P>
Zambia Daily Mail today quoted him as telling here on Tuesday
a visiting delegation of the Commonwealth Parliamentary
Association (CPA) that democracies in the world differ and it is
not right for other countries to impose their democratic style on
others.
</P>
<P>
"The British colonial system left us with the notion that only
governments of coalition could work in Africa," he told the
parliamentarian delegation from CPA branch in Britain.
</P>
<P>
"Today in Zambia our friends are crying for a coalition
government. To them democracy is only when they are in office.
When they are removed, it is not democracy," he said.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba said the government will however continue to dialog
and interact with serious opposition parties but not at the whim
of ourside pressure.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba also regretted the failure of peace in Angola despite
the peace accord signed in Lusaka in 1994 by the Angolan
government and the opposition National Union for the Total
Independence of Angola (UNITA).

<HEADLINE> Jordanian FM Calls for Arab Coordination </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian Foreign
Minister Fayez Tarawneh who is on a two-day visit to Saudi
Arabia today called on the Arab world to coordinate and strengthen
mutual trust to press Israel to return the occupied Arab land.
</P>
<P>
Getting back the Arab land occupied by Israel needs Arab
coordination based on mutual trust, Tarawneh said while holding
talks with Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah Ibn Abdel-Aziz in Saudi
western coast city of Jedda, Kuwait News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Tarawneh's talks with the Saudi crown prince focused on an
assessment of peace crisis caused by the hardline stances of the
Israeli government led by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
He said the matter needed "a comprehensive assessment between
the Arab brothers," noting that his country was coordinating
with Syria, Egypt and the Palestinian National Authority.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he called on Israel to end the closure policy
against the Palestinian people, to unblock Palestinian funds and
lift the siege imposed on Palestinian towns.
</P>
<P>
Tarawneh is accompanying Jordanian Crown Prince Hassan Ibn
Talal on an official visit to Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Press Agency said Prince Hassan also discussed with
Saudi King Fahd Ibn Abdul-Aziz and Crown Prince Abdullah Ibn
Abdel-Aziz on bilateral relations and the latest developments on
the Arab, Islamic and international arenas in light of the
shuttle visit to the region by U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the two sides tackled the possibility of
pushing forward the stalemated Middle East peace mission
according to the limited improvement achieved during Albright's
visit to the region, which took her to Israel, the Palestinian
self-rule areas, Syria, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Jordan and Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Prince Hassan, who arrived in Jedda Tuesday, is due to
conclude his Saudi trip later today.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 17 (Xinhua) -- The following are major
news items in leading U.S. newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- The Clinton administration scrambled to reach a compromise
on a treaty to ban land mines, hoping to avoid international
censure. Details of the new American position were not yet
public, but other countries seemed opposed to amendments other
than possibly agreeing to a delayed timetable.
</P>
<P>
-- Attorney General Janet Reno, embarrassed by missteps and
discord in the Justice Department's campaign finance
investigation, will replace the top Federal prosecutor and FBI
agent in charge of the inquiry with more experienced personnel.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Announcing his long-awaited verdict on a proposed
settlement with the tobacco industry, President Clinton will
endorse an agreement but insist that it include sharply
increased penalties on cigarette makers if they don't meet
targets for reducing youth smoking over the next decade.
</P>
<P>
-- The Clinton administration said in a report that Mexico
has made great strides in fighting drug traffic king and related
corruption and that the United States will pursue a policy of
"cooperation, not confrontation," with its southern neighbor.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal:
</P>
<P>
-- The International Monetary Fund scaled back its growth
forecasts for Japan, Southeast Asia and most of the developing
world, but predicted nonetheless that the global economy is
about to enjoy what could be its best five-year stretch in the
past 25 years.
</P>
<P>
-- Clinton unveiled trade legislation that sidesteps the
issue of labor and environmental safeguards sought by top
Democrats. He instead chose a course designed to win Republican
support for extending, through 2005, presidential authority to
negotiate trade accords Congress must accept or reject, not
amend.

<HEADLINE> Strict Measures Ordered to Tackle Haze in Malaysia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia today decided
to take several stringent measures to deal with the haze, which
has enveloped the whole country since June and worsened in the
last few days.
</P>
<P>
The measures decided by the cabinet today include a ban on all
forms of open burning and checks to be carried out by the police
and army open burning, Information Minister Mohamed Rahmat said.
</P>
<P>
The relevant agencies have been asked to enforce the law
strictly and impose hefty fines against those engaged in open
burning, Mohamed, who is also National Disaster Relief Management
Committee chairman, said at a news conference here.
</P>
<P>
He said the Fire and Rescue Services Department has been
ordered to immediately put out any open burning spotted.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet also decided that cloud-seeding which started two
weeks ago will be carried out more often, covering a wider area
and not confined to areas where the haze is serious.
</P>
<P>
He said it has also been decided that the Royal Malaysian Air
Force (RMAF) will be directly involved in cloud-seeding.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet also asked the Treasury to approve funds for the
RMAF to buy cloud-seeding equipment to be fitted to the aircraft
used for the purpose.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet agreed that if the air pollutant index (API)
touches 250 and above, all land clearing and earthworks will be
stopped, Mohamed said.
</P>
<P>
He said schools would be closed when the index touches 400
while a state of emergency would be declared by Malaysian Prime
Minister Mahathir Mohamad when the level deteriorates to 500.
</P>
<P>
Under the Malaysian API, readings between 0-50 are classified
as good, 51-100 as moderate, 101-200 as unhealthy, 201-300 as very
unhealthy and 301-500 as hazardous.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, according to an Environment Department statement,
the air quality throughout Malaysia has improved in most areas
compared to yesterday.
</P>
<P>
The air quality indicting the "hazardous" level yesterday with
an API reading of 359 in the Nilai area in the southeastern state
of Negeri Sembilan improved to the "unhealthy" level with an API
reading of 134.
</P>
<P>
The API readings of 302 and 344, also indicating "hazardous"
air quality level in Kuala Lumpur and its suburban Gombak area
respectively yesterday, were also down to the "unhealthy" level
with API readings of 139 and 116 respectively.
</P>
<P>
The air quality in other parts of the country also improved.
</P>
<P>
Mohamed said the improvement in the air quality today could be
due to the cloud-seeding carried out by the Environment
Department.
</P>
<P>
He hoped that cloud-seeding by the Indonesian authorities would
help improve the air quality further.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Youth Eager to Join Communist Party (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Beijing has a total of 1.1 million Party members, excluding
those working in departments directly under the central
authorities. The membership includes over 210,000 people under the
age of 35, according to the organization department of the
municipal CPC committee.
</P>
<P>
Last year alone, Beijing organizations recruited more than
44,000 new Party members, some 29,000 of those, or 67 percent of
the total, were under the age of 35. At present, some 229,000 of
360,000 people who have applied for Party membership are under 35.
</P>
<P>
The younger generation's enthusiasm for joining the CPC is
closely related to the fact that CPC organizations at all levels
have attached great importance to education and guidance of the
young, said Wang Liping, deputy division chief of the municipal
organization department.
</P>
<P>
Wang pointed out that "China's reform and opening-up drive,
economic development and social stability have also had a positive
influence on the young."
</P>
<P>
When comparing the conditions of the Chinese society before and
after the adoption of the reform and opening-up policies, the
younger generation has quite naturally reached the conclusion that
China's development and prosperity rely on the leadership of a
strong communist party, according to Wang.
</P>
<P>
"The comparison greatly enhances their confidence in the
Party," said Wang.
</P>
<P>
Young students who are moved and inspired by the exemplary
roles played by fellow students who are Party members are actively
applying for Party membership, according to Hou.
</P>
<P>
Hou cited an example of two undergraduate classes in the School
of International Relations. He said 14 of the top 20 students were
Party members.
</P>
<P>
He said that the example set by student Party members inspired
over 90 percent of students in the two classes to apply for Party
membership prior to graduation.

BEIJING, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Liu Yang entered prestigious
Beijing University and one of the first major decision he made was
to apply for membership of the Communist Party of China (CPC).
</P>
<P>
Liu responded to a question in the application by saying that
"The Communist Party of China is a great political party, and only
the Party can lead the Chinese people to prosperity."
</P>
<P>
Liu said the 15th CPC National Congress which is meeting from
Sept. 12-18 "has established the precept of raising high the great
banner of Deng Xiaoping's Theory and propelling the cause of
building socialism with Chinese characteristics into the 21st
century."
</P>
<P>
"This represents the aspirations of the entire nation, and
further increases my confidence in the Party," said Liu.
</P>
<P>
Liu is only one of a growing contingent of young people in the
Chinese capital who are actively applying for membership in the
CPC, with over 20,000 young people joining the Party every year.
</P>
<P>
In Beijing University alone, some 2,000 students have applied
for Party membership each and every year since the beginning of
1990s, according to Hou Xuezhong, the official in charge of
Beijing University's CPC committee.
</P>
<P>
Hou noted that the number of applicants continues to grow, with
some 3,628 students submitting applications in 1996. The figure
accounted for a quarter of the university's then total enrollment.
</P>
<P>
The university's Party organization has admitted 3,116 new
members since 1991, including 2,849 students, said Hou.
</P>
<P>
Party members accounted for 9.33 percent of the school's
undergraduate population in the first six months of this year, up
from 5.3 percent in 1991. The figure for Graduate students
accounted for 22.6 of the total.
</P>
<P>
The number of students applying for Party membership at other
Beijing universities has also grown in recent years, with Party
members accounting for around ten percent of the total number of
students in schools like Qinghua University and the Chinese
People's University.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Called to Continue Economic Restructuring </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 17 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary
Fund (IMF) today called on Indonesia to continue restructuring its
economic sector despite its achievements in keeping the rupiah's
fluctuation in check.
</P>
<P>
It is necessary for Indonesia to keep on taking such measures,
IMF Deputy Managing Director Stanley Fischer told the press after
meeting with President Soeharto here.
</P>
<P>
However, Fischer did not say what measures the IMF is expecting
Indonesia to take.
</P>
<P>
Asked about the IMF's opinion on the Indonesian rupiah's
depreciation against the U.S. dollar, Fischer praised the measures
the Indonesian government has taken so far.
</P>
<P>
He welcomed the government's announcement on Tuesday that it
will postpone and review 106 trillion rupiah (about 35.6 billion
U.S. dollars) worth of development projects financed by the state
budget, state-owned companies and private enterprises, calling it
"an important step" on the road to stability.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, the government should also take other
measures to save the country from a financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian rupiah was traded at about 2,950 to the dollar,
compared to about 2,450 before the speculative attacks on it in
early July.
</P>
<P>
Speculative attacks have shaken most Southeast Asian currencies
following the devaluation of the Thai baht on July 2. The rupiah
has declined by over 20 percent since then.
</P>
<P>
According to official sources here, President Soeharto Tuesday
criticized the IMF for its slow action in helping Association of
Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) members deal with the region's
recent currency turmoil.
</P>
<P>
Meeting with a local banker, the president expected the world
body to deregulate its complicated procedures to accelerate its
mission to help needy countries.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto also complained about the attitude of industrialized
countries in anticipating financial upheavals.
</P>
<P>
He called on the developed countries in the Asia-Pacific
Economic Cooperation (APEC) to lend a helping hand to the
grouping's less developed members, in their effort to overcome the
current currency crisis.
</P>
<P>
"It is high time now for APEC to translate and apply its
partnership through, for instance, the establishment of a standby
loan system to tackle the ongoing monetary crisis hitting the less
developed nations in APEC," the president was quoted as saying.

<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia today launched
two funds to further accelerate and upgrade the development of
indigenous technological capabilities.
</P>
<P>
The funds -- the Commercialization of R&AMP;D (research and
development) Fund and the Technology Acquisition Fund -- will be
managed by Malaysian Technology Development Corporation (MTDC) and
are open to all Malaysian companies, including small and
medium-sized industries (SMIs), International Trade and Industry
Minister Rafidah Aziz said.
</P>
<P>
A sum of 100 million ringgit (about 33.3 million U.S. dollars)
has been allocated for the Commercialization of R&AMP;D Fund and 61
million ringgit (about 20.3 million dollars) for the Technology
Acquisition Fund, she said when launching the funds, according to
the Malaysian national news agency Bernama.
</P>
<P>
The funds will provide partial grants ranging from 50 percent
to 70 percent, she said.
</P>
<P>
For the Commercialization of R&AMP;D Fund, joint ventures between
local firms and universities/public research institutions, both
local and foreign, are also eligible to apply.

said here today.
</P>
<P>
The commander assessed the aerial maneuver, which started from

<HEADLINE> Grass-roots Democracy Being Promoted in China (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Incomplete statistics show that about one-fifth of the village
heads in China have been replaced in every election, according to
official sources.
</P>
<P>
The village committees are responsible mainly for making major
decisions, improving democratic supervision, and keeping the
villagers informed of political activities and financial affairs
in the villages, Doji Cering said.
</P>
<P>
"Around the turn of the century, a self-management system is
expected to be established in all villages across the country," he
said. As for the urban areas, the workers' conference is a major
grass-roots democratic unit, he added.
</P>
<P>
So far, a total of 290,000 enterprises, or 85 percent of the
total in the country, have established workers' conferences,
according to Zhang Dinghua, vice president of the All-China
Federation of Trade Unions.
</P>
<P>
Major tasks of the conference include deliberations and
approval of the factory plans, examination of the financial
management, and a general evaluation of all officials.
</P>
<P>
"Enterprises are gaining a higher degree of self-management as
the socialist market economy progresses, Zhang said, adding that
"as a result, the role of leading executives in the enterprises
are increasingly important."
</P>
<P>
Zhang called for the function of the conference to be increased
so as to provide an effective way to check corruption or abuse of
power.
</P>
<P>
According to Zhang, all publicly-owned enterprises across the
country will carry out an annual democratic evaluation of their
executives, and so far this has been adopted in a total of 100,000
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
However, the shareholders' conference will not replace the
workers' conference which plays the role of democratic management,
despite a possible shareholding system to be introduced in
state-owned businesses, Zhang noted.

<HEADLINE> Grass-roots Democracy Being Promoted in China (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Promotion of democracy at
grass-roots units in China is a major task for the on-going
political restructuring, and whether it can be realized or not has
a vital bearing on the country's long-term stability and the
people's interests, a Party congress delegate from the Chinese
Ministry of Civil Affairs said here today.
</P>
<P>
Jiang Zemin's report to the ongoing 15th National Party
Congress stressed the work to improve the system of democratic
election at the grass-roots units in China and increase the
worker's participation in reforms and management of enterprises,
and this has aroused heated discussions among the
delegates, according to Doji Cering, minister of Civil Affairs.
</P>
<P>
Grass-roots democracy is mainly manifested in the elections of
village committees in rural China, and the workers' conference in
urban China, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
Since 1988, the overwhelming majority of the provinces across
the country have carried out at least two rounds of elections.
</P>
<P>
Over 90 percent of the farmers have participated in the
elections, he said.
</P>
<P>
"On spotting any violations of law in the process, the farmers
usually ask the press or law firms for help," said Doji Cering.
</P>
<P>
Usually, two candidates who run for the head of the
village committee make policy speeches prior to the elections,
he added.
</P>
<P>
From time to time, they answer questions from the villagers and
each villager cast a vote, he said.
</P>
<P>
"With the democratic election, the overall competence of the
village heads has improved, and a group of young farmers good at
managing farm production have taken the leading posts of the
villages, replacing those who are conservative," Doji Cering said,
stressing that "this has contributed greatly to the stability and
development of the rural areas."

<HEADLINE> Philippine Peso Falls to New Low </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 17 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine peso,
recovering slowly in the past few days, today fell to another
record low of 32.807 pesos against the U.S. dollar amid rising
fears of political uncertainty in the country.
</P>
<P>
This new average exchange rate between the peso and the dollar
was 1.38 percent lower than Tuesday's 32.36 pesos recorded in the
Philippine Dealing System, the country's electronic currency
exchange system.
</P>
<P>
The peso has so far depreciated 24.3 percent since the central
bank allowed it to fluctuate in a wider band on July 11 in face of
relentless international speculative attacks against the local
currency.
</P>
<P>
Traders attributed the latest slump in the peso's value to
mounting concerns over prolonged political instability as a result
of raging debates over amendments to the country's existing
constitution.
</P>
<P>
They said many hoped to buy more dollars before the September
21 anti-charter change rally organized by the Catholic Church and
former President Corazon Aquino.
</P>
<P>
A row over efforts by President Fidel Ramos' supporters to
change the charter so Ramos can run for a second term has set the
government in a confrontation with the Catholic Church and the
opposition.
</P>
<P>
Other dampers included rising demand for the dollar by local
businesses to import goods for the forthcoming Christmas.

<HEADLINE> Iran Bolsters up Lebanon against Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Iran's Supreme Leader Ali
Khamenei today bolstered up Lebanon in its fight against Israeli
aggression while promising continuous support.
</P>
<P>
While meeting with visiting Lebanese Parliament Speaker
Nabih Berri, Khamenei described the anti-Israeli resistance in
Southern Lebanon as a source of honor and prestige for the Arab
and Islamic world.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian leader also stressed unity and solidarity against
the "Zionist enemy."
</P>
<P>
Turning to efforts made by Israel and other enemies of Islam
to sow discord among Muslims, Khamenei said that Shiite and
Sunni Muslims were enjoying a harmonious coexistence in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
He told his Lebanese guest that any action which may help the
enemy to sow discord among Muslims must be refrained from.
</P>
<P>
Khamenei also referred to the smear campaign waged by Israel
to accuse Lebanese Muslim youths of terrorist acts, saying all
freedom-loving people of the world know well that these faithful
youths are defending their dignity, independence and homeland.
</P>
<P>
According to a report carried by the official news agency
IRNA, Khamenei also touched on the close ties between Iran and
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Berri who arrived here Monday said that the anti-Zionist
resistance has created unity and solidarity among all Lebanese
groups and the government and shattered the ranks of Zionist
enemy.
</P>
<P>
He also praised the supports offered by Iran to Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Before his departure at the airport today, Berri said, "Iran
is a powerful country in the region, which can play a
fundamental role in solving the problems of the region."

<HEADLINE> China to Reform Structure of Government Institutions (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 17 (Xinhua)-- The number of ministries and
administrative bodies under the State Council has dropped from
68 to 59 and 56 non-permanent central government institutions have
been abolished since 1992, said a senior official from the
Ministry of Personnel.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Zhijian, vice-minister and deputy director of the
Committee on Organizational Structure under the CPC Central
Committee, said the number of personnel in government institutions
at different levels has been cut down from 9.25 million to 7.25
million, down by two million people.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said China had carried out reform of the structure of
central and local government institutions from 1993 to 1996. The
size of the government has been kept within the limits, with
reduction in the number of institutional organizations.
</P>
<P>
However, he pointed out, the establishment of government
departments, the personnel composition and operational structure
still cannot meet the requirements of the socialist market economy.
</P>
<P>
The size of the government is still very large in general, he
said, leaving it a pressing and arduous task in deepening
structural reform of government institutions.
</P>
<P>
At present, there are 41 ministries under the State Council and
an average of 53 government departments at the provincial level.
The number of government institutions under a medium-sized city
and a county reaches 46 and 28, respectively.
</P>
<P>
At the opening session of the current Party congress five days
ago, Jiang Zemin pointed out that China's government institutions
have still been plagued by "unwieldy organization, overstaffing,
failure to separate the functions of the government from those of
enterprises and serious bureaucracy."
</P>
<P>
"The fact that Jiang Zemin's report to the congress has taken
the reform of government organizational structure as one of the
important component parts of political restructuring shows that
the CPC Central Committee has attached great importance to
structural reform and its determination to push ahead political
restructuring," said Zhang.
</P>
<P>
He said the structural reform at present focuses on the
transformation of government functions and the separation of the
functions of the government from those of enterprises, handling
well relations between the government and the enterprises, market
and the society.

<P>
China has a dozen of departments on economic management under
the State Council, outgrowing that in developed countries. This is
the outcome of the planned economy, Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
The next step of readjustment of government institutions is to
reduce the number of these departments and make some of them
economic entities without government functions.
</P>
<P>
On readjusting institutions of the local governments, Zhang
said, continued efforts will be made to cut the size of staff
working in poverty-stricken counties and townships in a bid to
alleviate the burden of the local people, he said, adding this is
a major measure to help people in poor areas to shake off poverty
by the end of this century.
</P>
<P>
Today, China still has 592 poverty-stricken counties, with a
combined poverty-stricken population of 60 million. Reform of
administrative structure is an important aspect of the structural
reform. The state is to work out a law on administrative
organizational structure, with the aim of legalizing the
establishment of government institutions and its management, he
said.
</P>
<P>
However, the streamlining of government institutions should not
be conducted in a simple way. Macro-economic control and
law-enforcement departments should be strengthened to meet the
requirements of a market economy, Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
For example, he said, the personnel of law enforcement
departments have expanded by 200,000, the taxation departments by
200,000 and the industrial and commercial departmens by over
100,000.
</P>
<P>
How to properly arrange the redundant staff who have been
laid-off remains the most difficult task in the institutional
reform. All localities should explore new ways in accordance with
their own conditions, including expanding the service trade, he
said.

<HEADLINE> Nepal Passes Bill Against Party Defection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, September 17 (Xinhua) -- An anti-defection bill,
which aims to prevent MPs from deserting their own parties and
thus bring stability to Nepal's politics, has been unanimously
approved by the Lower House of Nepal, the local press reported
today.
</P>
<P>
MPs from the ruling Communist Party of Nepal (United
Marxist-Leninist, CPN-UML) and the National Democratic Party (RPP)
and those from the main opposition Nepali Congress voted
overwhelmingly for the bill Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Upper House passed the bill on August 29.
</P>
<P>
Under the bill, a member will be considered defecting when he
or she resigns from the party he or she was elected from, or takes
membership of another party, or forms his or her own party without
fulfilling the requirements or violating party whips.
</P>
<P>
And once the parliament leaders make public the notice of
defection issued by the party concerned, the term of the MP will
automatically be terminated and the position considered vacant,
according to the bill.
</P>
<P>
Such defecting members will be given 15 days to justify their
action, which will be reviewed by the leaders of the parliament
before action is taken against them.
</P>
<P>
But he or she will not be considered defecting when joining a
party formed by 40 percent of either the working committee members
or the parliamentary party committee members, the bill decides.
</P>
<P>
Since 1991, recalcitrant MPs have been the cause of political
instability in Nepal.
</P>
<P>
Things became worse after a hung parliament appeared in the
mid-term election in 1994, where no single party held a majority.
</P>
<P>
In the past seven years, MPs either refused to obey the whip of
their parliamentary leaders or left their own parties, joined the
opposition and abstained or voted against their governments,
causing the fall of four of the five governments.
</P>
<P>
The anti-defection bill, registered for discussion during the
11th session of the parliament, was passed down to the current
session because the last was plagued by confidence motions.

<HEADLINE> More People Visit Deng's Former Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, September 17 (Xinhua) -- An increasing number of
people have visited the former residence of Deng Xiaoping in
Guang'an County, Sichuan Province, since the 15th Congress of the
Communist Party of China (CPC) was convened on September 12.
</P>
<P>
A member of the local administrative staff reports that the
daily number of visitors has increased three-fold.
</P>
<P>
He said that many of the visitors have journeyed from other
parts of the country specially for the occasion. On a visitor's
book, a visitor wrote: "It is especially memorable to visit Deng's
former home and review his great life and achievements during the
ongoing 15th Party Congress."
</P>
<P>
The administrative staff made special arrangements for the
occasion by preparing a brief introduction to Deng's life, and a
photo exhibit of the third generation of CPC leadership.
</P>
<P>
A wide-screen color television in the courtyard allows both
staff workers and visitors to monitor the progress of the Party
Congress.
</P>
<P>
"Jiang Zemin's work report at the congress fully confirms the
authoritative status of Deng Xiaoping's Theory and has greatly
inspired people to visit Deng's former home," according to Xu
Xiuwen, an agronomist from Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Newlyweds Jiang Qijian and Huang Xiuli journeyed from Shenzhen,
the country's first special economic zone set up in the early 80s
under Deng's proposal. "Shenzhen has been evolved from a former
wasteland into a modern metropolis under the guidance of Deng
Xiaoping Theory," said Jiang.
</P>
<P>
"We are fully confident and determined that the third
generation of the CPC leadership with Jiang Zemin at the core is
capable of leading the people to build the motherland well and
unite the people of different nationalities," said Losang, a young
man from the Tibet Autonomous Region.

CAIRO, September 17 (Xinhua) -- The following are business
briefs from the Middle East countries:
</P>
<P>
AMMAN -- Jordan is expected to receive more than 75 million
U.S. dollars of European aid this year, the Jordan Times reported
today.
</P>
<P>
The European Council of Ministers decided to allocate 15
million dollars of additional aid to Jordan Monday, the paper
quoted Jordanian Deputy Prime Minister for Development Affairs
Jawad Anani as saying.
</P>
<P>
Both sides reached an agreement last April under which Jordan
will receive 50 million dollars of aid from Europe.
</P>
<P>
Anani, who just concluded visits to six European countries
Tuesday, said some European countries had pledged more than 10
million dollars extra aid for Jordan.
</P>
<P>
AMMAN -- Jordan and Algeria signed here Tuesday two agreements
on prevention of dual taxation and cooperation in customs affairs
and legislation, the Jordan Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, both sides signed a protocol designed for promoting
bilateral industrial and commercial cooperation through setting up
joint projects.
</P>
<P>
AMMAN -- Jordan has concluded contracts with Iraq to sell it
more than 83 million U.S. dollars worth of food and medicine, the
Jordan Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
The paper said that 35 Jordanian corporations were involved in
the contracts signed within the framework of the U.N.-Iraqi
oil-for-food deal which allows Baghdad to sell up to 2 billion
dollars of oil over six months to buy food and medicine.
</P>
<P>
The goods under the contracts include soap, detergents and
table salt, and more Jordanian bids to sell other goods to Iraq
are under discussion by Iraq and U.N. agencies concerned,
according to the Amman Chamber of Industry.
</P>
<P>
It disclosed that Jordanian pharmaceutical firms are currently
striving to sign contracts with Iraq to sell it 210 million
dollars worth of medicine and hoped that they could get a good
share of the transaction.
</P>
<P>
BEIRUT -- The Lebanese housing problem has turned into a crisis
that transcended low income groups to hit middle income workers,
according to a latest report by a leading commercial bank.
</P>
<P>
The report issued by the Beirut-based Fransabank, one of the
leading commercial banks here, said that the middle income
workers make up 55 percent of Lebanon's labor force. Low income
groups live on 500 U.S. dollars or less a month while middle
income workers live on 500 to 2,000 dollars a month.
</P>
<P>
The report said that on the other hand, 60,000 to 100,000
housing units with 11 million to 15 million square meters
lay empty because developers overestimated the purchasing power
of the public who do not have access to long-term loans.
</P>
<P>
It called on the government to develop a secondary mortgage
market to solve the housing crisis and keep up with neighboring
countries.
</P>
<P>
The primary mortgage market in Lebanon comprises 300 million
to 400 million dollars of extended and available loans. These
loans are provided by the state-owned housing bank and other six
private banks that extend 10-year loans at 11 to 13 percent
interest, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
However, it said that the amount of available loans does not
cover more than 7 percent of the 5.5 million to 7 million dollars
market value of the empty apartments. The loans are not long
enough and remain relatively expensive.
</P>
<P>
The report said a secondary mortgage market, which will provide
more liquidity and bring down mortgage prices, has a good chance
of succeeding in Lebanon because the country has a developed and
deregulated capital market and interest rates.

<HEADLINE> South Asia Sees Fastest Growth in Export: WB Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 17 (Xinhua) -- South Asia is witnessing
the world's fastest growth in export in the period leading up to
2020, according to a World Bank report released here today.
</P>
<P>
The report, "South Asia's Integration into the World Economy",
said that the region is poised to be a major force in the global
trading system in the next 25 years.
</P>
<P>
Exports of the region have responded to new opportunities,
regional economies are opening up, direct investment inflows are
increasing, it said. Average nominal protection rates are now
around 20 to 25 percent, half of what they were five years ago.
</P>
<P>
Real exports grew at 11 percent a year in the 1990s, faster
than in any other region except East Asia.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the faster integration of the region into
the global economy holds the promise of higher growth rates and
the large-scale eradication of poverty.
</P>
<P>
But this will depend on whether South Asian countries can
continue to enact broad-based reforms, improve governance, and
further liberalize trade, it said.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference, John Williamson, World Bank Chief
Economist for South Asia Region, said the study also makes it
clear that South Asia still has a long way to go.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, South Asia continues to have the
highest tariffs in the world and more quantitative restrictions on
trade than most other regions.
</P>
<P>
Per-capita exports are five times lower than in other
developing countries, and South Asia's share in world trade is
just 1 percent, compared with 4 percent for China. Intra-regional
trade is still minuscule, accounting for 4 percent of total trade,
it said.
</P>
<P>
South Asia remains the region with the highest incidence of
poverty and the largest absolute numbers of the poor, it said.

<P>
BEIJING, September 17 (Xinhua) -- For Liu Ming, a middle-aged
laid-off factory worker in northeast China's Jilin Province,
Chinese President Jiang Zemin's opening speech to the 15th
National Congress of the Communist Party of China (CPC) was like a
soothing dose of tonic.
</P>
<P>
She was moved to tears while watching Jiang deliver a report on
September 12, in which he pledged that the Party and government
will take steps to better care for and accommodate the laid-off
workers, and improve the re-employment program.
</P>
<P>
"Jiang Zemin has us laid-off workers on his mind, and cares a
lot about us," said the jobless woman.
</P>
<P>
Another laid-off factory worker from Jilin, 46-year-old Zhou
Lihua, applauded Jiang's call on the broad masses of workers to
alter their frame of mind and take pains to improve their work
skills so as to adapt to demands of reform and development.
</P>
<P>
Zhou attended a training course on household affairs, was a
nurse for a mentally-retarded child and has eventually taken a
job in a vocational school after she was laid off by her
former factory.
</P>
<P>
"When I review my past experience, I think what General
Secretary Jiang said is right," said Li. "The way out for laid-off
people is to improve their own quality to adapt to the changing
situation."
</P>
<P>
Tong Fengying, who was laid off by a textile mill several years
ago, now works for a job placement agency attached to a local
women's federation.
</P>
<P>
Tong agreed with Jiang that flow of personnel and laid-off
workers is only a temporary difficulty brought on by the expansion
of enterprise reform.

Truck drivers from a mining company associated with the Anshan
Iron and Steel Corporation, based in northeast China's Liaoning
Province, agree that Jiang's words lifted a great weight from
their shoulders.
</P>
<P>
The once-distressed drivers have plenty to smile about now.
After two months of management reform in the mining company,
drivers from many trucking teams scattered over 30 separate
production areas of the mine have been organized into a
centralized professional unit.
</P>
<P>
Some of the truck drivers, who had been accustomed to the "rice
bowl" routine, were unhappy with the strict work assignments after
the reshuffling, said Zhao Xiufen, a local Party official.
</P>
<P>
They even described the reform in their company as an effort
taken in vain. But Jiang's speech was like a key that unlocked
their minds, the official said.
</P>
<P>
The move to form a single strong unit was a wise act that
serves the long-term interests of the drivers, and after hearing
Jiang's report, they realize that, the official added.
</P>
<P>
In Shanghai, Qiang Ziqiang, a retired engineer from Shanghai
Aircraft Manufacturing Factory, and his wife said they are deeply
impressed by the plan proposed by the congress to develop various
forms of economic ownership for state firms while making sure
public ownership remains a dominant force.
</P>
<P>
Both are now retired workers from state-run enterprises. Their
elder son is working for a Sino-overseas joint venture, their
second son is running a business of his own after he returned from
studying abroad, and their daughter is employed at a state-owned
enterprise.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh to Record Zero Population Growth in 2040 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh is expected to see a
zero growth in its population in 2040, when it will have 205
million people if the total fertility rate continues to be kept at
3.3 percent until that time.
</P>
<P>
To reach the goal means that one woman will give birth to only
one child, it was learned here today from the Bangladesh Bureau of
Statistics (BBS).
</P>
<P>
"Bangladesh will have to wait another 43 years to stabilize its
population at around 205 million," said a BBS official.
</P>
<P>
The fertility rate, which was 4.9 percent in 1990, declined to
3.4 percent in 1996 and 3.1 percent in 1997 and it will hover
around 2.2 percent in the future, the official said, adding that
it means that population growth will remain at zero percent on a
long-term basis.
</P>
<P>
According to the Dhaka Office of the U.N. Population Fund
(UNPF), Bangladesh has proven to be one of the successful
countries in the last quarter of the 20th century in terms of
population control and the contraceptive prevalence rate (CPR).
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh has lowered its population growth rate from 3
percent in 1973 to 1.6 percent in 1997 while it has raised the CPR
from 8.5 percent in 1975 to 48 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
But it is still much below the UNPF-recommended 68 percent to
check the rapid growth of population in the country.
</P>
<P>
The population of Bangladesh is estimated at 123.8 million in
1997, the ninth largest in the world and the sixth in Asia,
according to the official.
</P>
<P>
Future population growth potential in Bangladesh is very high
because of a large base of young population (below 15 years) and
women of reproductive age (15-49 years).
</P>
<P>
People below 15 years account for 43 percent of the total
population and women of reproductive age represent 46 percent of
the total female population, the official added.
</P>
<P>
Under the draft Fifth Five-Year Plan (1997-2002), Bangladesh
will see a net increase of 8.8 million in its population during
the period while by the year 2020, there will be a net growth of
42.74 million people.
</P>
<P>
Due to the population growth momentum, the number of working
age population (15-59 years) will increase from 66.6 million this
year to 80.2 million in 2010 and 109 million in 2020.

<P>
BANGKOK, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's Board of
Investment has launched a major publicity campaign with the
U.S.-based Time Warner and CNN (Cable News Network), aimed at
rebuilding foreign business and investor confidence in the
country.
</P>
<P>
The initial three-month phase of the campaign, at a cost of
nearly 3 million U.S. dollars, will deliver the message that
"Thailand is on the road to recovery" after 17.7 billion dollars
in standby rescue credit and other loans has been made available
to Thailand through the brokerage of the International Monetary
Fund (IMF).
</P>
<P>
"We want the world to know what Thailand's problems are, what
medicine we are taking, and what the prospects for recovery are,"
a press release issued today quoted Staporn Kavitanon, secretary
general of the board, as saying. "It is no ordinary thing for a
government and people to admit mistakes, talk about how painful
recovery itself will be, and still optimistic about the future."
</P>
<P>
The publicity campaign, launched this week in Asiaweek magazine
and the Asian edition of Time magazine, revolves around a series
of three, full-page black-and-white ads, using text only to convey
the seriousness of the message.
</P>
<P>
The print campaign is accompanied by a parallel TV campaign on
CNN. Three separate ads have been created depicting in stark,
simple terms Thailand's efforts to return to normalcy and
recovery.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Calls for Reexamination of Globalization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Thai Deputy Foreign Minister
Pitak Intrawithayanunt today called on APEC and other
international forums to reexamine the globalization process.
</P>
<P>
Opening a seminar on "the implications of the APEC process for
intra-regional trade and investment flows in Asia and the
Pacific", Pitak said, "while globalization is an undeniable
reality of modernization, the downside of globalization has also
begun to show itself."
</P>
<P>
He said, "it could be argued that a most dramatic downside of
globalization and liberalization can be seen in the economic
situation currently afflicting Thailand and some other Southeast
Asian countries."
</P>
<P>
He expressed his hope that there should be some regional
response to the vulnerabilities faced by developing countries in
the process of globalization.
</P>
<P>
Senior officials from about 20 economies in the Asia Pacific
region are attending the three-day seminar, organized by the
United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the
Pacific (ESCAP), designed to help developing countries in the
region to effectively respond to challenges and opportunities
arising from the process of globalization and regionalization.
</P>
<P>
The seminar is expected to provide an opportunity for a
systematic analysis of the topical issues such as the impact of
trade liberalization in the region, the implications for the
intra-regional trade and investment in the non-APEC countries of
the region.
</P>
<P>
In its "trade and development report 1997", launched worldwide
this week, the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development
(UNCTAD) sounds warning on globalization and advocates policies to
counter economic polarization and growing income inequality.

BEIJING, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng said
here today that President Jiang Zemin's visit to the US in late
October will be of great significance to the advancement of
Sino-US relations.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting with Michael Armstrong, chairman and executive
president of Hughes Electronics Corporation, Li called Jiang's
state visit to the US "very important," stressing China and the US
should work to create a more stable relationship.
</P>
<P>
He spoke highly of Hughes' long-term cooperation with China's
astronautics departments, and expressed the hope that both sides
will take more active steps to increase business contracts and
expand technology transfer.
</P>
<P>
China is willing to cooperate with sound foreign enterprises,
with its eye set on both the present and the future, Li said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has placed much emphasis on the
astronautics industry, he noted.
</P>
<P>
The astronautics products, as a manifestation of
high-technology, are important to the national economy and social
development, and have spawned many new related industrial lines as
well, he added.
</P>
<P>
Armstrong said that world opinion was deeply and positively
influenced by the messages from the 15th National Congress of the
Chinese Communist Party, and Hughes' confidence in cooperating
with China has increased.
</P>
<P>
He noted that as president of the US Export Committee, he will
continue to strive for a healthy development of the economic and
trade relations between the two countries.

<HEADLINE> Rapid Economic Growth in East Asia to Continue: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, September 17 (Xinhua) -- The recent currency crisis
in Southeast Asian financial markets would not stop continuing
spectacular growth in the region, Australian Foreign Minister
Alexander Downer said today.
</P>
<P>
"East Asia is going to continue to grow economically, whatever
difficulties there may have been in recent weeks in the financial
markets in some of the Southeast Asian economies," Downer said in
a speech to the Asian Business Connection in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
"East Asia is going to continue to grow and in our judgment
grow strongly over the medium to long term," he said.
</P>
<P>
He described the evolution of East Asia, the world's most
influential economic region by next century, as one of the most
important influences on Australia's future.
</P>
<P>
The Australian government's recent white paper on foreign
affairs and trade has put Australia's relationship with the
Asia-Pacific region as the top priority of the country's foreign
policy agenda.
</P>
<P>
The white paper says Australia's ties with the United States,
Japan, Indonesia and China are the country's four most important
relationships.
</P>
<P>
Australia's trade performance was already highly dependent on
the East Asian region, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Sixty-one percent of our exports go into East Asia. We are one
of the most East Asian oriented, most East Asian dependent
economies in the world," the foreign minister said.
</P>
<P>
"Our exports in the 1996-97 financial year (ending on June 30,
1997) to East Asia were 32.5 billion US dollars. The imports were
20 billion US dollars. We are doing extraordinarily well in East
Asian markets and can do better," he added.
</P>
<P>
Australia's focus on the Asia-Pacific did not mean the
Australian federal government would ignore the foreign policy in
Europe, the United States, South America and the Middle East.

</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> More Realistic Value for Australian Dollar: Fischer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, September 17 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar was at
a more accurate and realistic value for exporters after slumping
to a two-year low Tuesday, acting prime minister Tim Fischer said
today.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar Tuesday closed the day weaker against the
US dollar after earlier hitting a 26-month low of 71.65 US cents,
its lowest level since it reached 71.42 in mid-July 1995.
</P>
<P>
Economists here today feared an interest rate cut and a weak
outlook for commodity prices could pressure the local unit down
further to 71 US cents in the near term.
</P>
<P>
"As a consequence of that (lower dollar) we have an accurate
and more realistic value for the Australian dollar," acting prime
minister Fischer, as the prime minister John Howard has left for
the South Pacific Forum, told reporters.
</P>
<P>
"It's an exporter's dollar, I am proud of that circumstance,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Movements in the exchange rate since December were the
equivalent to a new tariff of 10 percent, and that the exchange
rate was more significant than tariff settings, Fischer said.
</P>
<P>
Citibank senior economist Annette Beacher said the Australian
dollar was likely to fall further in coming days with no major
local economic data due until the middle of next week.
</P>
<P>
"There is not a lot of domestic data to help sway the
Australian dollar from a domestic point of view, we need some
signs of strength on the domestic front but we will not get that
until later in the year," the economist said.

<HEADLINE> Firing Incident not Affect Ties with Iran: Pakistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, September 17 (Xinhua) -- The killing of five Iranian
air force trainees by unidentified gunmen in Pakistan today was
"unfortunate" but the incident will not affect Pakistan's friendly
 ties with Iran, State Minister for Foreign Affairs Siddique Kanju
said here today.
</P>
<P>
The five Iranian air force trainees, who came here for a
two-month training in August, were shot dead by unidentified
gunmen this morning in Rawalpindi, the sister city of the
Pakistani capital.
</P>
<P>
"It is an act of terrorism and we must be very conscious about
it," Kanju told a news conference after having visited those who
were wounded in the incident with Interior Minister Shujat Hussain
at a local hospital.
</P>
<P>
Islamabad enjoys very friendly relations with Tehran and this
unfortunate incident would not affect bilateral ties, Kanju said.
</P>
<P>
"It would not affect our relations at all," he said, adding it
is pre-mature to comment on the reason of the unfortunate
incident.
</P>
<P>
Interior Minister Shujat said at a news conference that "they
were our guests from a brotherly Muslim country and we are sorry
for their killings."

<HEADLINE> Jewish Settlers: No Compromise With Government on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Jewish settlers, who moved
into the eastern Jerusalem neighborhood of Ras al-Amud and caused
a new crisis in Palestinian-Israeli relations, today denied the
report that they have reached a compromise with government to end
the crisis.
</P>
<P>
Early this morning, Israel Army radio reported on such a
reconciliation between the settlers and the government.
</P>
<P>
The settlers said the report was not true and insisted that the
Jerusalem Municipality has approved the building plan on the plot
in Ras al-Amud, which U.S. businessman Irving Moskowitz bought
over a decade ago, and they have right to live in this area.
</P>
<P>
The new crisis was sparked when Israeli Interior Ministry
appeals committee Sunday rejected an appeal by two Meretz Party
members to overturn the Jerusalem Municipality decision to permit
the building of 70 Jewish housing units in Ras al-Amud and three
Jewish families moved into the settlement.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian National Authority (PNA) has warned of violence
if the settlers remain in Ras al-Amud. "The PNA officially holds
the Israeli government responsible for any development that will
take place unless the settlers are evicted in the coming hours,"
PNA Local Authorities Minister Saeb Erekat said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Erekat and other PNA officials said that they, in coordination
with Israel, have ensured calm among the Palestinians in and
around Jerusalem. But, they added their ability to impose
restraint was limited.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the Israeli government sought ways to deal
with the Ras al-Amud crisis. Prime Minister's office Tuesday
convened an emergency meeting and decided to take a series of
measures, among them the appointment of Internal Security
Minister Avigdor Kahalani to head the team of officials dealing
with the move of Jewish settlers into the neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
stressed that the government would" exhaust all the means for
talks with those involved" to find a solution.

<HEADLINE> Jiang's Report Guides Reunification: Scholars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Experts and scholars on Taiwan
Question in east China's Fujian Province have expressed their full
support for the ideas and principles concerning the country's
reunification set forth in Comrade Jiang Zemin's report at the
ongoing National Party Congress.
</P>
<P>
At a forum held here Tuesday afternoon by the Provincial Taiwan
Affair Office, the scholars noted that it is of great importance
that Jiang highlighted the peaceful reunification issue in his
opening report.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Director of Fujian Taiwan Affairs Office Liang Maogan
said Jiang's report has enriched and expanded the "one country,
two systems" concept set forth by Deng Xiaoping. It will guide
us to hold high the great banner of Deng's theory and advance the
process of the motherland's peaceful reunification, he said.
</P>
<P>
Being in close geographic proximity, Fujian province and
Taiwan share the same culture including customs and dialect, which
has accounted for the long-standing good relations between people
across the Taiwan Strait, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Liang reviewed the work Fujian has done in recent years to
promote the reunification cause. He said Hong Kong's smooth return
to the motherland and the continued stability and prosperity were
examples for the settlement of the Taiwan issue based on the
principle of "one country, two systems."
</P>
<P>
However, the development of Taiwan's separatist tendency and
the interference of foreign hostile forces have gravely threatened
the peaceful reunification process.
</P>
<P>
Pan Shuming, director of the Provincial Academy of Social
Sciences, said Jiang made clear in his report the Chinese
mainland's position, confidence, sincerity and determination with
regard to promoting the reunification cause.
</P>
<P>
He said that Taiwan authorities should respond with sincerity.
</P>
<P>
Wu Nengyuan, director of the province's Taiwan Research
Institute, said that the convention of the Party's 15th National
Congress and Jiang Zemin's report will help increase the Taiwan
people's confidence in the motherland's reunification.
</P>
<P>
As Comrade Jiang Zemin said in his report, Liang noted,
Taiwan's future lies in the reunification, and any attempt to
split the motherland will reach a dead end.
</P>
<P>
Liang said he was confident that no matter how many obstacles
there might be on the road to reunification, the people on both
sides of the Straits as well as the whole Chinese nation will
surely achieve their goal.

TEHRAN, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Iran today lodged a strong
protest against Pakistan over the killing of five Iranian
students by unknown gunmen in Rawalpindi in Pakistan.

Mahmood expressed his government's deep regret over the attack.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Norway's Labor Government To Resign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, September 17 (Xinhua)--Norway's minority Labor
government will resign next month after losing support in Monday's
general election that unsettled the Norwegian currency unit krone,
and the stock and bond markets, according to the press here today.
</P>
<P>
The next Norwegian prime minister will be Christian Democratic
Party leader Kjell Magne Bondevik, 50, a veteran legislator who
plans to form a tri-party coalition with the Center and Liberal
Left parties.
</P>
<P>
Bondevik will have his work cut out later, but the two parties
he selected to be the coalition partners still hold different
stands on key issues.
</P>
<P>
Since both partners did poorly in the election, the coming
Bondevik government could hold only 42 of 165 parliamentary seats.
</P>
<P>
The Party of Progress, led by Carl I. Hagen, came second in the
election with 15.3 percent of the votes, but it is unlikely to be
included in the coalition despite its strong showing.
</P>
<P>
It stands for more spending on the elderly and limited
immigration.
</P>
<P>
Many political observers in Norway speculate that if the
coalition of Bondevik proves too fragile, Labor could wield power
again soon.

<HEADLINE> Shenyang to Expand Memorial Hall of September 18th Incident </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Shenyang city in northeast
China will expand a memorial hall commemorating the September 18th
Incident, a key event in the Chinese war of resistance against
Japanese aggression during the World War II.
</P>
<P>
The new Memorial Hall of the September 18th Incident in
Shenyang, capital of Liaoning Province, will cover 15,000 square
meters, much roomier than the former facility, so as to display
more cultural relics, photos and documents, said Shenyang Mayor Mu
Suixin.
</P>
<P>
The expansion project, which will cost 70 million yuan (8.4
million US dollars), will be finished before October 1999, he
announced today.
</P>
<P>
Japanese troops battled the Chinese army stationed at Shenyang
and occupied the city on September 18, 1931, signaling the start
of Japan's invasion of China.
</P>
<P>
Shenyang opened the memorial hall on September 18, 1991, at
the battlegrounds, and made it a "base for patriotic education."
</P>
<P>
The memorial hall has received more than one million Chinese
and foreign visitors since 1991, including many from Japan.
</P>
<P>
Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto visited the memorial
hall early this month during his visit to Shenyang.

TOKYO, September 17 (Xinhua) -- World Bank (WB) President James
Wolfensohn today called for more financial aid on a multilateral
level to cope effectively with currency turmoil and support
projects in developing countries, Kyodo News reported.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto, Wolfensohn stressed the importance of multilateral aid
by international financial organizations, including the WB,
voicing concern over recent moves by such countries as the United
States to give priority to bilateral over multilateral aid.
</P>
<P>
The WB head told Hashimoto that multilateral aid can provide
leverage for collecting additional funds.
</P>
<P>
Noting that Japan plans to cut its official development
assistance (ODA) spending by 10 percent in its fiscal 1998 budget
as part of fiscal consolidation efforts, Hashimoto, on his part,
called for the effective use of ODA.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto told Wolfensohn that Japan is considering providing
indirect aid by encouraging other official funds and private funds
with ODA as a core, said the report.
</P>

Wolfensohn is here on his way to Hong Kong where the WB and the

<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Singapore will step up its
efforts to become a fashion capital in the region by organizing
the inaugural Singapore International Fashion Festival in October
next year, the Singapore Trade Development Board (TDB)and the
Singapore Tourist Promotion Board (STPB) announced here today.
</P>
<P>
The Singapore International Fashion Festival, to be jointly
organized by the two boards, aims to position Singapore as a
fashion capital where people from the industry congregate to trade
and exchange ideas, they said.

<P>
The festival will also serve as a springboard for international
fashion houses to launch their Spring/Summer collections to the
region, the TDB and STPB said, stressing that Singapore will be
the region's window to the latest in fashion and trends.
</P>
<P>
The Singapore International Fashion Festival is designed to be

the collections of Asian and local designers and labels, the TDB
and STPB said.

<HEADLINE> Delegates on Development in Central, Western China (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Delegates to the ongoing 15th
Party Congress considered the opportunity precious for China to
boost the development in its vast central and western parts, where
there are abundant natural resources and great market potentials.
</P>
<P>
During panel discussions, delegates hailed the parts in Jiang
Zemin's report delivered at the opening session of the 15th
National Congress of the Communist Party of China on the
development strategies in the current less developed regions.
</P>
<P>
Jiang's report said that the state planned to strengthen the
support for the central and western parts by giving them priority
in arranging infrastructure and resources development projects,
encourage both Chinese and overseas investors to invest in the
regions, and further develop all forms of association and
cooperation between the eastern and the central and western parts.
</P>
<P>
Central and western China occupies 86 percent of the country's
total territory and their population accounts for 58 percent of
the total.
</P>
<P>
Time is now ripe for boosting its development. According to
delegates, key industrial and energy projects have been built in
these parts to tap the rich resources. The state has mapped out
preferential policies for their growth. The thriving east part has
showed the intention to explore the new market in those regions
where the labor cost is still low and consumption potentials vast.
Their geographical locations are suitable for bilateral and
multi-lateral international economic exchanges.
</P>
<P>
Efforts made by these regions to boost infrastructure
construction have paid off.
</P>
<P>
Take transport construction for instance, the Nanning-Kunming
railway and the Lanzhou-Urumqi double track railway have been in
operation. The Xi'an-Ankang and south Xinjiang lines are now under
construction. A new airport in Guiyang, capital of Guizhou
Province, has been opened to flights and the expansion project of
Kunming Airport in Yunnan Province is slated to be completed late
next year.
</P>
<P>
The central and western parts also planned to foster a
contingent of new pillar industries or new economic growth
outlets.
</P>
<P>
Sichuan this year planned to invest 23.5 billion yuan in 58 key
projects.
</P>
<P>
In this year alone, the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region poured
1.7 billion yuan into building a high-quality cotton production
base.
</P>
<P>
Energy production is another fast-growth sector in these parts.
</P>
<P>
Delegates said that China's energy production footholds have
been gradually shifted westward. Shaanxi, Gansu, Ningxia,
Xinjiang and Qinghai have become China's important energy
producers. A number of state-level petrochemical, coal,
non-ferrous minerals and other raw materials production bases are
now under construction in these regions.

<HEADLINE> WB Head Calls For More Multilateral Aid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, September 17 (Xinhua) -- World Bank (WB) President James
Wolfensohn today called for more financial aid on a multilateral
level to cope effectively with currency turmoil and support
projects in developing countries, Kyodo News reported.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto, Wolfensohn stressed the importance of multilateral aid
by international financial organizations, including the WB,
voicing concern over recent moves by such countries as the United
States to give priority to bilateral over multilateral aid.
</P>
<P>
The WB head told Hashimoto that multilateral aid can provide
leverage for collecting additional funds.
</P>
<P>
Noting that Japan plans to cut its official development
assistance (ODA) spending by 10 percent in its fiscal 1998 budget
as part of fiscal consolidation efforts, Hashimoto, on his part,
called for the effective use of ODA.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto told Wolfensohn that Japan is considering providing
indirect aid by encouraging other official funds and private funds
with ODA as a core, said the report.
</P>
<P>
Wolfensohn is here on his way to Hong Kong where the WB and the
International Monetary Fund annual meetings will begin later this
week.

<P>
Chongqing, China's newly-established municipality considered as
the pacesetter in the development of central and western China, is
making plans to accelerate the region's economic development.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Delin, secretary of the Chongqing Municipal Party
Committee, said the city has put forward three strategic programs:
</P>
<P>
-- The city will improve its comprehensive strength and help
bring about industrial and commercial growth in the central and
western parts of China;
</P>
<P>
-- In view of the fact that its rural areas are larger than the
urban districts, the municipal government will boost economic
development in both urban districts and rural areas; and
</P>
<P>
-- It will remove more people from the dam areas of the Three
Gorges Project and accelerate the economic growth there.
</P>
<P>
According to information provided by delegates to the current
congress, Guangdong has built 150 joint ventures in the central
and western parts with a total investment of 12 billion yuan.
Shanghai has invested 3.5 billion yuan in 170 projects. Zhejiang,
Fujian, Jiangsu and Shandong provinces have also invested heavily
in the regions.
</P>
<P>
Rural enterprises across China have signed 30,000 contracts
with their counterparts in these regions.
</P>
<P>
Sun Guangyuan, an assistant to the governor of Shandong
Province, said the practice of building enterprises in the central
and western parts of China by firms in coastal areas have not only
helped the under-developed areas with funds but also up-to-date
managerial expertise and marketing skills.
</P>
<P>
To boost economic development in the old revolutionary base
areas, poverty-stricken areas, border areas and areas inhabited by
ethnic minorities, over 4,000 enterprises from well-developed
parts of the countries have established businesses and opened
training courses to help develop rich local natural resources.

<P>
ISLAMABAD, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Five Iranian Air Force
trainees and their Pakistani driver were killed by gunmen today in
Rawalpindi, the sister city of the capital Islamabad, the Defense
Ministry sources told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Interior Minister Shujat Hussain said today the killing of five
Iranians by some unidentified gunmen was "a move to defame
Pakistan".
</P>
<P>
"I can't say anything more at this moment and the
investigations were underway," Shujat said when asked about this
morning's firing incident during which five Iranian air force
trainees and their Pakistani driver were killed.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, local police disclosed that five persons including

<HEADLINE> China's Worker-Owned State Enterprise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, September 17 (Xinhua) -- A medium-sized chemical
plant in Chongqing Municipality in southwest China became one of
the earliest state enterprises bought by employees when 1,200
workers spent 4.7 million yuan on the plant recently.
</P>
<P>
The purchase on June 18 of the Chongqing Jialing Chemical
Products Co. Ltd marked a shift from a form of state ownership to
collective ownership.
</P>
<P>
The plant produces potassium permanganate and potassium
hydroxide and was first in China in its field. But it almost went
bankrupt because of poor management and a failure to adapt to the
market economy. Its asset to debt ratio was 98 percent at its
worst.
</P>
<P>
So, departments decided to reform its property-holding system
and it was sold and reorganized as a modern company, with the
municipal government strongly supporting the move, and even
setting up an old-age insurance fund for the retired workers,
using profits from the property-rights transfer.
</P>
<P>
The reform has been praised by local banks, because it avoided
possible bad side effects. Because the city still has some similar
enterprises, the success of the reform may serve as an example
through its low cost and efficiency.
</P>
<P>
Advocates of the reform method argue that the newly-formed
company, whose shares are owned by individual workers, is still a
form of public ownership. According to the reform plans, the
largest shareholder, or legal representative, can own about 10
percent of the total number of stocks.
</P>
<P>
Workers chose their own managers by secret ballot, greatly
encouraging them to participate in the management process. On the
very day the new company was established, there were already many
proposals from workers.
</P>
<P>
Now other state enterprises in the city are demanding that they
be allowed to follow suit.

<HEADLINE> Preparations Made for Damming Yangtze River Flow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YICHANG, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Preparations have been made to
stop the Yangtze River flow at the Three Gorges to make way
for a dam and generators.
</P>
<P>
According to local sources, work on two parallel cofferdams on
both banks of the river, which will proceed in three phases, has
been moving rapidly, and 60 meters is expected to be added this
month.
</P>
<P>
The Gezhouba Group Company, which dammed the Yangtze for the
first time 16 years ago, is now in charge of this work on
the middle reaches of the Yangtze.
</P>
<P>
The first-stage, which left two openings 460 m. and 480 m. wide
respectively in the two cofferdams, was completed in the first
half of the year.
</P>
<P>
The second stage will be finished by November 3 this year. It
will leave two outlets, 130 m. and 240 m., in the cofferdams. And
the third stage, when the Yangtze is completely stopped, will be
finished by November 8.
</P>
<P>
A canal has been built to allow navigation on the Yangtze after
the Three Gorges Project cuts off the flow.
</P>
<P>
The canal is now being experimented with and is scheduled to go
into operation in October, after which all ships will pass the
Three Gorges area using that route.

<HEADLINE> WB Stresses Private Infrastructure in East Asia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 17 (Xinhua) -- The private sector should
be heavily relied on to address massive infrastructure needs in
East Asia, the world's fastest growing region, a World Bank (WB)
official said here today.
</P>
<P>
Infrastructure is a major challenge facing most developing
countries in East Asia, if the region is to maintain a rapid
growth rate and improve living standards, Harinder Kohli, a senior
adviser with the WB, told a press conference.
</P>
<P>
With projected growth for Asia at the 7-8 percent level this
year as well as for the near future, infrastructure needs for
East Asia are expected to total 1.2 trillion to 1.5 trillion
U.S. dollars over the next ten years, he said.
</P>
<P>
Adding South Asia together, investment in infrastructure is
likely to reach some 2 trillion U.S. dollars in the period.
</P>
<P>
As these needs highly exceed the financial and managerial
capacity of the public sector, they can only be met if the private
sector's role is highly enhanced, Kohli stressed.
</P>
<P>
Now the share of private investment in East Asian
infrastructure is between 12 and 18 percent, with higher level of
private involvement anticipated, according to "Choices for
Efficient Provision of Infrastructure in East Asia", a report
co-edited by Kohli.
</P>
<P>
He also suggested that East Asian economies, which enjoy some
of the highest savings rates in the world, develop their domestic
capital market for money-raising. Now only a quarter of the
financing for private infrastructure in East Asia comes from
domestic sources.
</P>
<P>
Total savings are running at 30-35 percent of gross domestic
product (GDP), and private savings at 25-30 percent in East Asia.
Moreover, a significant share of the savings is going into
financial assets.
</P>
<P>
So the issue is not a lack of domestic resources, and a more
mature domestic capital market will certainly help boost domestic
financing for private infrastructure, Kohli said.

<HEADLINE> Indian Refinery Fire Toll Rises to 51 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, September 17 (Xinhua) -- The death toll in the
devastating fire and explosions at an oil refinery complex in
India's Andhra Pradesh on Sunday has risen to 51 as 15 more bodies
were retrieved from the debris on Tuesday and today, Press Trust
of India (PTI) reported.
</P>
<P>
The fire and blasts at the refinery complex, located in coastal
city Vishakhapatnam of Andhra Pradesh, were reportedly caused by a
leakage in the pipeline carrying liquefied petroleum gas from the
storage tanks to the port.
</P>
<P>
The spark that ignited following the leak carried the fire
along the pipeline to the storage tanks, causing a series of
explosions.
</P>
<P>
Amidst fears that more than 20 more bodies might still be
trapped underneath the rubble, rescue teams assisted by the Indian
naval forces continued to rummage through the debris using special
cranes and tippers, the PTI said.
</P>
<P>
Six buildings including the administrative block of the
refinery were razed to the ground under the impact of the massive
fire and explosions.

Referring to the return of Hong Kong to China, Sokolov said
Hong Kong, as a financial and trade center in the world, will give
more vitality to China's economy.

potential in trade between the two countries, also hopes that

<HEADLINE> South Asia Sees Fastest Growth in Export: WB Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 17 (Xinhua) -- South Asia is witnessing
the world's fastest growth in exports in the period leading up to
2020, according to a World Bank report released here today.
</P>
<P>
The report, "South Asia's Integration into the World Economy",
said that the region is poised to be a major force in the global
trading system in the next 25 years.
</P>
<P>
Exports of the region have responded to new opportunities,
regional economies are opening up, direct investment inflows are
increasing, it said. Average nominal protection rates are now
around 20 to 25 percent, half of what they were five years ago.
</P>
<P>
Real exports grew at 11 percent a year in the 1990s, faster
than in any other region except East Asia.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the faster integration of the region into
the global economy holds the promise of higher growth rates and
the large-scale eradication of poverty.
</P>
<P>
But this will depend on whether South Asian countries can
continue to enact broad-based reforms, improve governance, and
further liberalize trade, it said.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference, John Williamson, World Bank Chief
Economist for South Asia Region, said the study also makes it
clear that South Asia still has a long way to go.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, South Asia continues to have the
highest tariffs in the world and more quantitative restrictions on
trade than most other regions.
</P>
<P>
Per capita exports are five times lower than in other
developing countries, and South Asia's share in world trade is
just 1 percent, compared with 4 percent for China. Intra-regional
trade is still minuscule, accounting for 4 percent of total trade,
it said.
</P>
<P>
South Asia remains the region with the highest incidence of
poverty and the largest absolute numbers of poor, it said.

<HEADLINE> Noted Party Scholar on China's Historic Opportunities (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 17 (Xinhua) -- A noted scholar of the
Communist Party of China (CPC) expressed his belief that China
will achieve smooth development in the next century by promoting
reform and opening up and the modernization drive under the
leadership of CPC Central Committee.
</P>
<P>
Gong Yuzhi, deputy director of the Party History Research
Office of the CPC Central Committee and vice-president of the
Party School of the Committee, made the the remarks by
comparing historic opportunities and challenges of the Party in
the last 60 years.
</P>
<P>
In the 1930s when Japanese imperialists invaded China, putting
the Chinese nation to the brink of subjugation, he said, the CPC
called on the entire country to wage a war of resistance against
Japanese aggression instead of fighting the civil war. The appeal
by the CPC resulted in a cooperation between the Communist Party
and the Kuomingtang.
</P>
<P>
As an important force to fight back the facists, the CPC has
safeguarded the national dignity of China and developed the
Party's strength in such a war.
</P>
<P>
In the historic test after the War of Resistance against Japan,
he said, the Communist Party of China won the heart of the Chinese
people by conforming to the aspiration of the nation. The move
ended the rule by Chiang Kai-shek and resulted in the
establishment of the new China.

<HEADLINE> Noted Party Scholar on China's Historic Opportunities (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
However, Gong admitted the Party has also lost some historic
opportunities because of the "Great Leap Forward" and the ten
years of turmoil, or the "Cultural Revolution," widening the
development gap between China and the developed countries.
</P>
<P>
Over the recent 20 years, he said, China has grasped and made
good use of two historic opportunities, which resulted in the
economic booms today.
</P>
<P>
It was Deng Xiaoping who played a leading role in the last two
historic periods, one in the late 1970s after the downfall of the
Gang of Four, another in the late 1980s and the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
The current world situation has been developing rapidly, Gong
said, adding although peace and development will be theme of the
times, the reorganization of different interest blocs and
integration of global economy will be accelerated. "We will feel
great pressure to bear upon if our development speed lags behind
other countries," he said.
</P>
<P>
Gong noted, "This is the historic background of the current
Party congress as well as the challenge facing the new generation
of collective leadership of China."
</P>
<P>
Some people are wondering after Deng Xiaoping's death whether
China can remain stable and whether the country can press on
with the reform and opening-up. Some others wish to see a chaotic
China. In this sense, the convocation of the 15th Party congress
is a historic conference in the historic period, he said.
</P>
<P>
The report Jiang Zemin delivered at the Party congress has
demonstrated the daring and resolution of the collective
leadership of the CPC Central Committee. The report, which has
observed and explained the current situation in a sober-minded
way, charted the right track with some breakthroughs.
</P>
<P>
"China will witness a smooth development in the next century if
we can seize the excellent opportunities," said Gong.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: HK's Banking Business in Steady Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's status as an
international financial center has been increasingly strengthened
in recent years with its banking business maintaining robust
growth.
</P>
<P>
Local banking business has turned on a fast growing track
since the 1970s due to its fine geographic location, improved
infrastructural facilities, highly-opening and low tax-rate
policies, and talented staff.
</P>
<P>
It has benefited a lot from the reforms and opening up in
China's interior areas since the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
Of the 100 largest banks in the world, 87 have branches in Hong
Kong.
</P>
<P>
According to the Census and Statistics Department of the Hong
Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR), the total assets of the
banking businesses in Hong Kong reached 8,699.2 billion HK
dollars (1,115.28 billion U.S. dollars) at the end of June this
year, an increase of 11.6 percent over the same period in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the savings and deposits in the banking businesses
reached 4,260.5 billion HK dollars (546.21 billion U.S. dollars),
rising 14.6 percent and the credits and loans came to 1,599.5
billion HK dollars (205.06 billion U.S. dollars), increasing by
26.2 percent over the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
The interim results of some banks listed in the Hong Kong Stock
Exchange showed that the growth of the average net profits of the
banks in the first half of the year increased by 27.3 percent,
with the Hongkong Shanghai Banking Corporation's profits rising 19
percent to 22.2 billion HK dollars (2.85 billion U.S. dollars) and
Kawah Bank Ltd. rising 50.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
The steady growth of Hong Kong's banking businesses is based on
a solid operation mechanism which agrees with the international
standard and practice.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, banks in Hong Kong enjoyed sufficient
capital and circulating capital, which far exceed the ratio placed
by the banking supervision requirement.
</P>
<P>
The supervision mechanism over Hong Kong's banking businesses
has been greatly improved. While enhancing its supervision role,
the Hong Kong Monetary Authority formulated Banking Ordinance and
Guideline for Risk Management of Derivatives and Related Trading
Instruments to strictly define the requirements on bank
registration, control over credit and loans and investment as well
as the management of derivatives and other risk trading.
</P>
<P>
With the Annual Meetings of the World Bank Group and the
International Monetary Fund due to be held in Hong Kong, local
people are confident of the bright prospect of the banking
business in the Hong Kong SAR in the years to come.

<HEADLINE> Malawian President Accused of Undermining </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Malawian President Bakilj
Muluzi has been accused of undermining the country's judiciary
independence after his calling on the former ruling Malawi
Congress Party (MCP) to apologize for a 1983 murder of four
politicians.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a rally Tuesday at Nkhata-bay in northern Malawi,
Muluzi said the people who allegedly killed the four men are
still within the MCP, Zambia's leading independent newspaper, The
Post reported today.
</P>
<P>
In a sharp response, Malawi lawyers described the president's
statement as "unfo"tunate" and said it undermines the
independence of Malawi's judiciary.
</P>
<P>
The legal practitigners said that all thE suspects in the
murder trial have been cleared of the allegations against them in
the high eourt and the supreme court.
</P>
<P>
Thrde former ministers, Aaron Gadama, ick Matenhe, Twaibu
Safgala, and legislator David Chiwanga were murdered 14 years ago
in southern Malawi during the MCP's rule under ex-President
Kamuzu Banda, who served his tenure of office during 1966-1994.
</P>
<P>
It has been widely believed in the country that the four
popular politicians died in a car accident until a commission of
enquiry set up by Muluzi, who succeeded Banda as president
following Malawi's first multi-party elections in 1994, found out
t`at the men were deliberately murdered.
</P>
<P>
The findings of the commission implicated that Banda, his
confidante Ceciia Kadzamira, his right-hand man John Tembo and
three senior police officers are involved in the killing.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese Housing Problem Turns into Crisis: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, September 17 (Xinhua) -- The Lebanese housing problem
has turned into a crisis that transcended low income groups
to hit middle income workers, according to a latest report by a
leading commercial bank.
</P>
<P>
The report issued by the Beirut-based Fransabank, one of the
leading commercial banks here, said that the middle income
workers make up 55 percent of Lebanon's labor force. Low income
groups live on 500 U.S. dollars or less a month while middle
income workers live on 500 to 2,000 dollars a month.
</P>
<P>
The report said that on the other hand, 60,000 to 100,000
housing units with 11 million to 15 million square meters
lay empty because developers overestimated the purchasing power
of the public who do not have access to long-term loans.
</P>
<P>
It called on the government to develop a secondary mortgage
market to solve the housing crisis and keep up with neighboring
countries.
</P>
<P>
The primary mortgage market in Lebanon comprises 300 million
to 400 million dollars of extended and available loans. These
loans are provided by the state-owned housing bank and other six
private banks that extend 10-year loans at 11 to 13 percent
interest, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
However, it said that the amount of available loans does not
cover more than 7 percent of the 5.5 million to 7 million dollars
market value of the empty apartments. The loans are not long
enough and remain relatively expensive.
</P>
<P>
The report said a secondary mortgage market, which will provide
more liquidity and bring down mortgage prices, has a good chance
of succeeding in Lebanon because the country has a developed and
deregulated capital market and interest rates.

<HEADLINE> 3 Iranian Air Force Trainees Killed in Pakistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Five persons, including
three Iranian air force trainees, were shot dead and two others
seriously injured today by unidentified gunmen in the Pakistani
city of Rawalpindi, police said.
</P>
<P>
Three gunmen riding motorcycles opened fire with Kalashinkov
rifles this morning on a Toyota van, which was carrying five
Iranian air force trainees, at busy Chour Chowk in Rawalpindi, the
sister city of Islamabad.
</P>
<P>
The Iranians were on their way from the Kamra aeronautical
complex, some 70 kilometers west of Rawalpindi, to the Civil

<HEADLINE> Diana's Car Could Be Blocked by Another Car: Police </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, September 17 (Xinhua) -- The Mercedes S280 sedan in
which Princess Diana and three others were travelling could have
been blocked by a Fiat car before the accident crash took place in
the mid-night between August 30 and 31, said police today.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, French investigators will have their first interview
Friday with Trevor Rees-Jones, the bodyguard of Diana, who is the
only survivor in the crash.
</P>
<P>
Police said that the ``meticulous'' examination of some glass
debris found near the Mercedes, which were apparently from a red
rear auto light, led them conclude the hypothesis of a possible
collision between the Mercedes and a Fiat car.
</P>
<P>
Two investigation judges, Marie-Christine Devidal and Herve
Stephan, will interview Rees-Jones, who has regained ``perfect
consciousness'' and can now communicate, reported Agence
France-Presse.
</P>
<P>
Rees-Jones, 29, is suffering from light brain contusion, serious
facial injury and pulmonary contusion.
</P>
<P>
His testimony will be key to solve two questions: At what speed
was Henri Paul, the driver, who was also killed, driving the car?
Was there a car which tried to block the Mercedes when the accident
took place in the Alma tunnel in downtown Paris?

<HEADLINE> Large Enterprises to Lead China's Economy: Delegates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Executives from 15
key state-owned firms in China shared the view that large
enterprises in the country should play a leading role in
China's economic development.
</P>
<P>
The executives, all delegates to the Party congress now in
session here in Beijing, warmly responded to what Jiang Zemin said
in his report to the congress: "By using capital as the bonds and
relying on the market forces, we shall establish highly
competitive large enterprise groups with trans-regional,
inter-trade, cross-ownership and trans-national operations".
</P>
<P>
Enterprise groups play a key role in the entire national
economy. The 120 pilot enterprise groups which the government has
selected to carry out reforms, for instance, account for one
fourth of the entire state-sector of the economy, despite that
they only account for one per thousand in number, they noted.
</P>
<P>
"Large state-owned enterprises almost dominate the nation's key
industries," said Wang Guoxing, vice chairman of the board of
directors of the Handan Iron and Steel Group.
</P>
<P>
For instance, six power suppliers produce more than 50 percent
of the country's total power output for north China, northeast
China, east China, central China and northwest China, they said.
</P>
<P>
Eight iron and steel groups in the country turn out 40
percent of the total steel output, Wang added.
</P>
<P>
"Once large enterprises have been revitalized, the state sector
and even the entire national economy will be of
great promise," said Zhang Guixing, general manager of the
Northeastern Electric Power Group.
</P>
<P>
Among the first 57 pilot groups, 32 of them have been listed on
the stock market. Thirty of them have issued A shares, and three
of them have issued B shares. Besides, ten groups have gone
public beyond the boundary.
</P>
<P>
Last April, the number of pilot groups rose to 120, speaking
for the confidence of the central government to deepen reforms in
state-owned sector.
</P>
<P>
So far, a number of enterprise groups featuring diversified
operations across various industries and simultaneous engagement
in science, technology, production and trade, have come into
being.
</P>
<P>
"But enterprise groups in China still have a long way to go to
make themselves competitors of their overseas counterparts," said
Zhang Ruiming, president of the Haier Group which is the country's
largest household electric appliances producer.
</P>
<P>
Among the first 57 pilot groups, the sales volume of the
largest was just 5.8 billion US dollars while the last of the 500
businesses listed by the US magazine "Fortune" reported a sales
volume of 8.9 billion US dollars, Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
Besides, China's large businesses now face an acute challenge
as a large number of overseas giants have entered China, he said,
adding that it is highly necessary to foster and develop
large enterprises and enhance their competitiveness in
the world, an executive from Shanghai said.

<HEADLINE> Tung Chee Hwa on Future Role of Hong Kong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Asia's economic and
political impact on the world in the decades to come cannot be
overlooked and Hong Kong remains a leading financial and service
center in the region, Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (HKSAR) Tung Chee Hwa told an international
business community here today.
</P>
<P>
In his keynote address on the Sixth Annual World Economic
Development Congress, Tung Chee Hwa said that the East Asia Region
could have an economy larger than that of the North American Free
Trade Agreement (NAFTA) members or the European Union soon in the
21st century,
</P>
<P>
This region could produce 1,200 to 1,300 billion U.S. dollars
in additional annual savings than it does today, thereby becoming
one of the largest capital markets in the world, he said. He also
quoted a report by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) that estimates
the region will have spent almost 1,000 billion U.S. dollars in
investments in infrastructure projects alone by the year 2000,
</P>
<P>
That means "Asia may well emerge as the world's largest
producer, capital lender, and capital borrower, as well as the
world's largest consumer market," Tung said.
</P>
<P>
"Imagine the unlimited economic opportunities which will
present themselves in the coming decades as this region's economy
continues to grow and as China becomes one of the largest
economies in the world," the right place the international
business community should be located to take advantage of these
opportunities is here in Hong Kong, Tung asserted.
</P>
<P>
He pledged that Hong Kong will continue to provide a friendly
business environment and a world-class service to backup
international corporations doing businesses in Hong Kong, in China
and throughout Asia.
</P>
<P>
"Our Chinese heritage, Western management style, and ability to
speak English and Chinese have placed Hong Kong in the best
position to provide the international business community with the
people, the knowledge and the skills necessary to run successful
business in China and the rest of Asia," Tung explained to the
audience.
</P>
<P>
The Special Administrative Regional Government will work hard
to ensure that Hong Kong maintains its position as a leading
financial and service center and remains at the forefront of the
new age with cutting-edge new technology and new industries, the
chief executive promised, inviting the international business
community to play an active role in Hong Kong's continuing
prosperity and development.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Theory of Primary Stage of Socialism Vital to China's Success (1) (By Zhao Hong) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 17 (Xinhua) -- When peasants in Fengyang,
east China's Anhui Province, spearheaded the move in 1978 in China
to introduce the contract responsibility system in which
individual farming households has the final say in what to grow
and how to operate, the majority of Chinese were discussing
whether the practice is capitalist or socialist.
</P>
<P>
Although the success story of Fengyang convinced the Chinese
people, they din not get a systematic and theoretical answer until
1987 when the 13th Party Congress made an exposition of the theory
that China is in the primary stage of socialism.
</P>
<P>
As an important cornerstone of Deng Xiaoping Theory, the
exposition of the primary stage of socialism has affirmed
socialist nature of Fengyang's experiment and other reform
initiatives elsewhere, making it clear that the relations of
production must be in agreement with the reality of China's low
productive forces.
</P>
<P>
The shareholding system and joint stock partnership which have
been introduced in China over the past few years have also raised
doubts among some people. They can get an answer from Jiang
Zemin's report to the on-going 15th National Congress of the
Communist Party of China -- it is because China is in the primary
stage of socialism.
</P>
<P>
It is ten years since the theory was put forward. Why has
China still been in the primary stage? Hasn't China moved
forward?
</P>
<P>
"China does have scored great achievements in economic
construction over the recent few years, which can be described as
China's great progress forward," said Xing Bensi, vice-president
of the Party School of the CPC Central Committee.
</P>
<P>
However, Xing said China has been in a stage of
underdevelopment, or primary stage as the country has low
production level and poor foundation. "This stage will continue
for about 100 years," he said.
</P>
<P>
The 15th Party Congress has affirmed, in an all-round way, the
primary stage of socialism, he said, adding that China should use
all forms of ownership to serve socialism as long as they can help
expand the socialist economy. Shareholding system can be applied
in capitalism and so can be in socialism.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Theory of Primary Stage of Socialism Vital to China's Success (2) (By Zhao Hong) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As China's reform has entered a critical period in solving
deep-rooted contradictions, the report has, for the first time,
put forward the major tasks in economic restructuring to continue
readjustment and improving the ownership pattern.
</P>
<P>
The current congress has, for the first time, pointed out
that China should see the full meaning of the public sector,
experimenting with diversified forms of public ownership while
upholding the dominant position and competitive edge of the state
sector.
</P>
<P>
The congress has affirmed various cooperation forms in terms of
labor, capital and stock. It has also affirmed the coexistence of
different modes of distribution, which combines remuneration
according to work and remuneration according to factors of
production put in, keeping the former in a dominant position. "It
is realistic and to the point," said a congress delegate.
</P>
<P>
The affirmation of the primary stage of socialism in the
current conference is to convince the decision-makers at various
levels to gain a clear understanding of the reality and work out
goals and measures in accordance with the criteria of "three
favorables" -- favorable to promoting the growth of the productive
forces in a socialist society, increasing the overall strength
of the socialist country and raising people's living standards.
</P>
<P>
Efforts should be made to materialize public ownership that can
greatly promote the growth of the productive forces. All
management methods and organizational forms that accord with the
laws governing socialized production may be utilized boldly, the
report says.
</P>
<P>
"To hold high the great banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory in the
report by Comrade Jiang Zemin has reassured us that we are right
to adhere to the criteria in developing the productive forces,"
said Wang Yinping, a congress delegate from Fengyang, a village in
Anhui.

<HEADLINE> Shenzhen Still Focus of Attention </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Li Youwei, Secretary of the
Shenzhen City Party Committee, has always been followed by Chinese
and overseas reporters whenever and wherever he appears during the
ongoing five-yearly 15th National Party Congress.
</P>
<P>
This shows that Shenzhen, China's first special economic zone
(SEZ), is still the focus of attention today when China
continues its reforms and opening-up.
</P>
<P>
Minutes prior to the opening session of the current congress,
reporters asked him what amazing measures Shenzhen is going to
take in the near future.
</P>
<P>
Li said people in Shenzhen are elated at Jiang Zemin's report
which called for holding high the great banner of Deng Xiaoping
Theory after they heard the live televised report by CCTV. "It is
of historical significance," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Shenzhen SEZ has developed under the guidance of Deng
Xiaoping Theory, he said, adding that people in Shenzhen have
built an internationally famous city on a vast uncultivated land
in 17 years.
</P>
<P>
"Therefore," he said, "we'll continue to hold high firmly Deng
Xiaoping Theory in years to future."
</P>
<P>
Every step and every measure Shenzhen takes in the course of
reforms would cause people's attention and provoke various outside
comments, he said.
</P>
<P>
The mixed ownership is Shenzhen's principal form of ownership,
which has enhanced the state-owned sector and increased its state
assets, he said.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the status of Shenzhen after Hong Kong's return to
the motherland, Li said: "Hong Kong's return has brought new
opportunities to Shenzhen." "With an improved infrastructure built
over the past decade and more, Shenzhen, encouraged by the
guidelines of the current Party congress, will continue to
emancipate the mind and make bold experiments," he added.

<HEADLINE> China Increases Earthquake Monitoring in Three Gorges Dam Area </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YICHANG, September 17 (Xinhua) -- China is increasing its
earthquake monitoring in the Three Gorges Dam area as construction
work there picks up steam.
</P>
<P>
The State Seismological Bureau will spend 57 million yuan on a
system to guard against possible earthquakes in the area.
</P>
<P>
When it is completed in the year 2009, the dam will have a
1,045-sq. km. reservoir with a capacity of 39.3 billion cubic
meters of water.
</P>
<P>
Seismologists say that the giant project could cause
construction-induced quakes, and if there is any, it will not be
so serious, because of the region's geographic structure and
topography.
</P>
<P>
In fact, Chinese experts began research in this area
30 years ago when the ideas of the dam first came up and tests
were done to provide data before the project was officially
approved.
</P>
<P>
Of the 35,000 dams in the world, there was a two-per-thousand
rate of earthquakes caused by construction and 80 percent of the
quakes recorded measured less than magnitude five on the Richter
Scale.
</P>
<P>
But, the higher the dam is, the bigger the potential for
earthquakes in the reservoir. And because the Yangtze River at the
construction site will be dammed in December, the water level in
the reservoir will be higher.
</P>
<P>
The State Seismological Bureau will start to build the monitoring
system this month for the whole construction area. It will also
set up a monitoring center at the dam site.

<HEADLINE> Developing Economies Fuel Global Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Developing countries have
become a powerful growth engine of an increasingly integrated
global economy, according to two keynote speakers today at the
three-day World Economic Development Congress which opened here on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In his speech entitled "The New Economic Order in Asia:
Economic, demographic and Geopolitical Issues", George Shultz, the
former US secretary of state, said there are two worlds in the
demographic view.
</P>
<P>
"One is wealthy and getting old, and it is a world in decline,
like West Europe; the other is poor and young, and in places where
growth happens, like Asia," he told more than 1,000 participants
at the Sixth World Economic Development Congress, a forum for
public and private sectors to discuss economic issues facing the
world.
</P>
<P>
The aging of population has greatly reduced the working force
in the developed world, such as Japan and Germany, while in
developing economies, like China, Chili, Brazil and Indonesia, the
labor contingent is growing rapidly, according to Shultz.
</P>
<P>
"This implicates that where the growth is coming, where the
infrastructure is bound to be located," said Shultz. Since the end
of the Cold War, he stressed, the global economy has become
integrated and security turned out to be a less concern.
</P>
<P>
Another speaker on the same topic was John Naisbitt, author of
the bestseller "Megatrends Asia", who told the Congress that the
Asian economy is currently shifted from being Japan-dominated to
being China-driven.
</P>
<P>
Established in 1992, the Congress is held each year immediately
before annual meetings of the World Bank Group and the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) and in the same venue.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong, a special administrative Region of China, is hosting
the congress' meeting as well as the annual meetings of the World
Bank and the International Monetary Fund for the first
time.

<HEADLINE> Five Principles of Peaceful Co-Existence Important: Ambassadors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Under the current
international situation, the Five Principles of Peaceful
Co-Existence, initiated jointly by India, Myanmar and China in the
1950's, are still necessary for successful inter-state relations.
</P>
<P>
This is the shared view of Indian Ambassador to China Vijay
Kunhianandan Nambiar and Myanmar Ambassador to China U Set, in
their recent exclusive interviews with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Nambiar said that the new international political and economic
environment is characterized by a much higher degree of
interdependence between nations, and that nations of the world
have a better appreciation of global security and are more
interested in each other's development.
</P>
<P>
"This reinforces the relevance and usefulness of the Five
Principles of Peaceful Co-Existence," Nambiar stressed.
</P>
<P>
With the growing emphasis on economic development, he noted,
relations between states are increasingly based on cooperation for
mutual interest and benefit, and international norms need to pay
attention to the poorer countries of the Third World.
</P>
<P>
In international political and security matters, it is
necessary to establish equitable and non-discriminatory
international orders, Nambiar said.
</P>
<P>
Set said that the Five Principles of Peaceful Co-Existence
still has significance in today's world, noting that these
principles have stood the test of time and have matured over the
years, thus setting a norm for inter-state relations.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar is confident that the Five Principles of Peaceful
Co-Existence will "play even greater role in inter-state relations
in the future," Set said.
</P>
<P>
He held that only when relations among countries, big and
small, are based on respect for equality, non-interference and
sovereignty, will there be peace and harmony in the world.
</P>
<P>
He said that China's foreign policy has helped relax
international tensions and build stability around the
world. "India has consistently respected China's long-term
interests and upheld the principle of 'one China'," hoping to
develop cooperative and constructive relations with China for the
next century, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Set said that China is making an all-out effort to implement
its independent foreign policy of peace. Myanmar-China friendship
is firmly based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Co-Existence,
and bilateral friendship and cooperation have been continuously
strengthened and developed, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that he hoped to further strengthen the existing
mutually beneficial ties through joint efforts based the Five
Principles of Peaceful Co-Existence.
</P>
<P>
The two ambassadors agreed that China's further development
will contribute to regional and world prosperity and stability,
hoping that China can play a greater role in regional and
international affairs.

<HEADLINE> Preparations Made for Damming Yangtze River Flow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YICHANG, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Preparations have been made to
stop the Yangtze River flow at the Three Gorges to make way
for a dam and generators.
</P>
<P>
According to local sources, work on two parallel cofferdams on
both banks of the river, which will proceed in three phases, has
been moving rapidly, and 60 meters is expected to be added this
month.
</P>
<P>
The Gezhouba Group Company, which dammed the Yangtze for the
first time 16 years ago, is now in charge of this work on
the middle reaches of the Yangtze.
</P>
<P>
The first-stage, which left two openings 460 m. and 480 m. wide
respectively in the two cofferdams, was completed in the first
half of the year.
</P>
<P>
The second stage will be finished by November 3 this year. It
will leave two outlets, 130 m. and 240 m., in the cofferdams. And
the third stage, when the Yangtze is completely stopped, will be
finished by November 8.
</P>
<P>
A canal has been built to allow navigation on the Yangtze after
the Three Gorges Project cuts off the flow.
</P>
<P>
The canal is now being experimented with and is scheduled to go
into operation in October, after which all ships will pass the
Three Gorges area using that route.

<HEADLINE> Cholera Kills 100 in South-Western Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Cholera continues to bite in
Nyanza Province, south-western Kenya, claiming more than 100
lives in the past two months, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, it seems more deaths go unreported as they occur
deep in the rural areas, said Daily Nation, a major paper
published in the Kenyan capital.
</P>
<P>
Many eating houses and filthy markets in the affected areas
have been closed down by public health officials.
</P>
<P>
"This disease is getting out of hand," a nurse there was
quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
District hospitals in Homa Bay, Rachuonyo, Suba and Migori and
rural-based health centers around these areas now are teemed with
cholera victims, said the report.
</P>
<P>
However( Richard Muga, a provincial medical officer, said
enough drugs and personnel had been sent out to contain the
spread, which is fueled by lack of clean drinking water and poor
sanitation.
</P>
<P>
He also urged provincial leaders and the church to help
spearhead public health and sanitation awareness as a measure to
curb the spread.

<HEADLINE> Peace Talks in Bangladesh Reach Greater Understanding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, September 17 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi government and
the insurgent southern tribal leaders have reached greater
understanding in their on-going peace talks which entered the
fourth day today, according to sources close to the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The sources said the two sides were trying to narrow down their
differences further over the status of the trouble-torn Chittagong
Hill Tracts (CHT), where Buddhist tribal people have been seeking
for self-rule since the early 1970s.
</P>
<P>
The talks, the sixth round being initiated by the government
for a formula to restore durable peace in the troubled hill
tracts, centered on points such as the land management in the CHT
and the region's administrative affairs, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Chief Whip and Chairman of the National Committee on the CHT
Hasnat Abdullah was leading the government delegation at the
talks, while insurgent leader Bodhiprio Larma was the chief
negotiator of the Parbatya Chattagram Jano Sanghati Samity
(PCJSS), the political wing of the armed rebels in the CHT.
</P>
<P>
The PCJSS leaders were said to have demanded the tribal
people's ownership of the land in the CHT, which is however now
mostly occupied by the Bengali settlers.
</P>
<P>
The tribal delegation also demanded full control of the
proposed administration of the three resource-rich hill districts,
bordering India and Burma, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
They added that the two sides also discussed in detail the
draft of a long-hoped for peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
So far no official briefing has being given about the
proceedings of the dialogue which began here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Observers said both sides will have to make concessions if
there is to be a final agreement on the CHT and that their efforts
appear to be heading towards that direction.

XIAMEN, September 17 (Xinhua) -- China's small "Island of
Pianos," Gulang Island in Xiamen, Fujian Province, will host a
piano music festival during September 27-29 to show its crazy
about the Western musical instrument.
</P>
<P>
The piano was first shipped to Gulang Island some 100 years
ago. Pianos now have become the most popular musical instrument on
the 1.8 square-kilometer island.
</P>
<P>
There are more than 400 pianos on the island, averaging one for
every ten families, ranking Gulang first in the country in terms
of piano density.
</P>
<P>
Many of China's noted pianists are natives of Gulang, which

The festival will feature a series of concerts, performed by
both professional and amateur musicians.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, September 17 (Xinhua) -- In a significant policy
shift, India has decided to throw open its two nuclear power
reactors at Kakrapar in Gujarat for inspection by international
experts, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
The two reactors will be opened up in November for visits by
members of the Tokyo-based World Association of Nuclear Operators
(WANO).
</P>
<P>
This follows an earlier move by India's Nuclear Power
Corporation (NPC) to subject its new 500 mw reactor design to
review by safety experts of the International Atomic Energy Agency
(IAEA) in Vienna.
</P>
<P>
These latest efforts in increased transparency are seen as
India's response to both western and local criticism that the
country is operating vintage reactor of unsafe design.
</P>
<P>
NPC managing director Yelleswarapu Sivaram Prasad described the
Indian move as "voluntary" and "a confidence-building measure".
</P>
<P>
He said WANO members were free to inspect the control and
safety features installed in the Kakrapar Power Station and watch
all the activities going on.

<HEADLINE> Californian Residents, Scientists Prepare For El Nino Winter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Although predictions
about EL Nino differ, the U.S. state of California is quite prepared
even if all the bad things predicted never occur.
</P>
<P>
What has captured the media and public is whether the current
phenomenon would produce the extreme weather effects similar to
those during the last big and disastrous El Nino event in 1982-83.
</P>
<P>
Expectations about the current El Nino are so high that the
federal government has decided to hold a high-level meeting in
October on what California needs to prepare for the El Nino winter.
</P>
<P>
However, unlike ordinary people who are worried about the El
Nino effects, excited scientists of the West Coast just view it as
an opportunity to study one of nature's least-understood
phenomenon, as they were largely unprepared for the 1982-83 El
Nino.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania to Uphold Fight Against Graft </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, September 17 (Xinhua) -- The Tanzanian
government will leave no stone unturned in the fight against
graft in the public service.
</P>
<P>
This was pledged by Prime Minister Frederick Sumaye at a
dinner hosted for him in Hamburg, Germany, last night, according
to a news dispatch from that German city.
</P>
<P>
Sumaye said that the government in Tanzania will wage the war
on corruption with all means at its disposal, describing
corruption as evil and a hindrance to private sector investment
as private investors look for a strong, accountable and
transparent system of government.
</P>
<P>
He challenged genuine investors to judge Tanzania on the basis
of its recent performance in economic reform programs, saying
that besides the reforms the government is also keen to ensure
good governance and the rule of law.
</P>
<P>
Sumaye is in Hamburg at the head of a strong delegation to the
Tanzania Trade and Investment Conference to be held there.
</P>
<P>
While opening the one-day meeting Monday, Sumaye said the
national industrial policy adopted by the government to guide
investment outlays over the next 25 years, aims at establishing a
strong industrial base which still lacks capital and genuine
investors.
</P>
<P>
He elaborated that the main ingredients of the policy include
a comprehensive realization of the role of the sector played in
the socio-economic transformation for self-sustaining growth and
development.
</P>
<P>
Sumaye further said that as the government is implementing
such policy reforms, it intends to create a macro-economic and
institutional framework that will motivate the private sector to
perform and act as a gloss to the country's economic development.
</P>
<P>
The Hamburg conference is jointly organized by the Tanzanian
government and the Hamburg-based German-Africa Association.
</P>
<P>
The conference is expected to provide yet another impetus for
increased economic cooperation between Tanzania and Germany.

<P>
They are ready to finance local enterprises with proven
credibility and business acumen, while the local banks are bound

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Gears Up For Copyright Agreement Implementation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam and the United States
are speeding up preparations for the implementation of an
agreement on copyright due to come into effect next January, the
newspaper "Vietnam News" reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The agreement, which was signed by U.S. State Secretary
Madeleine Albright and Vietnamese Foreign Minister Nguyen Manh Cam
last June, was established to protect copyright for motion
pictures, videos, musical performances and software.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam's Department of Copyright is preparing documents and
training sessions for various agencies and organizations,
especially in the motion picture and musical performance
industries.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam will strive to fulfill the requirements of the
agreement, first by preventing piracy of copyright and authorship,
said the report.
</P>
<P>
However, the English-language daily said, since the country's
legal system is underdeveloped, the enforcement of the new
agreement is expected to be difficult.

She said more people were aware of the negative effects of

BEIJING, September 17 (Xinhua) -- More precise navigation
services are now possible for ships plying the East China Sea
waters, according to China's State Bureau of Surveying and Mapping.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Roundup: HK's Banking Business in Steady Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's status as an
international financial center has been increasingly strengthened
in recent years with its banking business maintaining robust
growth.
</P>
<P>
Local banking business has turned on a fast growing track
since the 1970s due to its fine geographic location, improved
infrastructural facilities, highly-opening and low tax-rate
policies, and talented staff.
</P>
<P>
It has benefited a lot from the reforms and opening up in
China's interior areas since the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
Of the 100 largest banks in the world, 87 have branches in Hong
Kong.
</P>
<P>
According to the Census and Statistics Department of the Hong
Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR), the total assets of the
banking businesses in Hong Kong reached 8,699.2 billion HK
dollars (115.28 billion U.S. dollars) at the end of June this
year, an increase of 11.6 percent over the same period in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the savings and deposits in the banking businesses
reached 4,260.5 billion HK dollars (546.21 billion U.S. dollars),
rising 14.6 percent and the credits and loans came to 1,599.5
billion HK dollars (205.06 billion U.S. dollars), increasing by
26.2 percent over the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
The interim results of some banks listed in the Hong Kong Stock
Exchange showed that the growth of the average net profits of the
banks in the first half of the year increased by 27.3 percent,
with the Hongkong Shanghai Banking Corporation's profits rising 19
percent to 22.2 billion HK dollars (2.85 billion U.S. dollars) and
Kawah Bank Ltd. rising 50.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
The steady growth of Hong Kong's banking businesses is based on
a solid operation mechanism which agrees with the international
standard and practice.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, banks in Hong Kong enjoyed sufficient
capital and circulating capital, which far exceed the ratio placed
by the banking supervision requirement.
</P>
<P>
The supervision mechanism over Hong Kong's banking businesses
has been greatly improved. While enhancing its supervision role,
the Hong Kong Monetary Authority formulated Banking Ordinance and
Guideline for Risk Management of Derivatives and Related Trading
Instruments to strictly define the requirements on bank
registration, control over credit and loans and investment as well
as the management of derivatives and other risk trading.
</P>
<P>
With the Annual Meetings of the World Bank Group and the
International Monetary Fund due to be held in Hong Kong, local
people are confident of the bright prospect of the banking
business in the Hong Kong SAR in the years to come.

<HEADLINE> Albanian Parliament Approves Tax Hike Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, September 16 (Xinhua) -- The Albanian parliament today
approved -- after intense bickering and some scuffling -- a tax
reform package that would dramatically raise value-added taxes
</P>
<P>
Under the new bill, which was submitted by the new cabinet on
Monday, Albania's value-added tax rate will shoot up to 22 percent
from the original 12 percent as of October 1.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the bill also stipulates an over-the-board hike of
consumption taxes on alcohol, tobacco, foodstuff and petroleum
products. Consumption tax rate on tobacco will rise to 70 percent
and imported lubricants and oils, 80 percent.
</P>
<P>
Observers say the higher taxes, as demanded by the
International Monetary Fund as a major prerequisite for the
provision of emergency funding, will inevitably drive prices up.
</P>
<P>
The move was designed to cut the country's mammoth deficit,
which earlier this year stood at 30 billion Lek (209.8 million
U.S. dollars), estimated at 40 percent of its gross national
product (GNP).
</P>
<P>
Huha Kahkonen, an IMF official, said on September 3 that the
IMF would approve emergency funding for Albania at the end of next
month if the package could be implemented in October.
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Arben Malaj said the government will come up
with a set of measures to mitigate the adverse effects on those
with lower incomes.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that 1.2 million of Albania's 3.2 million
population are now living below the poverty line and 300,000
people are unemployed.

<HEADLINE> Russia to Revamp Aviation Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 16 (Xinhua) -- The Russian government has
decided to revamp its ailing aviation industry so as to meet both
military and civilian needs.
</P>
<P>
The "Financial News" newspaper reported today that under a
special reorganization program, the cash-strapped aviation
industry will be restructured to have only half of the existing
300 enterprises through mergers or close-downs.
</P>
<P>
After the restructuring, the industry will have only four
giants -- Mig, Sukhoi, Topolevand and Ilyushin -- as its backbone
to produce whole planes, and 10 to 15 companies as its second tier
supplying instruments, engines and auxiliary products.
</P>
<P>
Russia is estimated to need some 6,500 new civilian planes
before the year 2015, which, if imported, will cost the country 99
billion U.S. dollars. But designing and building by Russians
themselves will be much cheaper, costing only 53 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
In the future, the government will only provide minimum
financial support for the development of new aircraft, and by
early 1999 there will be no wholly state-owned aviation
enterprises. The government will only reserve its controlling
right in their ownership.

<P>
DHAKA, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh will take steps to
reform the law enforcing agencies which have drawn severe
criticism from the business community, local press reports said
today.
</P>
<P>
A draft of the guidelines for reforms will be prepared in
consultation with all circles concerned, the reports quoted Home
Affairs Minister Rafiqul Islam Bu as saying on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"We will bring about a perfection through continuous reforms
and changes," Islam Bu told businessmen at a discussion on law and
order and smuggling sponsored by the Federation of Bangladesh
Chamber of Commerce and Industry (FBCCI).
</P>
<P>
He said corruption in the police forces as well as in other
parts of the administration was the legacy of past mismanagement.
"It will take time to clean up the garbage."
</P>
<P>
The minister said a department had been set up in the police
forces to deal with the law and order situation in business and
industrial sectors.
</P>
<P>
He also suggested that the FBCCI form agencies in the chambers
across the country to collect information on law-breaking cases,
and asked the chambers to report the information to the home
ministry for further action.
</P>
<P>
On improper preparation of charge sheets that allowed culprits
to obtain bails from the courts, he said a special agency to be
formed by lawyers and officials would look into such cases and
tougher action would be taken against police officers who are
proved to be responsible for such lapses.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia's Ringgit Weakens further </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's ringgit,
which has been in a continuous downward trend for the last few
days, took a fresh beating in early trade today, breaching the
3.00 ringgit level against the U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
On selling of ringgit for the greenback from offshore funds
following renewed concerns about the state of Thailand's economy,
the local currency was opened this morning at 3.0100/50 against
the U.S. dollar compared to 2.9900/30 at the close yesterday.
</P>
<P>
This was a new low of the ringgit since 1970 when it was once
traded at 3.0775 to the U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
The ringgit also weakened against other major currencies. It
fell to 1.9848/94 against the Singapore dollar from 1.9752/85 at
the close yesterday and to 4.8076/71 against the pound sterling
from 4.7607/84.
</P>
<P>
Against the deutschemark, the ringgit dropped to 1.7015/45 from
1.6908/34 and against the Japanese Yen, it weakened to 2.4876/38
from 2.4770/16.
</P>
<P>
The reported possible withdrawal of an International Monetary
Fund rescue package for Thailand was attributed to the weakening
of regional currencies.
</P>
<P>
The crisis in Thailand is not over yet and will haunt the
region for a while, a dealer said, expecting the ringgit to stay
above the 3.00 ringgit level to the U.S. dollar for a while as
sentiment on the local unit is bearish.

<HEADLINE> SDP, Sakigake Demand Convicted Bribetaker Quit Cabinet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Japan's Social Democratic Party
(SDP) and New Party Sakigake agreed Tuesday to demand that an
official convicted of taking bribes resign from his new cabinet
post, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
The SDP and Sakigake, two non-cabinet allies of the ruling
Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), will ask the LDP to relieve Koko
Sato, the newly appointed director general of the Management and
Coordination Agency, of his cabinet post when the three parties'
secretaries convene for a meeting on Wednesday, SDP officials said.
</P>
<P>
Sato, a veteran politician convicted of taking bribes in the
1976 Lockheed scandal, was included in Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto's new cabinet in a reshuffle last Thursday. He is the
first person convicted of bribery to join a cabinet in the postwar
period in Japan.
</P>
<P>
In a general meeting of SDP lawmakers from both chambers of the
Diet (parliament) on Tuesday, many criticized Sato for accepting
the cabinet post.
</P>
<P>
Some senior members of the SDP called on the party to abandon
its alliance with the LDP if Sato remained in his post.
</P>
<P>
SDP leader Takako Doi made clear in the meeting that she would
take a tough stance, saying, "This is an important case that may
affect democracy in Japan."
</P>
<P>
After the meeting of the Diet, the SDP decided at its executive
meeting that the party would demand the resignation of Sato and
boycott most meetings with the LDP.

<HEADLINE> 13 Dead, 5,000 Homeless in Floods in Sri Lanka </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Floods caused by three days
of ceaseless torrential rains in several parts of Sri Lanka have
killed 13 people and rendered over 5,000 homeless, the local press
reported today.
</P>
<P>
Continuous rains, starting on Sunday night, have caused serious
floods and land slides in Avissawella, 50 kilometers east of
Colombo, and Ratnapura District.
</P>
<P>
On Monday alone, five people were confirmed killed and more
than 3,000 people were rendered homeless in the floods in
Avissawella, one of the worst affected areas. Many others were
reported missing.
</P>
<P>
Other deaths were reported in Habaraduwa, Dehiowita in the
southern area and Haputale and Badulla in central mountain areas
which were also badly hit by the rains.
</P>
<P>
The floods destroyed several parts of the main roads. Train
services were also disrupted due to the rains.
</P>
<P>
In Colombo, capital of this Indian Ocean island nation, the
waters of the Kelani River have risen to the warning level. Floods
are feared to wash out the low lying areas of the city today if
the rain continues.
</P>
<P>
The local government has to place those homeless in schools,
temples and community centers.
</P>
<P>
So far the estimated damage caused by the floods was about 25
million rupees (420,000 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The Sri Lankan Meteorological Department has attributed the
disastrous rains to the weak southwest monsoon winds, which were
conducive to thundershowers. The department has forecast that the
rain will continue for another two days.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Rupiah, Stocks Fall on Regional Weakness </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 17 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian rupiah and
local stock prices weakened on Tuesday despite the government's
announcement on project rescheduling, dealers and brokers here
said today.
</P>
<P>
Spot rupiah weakened to a low of 2,955 against the U.S. dollar
from an opening of 2,930/2,938 before settling at 2,948/2,952 at
Tuesday's close.
</P>
<P>
Sustained regional weakness and concern that the riot in
Ujungpandang, capital of Indonesia's South Selawesi province,
might spread kept the rupiah under pressure and caused relatively
heavy bidding on the U.S. dollar, dealers said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Jakarta Stock Exchange composite index slipped
2.89 percent to 534.83 points at Tuesday's close despite a 0.5
percent gain at the opening in anticipation of the retrenchment
program.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said the government's retrenchment program should have
sent a positive signal to the market, but it failed to lift the
market.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Finance Mar'ie Muhammad announced before a
parliamentary plenary session Tuesday that the government would
postpone or review 35.6 billion U.S. dollars worth of government
and state-related projects as part of the drastic measures to cope
with the currency crisis.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the central bank has reduced its bank Indonesia
certificate (SBI) for one month and three month periods by seven
percent in order to ease the tight monetary policy.
</P>
<P>
The rupiah has fallen more than 10 percent in the past month
and nearly 25 percent since January this year following offshore
speculative attacks on the currency and a rush by local companies
to hedge their foreign borrowings.

<HEADLINE> IMF Diagnoses Southeast Asia Currency Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hong Kong, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Real currency appreciation
and a fragile financial sector, rather than fiscal imbalances, are
said to have ignited the Southeast Asia's currency crisis, which
sank currencies of these emerging economies to record lows,
according to a report released by the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) here today.
</P>
<P>
The World Economic Outlook, published a week before this year's
 Annual Meetings of the World Bank and the IMF, picked up the
recent speculative attacks on the currencies of some emerging
market economies as a global issue and tried to find the factors
behind.
</P>
<P>
The currency turmoil hit Thailand the hardest, to which the IMF
later provided a rescue package worth of 17.2 billion U.S. dollars
to bail the economy out. The Thai baht crunch soon spilled over
to other currencies in the region -- the Philippine peso,
Malaysian ringgit, Indonesian rupiah, and even the robust
Singaporean dollar all were depreciated.
</P>
<P>
"The trigger point is likely to depend upon the circumstances
and characteristics of the economy in question, including its
exchange rate policy, its degree of openness, its savings and
investment behavior, the nature of the capital flows financing its
balance of payment deficit, and the health of its financial
system," the report said.
</P>
<P>
Before the speculators mounted attacks on its currency,
Thailand had recently experienced appreciation of both real and
nominal effective exchange rate, which, coupled with a widening
current account deficit, may have increased the perceived risk of
a crisis, said the report.
</P>
<P>
In fast-growing economies, rapid capital inflows in recent
years have built up inflationary pressures and the real exchange
rates tend to appreciate through higher domestic inflation, the
report analyzed.
</P>
<P>
"As signs of overheating and of the tension between the
authorities' desire, on the one hand, to contain inflation and, on
the other, to maintain a stable exchange rate become increasingly
apparent, investors are likely to begin to doubt whether the
situation is sustainable," the report said.
</P>
<P>
In the Thailand case, sluggish exports had recently slowed down
its economic growth, raising doubts about the authority's
continued willingness to support the exchange rate by maintaining
high interest rates.
</P>
<P>
"A turnaround in market sentiment can then bring about a sudden
reversal in capital flows and an external financing crunch that
could result in significant losses in international reserves or a
large adjustment in the exchange rate," the report said.
</P>
<P>
Weaknesses in the banking sector, such as heavy reliance on
short-term borrowing, excessive lending to property-related
projects, poor supervision and inadequate prudential regulations,
tend to make developing economies vulnerable to a sudden reversal
of capital inflows, according to the report. Thailand fell into
the category.
</P>
<P>
The report stressed that the large external current account
deficit in Thailand, around ten percent of its GDP growth in 1996,
is by no means a determinative factor to stir up the currency
turbulence. "Neither theory nor experience suggests some
definitive threshold level for the current account deficit that
may be expected to trigger an external crisis."
</P>
<P>
It highlighted the significant spillover effects of crisis in
one country on other countries in the region, which share common
risk factors, such as real currency appreciation against a rigid
exchange rate system, large external debts and too much domestic
credit to booming property and construction sectors.
</P>
<P>
Despite the recent currency upheavals, the report said that the
overall outlook for capital flows to developing countries remains
broadly positive.
</P>
<P>
Saying that the trigger point for such reversals is difficult
to predict, the report concluded that the best defense is to
pursue policies that address the emergence of imbalances before
they get out of control.
</P>
<P>
The IMF suggested that developing economies establish a set of
core regulatory standards for stronger banking supervision and
learn to manage volatility of cross-border capital flows.

<HEADLINE> Italy to Boost Investment in Railroad Modernization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, September 16 (Xinhua) -- The Italian government will
invest 35 trillion lire (20 million U.S. dollars) in modernizing
the country's railway network over the next 10 years, Transport
Minister Claudio Burlando said today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a hearing of the Senate Public Works Committee,
Burlando said the money would be used to maintain the existing
network and introduce new technology and equipment. About 17.5
trillion lire of the total amount is expected to go toward a
high-speed rail project, while the other half will be spent in
improving the current rail system.
</P>
<P>
Burlando stressed the need for railroad reformation and
regarded it as an urgent task facing the country.
</P>
<P>
The State Railway came under fire in early August when a series
of accidents caused tens of thousands of passengers to be stranded
in Rome on the biggest travel weekend of the year. The crisis was
seen as the latest sign of an aging, out-of-date system.
</P>
<P>
Burlando said 40 percent of the money will be ready in 1998.
He expressed his optimism over the investment plan saying that the
State Railway and National Treasury officials have reached a
consensus on the plan.

<HEADLINE> Economic Growth of Developing Countries to Remain Buoyant: IMF </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 17 (Xinhua) -- The growth of the real
gross domestic product (GDP) in developing countries is expected
to remain buoyant at slightly over six percent in 1997 and
similar growth is projected for 1998, the International Monetary
Fund (IMF) said here today.
</P>
<P>
The latest edition of the "World Economic Outlook" released
this morning said in most developing countries, low or declining
inflation and generally prudent fiscal policies suggest that
threats to growth arising from policy imbalances have been
significantly reduced, the report said.
</P>
<P>
However, the report pointed out, in a number of cases, large
external imbalances and fragile banking systems have emerged and
affected investors' confidence.
</P>
<P>
But such short-term difficulties should not significantly
affect the generally positive long-term prospects of these
countries provided macroeconomic stability is not jeopardized and
the necessary reforms are implemented without undue delay.
</P>
<P>
In Asia, several countries have recently experienced financial
market pressures linked to concerns about large external deficits.
</P>
<P>
Growth in some Southeast Asian countries is likely to slow
significantly in the short run following the recent financial
crisis in the region but should subsequently return to its quite
strong longer-term trend, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The soft landing of China's economy has succeeded in
alleviating inflationary pressures: consumer price inflation is
expected to moderate to 4.5 percent in 1997, a striking contrast
with the 22 percent inflation rate registered in 1994. At the same
time, growth has been maintained at over nine percent.
</P>
<P>
Solid growth is also projected to continue in India. The reform
process under way in the country since 1992 has already produced
notable results, raising annual growth to about seven percent
since 1994 compared with about five percent through the 1980s and
early 1990s, the report noted.
</P>
<P>
Developing countries in the Middle East and Europe region have
witnessed significant improvements in economic performance in
recent years and average growth is expected to continue in the
four to five percent range in 1997-98 despite a slight decline in
oil prices.
</P>
<P>
For Africa, the overall growth estimate for 1997 has been
revised down to 3.75 percent compared with 4.5 percent in the May
edition of "World Economic Outlook".
</P>
<P>
The downward revision appears disappointing following the
relatively encouraging outcome for 1996.
</P>
<P>
However, this result is strongly influenced by developments
such as drought in Morocco, and civil war and political turmoil in
the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the Republic of the
Congo.
</P>
<P>
Overall, while the fragility of Africa's recovery is
highlighted by recent setbacks and political uncertainties, there
are also a significant number of relatively successful economies
that illustrate the region's potential for reversing the long-run
decline in living standards during much of the past quarter
century.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, growth in Africa is projected to recover to about 5
percent.
</P>
<P>
In the Western Hemisphere, both Argentina and Mexico have
continued to recover following the 1995 crisis, and growth is
expected to remain fairly strong during the period ahead.
</P>
<P>
In Brazil, inflation has continued to abate and is expected to
fall below eight percent in 1997, but the external deficit has
been rising.
</P>
<P>
In Chile, growth and inflation have slowed somewhat as a result
of measures to address the risk of overheating; healthy
fundamentals point to continued medium-term growth in the range of
six to seven percent.
</P>
<P>
While Chile's economy remains the strongest among the
developing countries of the Western Hemisphere, there are
encouraging signs that improved macroeconomic discipline and
intensified structural reform efforts are improving the growth
outlook for other countries in the region, the report
said.

<HEADLINE> EU Offers Nepal Preference for Garments Export </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, September 17 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) has
exempted Nepal from the provisions of the rules of origin for
exporting ready-made garments to the EU countries, Nepali
newspapers reported today.
</P>
<P>
This arrangement will promote the exports of ready-made
garments, which are Nepal's major foreign exchange earner along
with the tourism and carpet industries.
</P>
<P>
Nepal had had to pay customs duties if its exports of
ready-made garments did not conform to the provisions in the rules
of origin as specified by the EU, the reports quoted the Nepali
Commerce Ministry as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Nepali government asked the EU to exempt Nepal from the
rules and the EU decided on September 3 to provide facility under
the general preference system to Nepal for exporting ready-made
garments as per the specified quantity, the reports said.

<HEADLINE> IMF on Prospects for Growth in South Asia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 17 (Xinhua) -- South Asia, the second
fastest growing region after East Asia in the world for the past
decade, will maintain its growth momentum provided that
comprehensive economic reforms are continued, the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) said here today.
</P>
<P>
The latest edition of "World Economic Outlook" released here
this morning said that projected growth for India, the giant in
the subcontinent, remains at 6.5 percent, well above the average
of five percent achieved in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
"Following the reform program that India initiated in 1991-92,
growth in real Gross Domestic Product recovered, and then
accelerated, registering about 7 percent a year in the period
1994-96," the report said.
</P>
<P>
"There has been some recent deceleration in economic activity,
concentrated in industrial production and stemming for weakness in
investment and export. Nevertheless, with agricultural performance
benefiting from a favorable monsoon, projected growth for 1997
remains at 6.5 percent," the report pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Inflation is expected to remain moderate, while the external
position should continue to be comfortable with a current account
deficit of less than two percent of GDP and private capital inflows
continuing to be strong, the report said.
</P>
<P>
"A more comprehensive and deep-rooted second wave of reform
measures" remain to be implemented to sustain and improve India's
growth performance of the recent past and to reach its full
potential, it added.
</P>
<P>
"Achieving higher growth in India over the medium term will
depend on mutually reinforcing fiscal measures and structural
reforms," it noted.
</P>
<P>
Turning to Pakistan, the report said, growth projection has
been revised downward to three percent against the five percent
registered for both 1995 and 1996, in the wake of last year's
balance of payments crisis and subsequent adjustment measures.
</P>
<P>
Facing widening macroeconomic imbalances and a threat of
foreign exchange crisis in the latter half of 1996, the Pakistani
authorities adopted a wide-ranging policy package to strengthen
macroeconomic policies and implement structural reforms.
</P>
<P>
The structural components of the policy package were
strengthened substantially in the first half of 1997 in such areas
as tariff reform, tax reform, and financial sector restructuring.
These efforts hold promise of a recovery of GDP growth to the five to
six percent range, as well as of a more stable macroeconomic
environment, said the report.
</P>
<P>
This prospect is contingent, however, upon the sustained
implementation of stabilization and structural policies, it
stressed.
</P>
<P>
In Sri Lanka, the macroeconomic situation has improved since
mid-1996, with the end of the drought and the power shortages, the
report said, adding that growth, which had slowed to under four
percent in 1996, is expected to recover to six percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Persistently large fiscal deficits are at the heart of many of
Sri Lanka's economic problems including the lack of durable
inflation control and relatively modest growth, it noted.
</P>
<P>
After two consecutive years of fiscal deficits in excess of 10
percent of GDP, the deficit narrowed slightly to 9.5 percent in
1996, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
The 1997 budget, which aims to reduce the deficit by two
percentage points of GDP, is a good start to the medium-term
fiscal consolidation but further fiscal adjustment is necessary,
the report said.
</P>
<P>
Turning to Bangladesh, the report said, although economic
growth rose to nearly five percent during the first half of the
1990s, poverty remained pervasive.
</P>
<P>
Inadequate progress in removing deep-seated structural
rigidities in the economy, including a large public sector and a
weak and undercapitalized banking system, made it difficult to
attain a more rapid rate of growth and poverty reduction, the
report said.

<HEADLINE> IMF Predicts Robust Growth in Transition Countries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Many of the transition
countries have achieved robust growth in their economy, according
to a report issued here today by the International Monetary Fund
(IMF).
</P>
<P>
The robust growth trends in these countries can be attributed
to the success of a growing number of economies in establishing
and maintaining macroeconomic stability and in pursuing
outward-oriented, market-based reforms, said the latest edition of
 "World Economic Outlook".
</P>
<P>
There are increasingly encouraging signs that in some
transition countries including Poland, the Baltic countries, the
Czech Republic, Slovak Republic, Hungary and Slovenia, which have
pursued comprehensive stabilization and reform policies.
</P>
<P>
The report said that these countries are experiencing
relatively solid growth, moderate inflation, and good progress in
their reintegration into the world economic and financial system.
</P>
<P>
In the countries in transition as a group, output in 1997 is
now projected to increase by 1.5 to two percent, the first
significant positive growth rate in eight years.
</P>
<P>
The countries more advanced in transition have generally
continued to make progress in reducing inflation, while growth has
 picked up in a number of countries, including Hungary. In Poland,
 inflation on a 12-month basis has fallen below 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
In other countries less advanced in transition, Russia and most
 other countries of the former Soviet Union have made substantial
progress in bringing down inflation.
</P>
<P>
The report said that many challenges remain to be addressed to
safeguard and further extend the progress that has been achieved
in many of the less advanced transition countries. There remains a
 need to establish the institutions of a market economy, which are
 still rudimentary.
</P>
<P>
In addition to fiscal and structural policy requirements, the
transition countries generally face substantial challenges in the
area of monetary policy, the report added. Further progress is
also needed to put in place the framework of instruments and
institutions through which monetary policy can be operated in a
market economy.

<HEADLINE> Six-Month Tourist Arrivals Up 1.53 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Foreign tourist arrivals in
Thailand numbered 3.58 million during the first half of this year,
up 1.53 percent from the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
Most of the tourists, about 2.27 million, came from East Asia
during January-June this year, up 1.6 percent, according to
statistics by the Thai Immigration Bureau and the Police
Department.
</P>
<P>
Tourists from Europe numbered 802,922, an increase of only 0.6
percent, while tourists from America totaled 202,359, up 7.75
percent.
</P>
<P>
However, tourists from South Asia dropped 12.4 percent during
the six months.
</P>
<P>
Thailand has set a target to attract 7.4 million tourists for
this year and the Tourism Authority of Thailand (TAT) is worried
that the number of visitors this year will fall below the target.
</P>
<P>
Local newspapers quoted the TAT as saying that cheating of
tourists remained the biggest problem spoiling the country's
tourism, while little progress had been made in attracting wealthy
tourists instead of the mass market.

<HEADLINE> IMF: Southeast Asian Economy to Return to Fast Track </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Several Southeastern Asian
countries, which have been plagued by a recent currency turmoil,
are likely to experience a slowdown in the months ahead, but
should gradually return to strong economic performance, the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) said today.
</P>
<P>
The latest edition of "World Economic Outlook" released here
this morning said, "In Asia, despite the region's impressive
growth performance in recent years, several countries have
recently experienced financial market pressures linked to concerns
about large external deficits."
</P>
<P>
The pressures have been most acute in Thailand, where
fragilities in the banking system contributed to market concerns,
said the report.
</P>
<P>
After a series of attacks on the baht, a more flexible exchange
rate regime was introduced in early July and there has since been
a depreciation of over 30 percent against the U.S. dollar, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
Provided adequate measures are adopted to strengthen the
financial sector and the balance of payments, confidence should be
restored relatively quickly, it pointed out.
</P>
<P>
"Growth in Thailand is likely to slow significantly in the
short run but should subsequently return to its quite strong
longer-term trend," the report noted.
</P>
<P>
Projected growth for the country has been downgraded by 3.5-4
percentage points to 2.5 percent, reflecting both the effects of
the crisis itself and the adjustment measures put in place.
</P>
<P>
Spillovers were felt by several countries in the region,
especially the Philippines, Indonesia and Malaysia, the report
said, downgrading growth projections for all of these countries by
0.5 to 1.5 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
Asia is projected to remain the fastest growing region in the
developing world, and even with the downward revisions to growth
projections for 1997 and 1998 owing mainly to the currency
turmoil, its expansion this year, by 7.5 percent, will still
significantly exceed average growth in the 1980s and early 1990s,
the report said.
</P>
<P>
The report also stressed that as of early September, broader
spillover effects of the crisis on other emerging market economies
in Asia remained fairly limited.
</P>
<P>
The Singapore dollar weakened moderately in July and August,
the Hong Kong dollar also briefly came under pressure in
mid-August. Equity prices generally weakened across the region in
July and August.
</P>
<P>
The report noted, "Overall, there are reasons to believe that
the currency turbulence will eventually wane without greatly
damaging the region's long-term prospects."

<HEADLINE> IMF Expects Turnaround in Thai Economy Next Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 17 (Xinhua) -- A senior official of the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) today expressed his confidence
in a gradual improvement in Thailand's economy next year as
efforts to tackle the currency crisis have begun to take effect.
</P>
<P>
Michael Mussa, IMF economic counselor and director of the
Research Department, told a press conference here this morning
that although it is difficult to tell exactly when the market
pressure will come down, he expects the Thai economy to improve in
the next six months to one year.
</P>
<P>
While there is still an adjustment process in both the market
and financial policy, rescue measures "are indeed in place", he
said.
</P>
<P>
"Within the coming year, you can see a turnaround in the
economy," Mussa predicted.
</P>
<P>
The market has overdone in the crisis for the past two months,
leading to a sharp depreciation of the Thai currency, and the key
problem now is to restore market confidence, he said.
</P>
<P>
The international financial community has sent a clear signal
to the market that the overreaction should be corrected, he
said.

<HEADLINE> IMF on European Monetary Union </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 17 (Xinhua) -- The advent of European
Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) scheduled for the beginning of
1999 will constitute a major change in the international monetary
system, according to a report issued here today by International
Monetary Fund (IMF).
</P>
<P>
The latest edition of "World Economic Outlook", a report on
world economic and financial surveys, said that involving the
replacement of the national currencies of a number of highly
developed economies of substantial size by a single common
currency, EMU will in fact have no parallel in history.
</P>
<P>
The achievement of EMU will reflect over 40 years of progress
in strengthening economic, monetary, and political ties within
Europe.
</P>
<P>
It said that the EU countries have made considerable progress
in macroeconomic convergence.
</P>
<P>
The inflation in the EU is now lower than at any other time in
the last 35 years. For 1997, average consumer price inflation in
the EU as a whole is projected at 2 percent, less than half of
what it was when the treaty was agreed in 1991, with all EU
members, except Greece, expected to have inflation below 3
percent.
</P>
<P>
Important improvements have also been made in the fiscal area.
The EU-wide general government deficit in 1997 is projected at
2.75 percent of GDP, some 3.5 percentage points lower than its
peak in 1993.
</P>
<P>
The report pointed out that the countries' efforts to improve
inflation and fiscal performance in recent years have not been
without short-term costs in terms of weaker activity.
</P>
<P>
But the costs of fiscal consolidation should not be
exaggerated, it said.
</P>
<P>
The faltering of Europe's recovery in 1995-96 also reflected
the impact on confidence of inadequacies in structural policies in
many countries -- notably the slow pace of labor market reforms,
but also limited progress in the reform of government spending
programs and the consequent overdependence on tax measures in
fiscal consolidation efforts.
</P>
<P>
On the unavoidable uncertainty following the introduction of
the new currency and the possibility of large movements in
exchange rates, the report said that they may lead to greater
calls for international policy coordination between EMU and other
countries, particularly in dealing with any perceived misalignment
of exchange rates.

<HEADLINE> IMF Outlines Situation in Advanced Economies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Stronger growth in the
advanced economies may help the global economy in the future
decade, but these well-developed countries face different
problems, according to a report issued by the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) today.
</P>
<P>
The latest edition of "World Economic Outlook" said that the
global economy is enjoying the fourth episode of relatively rapid
growth since the early 1970s and the good tendency is backed by
stronger growth in the advanced economies.
</P>
<P>
The report took note of continued solid growth with low
inflation in the United States and Britain, strengthening recovery
in Canada and a broadening of recovery across continental Western
Europe. "Stronger growth during the period ahead in these
countries should help support global demand and activity," it
said.
</P>
<P>
However, the report pointed out, the advanced countries have
different conditions for each own economic development and face
different situations.
</P>
<P>
The high degree of price stability remains an impressive
achievement shared by almost all of the advanced economies,
according to the report.
</P>
<P>
"In 1996, the rate of consumer price inflation averaged 2.5
percent, and only four countries experienced inflation above 5
percent; measured by GDP deflators, a broader measure of the price
level, average inflation was just 2 percent," it said.
</P>
<P>
In terms of output and employment, the picture in these
advanced countries is much more mixed as underscored by sharp
divergences in labor market performance in recent years.
</P>
<P>
"Whereas a number of economies including the United States,
Britain, and several of the smaller advanced economies are
operating at relatively high levels of resource use," the report
continued, "the three major continental European countries
(Germany, France and Italy) have suffered protracted economic
weakness that has been accompanied by a dramatic rise in
unemployment to post-war record levels."
</P>
<P>
Conditions for recovery in the advanced economies have
gradually improved, but few forecasters expect the upswing to make
more than a modest dent in unemployment. In Japan, the recovery
has also proven quite hesitant.
</P>
<P>
As to the unsatisfactory economic performance of Germany,
France and Italy, the report said, "The sources of (their)
weakness have been internal."
</P>
<P>
It attributed the following major four factors to the
sluggishness, such as lack of substantial fiscal consolidation,
lack of flexibility of labor markets, lack of consumer and
business confidence and lack of a justified monetary policy.

<HEADLINE> IMF Forecasts 4.2 Pct World Economic Growth This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 17 (Xinhua) -- The global economy is
expected to grow by 4.2 percent this year and 4.3 percent in 1998,
 the International Monetary Fund (IMF) said today.
</P>
<P>
With the strongest pace in a decade, the world economy is
enjoying the fourth episode of relatively rapid growth since the
early 1970s, according to the latest edition of the IMF's "World
Economic Outlook" released here this morning.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, inflation will remain subdued in the advanced
economies at about two percent, and decline further in the
developing countries and the countries in transition, the IMF
said.
</P>
<P>
Robust world trade expansion will contribute greatly to the
solid economic growth, with annual trade volume, goods and
services included, forecast to increase by 7.7 percent this year
and 6.8 percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The IMF described the high degree of price stability as an
impressive achievement shared by almost all of the advanced
economies, predicting an average of 2.2 percent consumer price
inflation along with an average of three percent economic growth
for them.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of the Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) in
Europe, the IMF believes that the establishment of EMU will be a
milestone in the 40-year-long quest to strengthen economic and
monetary integration in Europe.
</P>
<P>
"For Europe, it is to be hoped that EMU will herald a new era
of stronger economic growth," the IMF said, noting that a common
currency shared by a majority of EU member countries, and
potentially by all of them, will lower transaction costs and
generally promote economic integration, generating long-term
efficiency gains.
</P>
<P>
However, the IMF also called for close attention to be placed
on uncertainties about the EMU, suggesting that investor sentiment
 may change if the feasibility of the timetable is perceived to be
 threatened, which will probably lead to unwelcome upward pressure
 on currencies of some countries and weaker economic confidence.
</P>
<P>
The report expected real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth in
 the developing countries to remain relatively buoyant at around
6.2 percent in 1997, compared to 6.5 percent last year, and their
average consumer price inflation will drop from 13.2 percent last
year to ten percent this year.
</P>
<P>
"While the rapid expansion in the Asian region is projected to
moderate somewhat further, many countries in other regions that
saw a marked strengthening of activity in 1996 are expected to
sustain this improvement in the period ahead," the report said.
</P>
<P>
But the IMF again cautioned that the integration of developing
countries into world financial market "poses significant
challenges".
</P>
<P>
While capital inflows can substantially enhance countries'
growth performance, "experience shows that persistently large
deficits are likely sooner or later to result in highly disruptive
 changes in market sentiment," the report said.
</P>
<P>
In order to avoid possible damages by such changes, the IMF
underlined "the frequent need to strengthen fiscal policy" and
"the need for prudential rules that limit the banking system's
exposure to domestic loan problems and to foreign exchange and
liquidity risks" as well as the need for "a gradual introduction
of capital account convertibility".
</P>
<P>
On economic prospects of transition countries, the IMF took
notice of "increasingly encouraging signs that the process of
transition is working".
</P>
<P>
Those countries which have pursued comprehensive stabilization
and reform policies are experiencing relatively solid growth,
moderate inflation, and good progress in their reintegration into
the world economic and financial system, the IMF said.
</P>
<P>
Economic growth in the transition countries is expected to
reach an average of 1.8 percent this year, compared to 0.1 percent
 last year, and their average consumer price inflation will go
down to 32 percent this year from 40 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
"Despite slow progress in some cases, 1997 seems likely to be
the first year for the transition countries overall to register
positive growth," the report said.
</P>
<P>
It also noted that many challenges remain to be addressed for
those transition countries, including the needs to establish the
institutions of a market economy, restructure former state-owned
enterprises, improve financial system and policy-making, and
strengthen macroeconomic stability.
</P>
<P>
While macroeconomic stability, trade liberalization, and the
creation of the basic institutional framework of a market economy
are essential for stronger growth, broader-based reforms are
necessary to sustain and enhance countries' longer-run growth
performance and ensure that the benefits of reform are more widely
 shared, the IMF said.

<HEADLINE> IMF Projects China's GDP Growth at 9.5 Percent in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 17 (Xinhua) -- China will be able to
maintain a 9.5 percent growth for its real gross domestic product
(GDP) in 1997, while consumer price inflation is expected to be at
a low of 4.5 percent, according to the International Monetary Fund
(IMF).
</P>
<P>
The "World Economic Outlook" report released here this morning
held that this year China's economic growth has been maintained at
over 9 percent, which seems to be close to the country's potential
growth rate for the year.
</P>
<P>
The soft landing of China's economy has succeeded in
alleviating inflationary pressures, with consumer price inflation
expected to moderate to 4.5 percent in 1997, which is a striking
contrast with the 22 percent inflation rate registered in 1994,
the report said.
</P>
<P>
Reviewing China's economic development, the report said that
China has had impressive economic growth coupled with significant
structural transformation since it initiated economic reforms in
the late 1970s. During 1978-96, real GDP grew on average by over 9
percent a year, contributing to a near quadrupling of per capita
income.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, many of the distortions and rigidities of
the former central planning system were eliminated and market
forces came to play an increasingly important role in economic
decision making.
</P>
<P>
Equally significant has been the gradual opening and
integration of the economy with the rest of the world, as
reflected in large increases in external trade and foreign direct
investment and the recent establishment of current account
convertibility. In less than two decades, China's share in world
export markets has nearly tripled.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese economy has absorbed almost half of total foreign
direct investment flowing to developing countries in recent years
and with the exchange rate of the Renminbi kept broadly stable to
the U.S. dollar, the strong external position has resulted in a
sharp rise in the country's foreign exchange reserves, which have
climbed to the second place in the world.
</P>
<P>
Referring to China's macroeconomic performance, the report held
that it has generally been favorable. China has avoided the large
output declines and severe macroeconomic instability that have
tended to characterize the transition experiences in some other
countries. In addition, notwithstanding brief episodes of
overheating, inflation on average has been relatively low as rapid
rates of monetary expansion have been absorbed by strong growth in
money demand.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the infrastructure and institutions for market-based
macroeconomic management have been gradually developed, including
a relatively autonomous central bank with a mandate for inflation
control, instruments for indirect macroeconomic management, and a
market-determined exchange rate system.
</P>
<P>
However, the report said, China still faces significant
challenges in the years ahead for its economic development.
</P>
<P>
It pointed out that for China to sustain its rapid growth with
low inflation will require restructuring and efficiency
improvements in state-owned enterprises, financial reforms and a
strengthening of budget revenues.
</P>
<P>
"The strong balance of payments position provides an
opportunity to accelerate trade liberalization, which is also
critical for China's longer-run growth prospects," it said.

<HEADLINE> One More S. Korean Bank Opens Office in Myanmar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, September 17 (Xinhua) -- One more South Korean bank --
Hana Bank -- has opened its representative office in Myanmar, the
official newspaper the New Light of Myanmar reported today.
</P>
<P>
Hana Bank, which began operations Tuesday, is the third South
Korean bank to open an office in the country after Korea Exchange
Bank and First Korea Bank.
</P>
<P>
Since Myanmar reformed its financial management system in line
with the market-oriented economy introduced in the late 1980s, it
has allowed the private sector to operate banking business while
permitting foreign banks to open representative offices in the
country.
</P>
<P>
So far, a total of 45 foreign banks from 16 countries or
regions have opened offices in Myanmar. Most of them are from
Japan, Thailand, France, Singapore and Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
Some of the foreign banks also plan to set up joint venture
banks in the country following Myanmar's entry into the second
phase of its financial reform.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, there are 25 private banks in
Myanmar in addition to six state-owned banks and some
state-private ones.

<HEADLINE> IMF: HKSAR, Mainland Economic Integration Steady </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Economic integration
between the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) of China
 and the Chinese mainland has advanced steadily since the
initiation of China's reform process in 1978, according to the
International Monetary Fund (IMF).
</P>
<P>
The "World Economic Outlook" released by the IMF here today
said that HKSAR's economic performance remains impressive as its
handover to China has proceeded smoothly, and the links between
the two economies in production, investment, trade and financial
flows have been on the increase.
</P>
<P>
The report predicted that HKSAR's GDP will have a 5.3 percent
growth for 1997 and a 5.0 percent growth for 1998, while consumer
price inflation will be 7.1 percent and 6.5 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
It said that the increased economic integration has coincided
with dramatic structural changes of Hong Kong's economy from one
that was based on manufacturing to one dominated by the services
sector.
</P>
<P>
Investment from Hong Kong accounts for two-thirds of foreign
direct investment in the mainland since 1979 and provides
employment for an estimated 4 to 5 million workers in southern
provinces. As production facilities have been relocated to the
mainland, cyclical fluctuations in Hong Kong's GDP and the
mainland's industrial production have become increasingly
correlated.
</P>
<P>
Bilateral trade flows have also expanded steadily. Around 55
percent of Hong Kong's re-exports are originated in the mainland
and about 35 percent are destined to the mainland. One-fourth of
Hong Kong's domestic exports in recent years have gone to the
mainland, although only six percent of retained imports have
originated in the mainland.
</P>
<P>
While banking and financial links have developed, the degree of
financial integration remains limited, the report added.

<HEADLINE> Anti-Corruption Remains Arduous Task: Delegates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Delegates attending the 15th
Communist Party National Congress shared the view that China still
faces the arduous task of fighting corruption and should continue
it perseveringly.
</P>
<P>
The fact that Jiang Zemin's call for never allowing
corruptionists to hide themselves within the Party drew a burst of
applause from all participants at the opening session of the Party
congress reflected the heartfelt wishes of the whole Party and the
people across the country, said a delegate.
</P>
<P>
Li Jinhua, member of the Central Commission for Discipline
Inspection (CCDI), said progress has been made in the fight
against corruption since the 14th National Party Congress held in
1992.
</P>
<P>
Discipline inspection departments at various levels in the
country have tracked down a number of key cases and took
disciplinary actions against more than 20,000 officials at the
county (section) levels and 1,600 officials at the prefecture
(department) level.
</P>
<P>
Li Moran, a delegate in the capacity of a film star, said that
at first he worried about the case of Chen Xitong, former
secretary of the Beijing Municipal Party Committee, fearing that
it would end up with nothing definite.
</P>
<P>
"I was delighted with CCDI's decision on Chen Xitong, which
will help to improve the prestige of the Party," he added.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Siqing, president of the Supreme People's Procuratorate,
said the Party has found an effective way to curb corruption,
which has a unified leadership with support from discipline
inspection departments and the broad masses.
</P>
<P>
Hou Zongbin, CCDI deputy secretary, said the next five years
will be a period of deepening reform and accelerated economic
development as well as a crucial period of fight against
corruption.
</P>
<P>
The key to fighting corruption is to speed up economic and
political restructuring and root out the hotbed which breeds
corruption, he added.
</P>
<P>
Guo Fenglian, Party secretary of Dazhai Village in north
China's Shanxi Province, said: "We have no reason to practice
extravagance and waste as 50 million rural population have not got
rid of poverty and many urban dwellers are still leading a poor
life. Graft by a tiny number of communists has damaged the
prestige of the Party."
</P>
<P>
Wei Jianxing, a delegate from Beijing, said: "We should
strengthen the fight against corruption, tighten supervision,
deepen the reform and pay attention to both present and future
development.

<HEADLINE> Russia Outlines U.N. Reform Emphasis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 16 (Xinhua) -- The reform of the United
Nations should emphasize the structural rationalization of the
world body rather than just budget-cuts, said a Russian official.
</P>
<P>
At a news briefing today, Foreign Ministry official Sergey
Ordzonikidze said that eliminating the overlapped
U.N. institutions will make the world body more structurally
rational and responsive to the practical needs of its member
states.
</P>
<P>
He said that at the upcoming U.N. General Assembly meeting, the
Russian delegation will work for the establishment of a new world
order based on consolidated collective security and mutually
beneficial cooperation.
</P>
<P>
On the reform of the U.N. Security Council, the official said
Russia believes that the council's membership could be expanded to
20, including Germany and Japan.
</P>
<P>
The official stressed that in enforcing violent and mandatory
operations, the U.N. should strictly observe the clearly-defined
provisions of the U.N. Charter.
</P>
<P>
He pledged that Russia will cooperate with the U.N. in solving
the conflicts in the members of the Commonwealth of Independent

<HEADLINE> Canada Unveils New Space Instrument </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, September 16 (Xinhua) -- The Canadian Space Agency
(CSA) unveiled here today a new space instrument that is expected
to put Canada squarely at the front of global ozone research.
</P>
<P>
The sensor, named Optical Spectrograph and Infrared Imager
System (OSIRIS), will provide ozone data of unparalled detail to
the global scientific community, CSA said.
</P>
<P>
While previous ozone studies have examined the extent and
progress of the ozone problem, the OSIRIS study will be the first
to measure the concentration of ozone-depleting pollutants
themselves.
</P>
<P>
With this knowledge, scientists will be able to positively
identify human activities that contribute to the problem.
</P>
<P>
The unveiling is part of the celebrations marking the 10th
anniversary of the signing of the Montreal Protocol, which is
being formally celebrated in Montreal today.
</P>
<P>
CSA said that OSIRIS will be one of two major instruments
onboard the Swedish ODIN satellite, scheduled to launch in the
fall of 1998.

<HEADLINE> Xiamen Port to Become International Hub </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XIAMEN, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Construction of the Haicang
section at Xiamen Port in Fujian Province, on the western shores
of the Taiwan Straits, has been in progress since 1995.
</P>
<P>
The goal of the project is to expand both the area and capacity
of the east China port, and eventually transform it into an
international shipping center.
</P>
<P>
The Xiamen city government plans to promote local economic
development by accelerating construction of the port area,
according to local officials.
</P>
<P>
Deep-water berths in the Dongdu section of the port currently
have an annual handling capacity of 14 million tons. The
capacity is expected to raise to 35 million tons upon completion
of the ongoing construction.
</P>
<P>
The Haicang Section, with a coast line of 13 km, will include
49 deep-water berths with each having a handling capacity of at
least 10,000 tons. Estimates call for the section's total annual
capacity to hit 90 million tons.
</P>
<P>
The two sections will raise the annual handling capacity of
Xiamen Port to over 100 million tons, a level which port
authorities regard as a key factor which will enable the port to
become an international shipping center in future.
</P>
<P>
Four berths for oil, coal, container and sundry goods were
completed in the Haicang Section in the first two years of
construction.
</P>
<P>
In addition, an expansion project will enable the Xiamen
Shipyard to build vessels rated at 10,000 dwt and to repair vessel
rated at 20,000 dwt.
</P>
<P>
Additional berths, as well as various other port facilities and
infrastructures such as roads, railways and bridges are scheduled
for construction in the coming years. Local sources report that
foreign investors have shown increasing interest in participating
in related projects.

CHANGSHA, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Foreign-funded businesses
have praised the efforts of Central China's Hunan Province to
train Chinese management personnel for local operations.
</P>
<P>
In 1994, foreign investors complained that some senior Chinese
managers knew little about management and were in dire need of
special training and education.
</P>
<P>
The province responded by establishing an education and
training center to train management personnel for foreign-funded
enterprises
</P>
<P>
The center has trained over 1,500 managers, accountants and key
management personnel for nearly 800 foreign-funded firms over the
past two years, according to Director Hu Xiangrong of the center.
</P>
<P>
The center has also established contacts with local colleges in
order to offer more opportunities for trainees to continue their
advanced studies in various areas, including MBA programs. Some
100 Chinese and foreign experts have been hired as part-time
teachers.
</P>
<P>
Training focuses on modern enterprise system, joint venture
management, accounting, foreign exchange administration, tariff
and real estate policies.
</P>
<P>
Wang Haobo, general manager of the Chenzhou Light &AMP; Carbon
Products Co. Ltd, said he learned few management concept in his

<HEADLINE> Driver Believes Mechanical Failure Causes Senna Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Former Ferrari driver Michele
Alboreto claimed Tuesday at an Italian court that a mechanical
failure caused Ayrton Senna's fatal crash during the 1994 San
Marino Grand Prix.
</P>
<P>
It was the second time Alboreto appeared at the trial which was
reopened after a summer suspension in Imola.
</P>
<P>
He was summoned by prosecutor Maurizio Passarini to give
further testimony about the possible cracking of the steering
column in Senna's Williams-Renault car.
</P>
<P>
Alboreto's testimony gave strength to the prosecution's case in
the trial of six top Formul One officials charged with
manslaughter in the death of Senna.
</P>
<P>
The trial, which began in February, is seen as a potential
threat to auto racing in Italy.
</P>
<P>
FIA, the world governing body of the sport, suggested that F-1
teams may be afraid to race on Italian circuits if there are
convictions.
</P>
<P>
The six defendants could face up to five years in prison if
convicted.
</P>
<P>
The defendants include Frank Williams and Patrick Head, chief
and technical director of the Williams team.
</P>
<P>
Former Williams team designer Adrian Newey is also standing
trial, along with race organizer Federico Bendinelli, circuit
manager Giorgio Poggi and race director Roland Bruynseraede.

<TEXT>
<P>
HELSINKI, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Finnish Minister of Foreign
Trade and European Affairs Ole Norrback said Monday he shares a
view with Chinese leaders that reforms are essential to promote
economic performances.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks here in an interview with Xinhua before
leaving on an overseas trip. He will visit China in mid-October.
</P>
<P>
Norrback said the message from the ongoing 15th National
Congress of the Chinese Communist Party is that China will further
deepen its economic reforms and liberalize its foreign trade,
which is a very wise decision.
</P>
<P>
He said that China's policy of reform and opening to the
outside world has brought about great changes in various fields,
with the economy growing 10 percent annually over recent years.
</P>
<P>
China's rapid economic growth has not only improved the
well-being of its people but also produced a tremendous impact on
world economy and trade.
</P>
<P>
Norrback said China's role in world affairs has also been
strengthened along with its economic development and it is moving
steadily toward prosperity.
</P>
<P>
He also said Finland supports China's efforts to join the World

<HEADLINE> More Investment Budget Cuts Needed for Thai Gov't </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 17 (Xinhua) -- The Thai cabinet has called
for further cuts in the investment budgets of both government
agencies and state enterprises this year and next year.
</P>
<P>
A further reduction in budgets for the two years will have to
be made to improve the government's fiscal position as required by
the International Monetary Fund (IMF), according to a government
house spokesman on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Under the terms of an agreement with the IMF, which brokered a
17.2 billion US dollar rescue fund, the Thai government must
produce a consolidated public sector surplus equivalent to one
percent of the gross domestic product (GDP) in the 1998 fiscal
year beginning on October 1 this year. And the fiscal deficit
this year must not exceed 1.6 percent of GDP.
</P>
<P>
Deputy prime minister Virabongsa Ramangura, who is in charge of
financial matters, is proposing that all tied-over budgets from
fiscal 1997 be reviewed, according to government spokesman
Varathep Rattanakorn.
</P>
<P>
If all tied-over budgets are cut, the government would come
closer to balancing the books, Virabongsa was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
But if there will still be a shortfall, more measures will be
needed to increase government revenues, such as a higher excise
tax on oil and luxury goods.

<HEADLINE> Canada to Create Million New Jobs, Bank Predicts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, September 16 (Xinhua) -- The Canadian economy will
experience growth and see the creation of one million new jobs by
the end of the century as momentum for new development builds, the
Toronto Dominion Bank predicted today.
</P>
<P>
"The Canadian economy is finally firing on all cylinders -- and
that spells great news for jobs," said Ruth Getter, the bank's
senior vice president and chief economist.
</P>
<P>
"Almost 400,000 new jobs will be created this year, and we
expect another 300,000 jobs to be added in both 1998 and 1999,"
Getter said in the bank's latest quarterly economic forecast.
</P>
<P>
The bank predicted that Canada, which is outperforming the
other G-7 nations this year, will widen its lead even further in
1998.
</P>
<P>
Canada's real gross domestic product (GDP) is expected to grow
3.7 percent this year, 3.5 percent next and 2.8 percent in 1999,
the bank said.
</P>
<P>
The country's unemployment will edge down to 9.2 percent this
year, and 8.8 and 8.6 percent in the next two years.
</P>
<P>
"Although the Bank of Canada may raise interest rates as the
economic expansion picks up steam, interest rates will still
remain at very low levels," Getter said.
</P>
<P>
Canada now has "an environment that can support a fairly long
period of sustained economic growth," he added.

regions in the country, has formally decided on Tuesday to bid for
the hosting of the 2006 Winter Olympic Games.
</P>

Veneto is estimated to spend 12 billion liras in its bidding
efforts and the regional government was alreay busy in seeking

<HEADLINE> Manila to Ease Rules on Foreign Exchange Sales </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 17 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine Central Bank
has approved in principle the exclusion of foreign exchange
subsidiaries and affiliates of banks from the 25,000-U.S.-dollar
cap on over-the-counter dollar sales.
</P>
<P>
Manila Bulletin reported today that the monetary authorities
have considered amending the ruling on foreign exchange
corporations of banks in response to a request from the Foreign
Exchange Association of the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
The Central Bank is excluding foreign exchange affiliates and
subsidiaries from the limitation on condition they do not sell
dollars to non-residents as well as financial institutions which
are with agent banks, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Over-the-counter dollar sales are transactions that require no
documentation, or prior approval from the Central Bank.
</P>
<P>
The monetary authorities ordered last week that foreign
exchange subsidiaries and affiliates of banks should be governed
under the same rules and regulations applicable to the banks.
</P>
<P>
However, currency dealers sought a "distinction" between rules
and regulations covering foreign exchange subsidiaries of banks
and those for the banks themselves.
</P>
<P>
The 25,000-U.S.-dollar cap had virtually paralyzed the
transaction of foreign exchange corporations, because it cramped
the ability of banks to service the dollar requirements of these
corporations.
</P>
<P>
"The limitation virtually renders foreign exchange corporations
of banks useless," a treasury official of a universal bank said.
</P>
<P>
Banks normally course their dollar requirements through foreign
exchange corporations.

permitted to run again, the USA Track &AMP; Field said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. governing body for athletics said a doping hearing
board had cleared Slaney following a weekend hearing in Chicago.

The International Amateur Athletic Federation (IAAF) suspended
Slaney in June for her drug test at the 1996 U.S. Olympic trials.

<P>
The test found Slaney to have a higher ratio of testosterone to
epitestosterone although she denied taking steroids or any drugs
banned by the IAAF.

guerrillas today in the southern province of Huila, with a pilot
slightly injured.

<P>
A police spokesman said the shooting took place at 10:30

<P>
PARIS, September 16 (Xinhua) -- France will decide on a "case
by case" basis whether to erect or maintain perimeter fencing at
its 10 World Cup stadiums next year.
</P>
<P>
During a tour of Lens' Blooaert ground, one of the venues for
the 1998 finals, French interior minister Jean-Pierre Chevenement
said security should be managed case by case because no venue
ressembled another.
</P>
<P>
Chevevement added that maintaining security was a question
above all and he would shortly be contacting the World Cup
Organising Committee (CFO), jointly headed by Michel Platini and
FIFA, soccer's world governing body.
</P>
<P>
Former France captain Platini said at the weekend he hoped
France's new government, elected in June, would choose to remove
perimeter fencing for the tournament.
</P>
<P>
FIFA also wants a tournament without fences but the former
government had decided they should stay.

<HEADLINE> Hainan Improving Tourism Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAIKOU, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Tourism authorities in Hainan,
China's island province in the south, are controlling the number
of new hotels for tourists and travel agencies in an effort to
improve their competitive edge.
</P>
<P>
Local officials say the Provincial Tourism Administration will
suspend issuing licenses to new travel agencies or hotels in urban
areas and will not approve any ethnic song and dance programs over
the next three years.
</P>
<P>
However, the suspension will not apply to hotels and villas to
be built with foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
The move comes when Hainan's tourism industry is caught in a
downward spiral in service quality and profits, despite a growing
number of tourists.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, the province had some five million tourists.
</P>
<P>
However, the large number of hotels has kept the hotel
occupancy rate low and competition too intense among the many
travel agencies, bringing the profit margin down to an
unreasonably low level. Low-quality service is beginning to hurt
the province's image.
</P>
<P>
The province has closed 164 travel agencies that don't have
licenses and suspended business at another 35 that failed to pass
the annual provincial tourism administration inspection.

<P>
CHANGSHA, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Residents in the capital of
central China's Hunan Province are finding many more things that
can be leased, like cars, computers and telephones.
</P>
<P>
At the Weiyi Company, the city's largest car leaser, 5,000 yuan
as a surety and photocopies of an ID card and driver's license
will get you a rental car. Daily rates run from 420 yuan for a
Santana to 2,000 yuan for a Mercedes-Benz.
</P>
<P>
The company is doing a steady business, earning more than
100,000 yuan each month on average in the three years it has been
in operation.
</P>
<P>
Business people in town for a deal often complain of
inconvenient communications. To meet their needs, the local
telecommunications office started a phone leasing
service. Customers put a 500-yuan deposit and pay 300 yuan.
</P>
<P>
And, with the increasing popularity of computers, computer
leasing has become another good business in the city. Monthly
rates are slightly over 100 yuan. According to one employee, 60
percent of the customers are high school students.

LONDON, September 16 (Xinhua) -- All seven French clubs either
won or draw their openers to boost their morale in the UEFA Cup
first-leg first-round matches on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Auxerre won the away game against Deportivo La Coruna of Spain
2-1, Metz scored a 2-0 win away to Belgian Mouscron while Nantes
forced a 2-2 draw away against Denmark's Aarhus.
</P>
<P>
Among those played at home, Bastia toppled Portuguese Benfica
1-0, Lyon stunned Brondy of Denmark 4-1, Bordeaux forced to a
scoreless draw with England giants Aston Villa, while Strasbourg
defeated Glasgow Rangers of Scotland 2-1 with all the goals from
the penalty spot.
</P>
<P>
Yet, the Italian clubs had mixed fortunes. Inter Milan snatched
a 2-0 home victory over Swiss Neuchatel and Lazio scored all the
four goals in the second half to beat home squad Vitoria Guimaraes
of Portugal 4-0, but Udinese was beat 1-0 in Poland by Widzew Lodz
and Sampdoria stumbled over Athletic Bilbao 2-1.
</P>
<P>
British clubs were eager to forget the night. Apart from Aston
Villa and Rangers, both lost the openers, Arsenal also went down
1-0 in Greece to PAOK Salonika, and Leicester City was beated by
Atletico of Spain 2-1.
</P>
<P>
Liverpool also suffered a miserable fate as they drew with
Celtic 2-2 in Glasgow.

<P>
Among other matches, 1860 Munich of Germany won 1-0 over Pori
in Finland, Dutch giants Ajax struggled for a 1-1 draw away to
Maribor Teatanic in Slovenia, and Turkey's Trabzonspor beat German
Bochum 2-0.
</P>
<P>
The biggest score of the night came from Zagreb, where Croatia
Zagreb were held 4-4 by Switzerland's Grasshopper Zurich, and
Austrian Salzburg scored a thrilling win 4-3 over Anderlecht of
Belgium.
</P>
<P>
Auxerre's win was sealed by two second half late goals through
Bernard Diomede and Stephane Guivarch, while two first-half goals
from Frederic Meyrieu and Bruno Rodriguez gave Metz a 2-0 win at
Mouscron.
</P>
<P>
Brazilian internationals came to rescue Inter Milan as both
Ronaldo and Ze Elias scored the second half goals to put the
Italian club for a 2-0 win over Neuchatel.
</P>
<P>
Ronaldo scored in the 58th minute, his second in as many games
for his new club after his transfer from Barcelona.
</P>
<P>
Polish champions Widzew Lodz defeated Udinese 1-0 as defender
Daniel Bogusz drove home the second half winner, after an arguable
penalty kick for Oliver Bierhoff was denied and the Brazilian was
booked for "faking" in the box.
</P>
<P>
Another Brazilian star Juninho scored the equaliser to put
Atletico Madrid for a 2-1 win over Leicester City before Christian
Vieri converted from the spot to give the Spaniards victory.
</P>
<P>
Greek Salonika defeated England Premiership giants Arsenal 1-0
through midfielder Konstantinos Fratzescos who scored the decisive
goal on the hour.
</P>
<P>
Arsenal that suffered the absence of Dennis Bergkamp, produced
only one real chance throughout the game which was sqaundered by
Ian Wright, one of three Arsenal players booked.

<HEADLINE> Fighting Erupts Again near Afghan Northern City </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Heavy fighting erupted
again near Mazar-e-Sharif, around 300 km north of Afghan capital
of Kabul, between the Islamic Taliban militia and their rival
northern alliance, Afghan sources here said.
</P>
<P>
The fighting was back in areas about 30 km east of the
Afghanistan's second largest city, stronghold of the anti-Taliban
alliance led mainly by Uzbek warlord Abdul Malik and former
military chief Ahmad Masood, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Latest Taliban advances were be the second time the militia
moved close to the city within a week, after being beaten back
last Friday from a point only 18 kilometers from Mazar-e-Sharif,
the only major Afghan city not in Taliban's hands.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the U.N. agencies are being compelled to temporarily
withdraw aid workers from Mazar-e-Sharif because their offices
have been so severely looted that they can no longer function.
</P>
<P>
"There is absolutely no way at the moment that we can continue
to provide vital help to the poorest and most vulnerable people in
Mazar, so we are withdrawing our staff until security conditions
improve sufficiently to restart relief programs," said Bronek
Szynalski, regional director of the World Food Program (WFP) and
acting U.N. coordinator for Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
"The WFP compound has been stripped bare," Bronek said in a
statement issued here Tuesday, adding the WFP has lost 735 tons of
food and large quantities of drugs and other medical supplies .
</P>
<P>
Other U.N. offices have also been comprehensively looted of
thousands of dollars worth of computers, walkie-talkie radios,
vehicles and so on, he said.
</P>
<P>
"This is the second time this year that our Mazar premises have
been robbed in this way, in clear violation of U.N. immunities,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
These events keep hindering their efforts to help hundreds of
thousands of people who depend on international assistance in
Afghanistan, he said.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 16 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations was
the unique and indispensable mechanism for addressing new
challenges, Hennadiy Udovenko, president of the 52nd session of
the General Assembly, stressed today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after elected as the president of the 52nd session of
the General Assembly, Udovenko said, "Peace and security are now
more threatened by the internal civil and ethnic strife,
international terrorism and proliferation of nuclear arms and
materials. These threats will not automatically disappear, and
they will, therefore, require the priority attention on the part
of the United Nations."
</P>
<P>
"The United Nations remains the unique and dispensable
mechanism for addressing new challenges, and resolution of
problems related to the maintenance of international peace and
security, promotion of sustained economic growth and sustainable
development, human rights, justice and international law," said
the president.
</P>
<P>
On strengthening the role of the organization, Udovenko said
the principles should be efficiency, transparency, democratization of
the decision-making process, realism and responsibility.
</P>
<P>
He said assuring the United Nations financial viability was
an essential condition for the success of its reform. To solve
the financial problem, political will and cooperative approach
should be strengthened, he added.

<HEADLINE> US Doctors Over-Prescribe Antibiotics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Doctors in the United
States wrote 12 million almost-useless antibiotic prescriptions
for colds, bronchitis and other respiratory infections in one
year, researchers said.
</P>
<P>
In 1992, doctors prescribed antibiotics to two-thirds of
bronchitis sufferers, half of common-cold sufferers and patients
with other upper respiratory infections, according to the latest
issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association.
</P>
<P>
That amounted to 12 million prescriptions, or one in every five
antibiotic prescriptions written for adults that year, researchers
said.
</P>
<P>
The 1992 figures were the latest available for the study, but
the 1995 numbers have since become available and are similar.
</P>
<P>
The indiscriminate use of antibiotics has contributed to the
emergence of drug-resistant bacteria, a growing problem in the
U.S., said the journal.
</P>
<P>
Studies have suggested many doctors may yield to pressure from
patients, or what they perceive to be the patients' expectations,
to prescribe a drug, even if it is unlikely to help.
</P>
<P>
"Every time we use an antibiotic, we run the risk of promoting
antibiotic resistance, or drug resistance, by bacteria," said the
lead author, Dr. Ralph Gonzales of the University of Colorado
Health Sciences Center in Denver.
</P>
<P>
In an editorial of the journal, Dr. Benjamin Schwartz of the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention called for "an
immediate and aggressive response" to combat inappropriate
prescribing of antibiotics.
</P>
<P>
"We encourage all physicians to examine their own practices and
identify where they can decrease unnecessary antimicrobial use,"
he said.

<HEADLINE> US Calls Jews Moving Into Arab Property "Negative" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 16 (Xinhua) -- The United States today
said the moving of two Jewish families into formerly Arab-owned
property in East Jerusalem would have "a negative impact" on the
already moribund peace process in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
"We think it would have a negative impact on the overall
process," State Department spokesman James Foley said at a
briefing.
</P>
<P>
The two Jewish families moved Sunday into the houses, which
they said had been bought for them by Jewish-American tycoon
Irving Moskowitz. But Palestinians said the houses were never
sold.
</P>
<P>
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright also said at the Shannon
airport, Ireland, on the way back from her maiden trip to the
Middle East, that that was "not a helpful act."
</P>
<P>
Foley told reporters Albright spoke clearly about the need to
"avoid unilateral actions or actions which tended to undermine
confidence."

<HEADLINE> Canada Attacks US Visa Legislation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, September 16 (Xinhua) -- The Canadian government is
stepping up its attack on a new U.S. immigration law that would
impose severe curbs on millions of Canadians who travel south to
the U.S., said a report today.
</P>
<P>
Canadian officials are going public with their fight over the
law after several failed bids to get the U.S. Congress to amend
it, according to the Globe and Mail newspaper.
</P>
<P>
The law, passed last year, would force all foreigners to fill
out visa forms upon entering the United States starting next
September.
</P>
<P>
Millions of Canadians who travel to the U.S. would have to fill
out the forms, which would formalize the inquiries immigration
officers often currently make orally of those crossing the border.
</P>
<P>
By 1999, Canadians crossing the border would also be required
to obtain an identification card encoded with key passport and
handprint information.
</P>
<P>
Canadian Ambassador to the U.S. Raymond Chretien complained in
a recent letter to key members of the Congress that the law would
cause traffic chaos at already-congested points along the border
and disrupt bilateral trade.
</P>
<P>
"Implementation of this act as it presently stands would have a
severe adverse impact on cross-border traffic at U.S. land ports
of entry," Chretien wrote.
</P>
<P>
"Citizens of our two countries have long enjoyed free and easy
access across our borders.... Clearly (the law) takes us in the
wrong direction," he said.
</P>
<P>
The crackdown is also at odds with public statements by
Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien and U.S. President Bill
Clinton on the increasingly open border, one Canadian official
said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. law will be phased in starting in January.
