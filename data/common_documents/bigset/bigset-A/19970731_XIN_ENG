<HEADLINE> Clinton Condemns Jerusalem Bombings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 30 (Xinhua) -- President Bill Clinton today
condemned bombings in Jerusalem that killed at least 18 people,
saying it was a "barbarous act."
</P>
<P>
The explosions occurred in the afternoon in Jerusalem at a
crowded outdoor vegetable market, killing at least 18 and wounding
more than 150. There was no immediate claim of responsibility for
the attacks.
</P>
<P>
"The slaughter was aimed directly at innocent Israelis,"
Clinton said in a statement at the White House briefing room. "It
was also aimed at the majority of Israelis, Palestinians and Arabs
who want a lasting and just peace."
</P>
<P>
"We must not let the enemies of peace prevail," he continued.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Clinton telephoned Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu to express his condolences.
</P>
<P>
"I told him the hearts and prayers of Americans are with him,
the people of Israel, and the victims of the attack and their
families," he told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Clinton also announced postponement of plans to send special
U.S. mediator Dennis Ross to the Middle East until a period of
mourning can be observed. Ross had been scheduled to depart for
Israel tonight.
</P>
<P>
"The trip (of Ross) will be postponed for a period -- an
appropriate period of mourning," he said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said he would continue his efforts to push forward the
Middle East peace process and any suggestion that he was not
"personally involved" was false.
</P>
<P>
"I believe my personal involvement has been continuing and
intense in this (peace process)," he said. "But I know of no
example in recent history where peace is made by third parties
trying to be helpful, making public statements alone."

<HEADLINE> US New Home Sales Jump by 6.1 Percent in June </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 30 (Xinhua) -- New home sales in the U.S.
jumped by 6.1 percent in June to the highest level since March,
the U.S. Commerce Department reported today.
</P>
<P>
The department said that sales of new single-family homes
totaled a seasonally adjusted 819,000 annual rate, up from a
sharply revised 772,000 a month earlier. May sales were revised
downward from the originally estimated annual rate of 825,000.
</P>
<P>
The sales in June were the highest since 825,000 in March and
were the fourth above 800,000 this year.
</P>
<P>
Regionally, sales shot up 12.4 percent in the West. They rose
by 9.2 percent in the South and 7 percent in the Midwest. But
sales plunged 21.1 percent in the Northeast.
</P>
<P>
The strong sale of new homes in June resulted from a sound
economy and favorable 30-year mortgage rates that fell to 7.69
percent in June, down from 7.94 percent in May and 8.32 percent in
June 1996.
</P>
<P>
So far this year, sales of new homes in the U.S. were 8.1
percent above those of the first six months of last year. However,
analysts are predicting sales will level off this year after
reaching 757,000 in 1996, the most since 1978.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the seasonally adjusted estimate of new
homes for sale at the end of June was 282,000, smallest since
278,000 in July 1993. It represented a supply of 4.2 months at the
current sales rate, smallest since a 4.1 month supply in July 1971.
</P>
<P>
The June inventory marked the sixth straight month of fewer
than five months' supply, the longest period since September
1970-August 1971.

<HEADLINE> Sexual Harassment, Crime in Southern Africa: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Strides have been made in most
Southern African Development Community (SADC) member states to
recognize sexual harassment as a criminal offense, gender
activist Patricia Mcfadden said here today.
</P>
<P>
Mcfadden said there had been significant progress since the
program to make sexual harassment a crime was introduced at
various universities in the region three years ago.
</P>
<P>
''There is an active network in the region in which women are
fighting back, insisting that sexual harassment be recognized as
a criminal offense,'' the South African activist said at the
four-day conference on the girl child which ends Thursday.
</P>
<P>
She said the effects of sexual harassment were far reaching as
the victims suffered psychologically and physically.
</P>
<P>
''It's more than just touching, it's also a violation of the
integrity,'' she said, adding that it was an imposition of sexism
and an expression of male supremacy.
</P>
<P>
It is difficult to fight sexual harassment because it has been
culturalized, she said, with men who normally are among the
violators, often arguing that it is cultural to admire and touch
women even against their will.
</P>
<P>
The program, she said, was strategically targeted at
universities as the graduates would be future industrialists.

<HEADLINE> S. Korean Convertible Bonds Trade Reaches Record High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, July 30 (Xinhua) -- South Korea has issued more
convertible bonds this year, with the trade volume of such bonds
so far this year reaching a record high of 2.07 trillion won
(about 2.33 billion U.S. dollars), the Korea Stock Exchange (KSE)
said here today.
</P>
<P>
The trade volume of convertible bonds as of July 29 this year,
the highest since the trade began to be concentrated at the KSE in
1994, exceeded the 1996 total of 1.13 trillion won (1.27 billion
dollars).
</P>
<P>
In 1996, the volume registered a slip of 2.59 percent from 1.16
trillion won (1.30 billion dollars ) the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The issuance of convertible bonds, which had declined steadily
since 1994, also increased remarkably this year, with 931.8
billion won (1.05 billion dollars) worth of bonds issued as of
July 29, already approaching the 1996 total of 1.02 trillion won
(1.15 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
Market observers attributed the rise to increased participation
by individual and foreign investors, as well as the successive
foreign investment limit hikes over the past two years.
</P>
<P>
Issuance of convertible bonds is favored more than ever, due
to increased hopes of a market recovery after a long-term bear
market, they said.
</P>
<P>
Changes in bonds trade regulations, which allow investors to
convert their holdings into stocks after three months, instead of
the previous six months, have also added to the appeal of such
bonds, they added.
</P>
<P>
They predicted the trend to continue for the rest of the year.

<HEADLINE> Iran's President-Elect to Be Sworn in August 4 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Iran's President-elect Mohammad
Khatami will be sworn in as the country's fifth president on
August 4, Parliament Speaker Ali Akbar Nateq-Nouri announced here
today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a formal session of the parliament, Nateq-Nouri
said the swearing-in ceremony would take place at nine o'clock
that morning.
</P>
<P>
It is expected to be attended by outgoing President Hashemi
Rafsanjani, head of the Judiciary Mohammad Yazdi, top civilian and
military officials, leaders of the religious minorities and the
diplomatic corps in the capital of Tehran.
</P>
<P>
According to parliament procedure, the new president is
required, with two weeks after inauguration, to introduce his
cabinet as well as his administrative program to the parliament.
</P>
<P>
The parliament will start study of the program and
composition of the cabinet in three five-hour sessions within one
week and the cast ballots in a vote of confidence.
</P>
<P>
So far, the president-elect has been withholding the make-up of
his government.
</P>
<P>
Local press reported that Iran's Permanent Representative at
the United Nations, Kamal Kharrazi, will be the next foreign
minister to replace Ali Akbar Velayati, who held the post for 16
years.
</P>
<P>
First Vice-President Hassan Habibi is to be renominated for
the post to ensure continuation of the development programs under
the Rafsanjani government.
</P>
<P>
Vice-President for executive affairs Mohammad Hashemi, who is
brother of Rafsanjani, will likely maintain his position and
Mohammad Ali Najafi, currently Minister of Education, may take
over as head of the Plan and Budget Organization.
</P>
<P>
Mostafa Hashemitaba, vice-president for physical training
affairs, will probably retain his post, while Admiral Ali
Shamkhani will become defense minister.
</P>
<P>
Khatami, 54, won a landslide victory over his main rival
Nateq-Nouri during the May 23 presidential election, in which the
most massive turnout since the victory of the 1979 Islamic
Revolution was recorded.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 30 (Xinhua) -- The Southern African
Development Community (SADC) will introduce satellite mapping
technology to clear land mines throughout the sub-region.
</P>
<P>
SADC Executive Secretary Kaire Mbuende said in Gaborone today
that the drive will cost about 2.2 million U.S Dollars.
</P>
<P>
SADC plans to use the new technology to spot land mines laid
during conflicts and determine a precise figure of the explosive
devices in Southern Africa,the official was quoted by the local
press as saying.
</P>
<P>
Mbuende describes the exercise as a systematic cleaning
campaign to be carried out in such countries as Angola and
Mozambique, which are among the most heavily-mined countries in
the world.
</P>
<P>
SADC, comprising 12 Southern African countries, was formed in
1992 in Windhoek, Namibia, to lead the region to a free trade
zone by the year 2000.

<HEADLINE> Violent Crime Rate Highest in UK Among European Nations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Britain has the highest rates of
violent crime, burglary and car theft among European countries,
according to a latest survey published today.
</P>
<P>
The International Crime Victimization Survey of 19,000 adults
in 11 countries including the UK, France, Sweden, Switzerland,
Finland and Austria, as well as Canada and the US revealed a
depressing picture of extremely high crime rates and fearfulness
among Britain's population.
</P>
<P>
The joint Home Office-funded study found that one in three
people in Britain have been a victim of crime, joint highest with
the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
With crimes involving robbery, assault and sexual assault, the
highest risks are also in Britain. Three percent of people in
Britain have had their cars stolen, the highest rate.
</P>
<P>
It is also highest for theft from cars, with about one in 10
people in Britain suffering a break in.
</P>
<P>
Britain comes second, only behind the Netherlands, when
examining comparative risks in terms of the number of crimes
experienced per citizen, with 61 offenses per 100 people.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Britain has slipped to having the highest
crime rate, from being sixth out of 15 countries in a 1989 survey.

<TEXT>

WASHINGTON, July 30 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. House of
Representatives Tuesday passed a defense bill of 248 billion
dollars which is to fund new military hardware and increase
military pay, but would halt U.S. ground operations in Bosnia
after June 30, 1998.
</P>
<P>
The bill, approved by a vote of 322-105 in the house, would
demand some four billion dollars more than the Clinton
administration planned for hardware and equipment, and 770 million
more for research and development programs.
</P>
<P>
President Bill Clinton has threatened to veto the bill, which
was 4.4 billion dollars more than his budget request and 3.9
billion more than this year's military spending.
</P>
<P>
Under the bill, the United States would spend 505 million
dollars on B-52 bombers this year, an increase of 331 million
dollars over last year, and 3.67 billion dollars on missile
defense programs.
</P>
<P>
The bill would also allow 79 million dollars for the Defense
Department programs dealing with the Gulf War-related
events.

<HEADLINE> Three English Men for Murder Convictions Exonerated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 30 (Xinhua) -- The English Court of Appeal today
exonerated three men who spent 18 years in prison for the murder
of a newspaper delivery boy.
</P>
<P>
The court quashed the convictions of Michael Hickey, his cousin
Vincent, James Robinson and a fourth defendant Patrick Molloy, who
died in prison in 1981, for the murder of 13-year-old Carl
Bridgewater, shot dead during a robbery in 1978.
</P>
<P>
"We have concluded that the appellants did not have a fair
trial and for that reason have quashed their convictions," Lord
Justice John Roch told the court.
</P>
<P>
"This is another case of a miscarriage of justice which is a
matter of regret for this court," he added.
</P>
<P>
The three men were released on unconditional bail in February
after prosecution lawyers said their trial was fundamentally
flawed and the convictions unsafe.
</P>
<P>
The men, known as the Bridgewater Four, had always protested
their innocence and had staged hunger strikes during their
imprisonment. Now they are seeking compensations for their 18-year
wrongful sentence.
</P>
<P>
During the one-month appeal hearing, lawyer Michael Mansfield
accused police of tricking Molloy into signing a false confession
and said a squad of police officers had conducted a carefully
cultivated strategy of deception.
</P>
<P>
The Appeal Court ruled that Molloy's confession had probably
been obtained by deceit and was inadmissable.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: It's a Win-Win for EU and Boeing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Though the European Commission
pronounced the go-ahead to the Boeing-McDonnell Douglas merger,
concessions were made as much if not more on the American side
than from across the Atlantic Ocean.
</P>
<P>
A damaging trade war was averted at last after seven months of
paperwork and negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The environment for competition was seemingly rendered more
fair as the Europeans okayed the move on conditions that Boeing
cedes all its existing and would-be exclusive supply deals, or at
least it has to refrain from such exclusivity until the year 2007.
</P>
<P>
This, alongside Boeing commitment not to abuse relationship
with customers and suppliers, is hoped to leave some leeway for
Airbus to land some orders in the United States.
</P>
<P>
The Europeans also required McDonnell Douglas to "fence" up its
commercial aircraft activities and they themselves, too, can use
through the licensing mechanism the aeronautic patents developed
under the auspices of U.S. governmental subsidy and public
funding.
</P>
<P>
All told, Boeing has made "substantial" concessions that took
care of Union officials' main concerns and led to the anti-trust
settlement.
</P>
<P>
Although the American aircraft makers backstepped from the
starting line of another round of competition in the global
aircraft market, the Europeans do not look to having a feasible
chance to get abreast with their American counterparts.
</P>
<P>
Now that the completion of the Boeing-MD merger is only a
matter of time, their carriers will soon expand from the current
Boeing market share of 64 percent to a combined 70 percent while
their share in the service fleet worldwide is to rise from 60
percent to a dazzling, if not damaging, 84 percent.
</P>
<P>
And what's more, the Boeing-MD combined market share is about
two thirds of the EU market, where airlines are forecast to
account for almost a third of future demands for commercial
aircraft over the next decade.
</P>
<P>
By grabbing for itself a market sharing opportunity with
billions upon billions of ECUs or Euros looming on the horizon,
the European Union has also reciprocated more of the bonanza to
the United States.
</P>
<P>
But should things go wrong after 2007, trade rows are destined
to return to between Boeing-MD and its archrival in the European
continent, the Airbus consortium.

<HEADLINE> Alatas: No Deadline for Cambodia's Entry into ASEAN </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Cambodia's entry into the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) is still awaiting
the agreement of two conflicting parties in Cambodia, Indonesian
Foreign Minister Ali Alatas said here today.
</P>
<P>
"The membership of ASEAN might be determined during Cambodia's
election in May 1998, or before or after the poll when the two
warring factions in that country reach an agreement. No deadline
has been set for Cambodia's entry," he said after having talks
with his Canadian counterpart Llyod Axworthy.
</P>
<P>
Axworthy arrived here Tuesday for a three-day visit to
Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN now groups Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines,
Singapore, Thailand, Vietnam, Laos and Myanmar. Cambodia was
delayed to enter the grouping because of political crisis in the
country.
</P>
<P>
Alatas along with Thai Foreign Minister Prachuab Chaiyasarn and
Philippine Foreign Minister Domingo Siazon plan to meet Cambodia's
Second Prime Minister Hun Sen in Phnom Penh late this week.
</P>
<P>
"Certainly, ASEAN is interested in helping to end the crisis in
Cambodia, but this is not the right time for me to tell the
press," he said.
</P>
<P>
Alatas did not elaborate on the topics the three ministers will
discuss with Hun Sen.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, an agreement between the two warring
factions, namely, the Cambodian People's Party (CCP) led by Hun
Sen and FUNCINPEC led by First Prime Minister Norodom Ranariddh,
plays a significant role in ending the Cambodian crisis.
</P>
<P>
He said a formation of a coalition cabinet and Cambodia's
election next year are two important factors to end the conflict.
"Whoever wins the election should be acknowledged by the Cambodian
people," he added.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Condemns Jerusalem Bomb Attack </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Egypt strongly denounced today the
two bomb explosions that rocked a bustling market in Jerusalem,
killing 13 people and wounding more than 150, the Middle East News
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak condemned the two deadly
bombings as "a sabotage" to the peace process and conveyed his
condolences to relatives of the victims.
</P>
<P>
"The Egyptian stance is clear, which denounces all kinds of
violence that works against the Mideast peace process," Mubarak
told reporters.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian leader said he had had telephone contacts with
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and President Ezer
Weizman after the bloody suicide bombings which took place at
around 10:15 GMT.
</P>
<P>
In another telephone conversation with Palestinian National
Authority President Yasser Arafat after the tragedy, Mubarak said
he stressed the importance of going all out to fight back "those
provocations against the efforts to save Mideast peace."
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Amr Moussa also expressed his condolences to
families of the victims and said the bombings "apparently do not
contribute to peace."
</P>
<P>
He stressed that all kinds of perpetrations against the peace
process have wrecked great pains upon both Palestinians and
Israelis.
</P>
<P>
The peace process should not be stopped, he said, adding that
"At this crucial time, it is important to continue the efforts to
achieve just and lasting peace."
</P>
<P>
Moussa also called for "restraint" from all parties in the
aftermath of the deadly bombings. "I hope all peace-loving people,
especially those in Israel, to cling to saving the peace process,
which is the only way to safeguard their security," he noted.
</P>
<P>
So far no one has claimed responsibility for the suicide
bombings in the main fruit and vegetable market in West
Jerusalem. But Israel blamed them on Palestinian militants which
oppose peace with Israel and have launched similar attacks in the
past.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 30 (Xinhua) -- South Africa today condemned
a suicide bombing in West Jerusalem, in which 18 people were
killed and more than 150 others injured.
</P>
<P>
In its statement, the South African Foreign Affairs Department
described the bombing as "a despicable atrocity", and urged
parties concerned to avoid any actions or retaliation which might
exacerbate tensions, and to continue with peace talks.
</P>
<P>
The statement said it is time for all people of goodwill in
the region to address their differences through dialogue and to
accept that the only road to a lasting and just peace lies in
negotiation.
</P>
<P>
The statement also expressed regret at the loss of life and
extended condolences to those injured and the families of those
killed.
</P>
<P>
According to reports reaching here, shortly after midday
today, two bombs exploded in Jerusalem's busiest Mahane Yehuda
open market, killing at least 18 people and wounded 150 others.
</P>
<P>
No one has claimed responsibility yet for the attacks, but
police suspected they were suicide bombings carried out by
Palestinian extremists.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Urges Arafat To Take Stiff Anti-Terror </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu today urged Palestinian National Authority (PNA) to take
stiff anti-terror actions following two bomb explosions in
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
"We expect not words of consolation from the Palestinian
Authority. What we expect is action to apprehend these terrorists
and their leaders," said Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu announced the statement when he was addressing a
hastily-arranged press conference following the twin bomb
explosions in the central open market in Jerusalem this
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
A total of 14 people, apparently including two suicide bombers,
were killed and 170 were injured. The incident is the most serious
one in terms of casualties since he came to power more than a year
ago.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the bombing attack, Palestinian President Yasser
Arafat telephoned Netanyahu condemning the attack and expressing
condolences to the families of the victims.
</P>
<P>
Referring apparently to Arafat's gestures, Netanyahu said in
his statement that Israel needs cooperation from the
PNA. "Security cooperation can stop terrorism," he added.
</P>
<P>
Instead, he said, the PNA released some 150 terrorists of Hamas
and Islamic Jihad and they were set free to approach Israel's
cities and streets and commit barbarous acts.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu said: "we expect action to collect explosives and
weapons. They are there in the field and can be collected."
</P>
<P>
The premier concluded: "I expect (from the PNA) not words of
condolence alone, words of condemnation alone, words of reproach
alone, but words that educate and call on the Palestinian
population to rise against terrorism." "That is what we expect
and we have every right to expect that," he said.

<HEADLINE> Chiluba Urges Revitalization of China-aided </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania and Zambia have no
plans to privatize the China-aided joint Tanzania-Zambia railway
(TAZARA) but would further commercialize and revitalize it,
Zambian President Frederick Chiluba said today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters here this afternoon at the end of his
three-day state visit, Chiluba said TAZARA has been privatized
enough and the immediate task is to raise efficiency and
innovativeness.
</P>
<P>
"We are not talking about privatization of TAZARA. Our goal is
to enhance efficiency and enable TAZARA to compete effectively in
this liberalized market," the Zambian president said.
</P>
<P>
He paid tribute to the founding fathers of the two nations,
Julius Nyerere and Kenith Kaunda, saying the spirit of TAZARA
must not be killed by those running the entity.
</P>
<P>
"If the management lacks innovativeness and enterprise then
something must be done about it," said Chiluba.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the two presidents have urged the private sector to
boost economic production, trade and investments in agriculture,
manufacturing industry, small-scale mining, communication,
transport and tourism.
</P>
<P>
According to a joint communique issued here today, the two
presidents have also agreed to reactivate the sub-commission on
trade, industry and finance to facilitate and promote cooperation
in trade, industry and finance.
</P>
<P>
They further agreed on improving the performance of the two
jointly-owned institutions, TAZARA and the Tanzania-Zambia
Pipeline (TAZAMA).
</P>
<P>
On regional issues, the two presidents reaffirmed support for
the decisions made on Burundi on April 16 this year, during the
fourth Arusha regional summit.
</P>
<P>
However, they expressed regret that the installation of the
government of national unity and reconstruction in Angola had so
far not led to the restoration of permanent peace and stability
in that country.
</P>
<P>
They expressed concern at the resumption of fighting in some
parts of the country and called upon the parties to the conflict
to adhere to the letter and spirit of the Lusaka protocol of
November in 1994.
</P>
<P>
On Liberia, the two presidents welcomed the holding of free
and fair elections and urged the people to embark upon the
reconstruction of their country.
</P>
<P>
President Chiluba and his delegation left for home after the
press conference and were seen off at the Dar es Salaam
International Airport by President Mkapa and other senior
government officials.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 30 (Xinhua) -- An exhibition marking the 70th
anniversary of the People's Liberation Army of China (PLAC) opened
here in the Central Museum of the Armed Forces today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening ceremony, Military, Naval and Air
Attache of the Chinese embassy Maj. Gen. Feng Yuqiang emphasized
that China will never participate in the arms race, never conduct
military expansion and never seek hegemony."
</P>
<P>
General Vladimir Verevkin-Rahalisky, first vice-chairman of the
Russian War Veterans Committee, in his congratulatory speech
praised the PLAC for its glorious history and way, and said it is
very good that the time of frigid ties between the two countries
has gone.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that the relations between Russia and
China as well as the ties between the two armies will be
strengthened and developed further.
</P>
<P>
On display at the exhibition were more than 50 photographs and
about 30 objects, which introduce the founding of the PLAC, its
way of defending the motherland and maintaining the order of the
country.
</P>
<P>

Russian military officers and veterans as well as military
attaches from the embassies of the United States, Britain, France,

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Opposition Remains Split </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan opposition remains split
when FORD-Asili Chairman Kenneth Matiba today rejected other
opposition leaders' stand to have the National Convention
Executive Council (NCEC) to lead their talks with the government.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that the only way forward is for a constitutional
conference that is convened and managed by the religious
institutions in the country," Matiba said at a press conference.
</P>
<P>
"The conference must have a neutral chair, a neutral venue and
an open floor," noted Matiba, charging both the parliament and
the NCEC are strongly biased and thus do not represent the views
of Kenyans.
</P>
<P>
NCEC, an umbrella body set up in April by Opposition parties
to coordinate their campaign for reforms, now is an interested
party which cannot represent the Opposition in the reforms debate
with President Daniel arap Moi, Matiba stressed.
</P>
<P>
Main Opposition leaders, including several FORD-Asili members
of parliament, reached agreement last week to undertake the
dialogue through NCEC and within the institutional framework the
NCEC provides.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Matiba called on Moi to step down within five days
beginning today, otherwise FORD-Asili would begin mass action
including the boycott of shops and businesses, especially those
owned by Asian Kenyans, he said.
</P>
<P>
Matiba also vowed to take action to press for a fresh
population census, the establishment of an independent electoral
commission, free access by political parties to media, redrawing
of constituency boundaries and so on.
</P>
<P>
FORD-Asili is one of the five registered Opposition parties in
the east African country but its leader Matiba, a member of
parliament, did not register as a voter during the voter
registration held from May to June.
</P>
<P>
The opposition has so far failed to pick a team to discuss
constitutional reforms with the government since Moi softened his
stance by meeting with official Opposition leader Kijana Wamalwa
and 19 key religious leaders and pledging dialogue in mid-July.
</P>
<P>
The government's shifts of position came days after the most
violent conflicts between the police and the Opposition
supporters in seven years broke out, claiming 13 lives around the
country on July 7.

<HEADLINE> British Armed Forces to Maintain Global Military Role </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 30 (Xinhua) -- British Defense Secretary George
Robertson said here today that the new Labor government would seek
to make the country's armed forces continue to play a global role.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the House of Commons' defense committee early today,
Robertson said, "We have to keep a broad balance of capabilities
so we can do what the people want us to do. What we have rejected
is the idea of minimal defense."
</P>
<P>
He stressed that Britain should maintain its armed forces in a
rapidly changing world. "In Europe today, we can see how
instability can so easily escalate into major conflict with
consequences which spill over borders and threaten our own
national security," he said.
</P>
<P>
The defense secretary pledged that the coutry's defense
spending would not be slashed but he made it clear the military
would have to make better use of its budget.
</P>
<P>
"The British people want strong defense for this country but
they don't want defense at any price and we must justify every
pound which is spent in the defense budget," he said.
</P>
<P>
Writing in today's Independent Newspaper, Robertson said, "We
are going to examine whether Britain should spend the money to
have a substantial role in situations like Bosnia or other
international crises."
</P>
<P>
He said, "With the end of the Cold War we have the opportunity
to decide what kind of contribution we wish to make to
international security."
</P>
<P>
"In truth, the British people want Britain to play a
substantial role in NATO, and to play a wider role in
international politics," he added.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania's Export Earnings Decline Last Month </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Export earnings for the
country went down by 10.6 percent as import bill increased by
24.6 percent last June, the Bank of Tanzania (BoT) disclosed
today.
</P>
<P>
The BoT said in its monthly economic review report that export
earnings dropped largely due to a decrease of 24.6 percent in
traditional exports and a decline of 2.3 percent in
non-traditional exports.
</P>
<P>
The BoT explained in the report issued here that the level of
receipts from traditional exports was low on account of a
decrease in both the volume and unit prices.
</P>
<P>
It said coffee was the only traditional crop which realized
increase in export earnings by one percent while others such as
cotton, sisal, tea, tobacco and cashew nuts registered decreases
in export volumes.
</P>
<P>
The BoT report, however, said sisal and tobacco enjoyed higher
export unit prices, but the sharp decline in export volume led to
lower earnings from tobacco.
</P>
<P>
It said the overall decrease in export volume was the major
factor for the poor performance of traditional exports.
</P>
<P>
On imports, the report said the major reasons for the increase
recorded was due to increases in all major categories, namely,
capital goods, intermediate goods, and consumer goods which
increased by 9.8 percent, 68 percent and 6 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhilets, the report said there was a surge in the imports of
building and construction equipment and machinery within the
capital goods category, which was an indication of expanding
investment activities in both construction and the manufacturing
sector.
</P>
<P>
The report also indicated that imports of food and food stuffs
increased by 102.3 percent during June, while other consumer
goods declined by nearly 4 percent to 21 million U.S. Dollars.
</P>
<P>
The BoT said in its report that the government's budgetary
performance last month was outstanding, with revenue collection
picking up from 46.3 billion Tanzania shillings (about 77 million
US Dollars) in May to 57.2 billion T. Shs. (about 95 million US
Dollars) and expenditure stagnating at around 52 billion T. Shs
(about 86 million Dollars).
</P>
<P>
It said the favorable situation improved the monthly overall
balance from a deficit of 5.8 billion T. Shs. (about 9.6 million
US Dollars) in May to a surplus of 4.6 billion T. Shs. (about 7.6
million US Dollars), while revenue collection reached 572 billion
T. Shs. (about 953 million US Dollars) in 1996/97, equivalent to
17.3 percent of GDP.
</P>
<P>
The bank said the records compared favorably with the revenue
target for the year, which was 563.8 billion T. Shs. (about 939
million US Dollars) or 17.1 percent of GDP.

<HEADLINE> Round-up: Bombs Kill 14 in Jerusalem, Setting Back </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 30 (Xinhua) -- In a major setback to the
Israeli-Palestinian peace process, two suspected Palestinian
suicide bombers blew themselves up in a bustling Jerusalem market
today, killing 14 people and injuring 170 others.
</P>
<P>
This was the first suicide bombing attack since the March 22
suicide bombing of a Tel Aviv cafe and one of the worst terror
attacks against Israel since the peace process began in 1993.
</P>
<P>
Two loud explosions occurred in seconds apart around 1:15
p.m. local time in the Mahane Yehuda open market, which was
packed with customers shopping for vegetables, fruits and other
daily necessities.
</P>
<P>
Eyewitnesses said that they saw two Palestinians wearing
shirts and ties entering the market, each carrying a huge bag
which police investigators late estimated to contain 10 kilograms
of explosives. One of them sat in front of a store at the
junction linking the market to the busy Jaffa Street and
detonated his bomb, and 20 seconds later another bomber blew
himself up.
</P>
<P>
Police said at least 14 people, including the two bombers,
were killed and 170 others were wounded in the blasts, which
badly devastated the nearby stores and cut down people from all
directions.
</P>
<P>
The scene was covered with bodies, blood and debris, and the
crowd there was chaotic, panic and hysteric as the wounded and
shocked survivors screamed and cried. Ambulances, police and
rescue workers quickly rushed to the site to evacuate the wounded
and collect body parts of some worst hit victims.
</P>
<P>
Police immediately sealed off the market area and ordered
the closure of the shops in order to search for more bombs
with bomb-sniffing dogs, but no other bombs were found.
</P>
<P>
So far, no one has claimed responsibility for the attacks,
though police suspected them to be carried out by anti-Israeli
extremist Palestinian organizations. Suicide bombings in Israel
were usually carried out by two militant Islamic organizations
the Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) and the smaller Islamic
Jihad. From late February to early March last year, they
launched a wave of suicide bombing attacks in public buses
in Jerusalem, Tel Aviv and Ashkelon, killing 62 people and
wounding hundreds others.
</P>
<P>
A large crowd gathered near the scene, many of them were
anxious to know whether any members of their family or relatives
were killed or wounded. Scores of ultra-rightist demonstrators
held a demonstration, shouting "Death to Arabs" and calling for
the government to end the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Police had to escort the Arab workers employed at the market
out of the area for fear that the extremist Jews would carry out
revenge attacks against them. Two leaders of the ultra-rightist
Kache Movement and three other demonstrators were arrested by the
police.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 30 (Xinhua) --
</P>
<P>
Reactions were swiftly coming from all sides. Israeli
government strongly condemned the Palestinian National Authority
(PNA) for refusing to crack down on anti-Israeli terrorism and
even encouraging it. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu held
immediate consulations with senior ministers, including Foreign
Minister David Levy and Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai and
Infrastructure Minister Ariel Sharon.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu's spokesman David Bar-Illan blamed the PNA for the
attacks, warning the peace process could not continue as long as
the terrorism was not eliminated. But he fell short of declaring
to cancel the planned resumption of the Israeli-Palestinian peace
talks within the week.
</P>
<P>
PNA President Yasser Arafat telephoned both Netanyahu and
Israeli President Ezer Weizman to condemn the attacks as "a crime
against the peace process." He offered condolences to the
victims, adding that much more needed to be done to prevent
further terror attacks.
</P>
<P>
However, Netanyahu told Arafat that condolences were not
enough and the PNA should make a U-turn in both his words and
actions by taking concrete measures to stamp out terrorism. In a
news conference held late the afternoon, Netanyahu demanded the
PNA act to crack down not only terrorist organizations, but
also the infrastructure that support them.
</P>
<P>
PNA officials called on Israeli government to act with
sanity and reason and to proceed with the peace process so
to stamp out the terrorism. Chief Palestinian Negotiator Saeb
Erekat said the PNA has been and will be doing 100 percent
to fight terrorism. He said the only answer to terrorism
should be for both Israelis and Palestinians to send out a
strong message by resuming and advancing the peace process.
</P>
<P>
For security reasons, Israeli troops reimposed a total
closure on the West Bank and Gaza Strip, and ordered over
50,000 Palestinians working in Israel to return home. And all
Israelis were barred from entering the Palestinian territories.
</P>
<P>
The bombing attacks also were condemned by international
leaders. U.S. President Bill Clinton called them a "barbarous
act" against innocent people. He called on the PNA to take
concrete actions to crack down on terrorism and increase
security cooperation with Israel. He said the only answer to
terrorism should be deepening determination by both Israel and
the PNA to advance the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Jordanian Foreign Minister Fayez Tarawneh said Jordan condemned
and categorically rejected such acts of terrorism. He also
hoped that the peace process would continue despite the
bombings.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak phoned Netanyahu today to
express condolences and the hope that the peace process would
continue.
</P>
<P>
Today's bombings came at a time when the Palestinians and
Israelis had agreed to resume peace talks this week, giving hope
to break the prolonged deadlock in the peace talks, which have
been stalled since Israel started building the Har Homa
settlement in East Jerusalem in March.
</P>
<P>
The long-term implications of the bombings remained unclear
at the time, but the immediate setback was the cancellation
of a planned visit here tomorrow by U.S. special peace envoy
Dennis Ross on a new round of mediation. Washington announced
to delay Ross' mission shortly after the bombing attacks.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that even if lower-level talks would be
resumed as scheduled, no major progress could be made when
the two sides remained dubious about each other's commitments
to peace.
</P>
<P>
The bombings, worst since Israel's hardline Likud government
came to power over one year ago, also tested Netanyahu's
election promises to bring the nation peace with security.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Condemns Bomb Attack in Jerusalem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus issued a statement today
strongly condemning the bomb attack in Jerusalem earlier in the
day, which left 14 people dead and more than 150 injured.
</P>
<P>
In the statement issued here this evening, the Ministry of
Foreign Affairs said "Cyprus is appalled by today's indiscriminate
terrorist bomb attack against civilians in Jerusalem which
resulted in the loss of so many innocent lives."
</P>
<P>
"Such condemnable acts can never be justified to support any
cause", the ministry said, noting that these acts undermine the
objective of all the parties concerned and aim at putting in
jeopardy the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Ministry said it is confident that "this abhorrent
act will not deter the protagonists from their efforts to
reinvigorate the peace process in the Middle East and to surmount
the hurdles that were put on its way".

<P>
It expressed sympathy to the government and the people of
Israel, as well as profound grief to the families of the victims.

<HEADLINE> Angolan Women Voice Their Demand for Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

</P>
<P>
LUANDA, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of women in the
war-plagued southern African country took to the street today
crying for their long-awaited peace.
</P>
<P>
Carrying placards inscribed with "We Want Peace, Not War",
"Stop Violence", "Build A Beautiful Future For Our Descendants"#,
these women marched to the national congress building of the
country.
</P>
<P>
Many of the demonstrators are women who have lost their
husbands or children in the two decades civil war in Angola.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators walked to the front of the national
congress building where parliament members were having a meeting
and presented their letter for peace.
</P>
<P>
The letter said that the Angolan women who have suffered most
from the war in the country would sacrifice whatever they have
for a final peace, so that their younger generations would no
longer fight each other in the meaningless wars.
</P>
<P>
Analia Pereira, a woman parliament member said that "we, the
mothers who have suffered physically and spiritually in the wars
and lost our children should be safeguards for peace."
</P>
<P>
She said that "Angolan women should, joining hands with
Angolan men, strive for the final peace in the country, and never
allow the tragedy of war to befall on the land again."
</P>
<P>
The peace demonstration was organized to mark the African
Women's Day on July 31. Women in some other cities in the
war-ridden country also held similar activities.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Lebanon Welcomes Lift of US Travel Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon welcomed U.S. Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright's decision to lift a 10-year-old ban on
U.S. citizens' travel to Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri described the decision as
"positive," saying it indicated a "confidence in Lebanon."
</P>
<P>
"Certainly the lift of the travel ban is good, and we call on
U.S. businessmen, who want to invest in Lebanon, to come here and
they will be welcomed and will find new opportunities of
investment in this country," the premier said at a press
conference in his office.
</P>
<P>
He believed that the decision will "positively" affect
Lebanon's economy "since it will encourage Americans of Lebanese
origin to travel to Lebanon and encourage American businessmen,
investors and bankers to come back to Lebanon bringing with them
their families."
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese prime minister also underlined that Lebanon is
"against terrorism" and the Lebanese government will "cooperate
with all friendly countries in order to consolidate the security
in our state."
</P>
<P>
He added that "the lives and security of U.S. citizens will be
assured in Lebanon exactly the same as other nationalities as well
as the Lebanese." He noted that contacts are continuously
conducted between Washington and Beirut for this purpose.
</P>
<P>
The travel ban, imposed in 1987 by the U.S. State Department
following a series of kidnappings of U.S. citizens in Lebanon, has
been automatically renewed every six months.
</P>
<P>
Hariri announced that he was informed earlier today by Albright
of the "decision of the U.S. government and herself" to lift the
ban, one day before a deadline for either retaining or ending the
restrictions.
</P>
<P>
Instead of the ban, Albright said, U.S. citizens "will be
warned (of dangers)" when they want to travel to Lebanon,
according to the Lebanese prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese Foreign Minister Farez Boueiz said that his country
"welcomes the decision to lift the travel ban for which we have
not found any justifications in the recent years after the
re-establishment of stability and security in Lebanon."
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister was quoted by the state-run Lebanese
National News Agency as saying that the U.S. government's decision
will be "comprehensive" and will allow the Lebanese flag-carrier
Middle East Airlines (MEA) to resume flights to the U.S., and the
U.S. consul in Lebanon to issue entry visas.
</P>
<P>
Khalid Mohammed Salam, MEA's director general, noted that the
U.S. decision was a "very positive fruit of the efforts exerted by
the Lebanese government on the issue."
</P>
<P>
He called on the U.S. government "to complete this step with
other practical steps" which will facilitate the MEA to resume
direct flights between Lebanon and the U.S.
</P>
<P>
Islamic fundamentalists in Lebanon were responsible for
abducting U.S. citizens and the U.S. has since demanded a Lebanese
government crackdown on Hezbollah, or Party of God, as a
precondition for lifting the ban.

<HEADLINE> ACP-EU Partnership to Be Based on "Co-operation" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
(by Wang Jinyu)
</P>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan Finance Minister Musalia
Mudavadi said today that the new partnership between
African-Caribbean-Pacific countries and European Union (ACP-EU)
should be based on true "cooperation" rather than on
"assistance".
</P>
<P>
He was speaking at the closing session of the Eastern Africa
Regional Seminar on the Future of the ACP-EU Cooperation held
here between July 28-30.
</P>
<P>
The minister noted that unprecedented changes had taken place
worldwide since the first Lome Convention signed between ACP
countries and EU 22 years ago.
</P>
<P>
One of the changes is that "development assistance seems to
have lost its priority on the political agenda of many European
countries," he told the seminar held to discuss the future ACP-EU
relations after the expiry of the Lome IV Convention.
</P>
<P>
Mudavadi pointed out that a number of donors had indeed
reduced their financial support to the third world, adding that
"it is our urgent duty to be aware of the effects of this trend."
</P>
<P>
He viewed the seminar as "an important step" in the long
process of re-defining, re-structuring and updating the terms of
this partnership established 22 years ago between the ACP
countries and the European Union.
</P>
<P>
In his opinion, the geographical scope and coverage of the
convention should be maintained and consolidated in a future
ACP-EU agreement.
</P>
<P>
The differentiation of aid portfolios should be in accordance
with the needs, strategies and capacities of recipient countries,
he noted.
</P>
<P>
The minister stressed that conditionalities should be a series
of well negotiated, transparent and positive goals rather than a
set of absolute punitive measures applied to ACP countries.
</P>
<P>
This regional seminar was designed to shape the common
position of the eastern African region towards the post-Lome
Convention debate.

<HEADLINE> PLO Official Attacks Netanyahu for Bombings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TUNIS, July 30 (Xinhua) -- A high-ranking official of the
Palestine Liberation Organization has held Israeli government
responsible for the two bomb blasts this afternoon in West
Jerusalem killing 14 people and wounding over 170.
</P>
<P>
Farouk Kaddoumi, director of the PLO Political Department, made
the accusation in a statement issued in Tunis after the suicide
bombings in a busy open-air market of Mahane Yehuda.
</P>
<P>
Kaddoumi said Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his
government are directly responsible for poisoning the atmosphere
between Palestinians and Israelis, for freezing peace, and for the
eruption of such incidents.
</P>
<P>
"We have affirmed from the very outset our desire for peace,
and the Palestinian masses demonstrated in favor of the peace
process. They have even put flowers in gun barrels of Israeli
soldiers as an expression of their overwhelming support of peace,"
Kaddoumi said.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, "the racist Israeli government, ever since it
came to power, has perpetrated provocative acts against the
Palestinian people and has turned its back to the peace process
and to the singed agreements."
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian people are living until this very moment under
siege, suppression and terror, and are being denied the means of
dignified life, he pointed out.

<HEADLINE> UNDP to Focus on Nigeria's Agriculture, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 30 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Development
Program (UNDP) said today it will sharpen its focus on
agriculture and environmental issues in its fifth country program
of assistance in Nigeria from 1997 to 2001.
</P>
<P>
"Environment and natural resources management will be
implemented with agriculture in form of sustainable agriculture,
environment and rural development," a UNDP official said.
</P>
<P>
According to Ogo Okoro, UNDP's national program officer in
charge of environment, issues like conservation, agro-forestry
development, erosion and desertification, municipal waste
management and its conversion into organic fertilizer and
alternative sources of energy will be considered during the
period.
</P>
<P>
The program officer said that land degradation through sheet,
hydraulic and wind erosion, deforestation and pollution are the
major challenges to the country's environment.
</P>
<P>
Some international non-governmental organizations will be
invited to train Nigerians in participatory approaches, she said.
</P>
<P>
The fourth program, from 1992 to 1996, cost three million U.S.
Dollars and developed a blueprint for a national forestry action
plan in conjunction with the Federal Forestry Department and the
World Bank.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Vows to Continue Resistance Against Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese President Elias Hrawi
today vowed that his country will continue military resistance
against Israel until Israeli occupation is eliminated in south
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The president made the remark while commenting on Washington's
decision to lift a ban on U.S. citizens' travel to Lebanon imposed
by U.S. State Department in 1987 following a series of kidnappings
of U.S. citizens in the country.
</P>
<P>
Hrawi was quoted by the state-run Lebanon Radio as saying that
his country "has been combating terrorism with all its strength."
</P>
<P>
The president regretted that U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright and others consider the existence of resistance against
Israel in south Lebanon as "dangerous."
</P>
<P>
He denied that those fighting the Israeli occupation are
terrorists. "Is that not a right for Lebanon to resist when its
land is occupied?" he asked.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or Party of God, accused by
Washington as a terrorist organization, spearheads a guerrilla
warfare in south Lebanon to oust the Israeli occupation forces out
of the occupied land.
</P>
<P>
Hrawi noted that the lift of the travel ban will not only
promote Lebanon's morale, but will also encourage all those who
want to come to Lebanon to see what has been happening since the
end of the 15-year civil war and what has been achieved in the
field of reconstructing infrastructures in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, Albright informed Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik
Hariri of the U.S. government's decision to lift the ban on
travel to Lebanon, a day before a deadline for either retaining or
ending the restrictions.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Cypriots Ask EU Membership Talks Be Put off </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Northern Cyprus leader Rauf
Denktas said today the European Union's negotiations with Cyprus
for its full membership should be postponed to enable
U.N.-brokered direct bi-communal talks to continue.
</P>
<P>
According to reports reaching here today, Denktas said the
decision to demand the postponement of EU-Cyprus membership talks
was taken unanimously by the administration of northern Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
The east Mediterranean island has been divided into Greek
Cypriot south and Turkish Cypriot north since 1974 when Turkey
landed troops to protect Turkish Cypriots following a pro-Athens
coup seeking union with Greece.
</P>
<P>
After the two ethnic groups agreed to hold face-to-face talks
under U.N. sponsorship at the beginning of this month, the EU
executive body European Commission gave the green-light to Cyprus'
full EU membership talks.
</P>
<P>
Denktas requested EU to put off the negotiations for Cyprus'
entry scheduled for 1998. "Otherwise, U.N.-mediated Cyprus talks
will stop," he threatened.
</P>
<P>
Clerides has said the Greek Cypriots would not take part in the
peace talks if the negotiations with EU are postponed.
</P>
<P>
The Cyprus issue has remained unresolved since 1974 and the
Turkish Cypriot side declared unilaterally in 1983 a breakaway
state "the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus," which is
recognized only by Turkey.
</P>
<P>
More than 30,000 Turkish troops are stationed in the northern
part of the divided Mediterranean island to safeguard the security
of the Turkish Cypriots.

<HEADLINE> Hussein Called for Efforts to Prevent Violence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, July 30 (Xinhua) -- King Hussein of Jordan today called
for all efforts to salvage the Middle East peace process and
prevent violence such as this afternoon's suicide bombings in the
West Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The bomb blasts came at a time of frustration about the
stalled peace process, the king said in an address to the
graduate officers from the Royal Award Academy, Radio Jordan
reported.
</P>
<P>
No one knows the consequences of these incidents, he said,
adding minority groups were trying to tide up anti-Jewish
sentiments but they would not succeed.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, a Jordanian government spokesman condemned this
afternoon's suicide bombings in the West Jerusalem as terrorist
activity against the innocent people.
</P>
<P>
Two suicide bombs exploded at 13:15 this afternoon in an open
market in the West Jerusalem, killing 14 people, including the
two bombers and wounding more than 170.
</P>
<P>
This was the first suicide bombing attack since the March 22
suicide bombing of a Tel Aviv cafe and one of the worst terror
attacks against Israel since the peace process began in 1993.
</P>
<P>
The bomb blasts came at a time when the Palestinians and
Israelis had agreed to resume peace talks this week, giving hope
to break the prolonged deadlock in the peace talks, which have
been stalled since Israel started building the Har Homa
settlement in East Jerusalem in March.
</P>
<P>
The long-term implications of the bombings remained unclear at
the time, but the immediate setback was the cancellation of a
planned visit to the region tomorrow by U.S. special peace envoy
Dennis Ross on a new round of mediation. Washington announced to
postpone Ross' mission shortly after the bombing attacks.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that even if lower-level talks between the
Palestinians and the Israelis would be resumed as scheduled, no
major progress could be made when the two sides remained dubious
about each other's commitments to peace.

<HEADLINE> Jordan's Parliamentary Elections to Be Held As </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, July 30 (Xinhua) - Jordan's King Hussein said here today
that parliamentary elections will take place as "constitutionally
scheduled," despite declared boycott by six opposition parties.
</P>
<P>
Radio Jordan quoted the king as saying democracy would
continue in the kingdom despite any opposition while addressing
graduate officers from the Royal Award Academy.
</P>
<P>
The Jordanian government has decided to invite international
observers to oversee the elections due on November 4 in an effort
to defuse uproar from six opposition parties to boycott the
elections.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, the Muslim Brotherhood, a main opposition
party, became the first to declare boycott of the elections.
</P>
<P>
Its general supervisor Abdul Majeed Thneibat said on July 12
that the Press and Publication Law, the one-person, one-vote
election system, the normalization of ties with Israel, and "the
government's measures to marginalize political parties" were the
main reasons behind the party's boycott of the elections.
</P>
<P>
Later, five parties followed suit. They are the Jordan
People's Democratic Party, the Jordan Arab Constitutional Front,
the National Action Front, the Al Ansar and the Islamic Action
Front (IAF), the biggest opposition party in Jordan.
</P>
<P>
The boycott is also supported by some other parties, which have
yet to declare whether they wanted to join in. Opposition parties
now own 23 seats in the 80-member Lower House of Parliament.
</P>
<P>
Multi-party system was revived in the kingdom in 1989 as part
of a political reform launched after widespread riots that were
set off by economic hardships. The protesters called for wider
public participation in decision-making.

UNITED NATIONS, July 30 (Xinhua) -- The Security Council of the
United Nations today welcomed the successful holding of

provided a strong foundation for the people of Liberia to achieve
a durable peace, the re-establishment of constitutional
government, and a return to the rule of law.
</P>
<P>
The council expressed the hope that the successful holding of
election would encourage refugees to exercise their rights of
return, and it called upon the new government to fulfill its
obligations under international law regarding returning refugees.
</P>
<P>
Noting the successful holding of elections represented a
critical step towards economic development, the council urged
the international society to continue to provide support and
assistance to Liberia through this period of reconstruction.

<HEADLINE> CBI Announces Initiatives to Meet Information </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 30 (Xinhua) -- British business needs to work in
new ways if it is to make the most of the opportunities offered by
electronic commerce and the information age, Adair Turner,
director-general of the Confederation of British Industry (CBI),
said today.
</P>
<P>
Launching both the CBI's own website and a new CBI initiative
to spread best practice, Turner said that the UK is well-placed to
be a global leader in the information society.
</P>
<P>
With a total output of 57.6 billion US dollars, growing at
around 7 percent a year, the UK's electronic and IT equipment
sector is the sixth largest in the world and is a major source of
innovation.
</P>
<P>
Eight of the top 20 investors in R&AMP;D in the UK are electronics,
IT or telecommunications companies, said Turner.
</P>
<P>
The markets open to electronic commerce are considerable and
are set to grow at a remarkable pace. Fifty million people in 150
countries are already connected to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that by the year 2000 there will be 250 million
subscribers and the US marketplace alone will be worth 112 billion
US dollars.
</P>
<P>
"Companies need to develop completely new ways of thinking and
acting to take advantage of these new markets," Turner said. "The
overall growth potential is huge, but the way in which these
markets will develop is still very unclear - that means both big
risks, but also big rewards."
</P>
<P>
Turner spelt out the issues business needs to consider as a
result of the rapid growth in information and communication:
</P>
<P>
-- The very rapid development of new technologies;
</P>
<P>
-- The convergence of different technologies --
</P>
<P>
telecommunications, electronics, multimedia and broadcasting;
</P>
<P>
-- The growing global business competition;
</P>
<P>
-- The urgent need for people with the right IT skills and
</P>
<P>
attitudes.
</P>
<P>
Turner said, "It's not enough simply to put information about
yourself on the Internet and think you're participating in the
information age. The potential is there to do your business
electronically -- and that's where the big benefits may well lie."
</P>
<P>
He also announced the setting up of the CBI's information
society forum. This is designed to spread best practice and help
member companies address the implications of the information age.
</P>
<P>
It responds to fast-growing member interest, and will focus on
such topics as technology in the retail supply chain, knowledge
management and valuation, the creative use of technology, as well
as a whole series on the specific challenges facing smaller firms.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Urges Restraint of North Ossetia, Ingushetia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 31 (Xinhua) -- President Boris Yeltsin today urged
restraint of North Ossetia and Ingushetia over their worsening
tensions sparked by a series of clashes recently between ethnic
Ingush and North Ossetians, reported the Itar-Tass News Agency.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin has ordered to draft a decree on priority measures for
normalizing the situation in the Prigorodny District, a disputed
area which used to belong to Ingushetia but now is under control
of North Ossetia, the Itar-Tass quoted Presidential Press
Secretary Sergey Yastrzhembsky as saying.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin is going to mediate between North Ossetian President
Akhsarbek Galazov and Ingush President Ruslan Aushev after he
returns to Moscow early next week from his holiday, Yastrzhembsky
said.
</P>
<P>
Tensions between the two republics, which share a border in
southern Russia, escalated when some Ingush refugees were attacked
by North Ossetians Tuesday night in the Prigorodny District. The
attack was later halted by Russian interior troops.
</P>
<P>
Some Ingush territory, including the Prigorodny District, was
given to the Ossetians during the former Soviet time and many
Ingush were expelled from their home in 1944 to the Kazakh steppes.
</P>
<P>
They were allowed to return to their lands in the late 1950s
but Ossetians objected to their return.
</P>
<P>
Most ethnic Ingush are Muslims who speak a Caucasian language
while Ossetians are mostly Christians who speak an Iranian
language.
</P>
<P>
Vladimir Zorin, chairman of the Duma Committee for the Affairs
of Nationalities today stressed that the conflict between the two
ethnic groups should be settled by peaceful means.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Chairman of the State Duma Mikhail Gutseriyev, who is in
charge of the work on a peaceful settlement of the Ossetian-Ingush
conflict, warned that the worsening of the situation may provoke
bloodshed similar to the one in 1992, when nearly 200 people were
killed in the fighting over the disputed Prigorodny District.

<HEADLINE> South Asian Nations Want Earlier Regional Free Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, July 31 (Xinhua) -- The seven South Asian countries
decided here today to speed up the realization of a South Asian
Free Trade Area (SAFTA).
</P>
<P>
Concluding their first meeting of the Inter-Governmental Group
(IGG) on Trade Liberalization at the Kathmandu-based SAARC
Secretariat, the seven member countries decided to hold two more
meetings this year to complete the deliberations in the third
round of trade negotiations by January 1998.
</P>
<P>
SAARC Secretary-General Naeem U. Hasan has said that the third
round was of crucial importance as it would put the South Asian
Preferential Trading Arrangement (SAPTA) on the fast track for
realizing the SAFTA by 2001, as decided in a May summit by members
of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC),
which groups India, Nepal, Bhutan, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka
and the Maldives.
</P>
<P>
The three-day meeting, held at the SAARC Secretariat, marks the
beginning of the third round of trade negotiations among the SAARC
countries, said a press release issued by the secretariat.
</P>
<P>
Representatives from the seven countries conducted in-depth
multilateral and bilateral negotiations with a view to expanding
the list of products and deepening the tariff concessions on
products already covered under the SAPTA.
</P>
<P>
They reviewed the progress achieved so far in the
implementation of the SAPTA agreement.
</P>
<P>
They recommended that the studies on issues concerning SAFTA,
non-tariff barriers, discriminatory practices and trade imbalances
among the SAARC members should be completed quickly by the
Inter-Governmental Expert Group (IGEG) on Transition to SAFTA, the
release said.
</P>
<P>
They urged the IGEG to expedite formulation of an action plan
on SAFTA which would serve as a blueprint for successive rounds of
trade negotiations by the IGG.
</P>
<P>
The representatives agreed that it is necessary to provide
special and more favorable concessions to the least developed
member countries, namely Bangladesh, Bhutan, Nepal and the
Maldives.
</P>
<P>
It was also agreed that direct bilateral talks and frequent
exchange of visits should be organized to promote trade in the
region with a view to realizing the SAFTA by the targeted date.
</P>
<P>
The seven countries also decided to coordinate their approaches
on vital issues concerning trade and tariffs in the international
fora like the World Trade Organization and World Customs
Organization to effectively project and protect their collective
interests, the release said.

<HEADLINE> US Leads Europe in Job Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, July 31 (Xinhua) -- Europe's slow economic growth and
underdeveloped service sector are proving to be major barriers to
European job growth, according to a noted economist in New York.
</P>
<P>
While the U.S. job machine continues to generate 2 to 3 million
jobs a year and reduce unemployment in a fast-growing labor force,
European employment growth is stagnant and the labor force has not
grown since 1991, said Gail D. Fosler, senior vice president and
chief economist of the Conference Board, whose analysis appeared
in a recent newsletter of the research group.
</P>
<P>
Her analysis challenges the widely-held thesis that vast
differences between the U.S. and European job markets are due to
the greater flexibility of the U.S. labor market, greater numbers
of small businesses in the U.S., and the creation of a large
number of low-wage jobs.
</P>
<P>
Fosler said that all three rationales are either "misstated or
misinterpreted." She noted, "The United States does have a
somewhat more flexible labor market than Europe, especially more
geographic mobility. But Europe has almost as much job creation
and job destruction as the U.S. and actually has more small
businesses than the U.S., even though they tend to be
micro-enterprises less well capitalized than those in the U.S."
</P>
<P>
She said that in the U.S., the pace of job growth in managerial
and professional specialty occupations, which includes computer
programmers, financial analysts, technicians and other high-tech
fields, is twice that in the lowest-wage occupations."
</P>
<P>
In addition, she said, the United States has many more
self-employed workers, while Europe actually has more small and
medium enterprises with salaried workers. The U.S. economy has 22
million small and medium enterprises, compared with 18 million in
Europe. Of these 22 million, 16.5 million are self-employed
workers with no employees -- more than 50 percent greater than the
number in Europe.
</P>
<P>
The economist also pointed to the gap of economic growth which
she said also led to job growth difference. "When an economy
doesn't grow, it is very hard for businesses to succeed," she
said.

<HEADLINE> Russia Won't Participate in Capturing War Crime Suspects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 31 (Xinhua) -- A senior official of the Russian
Foreign Ministry said today that Russian troops in Bosnia will
never participate in missions aimed at capturing war crime
suspects in the area.
</P>
<P>
Gennady Tarasov, Director of the Press Bureau of the ministry,
said that Russia disapprove such missions because they are beside
the real objective of peace keeping of these troops.
</P>
<P>
Tarasov made the comments in the wake of a series of warnings
from international officials of a tough, new approach to nabbing
suspects in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, NATO's secretary-general Javier Solana pledged
that all war crime suspects will be behind bars before the
international community leaves Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
Tarasov stressed that Russia believed that war criminals should
be punished, but that all related issues should be settled by
cooperation between all factions in Bosnia and the internation
tribunal under international laws.
</P>
<P>
He warned against actions that might worsen the trouble in the
area, and criticized the move by the British troops on suspects in
Bosnia early this month which triggered condemnation from the
local people.
</P>
<P>
Actions like this will not only escalate tension in the area,
but may also put into doubt the Bosnian local election scheduled
for September this year, he said.

<HEADLINE> Cypriot Fisherman Sentenced for Transmitting AIDS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, July 31 (Xinhua) -- A Greek Cypriot fisherman was
sentenced today to 15 months' imprisonment for knowingly
transmitting AIDS to his British lover.
</P>
<P>
Pavlos Georgiou, 40, from the southeastern coastal resort of
Ayia Napa, was charged under a 50-year-old British colonial law
enacted to check the spread of cholera and typhoid.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus gained independence from the British colonial rule in
1960. Under the law, the fisherman had faced a maximum sentence of
two years in jail, a fine of 1,500 Cyprus pounds (about 3,000
U.S. dollars), or both.
</P>
<P>
Georgiou was found guilty by court on Tuesday of not telling
Janette Pink, 45, from England, that he is HIV-positive during a
two-year love affair from 1994 to 1996.
</P>
<P>
Georgiou's wife died of AIDS-related illness in 1994,
</P>
<P>
During the three-month trial, Georgiou had denied Pink's
accusation that he lied to her about having the disease and had
maintained that Pink was fully aware of his condition..
</P>
<P>
Pink, a mother of two, found out she was HIV-positive in
October, 1994, but stayed with Georgiou until July 1996 when she
developed full-blown AIDS.
</P>
<P>
She then returned to England for medical treatment and decided
to report Georgiou to the Cypriot authorities.
</P>
<P>
Legal analysts here said the jail sentence is "stiff" in view
of the health condition of Georgiou, who, as a father of four and
the sole support of his family, is dying of the disease.
</P>
<P>
Pink, on the other hand, is said to be in a "terrible"
condition.
</P>
<P>
Judge Antonis Liatsos said the sentence was passed as "a
deterrent because of the seriousness of the case and because the
courts have a duty to protect the health of the people."

<HEADLINE> France Launches New Debate on Immigration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 31 (Xinhua) -- A new debate on France's immigration
policy is going on in the country following an earlier suggestion
by Prime Minister Lionel Jospin's Socialist government that two
tough immigration laws should be scrapped.
</P>
<P>
A committee in charge of re-writing the two laws, passed under
two former conservative governments, today presented a report to
Jospin.
</P>
<P>
The committee, consisting of 18 law experts and headed by
political scientist Patrick Weil, suggested that France mix
"pragmatism" with "humanity" when adopting a new immigration
policy.
</P>
<P>
Entitled "For a just and efficient policy of immigration,"
the report held that immigration itself is a positive thing and
that France was once a immigrants' country from 14th century until
1974, when it was attacked by economic recession and unemployment
worsening.
</P>
<P>
The report suggested that France give full nationality to all
the children born in the country from foreign parents, if they
have lived for years here before the age of 18.
</P>
<P>
It also urged the government to ease restriction on visits and
stay in France by foreigners whose families live in France,
encourage foreign students and scholars to study and do research
in French colleges, provide asylum to "freedom fighters," stop
arresting and imprisoning foreigners who are found to be living in
secret places.
</P>
<P>
The report has brought about various responses from the
French society. Le Figaro said in a commentary today that the
geographical situation of France today is totally different from
that of the 19th century, when the country absorbed waves of
foreign immigrants from Poland, Italy, Belgium and Spain, and the
immigrant population have become a "substitution population"
living on the outskirts of the French society.
</P>
<P>
The paper Liberation said that the report's suggestion of easing
restriction on providing political asylum is intended to help the
Algerians who are at odds with both the government and Islamic
militants at home.
</P>
<P>
The National Front (FN) party of Jean-Marie Le Pen strongly
condemned the Weil report, while reiterating its call for closing
France's door to foreigners.
</P>
<P>
"One should finish with the aberrations of the right of soil
and the folly of family reunion, one should reestablish the
controls at frontiers, denounce the Maastricht treaty, apply the
principle of national preference in employment, housing, and
family and social allowances," FN said in a communique released
today.

<HEADLINE> US Ambassador: Peace Talks Should Continue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 31 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Ambassador to Egypt Edward
Walker said after a meeting with Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa today that the Mideast peace talks should continue.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. diplomat made the statement a day after two bombs tore
through a crowded fruit and vegetable market in west Jerusalem
killing at least 15 people and wounding over 170 others.
</P>
<P>
Walker expressed regret over the bombings, saying that they not
only construe "an aggression against Israelis but also an attack
on the peace process as a whole, on the Palestinian National
Authority, the Palestinians and on Chairman Yasser Arafat."
</P>
<P>
"The purpose behind this incident is to torpedo the peace
process and smash the Palestinian government. It is important for
all of us to resume the peace process talks after the period of
mourning for the victims," he said.
</P>
<P>
When asked if the assault stemmed from a feeling of frustration
and desperation on the part of Palestinians over the freeze
in the peace process, the U.S. diplomat said there is "no excuse
justifying such an attack under any circumstance."
</P>
<P>
Palestinian-Israeli talks have been deadlocked for four months
over the Israeli decision to build thousands of new Jewish homes
in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton has condemned the suicide bombings
in Jerusalem and urged the Palestinian National Authority to take
more decisive steps to improve security.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Mideast envoy Dennis Ross postponed his planned mission to
the region until the mourning for the victims is over. Israel has
decided to suspend talks with Palestinians after the attack.

GENEVA, July 31 (Xinhua) -- Wary of upsetting two of Europe's
mightiest clubs, FC Barcelona and Internazionale of Milan,
soccer's world governing body FIFA has deferred setting a final
transfer fee for Brazilian superstar Ronaldo until September.
</P>
<P>
After the two sides failed to reach agreement earlier this
week, FIFA had said it would make its own proposal Wednesday on
the sale of the 20-year-old Brazilian from the Spanish to the
Italian side.
</P>
<P>
FIFA spokesman Mario Schneider Thursday said in Zurich: "Inter
Milan's offer and Barcelona's idea were too far apart, so FIFA
decided not to make a proposal."
</P>
<P>
Schneider said the matter would instead be left to a special
FIFA committee, which will meet in advance of the U-17
championships in Cairo early September.

<P>
BEIJING, July 31 (Xinhua) -- The first Beijing-Macao Students'
Summer Camp opened here today on the campus of Beijing Normal
University.
</P>
<P>
Some 80 high school and college students, including 50 from
Macao, participated in the camp. In the coming week they are
scheduled to watch the national flag-raising ceremony on Tiananmen
Square, visit the Palace Museum, the Great Wall and Qinghua
University.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the opening ceremony, Wei Yu, vice-minister of the

help young students from Macao and Beijing know about their
motherland, foster their sense of patriotism and increase their
friendship.
</P>

Chan Sao Iam, a representative from the Macao group, said the
young generation of Macao shoulders a significant historical

competition in history.
</P>
<P>
About 3,000 athletes from every corner of the globe will

effort to win the world to back up its bid for holding the 2004
Olympics.
</P>
<P>
The previous team entry record in history was set at the 1996
Olympic Games with 197 nations and regions, while the previous
championships best was 191 teams in 1995. The First World
Athletics Championships in 1983 drew 153 nations and regions.
</P>
<P>
The championships will open at the Panathinaikon Stadium, the
birth place of the modern Olympic movement 101 years ago. The

<HEADLINE> Fredericks Aims to Win a Sprint Double </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, July 31 (Xinhua) -- Frankie Fredericks of Namibia, who
romped two silver medals in both the 100 and 200 meters at last
year's Olympics, threw down his grautlet to his rivals by claiming
that he wants to take a sprint double triumph at the 6th World
Athletics Championships starting here tomorrow night.
</P>
<P>
"My goal is to win the gold medals in the 100m and 200m
races. In such a great organisation you have to be totally
concentrated. I believe that I am in a very good form right now to
achieve my goal," said the 30-year-old sprinter here today.
</P>
<P>
Fredericks is one of the favourites to win the dash events in
the competition. His best time this year is 9.91 seconds in 100m,
and 19.90 in 200m. The year's leading sprinter is Ato Boldon of
Trinida who ran 9.89 and 19.77 seconds early this month.
</P>
<P>
Donovan Bailey of Canada, world and Olympic 100 meters
champion, ranks sixth on the year's list at 9.97 seconds.
</P>
<P>
Maurice Greene and Jon Drummond, both from the United States,
are also posing threats in the 100 meters.
</P>
<P>
At the news conference here today, Bolton and Greene thought a
record between 9.78-9.79 will probably decide the gold medal in
the 100m at the championships. They said the weather conditions
ideal and quality of the track here especially favourable for an
unprecedented year in the 100m race.
</P>
<P>
"I feel physically and psychologically ready," said Ato, who
won two bronze medals at the Atlanta Olympics last year. "Besides
if I wasn't ready I wouldn't even have come to Athens. There is a
great difference between European meetings and a world class field
like the championships," added the 24-year-old.
</P>
<P>
Greene, who won the U.S. Championships at 9.90 and beat Bailey,
Boldon and Fredericks last month, said: "I feel obliged to do the
best possible thing for my country, and that will be no less than
the gold medal. I believe that I am in a great form and ready for
a world record."
</P>
<P>
The men's 100 meters final will be held on August 2.

<HEADLINE> NATO Plays Key Role in Polish Flood Relief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, July 31 (Xinhua) -- The North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO) has been playing a key role in the Polish
flood relief work, a NATO press release said here today.
</P>
<P>
The military alliance has served as a switchboard between
the United Nations Department of Humanitarian Affairs and the
pre-designated emergency points of contact in NATO members and
countries in the Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council, the release
said.
</P>
<P>
NATO, which announced earlier this month to take in Poland,
Hungary and the Czech Republic as new members, has helped to seek
aid for rescue and recovery equipment such as pumps, generators
and water purifiers.
</P>
<P>
14 of the NATO and partner countries have responded by
providing financial assistance alongside the rescue and recovery
equipment to those locations in Poland in greatest need.
</P>
<P>
Successive heavy rains in Poland earlier this month submerged
some 621,000 hectares of land, of which a third is still under
water.
</P>
<P>
And at least 50,000 Poles have become homeless because of the
flood, according to Polish government spokesman Krzysztof Pomes.

<HEADLINE> IAAF Reduces Drug-Ban From Four To Two Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, July 31 (Xinhua) -- The International Amateur Athletic
Federation (IAAF) reduced the suspension on drug-taking athletes
from four years to two here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The IAAF Congress voted by 112 to 56 for the move, although the
English and Canadian delegates strongly opposed the change.
</P>
<P>
They also agreed to end the automatic three months ban on
athletes caught taking stimulants. Instead they will be given a
public warning.
</P>
<P>
IAAF President Primo Nebiolo said the IAAF had to reduce the
punishment because of the threats of legal action from the United
States. Germany, Spain, France and Russia have refused to
implement the four-year ban.
</P>
<P>
The 74-year-old Nebiolo stressed that it was up to the
individual federations to decide whether to impose longer bans or
not if their national law allowed them to.
</P>
<P>
Attempts to have the ban reduced to two years at Gothenburg in
1995 failed but there has been growing pressure within the IAAF
to try and avoid costly court battles by halving the ban.
</P>
<P>
In a bid to crack down on cheating at least 300 dope tests will
be carried out during the upcoming World Championships which begin
here on Saturday.

<HEADLINE> People's Daily Issues Editorial To Mark Army's Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 31 (Xinhua) -- China's leading newspaper, the
People's Daily, will carry an editorial tomorrow to mark the 70th
anniversary of the founding of the Chinese People's Liberation
Army (PLA).
</P>
<P>
The PLA is an armed group led by the Communist Party of China
to carry out revolutionary and political duties. It is also a
strong pillar of the people's democratic dictatorship and is
an important guarantee for national security, social stability and
the unification of the motherland, the editorial says.
</P>
<P>
Over the past 70 years, the PLA has adhered to the guidelines
and principles of the Communist Party of China and has played an
important role in overthrowing the three big mountains
(imperialism, feudalism and bureaucrat-capitalism, which weighed
like mountains on the backs of the Chinese people before
liberation), founding New China, safeguarding the sacred
territories of the motherland, protecting the socialist
modernization, reform and opening drive, and promoting the
peaceful reunification of the motherland and the realization of
the smooth return of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The paper praises the PLA's participation in the country's
technological progress, industrial and agricultural production,
poverty-relief efforts and struggles against natural disasters.
</P>
<P>
The editorial calls on the army to adhere to Deng Xiaoping's
theory on army building and meet President Jiang Zemin's demand
that the troops "be qualified politically and competent
militarily, have a fine work style, be strictly disciplined and be
assured of adequate logistical support."
</P>
<P>
The principle that "the Party commands the gun" must be
followed, it stresses.
</P>
<P>
It emphasizes the need to improve the quality of the army and
step up its modernization drive, and to further reinforce the
unity between the army and the government, and the army and the
people. The relationship between economic and defense sectors must
be properly handled.
</P>
<P>
Peace and development are now the primary goals throughout the
world, but since hegemonism and power politics still exist, the
Chinese army must do more to modernize and standardize itself, the
editorial says.

management style, and one special spoonful of salt.
</P>
<P>
Xu's rags to riches story begins with his life as a peasant in
Zhejiang Province, east China, and ends with his ownership of the Chuanhua
Group, regarded as the most influential privately-owned enterprise
in the province.
</P>
<P>
When Xu fell seriously ill at the age of 24, his family
couldn't handle the high medical costs. In a money-making scheme
to pay the bills, Xu's father gave his life savings of 2,000 yuan
(about 240 US dollars) to an experienced cook to develop a
powdered soup mixture which the two Xus planned to sell
door-to-door, traveling by tricycle.
</P>
<P>
The soup turned a profit and the Xus decided to work
independently, but the cook refused to part with his secret
recipe.
</P>
<P>
One day, young Xu saw him add a spoonful of white powder to the
soup to thicken the mixture. Xu hired a technician in Hangzhou to
analyze the soup and for 2,000 yuan learned the identity of the
mystery ingredient: ordinary table salt.
</P>
<P>
Xu says this high-priced folly led him to establish his own
chemical firm nine years later.
</P>
<P>
"I came to understand that I could get rich only by applying
science and technology in production," Xu said. "From then on, I
made up my mind to build my own business."
</P>
<P>
But this was a distant dream for Xu, who was in poor health,
had limited funds and only simple equipment.

<P>
Under the guidance of some experts in organic chemistry, Xu set
up a workshop in his home and developed ten new products in
1988. That year he earned 150,000 yuan, which enabled him to pay
his debts and build a factory.
</P>
<P>
In 1990, he began to tackle the technical problems of removing
greasy dirt from fabric, and invented a detergent specially to
fight grime. The new product, called "901 Super Detergent," won a
gold medal at an international fair and netted a profit of over
one million yuan in 1991.
</P>
<P>
With his earnings, Xu expanded his firm and named it after his
father, Chuanhua.
</P>
<P>
The Chuanhua Group currently has technical and economic ties
with five countries and regions including the United States, Japan
and Germany. Twenty-one percent of Chuanhua's 500 employees are
college graduates; 20 of them hold leading management positions.
</P>
<P>
The group has developed scores of high-tech products, among
them the well-known "901 Super Detergent" that has made a profit
of over 10 million yuan since 1990.
</P>
<P>
The group's profits and taxes topped 21 million yuan in 1995.
Its annual sales volume is expected to top one billion yuan by
2000. And Xu has invested 70 million yuan to build a detergent
plant, the first phase of which is expected to be completed by the
end of this year.
</P>
<P>
To compete with other domestic and international companies, Xu
manages his company the modern way. Compared with the traditional
"iron bowl" system which secured life-long employment in some
Chinese enterprises, Xu initiated a "glass bowl" distribution
system, under which workers are paid according to the quality and
quantity of their work, and their wages are made public.
</P>
<P>
As a further incentive, any technician working for Chuanhua may
be rewarded for inventing a new product, and will receive a higher
bonus if the item is popular on the market.

<HEADLINE> German Mediation Panel Fails to Agree on Tax Reform Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, July 31 (Xinhua) -- A German mediation panel, comprising
parliamentary members from both the ruling and opposition parties,
failed today to agree on a tax reform package proposed by
Chancellor Helmut Kohl.
</P>
<P>
The panel, however, agreed to abolish the business capital tax
in western Germany in 1997 and not to levy it in eastern Germany.
</P>
<P>
The 1998-99 tax reform plan was designed to boost Germany's
competitiveness as a business location, which would result in an
annual net tax-cut of 30 billion marks (17.6 billion U.S.
dollars).
</P>
<P>
It was forwarded to the mediation panel after being rejected by
the main opposition Social Democrats (SPD) in the SPD-dominated
Bundesrat, the upper house of parliament.
</P>
<P>
The SPD had previously vowed to block the reform bill, calling
it socially unjust and lacking in solid financial basis. And Kohl,
deeming the bill as the best opportunity to boost investment and
jobs, had accused the Social Democrats of "treason" against the
over 4 million unemployed in Germany.
</P>
<P>
With the hope that a compromise deal could save the tax reform
bill, a major move of the government, Kohl had offered a series of
concessions to the SPD in a last-minute effort during
negotiations, but to no avail.
</P>
<P>
The SPD had also thwarted Kohl's many other initiatives this
year. Today's results were seen as a major political setback for
Kohl, whose popularity, as opinion polls showed, went already
behind his possible SPD rivals in the elections scheduled for
September 1998.
</P>
<P>
Kohl has been German Chancellor since 1982 and is seeking a
fifth four-year term in the upcoming elections.
</P>
<P>
The government's failure in seeking a tax system overhaul
provoked fierce criticism from the business.
</P>
<P>
Wendelin Wiedeking, managing board chairman of Germany's luxury
carmaker Porsche AG, sharply attacked Kohl on Wednesday. "One must
not and cannot rule a state like this," he said.
</P>
<P>
"To me and many of my entrepreneurial colleagues, this
government has become very questionable," he was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on today's results, a German industry leader told
the press that it was "a serious setback for Germany as a venue
for industrial enterprises."
</P>
<P>
Germany's biggest companies are investing in countries where
taxes are lower.

<HEADLINE> Army Should Stick to Deng's Socialist Theory: Jiang (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 31 (Xinhua) -- The People's Liberation Army (PLA)
must hold the banner of Deng Xiaoping's theory of building
socialism with Chinese characteristics high, Chinese president
Jiang Zemin said here today.
</P>
<P>
Jiang, who is also general secretary of the Central Committee
of the Communist Party of China (CPC) and chairman of the Central
Military Commission (CMC), made the remark at a rally in Beijing's
Great Hall of the People to mark the 70th anniversary of the PLA,
where he said that China is witnessing an important historical
period of continuing the reforms, opening up, and the
modernization drive as the 21st century approaches.
</P>
<P>
"We must have a powerful army and consolidate our national
defense in order to safeguard unity and the safety of the country
and to promote world peace and stability," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
The army must maintain a clear view of both the domestic and
international situations, he said, urging the army to be vigilant
in peace time, and strengthen their sense of responsibility and
mission, and launch a full-scale military development effort.
</P>
<P>
We must endeavor to create a new phase of the army's
revolutionization, modernization, and regularization in accordance
with the overall needs of being qualified politically and
competent militarily, having a fine style of work, being strictly
disciplined and being assured of adequate logistic support, he
said.

<HEADLINE> Army Should Stick to Deng's Socialist Theory: Jiang (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After recalling the PLA's history, Jiang said that the 70-year
history has proven that the PLA is loyal to the Party and the
people, and has the courage to overcome all difficulties and to
overpower all enemies. The PLA is an army with lofty ideals, moral
integrity, a good education, and strong sense of discipline.
</P>
<P>
Jiang emphasized that the reason the PLA has become a great
army is that it has always abided by the basic principle of the
Party's absolute leadership. It is an armed force that has
fulfilled political tasks assigned by the Party, stood firmly on
the Party's side, receiving orders from the Party since the day it
was established, said Jiang.
</P>
<P>
"The idea of the Party's absolute leadership over the army has
taken root in all officers and soldiers," he noted, adding that a
system has been formed that guarantees the Party's absolute
leadership over the army.
</P>
<P>
Party committees at all levels in the armed forces have played
a leadership role. Grass-roots party branches have acted as
fighting forces. The CPC members have played the role of vanguard
and model. "All of these have made the PLA a battle-tested
militant collective," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
The CPC will draw up a strategic plan for major issues like
reforms, development, and stability at the forthcoming 15th
National Congress of the CPC.
</P>
<P>
"Our future is bright, and our tasks are both glorious and
arduous," said Jiang. "Let's be closely united and make an effort
to build our country into a prosperous and strong, democratic,
civilized and modernized socialist country, and build our army
into a powerful, modernized and regularized revolutionary army,
under the guidance of Deng's theory of building socialism with
Chinese characteristics and the basic principles of the Party."

<HEADLINE> Bronze Age Road Found In Britain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 31 (Xinhua) -- A wooden road thought to have been
built to allow farming on salt marshes 3,000 years ago has been
discovered on the bank of the Humber estuary in northern England,
the Daily Telegraph reported today.
</P>
<P>
Parts of the 20-yard long trackway have been so well preserved
by the mud that it provides significant clues to Bronze Age
woodworking techniques.
</P>
<P>
The find was made south of the village of Melton three weeks
ago by archaeologists from Hull University. The trackway is made
from branches woven into a "hurdle" and held in place by sharpened
wooden stakes.
</P>
<P>
Both its location, an area rich in Bronze Age remains, and the
axe marks on the wood suggest that it dates from around 1000 BC.
</P>
<P>
In the past, only one trackway of a similar age has been found
in northern England.

BEIJING, July 31 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng said here
this afternoon that the current visit of Abdul-Salam Abubakar,
Nigerian chief of defense staff and member of Nigeria's
Provisional Ruling Council, will help strengthen the friendly
cooperation between the two countries and their armed forces.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting with Abubakar, Li said, the official visit by
Abubakar, who was asked to make the trip by Nigerian head of state
and chairman of the Provisional Ruling Council, Sani Abacha, fully
shows that the Nigerian Government attaches great importance to
the friendship between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
He welcomed the senior military delegation of Nigeria, who came
to China before the 70th anniversary of the founding of the
Chinese People's Liberation Army, which falls on August 1.
</P>
<P>
The Sino-Nigerian relations have been developing smoothly, Li
said. The exchange of visits between leaders of the two
countries in recent years has deepened their mutual understanding
and friendship, he added.
</P>
<P>
Li said his trip to Nigeria this May was successful albeit
short.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria, as a big power in Africa, is playing a positive role
in the international affairs and the regional affairs of Africa,
Li pointed out, adding that China appreciates the efforts of
Nigeria in maintaining a consolidated Africa and promoting
regional cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Abubakar said the Nigerian leaders believe that it is important
to further the Nigeria-China relations.
</P>
<P>
A key task of the delegation was to step up the friendly
cooperation between the two countries and armies, according to
Abubakar.
</P>
<P>
Abubakar said his country has admiration and respect for
China's role in international affairs.

CANBERRA, July 31 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar finished

HONG KONG, July 31 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Monetary Authority
began to issue 100 million new coins from this week to make up the
shortfall of working coins.
</P>

The new coins have seven denominations, of which the 10 cents,

The queen's-head coins are being retrieved by banks and will be

The return of Hong Kong to China aroused a rush for coins with
the head of Queen Elizabeth and many coins had gone into private
collections, resulting in a shortage of coins at banks and
retailers.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Monetary Authority said the new issues will
be sufficient to meet circulation demands.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Rally For PLA Anniversary (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A streamer hung opposite the rostrum reading "Rally closely
around the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the
core and strive to build a powerful, modernized, regular
revolutionary army."
</P>
<P>
Also present were revolutionary veterans, who made a great
contribution to the founding of new China, representatives from
various circles, and army, naval, and air force officers and men.
</P>
<P>
Delivering an important speech amid warm applause, Jiang told
of the PLA's history since its founding 70 years ago and the
army's great contribution in the Chinese revolution and the
undertakings after the founding of the new China in 1949.
</P>
<P>
He said the army's glorious 70-year history shows that the PLA
is loyal to the party and the people, that it braves all
difficulties and can defeat all enemy troops, that it has lofty
ideals, moral integrity, good education, and a strong sense of
discipline.
</P>
<P>
Jiang pointed out that the glorious history of the PLA is
inseparable from the great names of comrade Mao Zedong and comrade
Deng Xiaoping.
</P>
<P>
Comrade Mao Zedong, who was one of the main founders of the
PLA, put forward a set of principles for building the new type of
people's army during the course of the Chinese revolutionary
struggle, he said.
</P>
<P>
After the founding of the new China, he put forward the guiding
principles of building national defense and modernizing national
defense. Mao's military thought is an important part of Mao
Zedong thought, which is a creative development of the military
theory of Marxism by the Chinese Communist Party.
</P>
<P>
Deng Xiaoping's thoughts on army building during the new period
were an inheritance and development of Mao Zedong's military
thought, and an important part of the theory of building socialism
with Chinese characteristics and a long-term guiding principle for
our army's modernization drive.
</P>
<P>
Jiang emphasized that building the army and national defense
are the common task of the party and the Chinese people of
all nationalities and that it is a fine tradition to build the
army and the national defense by relying on people.
</P>
<P>
Jiang called finally on the party, the army, and all people
across the country to unite closely together under the guidance of
the Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese
characteristics and the party's basic line, working hard to build
the army into a powerful, modernized, and regular revolutionary
army, and the country into a prosperous, democratic, civilized,
and modernized socialist country.

<HEADLINE> Macao Security Problem Not Serious: Governor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, July 31 (Xinhua) -- Macao Governor Vasco Rocha Vieira
has said that Macao's security is not in a serious situation or
without control, a press release from the Government Information
Office said today.
</P>
<P>
The governor made the remark Wednesday following a shooting
incident at a hotel and an incendiary gadget attack on the garden
of the Government Palace in the morning.
</P>
<P>
"Although some criminal cases occurred recently, it is not
right to consider Macao a place unsafe or out of control," the
governor was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The shooting incident by three or four masked gunmen at about
2:00 (local time) Wednesday morning shocked Macao residents as a
sign of a new wave of triad fighting. Three people, a Filipino
security guard and two Portuguese engineers, were wounded in the
shooting.
</P>
<P>
The governor said that Macao police are determined to crack
down on and stop organized crimes and that "citizens should remain
 calm."
</P>
<P>
"The shooting incident that happened in the morning might
happen anywhere in the world," he said. "I do not think Macao's
overall security is jeopardized."
</P>
<P>
But he urged local citizens to cooperate with the police and
offer them relevant information.
</P>
<P>
In addition, he said Macao will also strengthen cooperation
with security organs in China's inland area, Hong Kong and the
Interpol in the fight against crimes.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Army Being Streamlined To Produce More Efficient Force </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 31 (Xinhua) -- President Jiang Zemin said here
today that cutting the numbers and improving the quality of the
People's Liberation Army (PLA) is a basic principle of its
modernization drive.
</P>
<P>
Jiang, who is also general secretary of the the Central
Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and chairman of the
Central Military Commission, made the remarks at a gathering
marking the 70th anniversary of the founding of the PLA today.
</P>
<P>
Streamlining the army with Chinese characteristics is the right
choice for China in military modernization, he said, emphasizing
that quality is an international trend with technology being
widely used in the military and that the Chinese army should have
a policy of quality improvement in all respects.
</P>
<P>
"Officers and soldiers should learn more about technology and
modern warfare," he said, and that the structure of the army
should be improved in line with strategic principles in the new
era and that training of soldiers and military and other college
students should be reformed .
</P>
<P>
Management of the army should be improved so that the army will
be better disciplined. And as for the relationship between
modernizing the military and economic construction, the country
should focus on economic development and the modernization of the
military forces give support to that.
</P>
<P>
With a growing economy, Jiang said, the country will increase
investment in national defence, improving military equipment and
the army's living standards.

<HEADLINE> Tung Underlines Two Crucial Factors for HK Success </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 31 (Xinhua) -- Tung Chee Hwa, chief executive
of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR), today
underlined the rule of law and the free market economy as two
"critical success factors" for Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a luncheon give by the Australian Chamber of
Commerce at the Grand Hyatt Hotel, Tung stressed that the rule of
law must be preserved by all means and it will be preserved by all
 means.
</P>
<P>
"All that I do, all the (Hong Kong SAR) government does, must
be and will be in accordance with the law, because we know that
the rule of law is essential to the continued success of Hong
Kong," he said.
</P>
<P>
Touching on another crucial factor for Hong Kong's success --
the free market economy, Tung said: "We let the market take the
lead in setting its own parameters while government intervention
is kept to a minimum."
</P>
<P>
"We have some of the world's largest foreign currency reserves,
 we have the busiest container port in the world and the busiest
international air freight throughput," Tung said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Hong Kong has an annual Gross Domestic Product
(GDP) per capita higher than many Western nations.
</P>
<P>
"One of the major reasons for our remarkable economic success
is undoubtedly Hong Kong's industrious, flexible and skilled
workforce," Tung said. "This, combined with our entrepreneurial
spirit, has enabled a gradual and smooth shift from a
manufacturing-based economy to one based on the provision of
services."
</P>
<P>
Tung also stressed that the Hong Kong SAR government has a
responsibility to ensure those, who cannot help themselves, live a
 decent and dignified life. It also must help those, who can help
themselves, with on-the-job training and help them to learn new
skills to meet the demands of the market, he added.

industry is in great danger and needs creativity, the head of the
new film and television school has said.
</P>
<P>
Dean Professor Richard Woolley said Hong Kong's film industry
is one of the world's biggest, but is in danger, the South China

"We want to help it prepare with creative ideas and skills when
 competition from Hollywood is so great," he was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said revolutionary changes had been introduced to degree
programs to give graduates a variety of career choices. The
courses stress a cooperative approach to the creative process.
</P>

The school offers 30 places in a diploma course, while more
than 250 students are competing for 24 degree places.
</P>
<P>
The report said figures show that local box office receipts
plummeted 27 percent last year, from 770 million HK dollars (98.72
 million US dollars) in 1995 to 560 million HK dollars (71.79
million US dollars).

of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR), said today
that the past month had been "very important" for Hong Kong as its
 people became the masters of their own destiny for the first time.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a luncheon given by the Australian Chamber of

a small milestone for Hong Kong, since it marks the end of the
first month of existence of the Hong Kong SAR.
</P>
<P>
"This past month has been very important for Hong Kong and its
people because it has given us a chance to actually put into
practice those concepts about which we have heard so much -- that
is 'one country, two systems' and 'Hong Kong people ruling Hong
Kong,'" he said.
</P>
<P>
He said there had been no big change in Hong Kong since the
handover on July 1. "It is business as usual."
</P>
<P>
"What has changed is that Hong Kong has become a part of China
and there is immense pride that this has happened," he added.
</P>
<P>
There is "immense confidence" that Hong Kong's tomorrow will be
 even better, Tung said. He stressed the importance of maintaining
 and building Hong Kong's role as an international trade and
finance center and the need to make further efforts to ensure the
continued success of Hong Kong.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria, Chad Urge Liberia to Foster Unity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 31 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria and Chad have urged
Liberia's President-Elect Charles Taylor to take urgent steps
toward achieving genuine national reconciliation in the
war-ravaged country.
</P>
<P>
In a communique after an unannounced one-day official visit
Wednesday by Chadian President Idriss Deby, the two countries
also stressed the need for all well-meaning Liberians to accept
the outcome of the July 19 polls so as to move the country
forward and put it in its rightful place in African and
international affairs.
</P>
<P>
Acknowledging that the successful polls fully actualized the
Abuja Accord on Liberia, they called on the international
community to assist the new government in the country.
</P>
<P>
Taylor won a landslide victory in the election. He is
expected to be sworn in on the coming Saturday. Fifteen heads of
state including Nigeria's Sani Abacha, South Africa's Nelson
Mandela, Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe and Laurent Kabila of the
Democratic Republic of Congo, are billed for the inauguration
ceremony.
</P>
<P>
The west African peace-keeping force in Liberia has promised
to provide "an overwhelming security" for the occasion.
</P>
<P>
On recent developments in Sierra Leone, both Abacha and Deby
reaffirmed that the Abidjan Agreement which led to a cease-fire
would continue to serve as a viable framework for peace,
stability and reconciliation in that country.
</P>
<P>
They agreed that effective bilateral and regional economic
cooperation among African countries is required for continental
economic integration.
</P>
<P>
In this regard, member states of the Organization of African
Unity should adopt necessary measures at national, regional and
continental levels to ensure effective implementation of the
Abuja treaty establishing the African economic community, the
communique said.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders also expressed concern about present situation
in Congo's Brazzaville, it said.

ABU DHABI, July 31 (Xinhua) -- Oman plans to reorganize its
stock exchange, the Muscat Securities Market (MSM), with an
independent depository and settlement body and a separate
regulatory function to be established, a local newspaper reported
today.
</P>
<P>
"Reorganization of the market is high on the MSM's agenda,"
the daily Khaleej Times quoted Oman's Commerce and Industry
Minister Maqbool Bin Ali Bin Sultan as saying.
</P>
<P>
In a speech to the MSM's general assembly, delivered by
MSM executive president Mahmoud al Jarwani, the minister said a
new law had been prepared to make the market function more
professionally.
</P>
<P>
"The law provides for separation between the regulatory body
and the regulated entities - the trading floor and brokers," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The minister said market capitalization rose 23 percent last
year to some 4.3 billion U.S. dollars. Twenty-one companies were
listed, one more than that of 1995, and all were oversubscribed.
</P>
<P>
He said primary market activity reflected business confidence,
good liquidity, low interest rates on bank deposits, the
saturation of investment in real estate and the relatively small
value of government bonds issued last year.

<HEADLINE> Uganda Protests Against Detention of Nationals in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 31 (Xinhua) -- Uganda has formally protested
against the "detention and harassment" of its nationals in Kenya
in the past two weeks when Kenyan police arrested more than 600
foreigners, the Daily Nation newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
Ugandan Minister of State for Foreign Affairs in charge of
Regional Cooperation Rebecca Kadaga Wednesday summoned Kenya's
High Commissioner Peter Ole Nkuraiyia and registered the protest,
said the report.
</P>
<P>
More than 100 Ugandans have been arrested and are being held
in various jails in Kenya, Kadaga said.
</P>
<P>
All attempts by Uganda's High Commissioner in Nairobi to have
them released "have been frustrated," she said, demanding the
Kenyan authorities establish the legal charges against the
detainees or set them free.
</P>
<P>
She also urged the Kenyan authorities to give Ugandan High
Commissioner to Kenya immediate access to those detained.
</P>
<P>
"Kenya is now holding the chairmanship of the East African
Cooperation. It is not proper that citizens from the Cooperation
countries should be treated like this," she charged.
</P>
<P>
However, Nkuraiyia said he has informed the Ugandan minister
that the recent events were "a normal security swoop we are
carrying out from time to time, not against Ugandans, Tanzanians
or Somalis."
</P>
<P>
He said Uganda may have over-reacted to the events, adding
that Nairobi has informed him that Ugandan High Commissioner has
not made a formal request to visit the detainees.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan authorities have no reason to deny the Ugandan High
Commissioner access to the detained persons, he noted.
</P>
<P>
More than 600 foreigners were reportedly netted in main cities
in Kenya in the last two weeks during a large-scale police
crackdown, which the police headquarters said was prompted by an
upsurge in car theft, murders, armed robberies and burglary.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi has ordered police
to crack down on foreigners, saying foreign spies and criminals
masquerading as refugees have invaded the capital city.

BEIJING, July 31 (Xinhua) -- National Defense Minister Chi
Haotian, who presided over a reception marking the 70th
anniversary of the  People's Liberation Army (PLA) in the Great
Hall of the People today, told the gathering that the PLA will
always strictly follow the commands of the Central Committee of
the Communist Party of China (CPC) and those of the Central
Military Commission (CMC).
</P>
<P>
China's party and government leaders Jiang Zemin, Li Peng, Qiao
Shi, Li Ruihuan, Zhu Rongji, Liu Huaqing, Hu Jintao and Rong
Yiren, as well as over 1,700 people attended the reception held by
the Defense Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Chi, who is also vice-chairman of the CMC and state councillor,
said, "We will stand firm with the CPC with Jiang Zemin at its
core both in thought and action," and "We must never lose our
loyalty to the Party, to the motherland, to the people and to
socialism. We should serve the people heart and soul and never
change the nature of the people's army."
</P>
<P>
He recalled the PLA's glorious history from the struggle for
national independence and liberation to the founding of new China
and the country's reforms and opening up to the outside world.
</P>
<P>
"History has shown that without the CPC armed with scientific
theory, there would be no flourishing socialist China today," he
said, "And without a people's army under the leadership of the
CPC, the people would not have what they have today."
</P>
<P>
He said that the PLA garrison in Hong Kong must fulfill its
responsibilities in strict accordance with the Basic Law of the
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and the Garrison Law, and
that it will actively contribute to maintaining the long-term
prosperity and stability of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
On the question of Taiwan, Chi said that China is committed to
settling that issue in line with the "peaceful reunification and
one country, two systems" principle.
</P>
<P>
"But we will never commit ourselves to forsaking the use of
force," he said, explaining that, "This is to preempt the forces
in Taiwan seeking Taiwan independence and splitting the motherland
and foreign intervention."

JERUSALEM, July 31 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli security forces
have arrested a total of 28 Palestinians in a sweeping campaign to
round up Hamas activists suspected of involvement in Wednesday's
Jerusalem suicide bombing, reported the state-run Israel Radio.
</P>
<P>
Army soldiers and plain clothes raided several Palestinian
villages to search for and pick up Hamas activists and their
families. All the arrests were carried out in villages still under
Israeli security control.
</P>
<P>
The crackdown is apparently part of the "security measures"
that the Ministerial Committee on National Security ordered
Wednesday night the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) and security
services to carry out against the Palestinian terrorist
organizations.
</P>
<P>
The arrests have taken place mainly in Jenin and Nablus,
cities in the northern part of the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Public Security Minister Avigdor Kahalani disclosed
that the two suicide bombing attackers had still not been
identified. He confirmed that parts of their ID cards were found
in their bodies, but they may be forged.
</P>
<P>
In a radio interview this morning, the minister said that
it was not yet clear which organizations the two terrorists
belonged to.
</P>
<P>
Kahalani said that police believe that the two were residents
of the West Bank, not from abroad.
</P>
<P>
He said that the two explosive devices they carried may
come from the secret explosive lab in Bethlehem uncovered by
Palestinian police last week.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia, Pakistan Agree to Enhance Trade, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, July 31 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia and Pakistan today
agreed to enhance trade and investment cooperation through a
package of proposals, according to Malaysian Foreign Minister
Abdullah Ahmad Badawi.
</P>
<P>
The proposals involved the diversification of imports and
exports, joint ventures and the relocation of labor-intensive
industries, Abdullah said at the end of the inaugural three-day
Malaysia-Pakistan joint Commission meeting here which was
represented by Abdullah and his Pakistani counterpart Gohar Ayub
Khan respectively.
</P>
<P>
He said: "We have also undertaken to look into the question of
our respective trade regimes with a view to facilitating greater
flow of trade between the two countries."
</P>
<P>
The two countries also agreed to promote youth, sport, tourism
and cultural exchanges for closer cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Apart from trade and commodities, the meeting deliberated on
possible joint ventures in human resource development and
technical cooperation in science and technology, he said.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah said the successful conclusion of the meeting would
chart a new direction in the bilateral relations between Malaysia
and Pakistan whose Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif began a three-day
official visit to Malaysia today.
</P>
<P>
Gohar said this was the first visit by Sharif to a Southeast
Asian country after assuming office in February this year
following his Pakistan Muslim League's victory in the general
elections, reflecting "the importance he attaches to Malaysia".
</P>
<P>
Pakistan was seeking to increase its exports of commodities
such as rice and fruits to Malaysia as the balance of trade was
now in Malaysia's favor, Gohar told reporters after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan was also looking into Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad's suggestion that the two countries enhance their
collaboration in producing, processing and marketing palm oil.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the possibility of supplying defense equipment to
Malaysia, Gohar said Malaysian defense personnel could be trained
in Pakistani institutions.
</P>
<P>
He also suggested that Malaysian investors establish joint
ventures or set up business in Pakistan including buying over
industries which were being denationalized or privatized.
</P>
<P>
Two-way trade between the two countries is showing an upward
trend with total trade amounting to 698 million U.S. dollars last
year.

<HEADLINE> ECOWAS Talks with S. Leone Junta May Deadlock </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 31 (Xinhua) -- Renewed efforts to restore
democracy in Sierra Leone may go into a deadlock with indications
of attitudinal differences among west African countries, media
reports said today.
</P>
<P>
The second-round talks between Sierra Leone's military
government and foreign ministers of Nigeria, Ghana, Guinea and
Cote d'Ivoire representing the Economic Community of West African
States (ECOWAS) continued Wednesday for the second day in
Abidjan, Cote d'Ivoire.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that Tom Ikimi, Nigerian Foreign Minister and
leader of the ECOWAS committee of four, said Wednesday he was
optimistic that the Sierra Leone crisis would soon be resolved.
</P>
<P>
However, his Ghanaian and Cote d'Ivoirian counterparts were
quoted as suggesting that enough time be given to the coup leader
to restore democracy.
</P>
<P>
The two parties held the first round talks in Abidjan two
weeks ago and decided another meeting should be held one week
later so that the junta could have time to consider ways to
resolve the crisis.
</P>
<P>
After the break, according to reports, the military junta gave
four conditions including the release of Fonday Sankoh, leader of
the former rebel Revolutionary United Front that had fought
successive governments since 1991.
</P>
<P>
Sankoh is said to be in detention in Nigeria and his group had
allied with the military government in the wake of the May 25
coup which overthrew the civilian government led by ousted
President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah.
</P>
<P>
The coup leader Major Johnny Koroma had earlier insisted on
conducting fresh polls or inauguration of a national conference
to determine the fate of deposed Kabbah.
</P>
<P>
When the two parties met for the first time in Abidjan,
Koroma's envoys told the ECOWAS foreign ministers that vacating
power for Koroma did not arise, while elections could not be held
in Sierra Leone for now, given the intense political hostilities
among various ethnic groups.
</P>
<P>
A member of Koroma's delegation was quoted as saying on
Tuesday that the military would not hand over power to Kabbah,
but to another democratically elected government.
</P>
<P>
Analysts noted that the sub-regional effort could be stalled
over the demand by Koroma for Sankoh's release ahead of any
meaningful negotiation.
</P>
<P>
The committee of four has earlier asked the Koroma regime to
hand over power to Kabbah's government or it will employ embargo
or even force to oust the military junta.
</P>
<P>
As a matter of fact, the blockade by the west African
peace-keeping force (ECOMOG) has resulted in short supply of
foodstuffs and drugs in the war-torn country.

<HEADLINE> Asian Games Marketing Chief Resigned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 31 (Xinhua) -- Santiparb Tejavanija, marketing
chief of the 1998 Bangkok Asian Games in Bangkok, has resigned
after legal wrangling over a 10 million dollars sponsorship
agreement with a computer firm Acer Inc.
</P>
<P>
Santiparb Tejavanija sent his resignation late Wednesday to
Thai deputy Prime Minister Sukavich Rangsitpol who chairs the
government-run Bangkok Asian Games Organising Committee (BAGOC).
</P>
<P>
He has quit his seven BAGOC positions but will remain as
treasurer of the Olympic Council of Asia (OCA).
</P>
<P>
The computer firm is to develop a results service for the Games
from December 5 to December 20 next year.
</P>
<P>
But the final contract has taken more than a year to sign
because of haggling with lawyers at the Thai attorney general's
office, games sources said.
</P>
<P>
Games preparations have been dogged by personnel changes and
worries that venues and a new transportation system in the traffic
choked Thai capital would not be ready on time. The BAGOC
secretary general was forced to stand down by the government in
May.
</P>
<P>
But Swiss-based marketing company ISL has signed a record 82
million dollars worth of sponsorship and licensing deals for the
Games, indicating its growing importance in the sporting
calendar.

<HEADLINE> Mandela Apologizes for Detention of Nigerian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 31 (Xinhua) -- South African President
Nelson Mandela today met two visiting Nigerian envoys, who were
briefly detained at a military air base Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
South African Press Association (SAPA) quoted Mandela as
saying that his meeting with Rabu Dagari and Mohammed Doba had
solved the "sensitive issue" between the two countries. But he
declined to divulge the details.
</P>
<P>
Reports of a diplomatic row between Nigeria and South Africa
surfaced earlier this week after Nigerian Information Minister
Walter Ofonagoro allegedly commented that Mandela was "the black
head of a white country".
</P>
<P>
Mandela said Ofonagoro had denied making the remark and he had
no reason to disbelieve him.
</P>
<P>
Mandela said relations between himself and Nigerian leader
Sani Abacha were, on a personal level, "cordial and harmonious".
</P>
<P>
Relations between South Africa and Nigeria were sound. There
had been some tension two years ago when Mandela called for the
suspension of Nigeria's membership of the Commonwealth after
Abacha ordered the execution of seven Nigerian human rights
activists.
</P>
<P>
Mandela today also revealed that the two Nigerian envoys were
mistakenly arrested and briefly detained at Wonderboom Air Base
outside Pretoria last night.
</P>
<P>
The aircraft carrying the Nigerian envoys was scheduled to
land at Johannesburg International Airport but instead touched
down at Wonderboom Air Base where Dagari and Doba were briefly
taken into custody, Mandela said.
</P>
<P>
The president said he had apologized to the envoys and would
be sending a formal apology to Abacha. He also promised an
investigation into the incident.

<HEADLINE> Germany Fails to Agree on Tax Reform Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, July 31 (Xinhua) -- A mediation panel comprising
parliamentary members from both the ruling party and opposition
ended negotiations early today without agreement on a tax reform
package proposed by Chancellor Helmut Kohl.
</P>
<P>
The panel, however, agreed to abolish the business capital tax
in western Germany in 1997 and not to levy it in eastern Germany.
</P>
<P>
The 1998-99 tax reform plan was designed to boost Germany's
competitiveness as a business location, which would lead to an
annual net tax cut of 30 billion Deutsche marks (about 17.6
billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
It was forwarded to the mediation panel after being rejected by
the main opposition Social Democrats (SPD) in the Bundesrat, the
upper house of parliament, where the SPD holds the majority.
</P>
<P>
The SPD had vowed to block the reform bill, calling it socially
unjust and lacking in solid financial basis.
</P>
<P>
Kohl, deeming the bill as the best opportunity to boost
investment and jobs, had accused the Social Democrats of "treason"
against the over four million unemployed in Germany.
</P>
<P>
In hope of a compromise deal to save the tax reform bill, a
major move of the government, Kohl had offered a series of
concessions to the SPD in a last-minute effort during
negotiations, but in vain.
</P>
<P>
The SPD had also thwarted Kohl's many other initiatives this
year.
</P>
<P>
Today's results were seen as a major political setback for
Kohl, whose popularity, as opinion polls have showed, goes already
behind his possible SPD rivals in the elections scheduled for
September 1998.
</P>
<P>
Kohl has been the German Chancellor since 1982 and is seeking a
fifth four-year term in the upcoming elections.

PARIS, July 31 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading French newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- Two Palestinians transformed into human bombs killed 14
people Wednesday in a Jewish marketplace in Jerusalem. The
attack, claimed by the Hamas militant movement, came at the moment
when Israel and the Palestinian authority were preparing to resume
peace talks which were interrupted for four months.
</P>
<P>
-- According to newly declassified information of the United
States government, the Swiss bank Credit Suisse helped finance
German Nazis during World War II by paying money to a German
espionage station house in Basle, Switzerland. The money was used
to buy Swiss-made military materials for the Third Reich.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- A scenary of horror and panic prevailed at a big Jewish
marketplace in Jerusalem Wednesday as 14 people were killed and
more than 150 wounded in a double bombing attack. This is the
most bloody bombing attack in Israel since Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu came to power.
</P>
<P>
-- A team of experts headed by Patrick Weil will present today
a report to Prime Minister Lionel Jospin on the reform of France's
immigration law and code of nationality, which will serve as the
basis for two bills on immigration and nationality to be discussed
by parliament in autumn. The Weil report suggests a reinforcement
of the natural right of soil for children born in France of
foreign parents, but it does not require the abrogation of two
previous immigration laws adopted under two former interior
ministers Charles Pasqua and Jean-Louis Debre.

<HEADLINE> Over 100 MPs Condemn Arrests of Aides to Tehran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 31 (Xinhua) -- More than 100 leftist and liberal
parliamentary deputies have condemned the recent arrests of seven
high-ranking officials of Tehran's municipality on charges of
corruption.
</P>
<P>
In their letter to Iran's Judicial Chief Mohammad Yazdi, which
was published by the Persian daily Iran today, the members of the
Parliament criticized the judicial branch for "political
motivations behind the recent arrests."
</P>
<P>
"The unfair,... and illegal treatment (arrests) which were
accompanied by sensational propaganda created the impression that
perhaps political motivation has overshadowed other
responsibilities of the Justice Ministry officials in Greater
Tehran," the letter signed by more than 100 deputies of the
270-seat Parliament said.
</P>
<P>
Plain-cloth men from the Justice Ministry raided the Mayoral
Office in downtown Tehran Monday and Tuesday and arrested seven
top aides on charges of embezzlement.
</P>
<P>
In a show of support for Tehran Mayor Gholamhussein
Karbaschi, whose group has been the target of the recent
arrests, the deputies touched on many accomplishments the mayor
has made during his eight-year tenure and called his role as
instrumental in the construction era headed by outgoing President
Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani.
</P>
<P>
Once a leftist, Karbaschi has switched camps in the past
decade, serving as one of the most outspoken champions of
liberal causes in the Islamic Iran.
</P>
<P>
He has played a pivotal role in the formation of liberal
group known as G-6 that has supported the development policies
of Rafsanjani.
</P>
<P>
Karbaschi and his group fully backed the presidential bid of
Mohammad Khatami who won a landslide victory by defeating his
main rival -- hardliner Parliament Speaker Ali Akbar
Nateq-Nouri, who is backed by Iranian Supreme Leader Ali
Khamenei.
</P>
<P>
Khamenei has launched the nationwide anti-corruption campaign
early this month and his close aide Ayatollah Ahmad Jannati has
called for sweeping judicial measures to bring corruptive
governmental officials to justice.
</P>
<P>
On July 20, Judicial Chief Mohammad Yazdi announced that he
will set up a special court to deal with rampant governmental
corruption in the country.
</P>
<P>
The 64-year-old president, his family members and some
cabinet members have been under constant attacks by hardliners
for various kinds of corruption since the beginning of 1996.
</P>
<P>
Some 156 members of the 270-seat Parliament called on July 1
for an investigation into the assets of top officials of the
Rafsanjani administration and their families.
</P>
<P>
The latest anti-corruption campaign comes at the end of the
Rafsanjani administration's second and last term. Rafsanjani will
officially step down from office on August 3.

<HEADLINE> China's First Court To Handle Tourist Disputes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, July 31 (Xinhua) -- If tourists visiting the Three
Little Gorges, a famous scenic spot in Chongqing in southwest
China, encounter any difficulties, they can turn to China's first
tourist court for help in resolving the problem.
</P>
<P>
There has been a tourism boom in the area in recent years, but
along with it has come some problems caused by unscrupulous
tourist agencies, resulting in disputes between them and tourists.
</P>
<P>
So, on February 16, 1995, the local authorities established the
first court specializing in travel disputes, which often include
over charging, violation of contract, and other forms of
unfairness. Compensation for those who win their claims can run
from 10 yuan (a little more than one dollar) to 5,000 yuan, and
disputes must be resolved in two or three days.
</P>
<P>
"Members of the court work from 5 a.m. to 8 p.m. during the
busy season," said the president of the court. And for
convenience' sake, the court accepts complaints over the phone and
through the mail.
</P>
<P>
One example was Deng Yanbing, a tourist from Xi'an, who on
April, 26, 1995 was overcharged 20 yuan for a boat ride. Thirty
minutes after Deng telephoned the court, he and other tourists got
compensation from the boat's owner.
</P>
<P>
The court has already handled more than 60 cases, and has
answered over 5,000 legal inquiries. The number of complaints are
down this year, however, with only five reported between January
and May.

<HEADLINE> Viet Nam Expects to Promote Coop with S. Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 31 (Xinhua) -- Viet Nam is ready to sign
agreements with South Africa on economic, scientific and
technological cooperation, local daily Business Report today
quoted Vietnamese Ambassador Tu Nguyen as saying.
</P>
<P>
Nguyen said the Vietnamese government had decided to open its
formal embassy in South Africa next year.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam established diplomatic relations with South Africa in
1993. However, instead of opening an embassy in Pretoria, the
ASEAN country has been managing its Southern Africa
representation from Luanda, Angola.
</P>
<P>
Nguyen said that Viet Nam's decision to move its embassy in
the region to South Africa reflects this country's increasingly
important role in the area, citing specifically South Africa's
presidency of the Southern African Development community (SADC)
and its pending presidency of the Non-Aligned Movement.
</P>
<P>
As a member of the Association of South East Asian Nations
(ASEAN), Viet Nam is interested in improving and increasing ties
between this successful regional group and the SADC, Nguyen said.
</P>
<P>
He said Viet Nam has its eye on South African mining
technology, equipment and expertise.
</P>
<P>
The trade balance reportedly falls in Viet Nam's favor. Last
year South Africa bought 7.86 million U.S. dollars worth of
goods, mainly rice and footwear, from Viet Nam and exported 4.27
million U.S. dollars worth of machinery, electrical equipment and
base metals to the Asian trading partner.

<HEADLINE> Elderly Tibetan Philanthropist </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, July 31 (Xinhua) -- Six new primary schools will open in
September in Nanmulin County, the Tibet Autonomous Region, thanks
to the efforts of Zhaxi Cering, a 68-year-old Tibetan.
</P>
<P>
"I'm very happy to do something for the children in my
hometown," said Cering.
</P>
<P>
The philanthropic Cering had used well over 770,000 yuan
(96,000 US dollars) by the end of last year to build 30 primary schools in
the region.
</P>
<P>
The schools have provided over 2,200 children in 54 villages
with an education, and enrollments in recipient counties have
jumped dramatically from 37 percent in 1990 to 67.9 percent in
1996.
</P>
<P>
Cering returned to China in 1964 after completing his studies
in India and the United States. Cering, 34 at the time, then
entered the Tibet Nationalities Institute to study Chinese.
</P>
<P>
He accepted a position as an English teacher at Tibet
University in 1982 and has since devoted his time to
education. Cering won praise in 1988 for his compilation and
publication of the first English-Tibetan-Chinese Dictionary.
</P>
<P>
Cering earned some 10,000 yuan from an English school he opened
to train the first group of young Tibetan tourist guides.
</P>
<P>
"The money I earned from the school was a considerable sum when
considering that I previously couldn't afford a bicycle," said
Cering. "At the same time, however, I was deeply concerned about
dropouts in poverty-stricken areas."
</P>
<P>
Cering followed-up on his concern by approaching a related
county department and expressing his desire to build schools. His
first primary school opened in Guque Village in 1991 has an
enrollment of 48 students.
</P>
<P>
Upon his retirement, Cering entered business. He explained, "I
need money to realize my wish of building schools." He took full
advantage of opportunities created while marketing Tibetan
handicrafts both at home and abroad to inform clients of his
ambition to build schools for poverty-stricken children. Cering's
efforts were rewarded with substantial donations for related
projects.
</P>
<P>
"It would have been impossible to build so many schools without
help from friends," said Cering.

<HEADLINE> Ugandans Deported From Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, July 31 (Xinhua) -- More than 30 Ugandans have been
deported from neighbouring Kenya since Monday, local newspaper
"The New Vision" reported today.
</P>
<P>
All Ugandans were back without Kenya police escort except
eight handed over Wednesday, border official said.
</P>
<P>
Kenyan policemen escorting the Ugandans claimed the deported
had caused insecurity and other forms of lawlessness in Kenyan
villages and towns.
</P>
<P>
Rebecca Kadaga, Ugandan Minister of State for Foreign Affairs,
Wednesday sommoned Ole Ukurayiro, Kenyan High Commissioner in
Kampala, and lodged a protest against Kenya's "detention and
harassment" of Ugandans.
</P>
<P>
More than 100 Ugandans had been arrested and were being held
in various jails in Kenya, with some being held for more than two
weeks, said Kadaga, adding all attempts by Uganda's High
Commissioner in Nairobi to have them released "have been
frustrated".
</P>
<P>
The minister demanded that the Kenyan authorities establish
the legal charges against the detainees or set them free.

<HEADLINE> Discussions on Congolese Crisis Reaches Deadlock </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YAOUNDE, July 31 (Xinhua) -- Talks on the Congolese crisis
held in the Gabonese capital Libreville reached deadlock again
following disagreement between Congolese President Pascal
Lissouba and his rival former President Sassou Nguesso.
</P>
<P>
Reports reaching here today said Sassou rejected the draft
plan discussed during peace talks in Libreville last Saturday,
saying only a transition period led by a public salvation
government could establish peace in the Republic of Congo (B).
</P>
<P>
Lissouba's party, the Pan African Union for Social Democracy
responded to the announcement by rejecting the idea of the
transition period, noting that to accept a transition period is
to question all democratic institutes as well as the constitution
itself.
</P>
<P>
According to the reports, Sassou is completely against the
prolongation of President Lissouba's mandate, adding that keeping
Lissouba in power threatens peace and security in the country.
</P>
<P>
Lissouba's mandate has already been extended by the Congo's
Constitutional Council on July 21. The council delayed the
elections initially set for July 27 and declared that Lissouba
should stay on beyond August 31 when his mandate was to expire
until a successor was elected. However, no new date for elections
was set.
</P>
<P>
Forces loyal to President Lissouba and the militia of former
President Sassou Nguesso have been fighting since June 5 when the
government soldiers tried to disarm Sassou's militia. More than
2,000 people have been killed during the clashes.
</P>
<P>
The cease-fire which has been in effect since July 13 is
respected by the both sides. Congolese capital Brazzaville
remains calm today.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Views on Science Fiction (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 31 (Xinhua) -- A great many Chinese people view
science fiction as children's literature, with one recent article
noting that "science fiction and fairy tales are both far from
real life."
</P>
<P>
Chinese sci-fi writer Xing He does not see it that way.
</P>
<P>
"For thousands of years, Chinese have been used to seeking
answers in history, and held that the ancient ideas are the
best. In the traditional Chinese concept, exploring the future is
useless," Xing said.
</P>
<P>
However, he added, China's modernization drive requires the
creativity and daring that science fiction embodies.
</P>
<P>
A group of delegates attending the ongoing '97 Beijing
International Conference on Science Fiction share the opinion that
the science fiction craze that swept the country since the late
1970s was attributed to China's reform and opening-up drive, as
well as the global technological revolution.
</P>
<P>
From then on, Chinese began to view their country differently,
believing that a future marked by change was possible.
</P>
<P>
"Science fiction has become a literature form closer to real
life," said Pan Jiazheng, vice-president of the Chinese Academy of
Engineering, who is also a sci-fi writer. His works highlight the
important role of hi-tech in solving China's major problems, such
as birth control and desertification.
</P>
<P>
"Since ancient times, the Chinese have liked fantasy stories,
but their illusions lack scientific proof," said Jin Tao, director
of Popular Science Press.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese created the legend of people flying to the moon
long before the world famous sci-fi writer Jules Verne popularized
the idea in his novels. According to one Chinese tale, Chang'e
flew to the moon by swallowing a powerful elixir stolen from her
husband.

BEIRUT -- A five-state panel overseeing the implementation of
cease-fire in the border area between Lebanon and Israel urged the
fighting sides to strictly comply with a truce agreement reached
last year. Representatives from France, Israel, Lebanon, Syria and
the United States, who make up of the cease-fire monitoring
committee, attended the 19-hour meeting on Thursday morning in the
headquarters of the U.N. peacekeeping forces at the south
Lebanese border town of Naqoura.
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- The Israeli government has decided to break off
negotiations, the state-run Israel Radio reported on Thursday
morning. The government also decided to allow Israeli security
forces to enter the Palestinian self-rule areas to carry out
missions, taking no notice of Palestinian sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
BONN -- About 15,000 people was told Wednesday to be ready to
abandon their homes at a moment's notice after the swollen Oder
River on the German-Polish border threatened to flood a vast
low-lying area of eastern Germany. Some 4,000 troops who had been
fighting a losing battle overnight to save the weakening dikes in
the northern part of the Oder were forced to retreat from the
riverside when a 50-meter-long stretch of dike was torn open by
floodwaters.

<HEADLINE> New Wall Materials Being Promoted In South China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, July 31 (Xinhua) -- China's Guangdong Province is
drafting long-term plans for promoting the development of new wall
materials to increase their use.
</P>
<P>
Traditionally, bricks made from local soil have been popular in
rural China, resulting in the destruction of a large amount of
farmland. The province hopes that new wall materials will account
for 25 percent of the wall materials output there by the year
2000, and 40 percent by the year 2010.
</P>
<P>
New wall materials are made of organic materials and are widely
used elsewhere in the world. Chinese experts say that using them
is an effective way to protect farmland, save energy, and improve
labor efficiency.
</P>
<P>
From 1991-95, Guangdong produced more than 20 kinds of new wall
materials, with an output equivalent to six billion standard
bricks. In 1995, it was able to save 192,000 tons of standard
coal, and recycled 200,000 tons of discarded materials, preventing
270 hectares of farmland from being destroyed.
</P>
<P>
New wall materials now appear in 20 percent of the buildings
in Guangzhou and 35 percent in Shenzhen.

<HEADLINE> Five Outlawed Members Arrested in Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 31 (Xinhua) -- Five members of an outlawed
opposition group have been arrested in Iran and charged with
espionage activities during presidential election campaigns in
May, a press report said today.
</P>
<P>
The Persian daily Kar-o-Karegar reported that the group known
as Mojahedin Khalq Organization (MKO) is based in Iraq and has
waged arm struggle against Tehran government for the past 16
years. MKO leader Massoud Rajavi is supported by the Iraqi
government, the newspaper alleged.
</P>
<P>
"Three members of the MKO team were arrested in (Iran's
southern province of) Kerman and the other two were arrested at
the border regions while trying to exit Iran illegally," an
unnamed information ministry official was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
However, the report did not mention when they were arrested or
who they are.
</P>
<P>
The official said that the agents of his ministry searched the
houses belonging to this group and acquired intra-organizational
documents of the group.
</P>
<P>
"Members of this team have had such activities as espionage
during the presidential election, identifying sensitive security
areas, writing slogans on the walls and distributing tracks," he
added.
</P>
<P>
During the presidential election campaign which ended in May 23
landslide victory for Mohammad Khatami, Iranian authorities
arrested a number of MKO operatives who had infiltrated into Iran.
</P>
<P>
The operatives, the government said, had been sent into Iran
to initiate a campaign of terror and to disrupt presidential
elections.

<P>
Followers of science fiction say the writing form is grabbing
the attention of more and more Chinese.
</P>
<P>
Zhou Guangzhao, president of the China Association for Science
and Technology, said that the most influential technological
innovations and inventions introduced during the 20th century have
evolved from the imaginative descriptions created by science
fiction writers.
</P>
<P>
Zheng Wenguang, father of Chinese contemporary science fiction,
claimed that sci-fi writers have the responsibility to develop the
literary form so as to attract not only children but adults.
</P>
<P>
China's only sci-fi magazine, "Science Fiction World," has a
readership of approximately 300,000, the largest among all the
publications of its kind in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
"The popularity of the magazine shows the change in Chinese
people's mentality," said Wu Yan, member of the Chinese Writers'
Association.
</P>
<P>
The purpose of science fiction, Wu noted, is not only to spread
scientific knowledge, but also to "provide humanistic background
for readership to think over the impact of scientific development
on culture and deeper layers of the society."
</P>
<P>
In his new story which fictionalizes the history of the Chinese
sending mankind into outer space, Wu showed how a weak nation like
China survives by struggle and self-sacrifice.
</P>
<P>
Some Chinese people believe that science fiction can predict
potential crises that may result from scientific development.
</P>
<P>
A story about the cloning of human beings published in China
last year mentioned the dangers of the technology. It has aroused
widespread concern among some natural and social scientists who
consider that many of the details in the story are similar those
of the recent sheep cloning experiments in Britain.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese people are now displaying a serious and earnest
attitude towards science fiction," said Yang Xiao, chief editor of
"Science Fiction World."
</P>
<P>
She said that science fiction is a new form of literature for
people with a modern mindset, and will be the mainstream
literature of the 21st century.

<HEADLINE> Monitors Call for Commitments to Cease-Fire in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, July 31 (Xinhua) -- A five-state panel overseeing
the implementation of cease-fire in the border area between
Lebanon and Israel urged the fighting sides to strictly comply
with a truce agreement reached last year.
</P>
<P>
Representatives from France, Israel, Lebanon, Syria and the
United States, who make up of the cease-fire monitoring
committee, ended a 19-hour meeting this morning in the
headquarters of the U.N. peacekeeping forces at the south
Lebanese border town of Naqoura.
</P>
<P>
The committee, which was set up under the cease-fire
understanding mediated in April, 1996, by the U.S. and
France between Lebanon and Israel, held the meeting to discuss
one complaint lodged with it by Lebanon and three by Israel
over cease-fire violations.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued at the end of the meeting, the 15th of
this year, the committee accepted as "fatal" what the Lebanese
side said in its complaint that three mortar shells fired by
Israeli forces or the Israeli-backed South Lebanon Army (SLA)
militia landed in Habboush Monday, "causing damages of properties
in the town."
</P>
<P>
The Israeli delegates argued that the incident was the
result of a "defensive response" to an attack launched by
Lebanese armed groups from Habboush, the committee statement
said.
</P>
<P>
In its own complaints, Israel accused Lebanese resistance
fighters of violating the so-called "April understanding" by
attacking civilian areas in the Israeli self-proclaimed "security
zone" at the weekend.
</P>
<P>
The monitoring team said it also accepted as fatal that at
least one Katyusha rocket fired by Lebanese armed groups landed
near Kawkaba over Saturday night and mortar shells landed in
Rihan Sunday, leading to the wounding of a woman.
</P>
<P>
However, just as what it had done in its previous
meetings, the committee refrained from condemning any side for
breaches of the cease-fire understanding, which demands civilians
on both sides of the border to be neutralized from military
operations.
</P>
<P>
The monitoring committee meeting was held amid reports of
trading fire between Muslim guerrillas of the Lebanese
pro-Iranian Hezbollah on the one hand, and Israeli forces and
their client Lebanese militia on the other in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Lebanese army units have cleared
the last land mines from the road leading to a crossing
between the south Lebanese port city of Saida and Jezzine, a
mainly Christian-populated town at the tip of the
Israeli-occupied border strip.
</P>
<P>
Although the government hopes to open the Kfar Falous
crossing Friday to allow a free access to Jezzine, there is
no indication that the SLA has begun clearing its section of
the road east of Kfar Falous, the Lebanese English daily the
Daily Star reported today.
</P>
<P>
Antoine Lahd, commander of the 2,500-strong SLA militia had
announced its agreement to the reopening last week.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted army sources as saying that the
Lebanese army units in the area were placed on full alert
to put into effect the government's decision to reopen the
crossing as scheduled Friday, which coincides with Lebanon's
Army Day.
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said the section of the road to be manned by
the Lebanese troops seemed ready for traffic after soldiers
finished removing mines and earth mounds.
</P>
<P>
But land mines in the fields on either side of the road
are left to remain there to block possible infiltration by
SLA militiamen, the army sources added.

<HEADLINE> China to Tighten Quality Control on Ginseng </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGCHUN, July 31 (Xinhua) -- China is working out a national
standard for the quality classification of American ginseng
products to upgrade the quality of both domestically-made and
imported American ginseng.
</P>
<P>
The standards, complete and authoritative, will be the first of
the kind in the world, said one of the experts who is formulating
the standards.
</P>
<P>
Prof. Li Shudian from Jilin Agricultural University said the
standards will help safeguard consumers' interests, promote the
healthy growth of China's own American ginseng industry, and
tighten the control on the import of low-quality ginseng.
</P>
<P>
The regulations cover five types of ginseng: American ginseng,
activated American ginseng, American ginseng slices, chewing
tablets of American ginseng and bagged American ginseng tea.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, more Chinese have begun to use American, or
western ginseng, for health purposes, and large quantities of
ginseng have been imported from the United States and Canada.
</P>
<P>
China introduced the technique for growing the plant in 1980,
and developed its own American ginseng industry.
</P>
<P>
In 1988, the Ministry of Health announced that the quality of
China-made American ginseng was already on a par with that of the
imported kind, and listed it in the Chinese pharmacopoeia.
</P>
<P>
With a total cultivating area of more than 3.5 million square
meters and an annual output of 100 to 150 tons of ginseng
products, China is now the third largest American ginseng
producer, following Canada and the United States.
</P>
<P>
Experts from the Jilin Agriculture University, Shanghai Herbal
Medicine Co. Ltd and Beijing First American Development Center
have been working on the draft of the standards for the quality
classification of American ginseng since 1992.
</P>
<P>
The standards are expected to be announced by the end of this
year, according to Prof. Li.

still no sign of survivors and the cold would not help their
chances.
</P>
<P>
Chief Superintendent Bruce Johnston was quoted by the
Australian Associated Press as saying that most of the people
trapped by the landslide, which occurred just before midnight last
night, were aged between 25 and 50 and were workers at the ski
village.
</P>
<P>
Some were from overseas, including those from the United
States, Johnston said.
</P>
<P>
Most might be sleeping when a chunk of cliff above Alpine Way
slipped, pushing Carinya Lodge 100 meters down the slope on to the
Bimbadeen staff lodge.
</P>
<P>
One person was believed to be inside Carinya Lodge, while
Bimbadeen was home to between 18 and 20 senior staff.
</P>
<P>
More than 100 emergency workers were at the scene shoring up
the edges around the slide, and navy and police helicopters were
flown in.
</P>
<P>
Rescuers used flexible fiber optic cameras to search for
survivors in areas deemed stable.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, a sweep of the rubble using sensitive sound equipment
failed to detect any signs of life.
</P>
<P>
A geophysicist flown in by the police from Sydney this morning
to assess the scene had warned there was likely more slippage some
time today, Johnston said.
</P>
<P>
The victims might not be reached for several days, he added.
</P>
<P>
"The longer it goes obviously their chances are diminishing,
everyone's different," he added.
</P>
<P>
"Clearly the chance of survival is going to be minimized but we
have to be careful, it may well be that something we do could
(cause) further slippage, we may indeed take a life that may be
saved in a day or so," the police officer said.
</P>
<P>
Police felt helpless and shocked by the situation, which they
described as "horrendous."
</P>
<P>
It was still not known what triggered the landslide, but it was
believed water seeping from the mountain might have weakened the
soil.

<HEADLINE> Under-Funded Tourism Leads to Billions of Rand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 31 (Xinhua) -- South Africa is losing
billions of Rand annually in foreign exchange earnings because
of an under-funded tourism industry, said the South African
Tourism Board (SATOUR) chairwoman Liz Westby-Nunn.
</P>
<P>
Westby-Nunn said that tourism could be one of the big four
foreign exchange earners alongside manufacturing, mining and
agriculture, a local daily Sowetan reported today.
</P>
<P>
Statistics showed that 1.2 million foreigners visiting South
Africa last year spent about 12.5 billion Rand (about 2.7 billion
US Dollar). This year's numbers, in spite of the underfunding
problem were likely to increase.
</P>
<P>
Westby-Nunn said tourism was South Africa's only industry with
an assured and sustainable growth potential, where significant
new employment could be created.
</P>
<P>
Citing tourism contributed 4.5 percent to Gross Domestic
Product, she said the government's 63 million Rand (about 14
million US Dollar) funding to the SATOUR the current financial
year was under-funded.
</P>
<P>
The government had to appreciate the status of tourism not
only as a foreign exchange earner, but as contributor to the
country's economy as well, she stressed.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said that the South African government was
considering imposing a tourism levy in a bid to improve the
under-funded tourism.

<HEADLINE> Bulgaria to Reform Health Care System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Bulgaria has decided to set up
medics commissions in September to carry out health care reforms
aimed at to streamlining hospitals and clinics.
</P>
<P>
The commissions, proposed by Health Minister Peter Boyadjiev,
will submit a list of district and university hospitals which will
remain operational.
</P>
<P>
Some hospitals will possibly be closed down while new wards
start operating to meet region-specific needs, said Boyadjiev.
</P>
<P>
The commissions will decide the number of the medics, the
budget of individual health care establishments and the needs for
medicines in accordance with the predominant diseases and the age
composition of the local population.
</P>
<P>
The future of a hospital will depend on several criteria,
including the total number of in-patients, patients' average age,
diseases of highest incidence and transport links with the nearest
health care establishment.
</P>
<P>
The Bulgarian health care system has been in operation for 50
years in a centralized principle. Now 70 percent of health care
establishments are funded by the municipalities.
</P>
<P>
The public purse will continue to finance the sector till the
launch of a medical insurance system which is unlikely in the
coming two years.
</P>
<P>
Four health-related bills are expected to be introduced at
parliament by the end of this year.

<HEADLINE> Uganda to Send Additional 3,000 Troops to Fight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, July 31 (Xinhua) -- Uganda will send additional 3,000
troops to fight rebels in western Uganda, local newspapers
reported today.
</P>
<P>
President Yoweri Museveni Wednesday told a rally in western
Kasese District that Uganda and the Democratic Republic of Congo
(formerly Zaire) planned to join hands in fighting against the
Allied Democratic Forces (ADF) rebels, the papers said.
</P>
<P>
ADF is a rebel group operating in Rwenzori Mountain connecting
the Democratic Republic of Congo and Uganda.
</P>
<P>
President Museveni pledged Tuesday to eliminate ADF rebels.
</P>
<P>
Answering a question concerning the government's stand on the
return of a local traditional leader Prince Charles Wisley
Iremangoma, Museveni said he will not oppose to his return, but
the prince should not use violence to grab power.
</P>
<P>
Uganda's constitution recognizes traditional leaders as
monarchs.
</P>
<P>
ADF rebels want to use the return of the prince as a
propaganda weapon against the government.
</P>
<P>
If Iremangoma is involved in the ADF rebellion, he will face
the laws, the president warned.
</P>
<P>
Iremangoma left Uganda to study in the United States in 1984
and has kept a low profile regarding ADF allegations that they
are fighting to meet him as king in the region of Rwenzori
Mountain.

<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, July 31 (Xinhua) -- At least 23 garment workers, mostly
women, died and more than 100 others injured in a stampede caused
by a minor fire at a garment factory in Dhaka on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said that a large number of panicked workers chocked
the exit following the fire which was caused by short circuit in
the switch board of the garment factory.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the exit was made more difficult to pass through
as the guard had reportedly kept the main gate closed partly to
bar the entry of outsiders in view of the day's industrial strike
and to prevent the workers from leaving their workplace during
duty hours.
</P>
<P>
Six policemen were also injured when the angry people attacked
them with bricks and stones as they were trying to remove the
bodies of the victims from the spot.
</P>
<P>
This is the second tragic incident in garment factories within
two weeks in the same area.

<HEADLINE> IMF Proposes Faster Privatization for Thailand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 31 (Xinhua) -- Senior officials of the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) have proposed that Thailand
speed up its privatization program and open its commercial banks
to foreign equity holding in excess of 25 percent, according to a
Bangkok Post report today.
</P>
<P>
The Thai government on Monday decided to seek an emergency
credit line from the IMF and work out an IMF-approved economic
revival program.
</P>
<P>
Rescue measures prescribed by IMF economic experts who are now
in Bangkok working with Thai authorities also envisage tax
reforms, flotation of utility rates, higher value-added tax,
strict controls on private sector debt creation and no help for
finance and securities firms.
</P>
<P>
The IMF also wants the Thai currency to stabilize at 30 baht to
the US dollar, the tax base broadened, tax collection improved and
monetary policy tightened.
</P>
<P>
The IMF officials have proposed growth be kept at 4-5 percent,
inflation no more than 7 percent and the current account deficit
no more than 5 percent of gross domestic product, the report
quotes Surasak Nananukul, an adviser to the prime minister as
saying. The paper did not say when he made the remarks.
</P>
<P>
However, the package would hurt if implemented in its entirety,
he said, but the government would make counter-proposals to
cushion the impact on the people.
</P>
<P>
Thai Airways International (THAI) and the State Railway of
Thailand have been identified as prime candidates for
privatization.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Thai economists at a panel discussion on Wednesday
warned that the country must be fully prepared for the negative
impact from measures being introduced by the IMF.
</P>
<P>
Suwinai Pornvilai, an economist of Thammasat University's
faculty of economics, said the IMF will make Thailand increase
value-added tax and fees for public utilities, allow financial
institutions with problems to collapse, force Thailand to create
savings, lower the quality of life of the Thai people and cut
extravagant expenses.

<HEADLINE> Herbal Foot Dressing Treatment for Mumps </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUIYANG, July 31 (Xinhua) -- Li Xinmin, a doctor in Guiyang,
capital of southwest China's Guizhou Province, uses herbal foot
dressings to treat parotitis (mumps).
</P>
<P>
Children are especially susceptible to parotitis, a highly
infectious disease Chinese refer to as "Monkey Lumps".
</P>
<P>
Western doctors prefer to treat parotitis with
anti-inflammatory drugs or incisions to facilitate drainage, while
doctors of traditional Chinese medicine opt for the use of herbal
foot dressings.
</P>
<P>
Li developed his therapy based on a prescription handed down
through generations of his family. The procedure involves applying
a bag of herbal medicine soaked with vinegar to an acupoint on the
sole of a patient's foot.
</P>
<P>
The herbal medicine takes effect in 24 hours and a patient
fully recovers within two days.
</P>
<P>
According to Li, "the therapy is based on the traditional
Chinese medical theory that upper body ailments can be treated by
stimulating acupoints in the lower extremities".
</P>
<P>
Li have used the procedure to successfully treat well over
1,000 patients in the past 20 years.

<HEADLINE> Polish Economy Grows amid Difficulties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WARSAW, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Polish economy continued to grow
in the first six months of the year despite an increase in trade
deficit and a drop in agricultural output.
</P>
<P>
Figures released today by the Central Statistics Bureau showed
that in the period under review, gross domestic product (GDP)
increased 7.8 percent, up from 7.1 percent in the second half
of last year.
</P>
<P>
In the second quarter, GDP went up by 8.2 percent over the same
period of last year, a record high since the start of economic
transition in 1989.
</P>
<P>
But because of the flooding which hit 25 provinces in southwest
Poland, the GDP is estimated to grow 4.6 percent in the second
half of this year.
</P>
<P>
Analysts estimate that the GDP growth rate for the whole year
may be 6 percent, higher than the targeted 5.5 percent but lower
than last year's 6.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
In the first six months, industrial output continued to grow at
a pace quicker than that of the corresponding period of last year
with the second quarter industrial output increasing 14 percent.
</P>
<P>
Polish economists said that the economic "overheating" which
began in the later half of last year has not yet cooled down,
hindering further development.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, trade deficit amounted to 12.7 billion U.S. dollars,
or 3 percent of the GDP. In the first five months of this year,
exports increased by 6.6 percent while imports soared by 23.4
percent, leading to an additional trade deficit of 4 billion
dollars.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that trade deficit of the whole year may amount
to 17.3 billion dollars, accounting for approximately 5.5 percent
of the GDP.
</P>
<P>
Adverse weather conditions have resulted in a lean year of
agriculture. Grain output has reduced by about 1 million tons,
making it difficult to curb price hikes. From January to June,
prices increased 16.1 percent over the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
In recent weeks, citizens in Warsaw, Krakow, Katowice and other
major cities fell prey to price rise. The prices for meat and
vegetables jumped from 30 to 50 percent, making it impossible to
bring inflation down to the planned 13 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
In the first half of the year, the financial situation worsened
with a rise in production costs and a drop in profits.

<HEADLINE> Hamas Claims Responsibility for Suicide Bombings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 31 (Xinhua) -- The armed wing of the Islamic
Resistance Movement (Hamas) claimed responsibility for Wednesday's
double suicide-bombing attack in Jewish west Jerusalem's central
open market, which killed 13 Israelis and wounded 168.
</P>
<P>
In a leaflet posted near the International Red Cross office in
the West Bank city of Ramallah, Hamas also demanded the release by
9 p.m. Sunday of its spiritual leader Sheikh Ahmed Yassin,
Hezbollah leader Sheikh Abdul Karim Obeid, and other security
prisoners and administrative detainees.
</P>
<P>
But the leaflet failed to mention what it would do when the
deadline expires.
</P>
<P>
The leaflet said that the bombing attack was "a present from
Mohammad's soldiers in response to the satanic leaflet that the
pigs distributed in Hebron," an apparent reference to the
leaflets depicting the Prophet Mohammad as a pig posted by an
Israeli woman in Hebron last month.

<HEADLINE> Israel Suspends Talks With PNA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 31 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli government has
decided to break off negotiations until the Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) smashes the terrorist infrastructure in its mist,
reported the state-run Israel Radio this morning.
</P>
<P>
The government also decided to allow Israeli security forces
to enter the Palestinian self-rule areas to carry out security
missions taking no notice of Palestinian sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's spokesman Shai
Bazak said that the negotiations, due to resume this week, would
remain in abeyance.
</P>
<P>
Bazak's statement came followed a late-night cabinet security
session debating on the serious situation in the wake of the
twin suicide bombing attack that took place in Jerusalem's
central open market Wednesday afternoon. A total of 13 Israelis
were killed and 168 wounded.
</P>
<P>
According to a four-point cabinet communique faxed to Xinhua
early this morning, the Ministerial Committee on National
Security decided on a number of steps in the wake of the
terrorist attack.
</P>
<P>
The communique said: "The committee directed the Israel
Defense Forces (IDF) and the security services to carry out a
series of security measures against the Palestinian terrorist
organizations."
</P>
<P>
"The Ministerial Committee on National Security views the
Palestinian National Authority as responsible for the acts of
terrorism and murder against innocent civilians in Jerusalem
since it did not take the steps which it was committed to
taking, including war on the terrorist organizations and their
infrastructure," said the communique.
</P>
<P>
The Ministerial Committee also demands that the PNA honor all
of its commitments to fight terrorist organizations and their
infrastructure, and prevent violence and incitement to violence,
said the communique.
</P>
<P>
It said that the Ministerial Committee determines that in
order for it to be possible to advance the peace process, the PNA
must honor all of its commitments, including -- first and
foremost -- to fight the terrorist organizations and their
infrastructure.

<P>
The Australian
</P>
<P>
-- Home buyers will save up to 32 Australian dollars (23.5 U.S.

interest rates half a percentage point Wednesday but most lenders
have defied the federal government's call for lower rates for
small business finance.
</P>
<P>
The Sydney Morning Herald
</P>
<P>
-- Treasurer Peter Costello has indicated that pensioners and
retirees may have to take a cut in interest rates on their savings
as a trade-off for banks passing on all of the latest official
interest rate reduction.
</P>
<P>
The Age
</P>
<P>
-- Australian Aboriginal activists continued their
international campaign against the federal government's native
title legislation, telling the U.N. conference in Geneva Wednesday

</P>
<P>
The Australian Financial Review
</P>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 31 (Xinhua) -- The UN Development Program (UNDP)
is joining China's efforts to reform water management and improve
the environment.
</P>
<P>
The UN agency and China International Center for Economic and
Technical Exchanges recently signed agreements on three new
projects into which the UNDP will put in more than two million US
dollars in grant assistance, said UNDP's China Office.
</P>
<P>
The projects are 21st Century Urban Water Management in China,
Capacity Building for Environmental Education in Primary and
Middle Schools through the Production of Interactive Teaching
Materials, and Capacity Development for Improving Traffic
Pollution Control in Beijing, according to today's "China Daily".
</P>
<P>
The urban water management project is expected to start next
month and last for two and half years. It aims to achieve
sustainable water use in urban areas, said Hou Xi'an with UNDP's
China Office.
</P>
<P>
The project will assist the Ministry of Construction in
improving water and waste water management by developing and
demonstrating an effective process for institutional reform and
implementation of a water demand management strategy.
</P>
<P>
Pilot activities will be carried out in Shijiazhuang, capital
of Hebei Province, to determine the most appropriate methodology.
</P>
<P>
An institutional reform strategy and an action plan will be
developed for a revised tariff structure to establish
self-financing water supply and waste water companies in the pilot
city. The results will be disseminated to other cities throughout
the country.
</P>
<P>
The China/UNDP environmental education project will last until
July 2000. It is designed to strengthen environmental awareness
and compliance by promoting interactive environmental education to
children.
</P>
<P>
The traffic pollution control project in Beijing aims to reduce
adverse social, environmental and economic consequences of
traffic-related air pollution in the capital city.
</P>
<P>
The two-year project, starting this month, will strengthen the
existing air pollution monitoring system in Beijing and collect
key data on vehicle emissions.

<HEADLINE> Northeast China's Grain Production Threatened By Drought </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 31 (Xinhua) -- The autumn grain output in
northeast China's Heilongjiang, Jilin and Liaoning provinces is
now threatened by a sustained drought this summer.
</P>
<P>
According to today's China Daily, some local rivers in the
three provinces have dried up for more than 40 days due to this
summer's long dry and hot weather there--the worst during the past
15 years.
</P>
<P>
In Jilin, the paper said, the rain fell between June 1 and July
21 was 43 percent less than the corresponding period last year and
16 percent less rainfall than in its worst ever drought 15 years
ago.
</P>
<P>
"Northeast China's severe drought will pose a serious threat to
the autumn grain crops scheduled for harvesting in about three
months if there is no rain in the next several weeks," the paper
said.
</P>
<P>
According to the paper, to date 12 million hectares of land
have been affected by the drought.

<HEADLINE> Asia Becomes Top U.S. Aerospace Export Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Asia has supplanted Europe as
the top market for U.S. aerospace exports, which rose almost 20
percent in 1996 to 39.6 billion U.S. dollars, the Aerospace
Industries Association (AIA) said.
</P>
<P>
The increase in export sales covered civilian and military
products, said David Vadas, director of AIA's Research Center in
an analysis, according to the latest edition of the Defense News
weekly.
</P>
<P>
Vadas said, Aerospace sales in Asia accounted for about 13
percent of total industry sales and 41 percent of all exports,
while the sales to the European Union accounted for 39.7 percent
of all exports.
</P>
<P>
"The Asia-Pacific market is critical to the industry's
success... and it's ours to lose," he said. U.S. restrictions on
defense sales to China, Vietnam and other Asia Pacific nations
give a free hand to Russia, Vadas added.
</P>
<P>
According to AIA figures, the Middle East ranks third for U.S.
aerospace exports, with 7.2 percent of all export sales, followed
by Canada, 7 percent, Latin America, 4.1 percent, and Central
Europe, 0.6 percent.

<HEADLINE> Nation to Begin Rural Pilot Census </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 31 (Xinhua) -- The State Council has decided to
begin a pilot census in China's small towns and to tighten census
management in rural areas, China Daily reported today.
</P>
<P>
State Council Secretary-General and State Councillor Luo Gan
said yesterday that the decision has been made in line with the
requirement for building socialist market economy.
</P>
<P>
Luo told a national teleconference yesterday that improving the
census in counties, townships and rural areas was important to
people's lives and was linked with economic development, social
progress and stability.
</P>
<P>
The changes were needed because in the last few years many
farmers have moved from the countryside to small towns in search
of work. The population shift has made the government's job of
providing social services difficult.
</P>
<P>
Under the new system, people who used to be farmers but are
currently working in pilot counties and townships can apply for
permanent residence in the small towns.
</P>
<P>
Those who have stable jobs and have lived at least two years in
the new areas can become permanent residents there.
</P>
<P>
This will help promote the orderly transfer of surplus rural
labor to small towns, ease population pressure on large- and
medium-sized cities and help modernize rural areas, Luo said.

<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, July 31 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar Mines Minister kyaw Min has
urged local gems and jade mining entrepreneurs as well as
merchants to observe the Gemstone Law promulgated in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Meeting with the entrepreneurs here Thursday, the minister

country after paying 20 percent tax and receiving inspection and
assessment of their mined gems.
</P>
<P>
The state-run newspaper The New Light of Myanmar today quoted

According to the Myanmar Gemstone Law, the mined gems and jade
should be sold on the designated Panglong Yadana Gems Market of
the state-run Myanmar Gems Enterprise, with large and fine quality
ones permissible to be sold at two state-sponsored annual gems
emporiums.
</P>
<P>
The law also allows private entrepreneurs to transport and sell
 freely within Myanmar their finished gemstone and manufactured
jewelry or export.

<HEADLINE> IMF Proposes Faster Privatization for Thailand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 31 (Xinhua) -- Senior officials of the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) have proposed that Thailand
speed up its privatization program and open its commercial banks
to foreign equity holding in excess of 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Thai government on Monday decided to seek an emergency
credit line from the IMF and work out an economic revival program.
</P>
<P>
Rescue measures prescribed by IMF economic experts who are now
in Bangkok working with Thai authorities also envisage tax
reforms, flotation of utility rates, higher value-added tax,
strict controls on private sector debt creation and no help for
finance and securities firms.
</P>
<P>
The IMF also wants the Thai currency to stabilize at 30 baht to
the US dollar, the tax base broadened, tax collection improved and
monetary policy tightened.
</P>
<P>
The IMF officials have proposed growth be kept at 4-5 percent,
inflation no more than 7 percent and the current account deficit
no more than 5 percent of gross domestic product, according to
Surasak Nananukul, an adviser to the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
However, the package would hurt if implemented in its entirety,
he said, but the government would make counter-proposals to
cushion the impact on the people.
</P>
<P>
Thai Airways International (THAI) and the State Railway of
Thailand have been identified as prime candidates for
privatization.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Thai economists warned on Wednesday the people to
face the pain in the near future.
</P>
<P>
Suwinai Pornvilai, an economist of Thammasat University's
faculty of economics, said the IMF will examine ways for Thailand
to repay debts it owes to international financial institutes, and
will make Thailand increase value-added tax and fees for public
utilities, allow financial institutions with problems to collapse
and cut extravagant expenses.

<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, July 30 (Xinhua) -- The Canadian government today welcomed
the decision of the United Nations Security Council to create a new UN
Transition Mission in Haiti.
</P>
<P>
"Canada believes that maintaining a UN presence in Haiti will help
consolidate the peace process there and build a solid foundation for
economic development," said Canada's Foreign Affairs Minister Lloyd
Axworthy.
</P>
<P>
The new mission will be made up of a civilian police force of 250,
including 60 Canadians, and a military protection force of 1,000, to
which Canada is contributing 650 soldiers
</P>
<P>
It will pick up from the current peacekeeping mission, whose
mandate expires tomorrow, for a four-month mandate until the end of
November.
</P>
<P>
The mission's mandate is to offer protection to the civilian police
officers and contribute to the development of the Haitian National
Police.
</P>
<P>
The UN established a presence in Haiti in March 1995, with Canada
in command since March 1996.
</P>
<P>
The new mission is "clearly the last of the peacekeeping missions
there" since Haiti has already indicated that it would make no further
requests for UN peacekeeping troops, according to the Canadian
government.

<HEADLINE> Turkmenistan's GDP Falls Sharply in First Half of 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Turkmenistan's gross domestic
product (GDP) slid 29 percent in the first six months of 1997 over
the same period last year, marking the biggest economic decline
among the 12 former Soviet republics.
</P>
<P>
The figures, released by the State Statistics Committee, showed
that industrial output fell 35.2 percent during the January-June
period.
</P>
<P>
Turkmenistan's grain harvest was only half the planned 1.2
million tons.
</P>
<P>
Turkmenistan's economy is predominantly agricultural. In recent
years, over-intensive cultivation of the principal crop, cotton,
together with massive irrigation projects, have led to serious
ecological damage.
</P>
<P>
At a cabinet meeting today, President Saparmurad Niyazov
demanded better development of the country's potential and asked
integrated agricultural companies to pick no less than 1.4 million
tons of cotton by December 15, 1997.
</P>
<P>
Now Turkmenistan is leasing farmland to individual farmers on a
long-term basis in a bid to make the country self-sufficient in
food.
</P>
<P>
Compared with other former Soviet republics, Turkmenistan
adopted a more cautious approach towards the implementation of
market economic reforms, concerned that the population's living
standards should not, as a consequence, deteriorate drastically.
</P>
<P>
The privatization of state property in the country, to be
effected in three stages, started only in December 1993,
considerably later than in other republics.

LIMA, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Peru had a trade deficit equivalent
to 491 million U.S. dollars in the first half of this year, or 45
percent less than the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
While announcing the figure today, the Commission for the

</P>
<P>
The trade balance for June was 13 million dollars in surplus
after five years of monthly deficits.
</P>
<P>
The downward trend of deficit is due to a better balance
between exports and imports. The increase in non-traditional
exports stand out among its overseas sales.
</P>
<P>
PROMPEX General Manager Antonio Castillo said the increase in
non-traditional exports was due to lower tariffs and the

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 30 (Xinhua) -- President Bill Clinton today
condemned bombings in Jerusalem that killed at least 18 people,
saying it was a "barbarous act."
</P>
<P>
The explosions occurred in the afternoon in Jerusalem at a
crowded outdoor vegetable market, killing at least 18 and wounding
more than 150. There was no immediate claim of responsibility for
the attacks.
</P>
<P>
"The slaughter was aimed directly at innocent Israelis,"
Clinton said in a statement at the White House briefing room. "It
was also aimed at the majority of Israelis, Palestinians and Arabs
who want a lasting and just peace."
</P>
<P>
"We must not let the enemies of peace prevail," he continued.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Clinton telephoned Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu to express his condolences.
</P>
<P>
"I told him the hearts and prayers of Americans are with him,
the people of Israel, and the victims of the attack and their
families," he told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Clinton also announced postponement of plans to send special
U.S. mediator Dennis Ross to the Middle East until a period of
mourning can be observed. Ross had been scheduled to depart for
Israel tonight.
</P>
<P>
"The trip (of Ross) will be postponed for a period -- an
appropriate period of mourning," he said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said he would continue his efforts to push forward the
Middle East peace process and any suggestion that he was not
"personally involved" was false.
</P>
<P>
"I believe my personal involvement has been continuing and
intense in this (peace process)," he said. "But I know of no
example in recent history where peace is made by third parties
trying to be helpful, making public statements alone."

<HEADLINE> US New Home Sales Jump by 6.1 Percent in June </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 30 (Xinhua) -- New home sales in the U.S.
jumped by 6.1 percent in June to the highest level since March,
the U.S. Commerce Department reported today.
</P>
<P>
The department said that sales of new single-family homes
totaled a seasonally adjusted 819,000 annual rate, up from a
sharply revised 772,000 a month earlier. May sales were revised
downward from the originally estimated annual rate of 825,000.
</P>
<P>
The sales in June were the highest since 825,000 in March and
were the fourth above 800,000 this year.
</P>
<P>
Regionally, sales shot up 12.4 percent in the West. They rose
by 9.2 percent in the South and 7 percent in the Midwest. But
sales plunged 21.1 percent in the Northeast.
</P>
<P>
The strong sale of new homes in June resulted from a sound
economy and favorable 30-year mortgage rates that fell to 7.69
percent in June, down from 7.94 percent in May and 8.32 percent in
June 1996.
</P>
<P>
So far this year, sales of new homes in the U.S. were 8.1
percent above those of the first six months of last year. However,
analysts are predicting sales will level off this year after
reaching 757,000 in 1996, the most since 1978.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the seasonally adjusted estimate of new
homes for sale at the end of June was 282,000, smallest since
278,000 in July 1993. It represented a supply of 4.2 months at the
current sales rate, smallest since a 4.1 month supply in July 1971.
</P>
<P>
The June inventory marked the sixth straight month of fewer
than five months' supply, the longest period since September
1970-August 1971.

<HEADLINE> Sexual Harassment, Crime in Southern Africa: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Strides have been made in most
Southern African Development Community (SADC) member states to
recognize sexual harassment as a criminal offense, gender
activist Patricia Mcfadden said here today.
</P>
<P>
Mcfadden said there had been significant progress since the
program to make sexual harassment a crime was introduced at
various universities in the region three years ago.
</P>
<P>
''There is an active network in the region in which women are
fighting back, insisting that sexual harassment be recognized as
a criminal offense,'' the South African activist said at the
four-day conference on the girl child which ends Thursday.
</P>
<P>
She said the effects of sexual harassment were far reaching as
the victims suffered psychologically and physically.
</P>
<P>
''It's more than just touching, it's also a violation of the
integrity,'' she said, adding that it was an imposition of sexism
and an expression of male supremacy.
</P>
<P>
It is difficult to fight sexual harassment because it has been
culturalized, she said, with men who normally are among the
violators, often arguing that it is cultural to admire and touch
women even against their will.
</P>
<P>
The program, she said, was strategically targeted at
universities as the graduates would be future industrialists.

In 1996, the volume registered a slip of 2.59 percent from 1.16
trillion won (1.30 billion dollars ) the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The issuance of convertible bonds, which had declined steadily
since 1994, also increased remarkably this year, with 931.8
billion won (1.05 billion dollars) worth of bonds issued as of
July 29, already approaching the 1996 total of 1.02 trillion won
(1.15 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
Market observers attributed the rise to increased participation
by individual and foreign investors, as well as the successive
foreign investment limit hikes over the past two years.
</P>
<P>
Issuance of convertible bonds is favored more than ever, due
to increased hopes of a market recovery after a long-term bear
market, they said.
</P>
<P>
Changes in bonds trade regulations, which allow investors to
convert their holdings into stocks after three months, instead of
the previous six months, have also added to the appeal of such
bonds, they added.
</P>
<P>
They predicted the trend to continue for the rest of the year.

<HEADLINE> Iran's President-Elect to Be Sworn in August 4 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Iran's President-elect Mohammad
Khatami will be sworn in as the country's fifth president on
August 4, Parliament Speaker Ali Akbar Nateq-Nouri announced here
today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a formal session of the parliament, Nateq-Nouri
said the swearing-in ceremony would take place at nine o'clock
that morning.
</P>
<P>
It is expected to be attended by outgoing President Hashemi
Rafsanjani, head of the Judiciary Mohammad Yazdi, top civilian and
military officials, leaders of the religious minorities and the
diplomatic corps in the capital of Tehran.
</P>
<P>
According to parliament procedure, the new president is
required, with two weeks after inauguration, to introduce his
cabinet as well as his administrative program to the parliament.
</P>
<P>
The parliament will start study of the program and
composition of the cabinet in three five-hour sessions within one
week and the cast ballots in a vote of confidence.
</P>
<P>
So far, the president-elect has been withholding the make-up of
his government.
</P>
<P>
Local press reported that Iran's Permanent Representative at
the United Nations, Kamal Kharrazi, will be the next foreign
minister to replace Ali Akbar Velayati, who held the post for 16
years.
</P>
<P>
First Vice-President Hassan Habibi is to be renominated for
the post to ensure continuation of the development programs under
the Rafsanjani government.
</P>
<P>
Vice-President for executive affairs Mohammad Hashemi, who is
brother of Rafsanjani, will likely maintain his position and
Mohammad Ali Najafi, currently Minister of Education, may take
over as head of the Plan and Budget Organization.
</P>
<P>
Mostafa Hashemitaba, vice-president for physical training
affairs, will probably retain his post, while Admiral Ali
Shamkhani will become defense minister.
</P>
<P>
Khatami, 54, won a landslide victory over his main rival
Nateq-Nouri during the May 23 presidential election, in which the
most massive turnout since the victory of the 1979 Islamic
Revolution was recorded.

<HEADLINE> SADC to Use Satellite for land-mine Clearance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 30 (Xinhua) -- The Southern African
Development Community (SADC) will introduce satellite mapping
technology to clear land mines throughout the sub-region.
</P>
<P>
SADC Executive Secretary Kaire Mbuende said in Gaborone today
that the drive will cost about 2.2 million U.S Dollars.
</P>
<P>
SADC plans to use the new technology to spot land mines laid
during conflicts and determine a precise figure of the explosive
devices in Southern Africa,the official was quoted by the local
press as saying.
</P>
<P>
Mbuende describes the exercise as a systematic cleaning
campaign to be carried out in such countries as Angola and
Mozambique, which are among the most heavily-mined countries in
the world.
</P>
<P>
SADC, comprising 12 Southern African countries, was formed in
1992 in Windhoek, Namibia, to lead the region to a free trade
zone by the year 2000.

<HEADLINE> Violent Crime Rate Highest in UK Among European Nations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Britain has the highest rates of
violent crime, burglary and car theft among European countries,
according to a latest survey published today.
</P>
<P>
The International Crime Victimization Survey of 19,000 adults
in 11 countries including the UK, France, Sweden, Switzerland,
Finland and Austria, as well as Canada and the US revealed a
depressing picture of extremely high crime rates and fearfulness
among Britain's population.
</P>
<P>
The joint Home Office-funded study found that one in three
people in Britain have been a victim of crime, joint highest with
the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
With crimes involving robbery, assault and sexual assault, the
highest risks are also in Britain. Three percent of people in
Britain have had their cars stolen, the highest rate.
</P>
<P>
It is also highest for theft from cars, with about one in 10
people in Britain suffering a break in.
</P>
<P>
Britain comes second, only behind the Netherlands, when
examining comparative risks in terms of the number of crimes
experienced per citizen, with 61 offenses per 100 people.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Britain has slipped to having the highest
crime rate, from being sixth out of 15 countries in a 1989 survey.

<HEADLINE> U.S. House of Representatives Passes Defense Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 30 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. House of
Representatives Tuesday passed a defense bill of 248 billion
dollars which is to fund new military hardware and increase
military pay, but would halt U.S. ground operations in Bosnia
after June 30, 1998.
</P>
<P>
The bill, approved by a vote of 322-105 in the house, would
demand some four billion dollars more than the Clinton
administration planned for hardware and equipment, and 770 million
more for research and development programs.
</P>
<P>
President Bill Clinton has threatened to veto the bill, which
was 4.4 billion dollars more than his budget request and 3.9
billion more than this year's military spending.
</P>
<P>
Under the bill, the United States would spend 505 million
dollars on B-52 bombers this year, an increase of 331 million
dollars over last year, and 3.67 billion dollars on missile
defense programs.
</P>
<P>
The bill would also allow 79 million dollars for the Defense
Department programs dealing with the Gulf War-related
events.

<HEADLINE> Three English Men for Murder Convictions Exonerated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 30 (Xinhua) -- The English Court of Appeal today
exonerated three men who spent 18 years in prison for the murder
of a newspaper delivery boy.
</P>
<P>
The court quashed the convictions of Michael Hickey, his cousin
Vincent, James Robinson and a fourth defendant Patrick Molloy, who
died in prison in 1981, for the murder of 13-year-old Carl
Bridgewater, shot dead during a robbery in 1978.
</P>
<P>
"We have concluded that the appellants did not have a fair
trial and for that reason have quashed their convictions," Lord
Justice John Roch told the court.
</P>
<P>
"This is another case of a miscarriage of justice which is a
matter of regret for this court," he added.
</P>
<P>
The three men were released on unconditional bail in February
after prosecution lawyers said their trial was fundamentally
flawed and the convictions unsafe.
</P>
<P>
The men, known as the Bridgewater Four, had always protested
their innocence and had staged hunger strikes during their
imprisonment. Now they are seeking compensations for their 18-year
wrongful sentence.
</P>
<P>
During the one-month appeal hearing, lawyer Michael Mansfield
accused police of tricking Molloy into signing a false confession
and said a squad of police officers had conducted a carefully
cultivated strategy of deception.
</P>
<P>
The Appeal Court ruled that Molloy's confession had probably
been obtained by deceit and was inadmissable.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: It's a Win-Win for EU and Boeing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Though the European Commission
pronounced the go-ahead to the Boeing-McDonnell Douglas merger,
concessions were made as much if not more on the American side
than from across the Atlantic Ocean.
</P>
<P>
A damaging trade war was averted at last after seven months of
paperwork and negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The environment for competition was seemingly rendered more
fair as the Europeans okayed the move on conditions that Boeing
cedes all its existing and would-be exclusive supply deals, or at
least it has to refrain from such exclusivity until the year 2007.
</P>
<P>
This, alongside Boeing commitment not to abuse relationship
with customers and suppliers, is hoped to leave some leeway for
Airbus to land some orders in the United States.
</P>
<P>
The Europeans also required McDonnell Douglas to "fence" up its
commercial aircraft activities and they themselves, too, can use
through the licensing mechanism the aeronautic patents developed
under the auspices of U.S. governmental subsidy and public
funding.
</P>
<P>
All told, Boeing has made "substantial" concessions that took
care of Union officials' main concerns and led to the anti-trust
settlement.
</P>
<P>
Although the American aircraft makers backstepped from the
starting line of another round of competition in the global
aircraft market, the Europeans do not look to having a feasible
chance to get abreast with their American counterparts.
</P>
<P>
Now that the completion of the Boeing-MD merger is only a
matter of time, their carriers will soon expand from the current
Boeing market share of 64 percent to a combined 70 percent while
their share in the service fleet worldwide is to rise from 60
percent to a dazzling, if not damaging, 84 percent.
</P>
<P>
And what's more, the Boeing-MD combined market share is about
two thirds of the EU market, where airlines are forecast to
account for almost a third of future demands for commercial
aircraft over the next decade.
</P>
<P>
By grabbing for itself a market sharing opportunity with
billions upon billions of ECUs or Euros looming on the horizon,
the European Union has also reciprocated more of the bonanza to
the United States.
</P>
<P>
But should things go wrong after 2007, trade rows are destined
to return to between Boeing-MD and its archrival in the European
continent, the Airbus consortium.

<HEADLINE> Alatas: No Deadline for Cambodia's Entry into ASEAN </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Cambodia's entry into the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) is still awaiting
the agreement of two conflicting parties in Cambodia, Indonesian
Foreign Minister Ali Alatas said here today.
</P>
<P>
"The membership of ASEAN might be determined during Cambodia's
election in May 1998, or before or after the poll when the two
warring factions in that country reach an agreement. No deadline
has been set for Cambodia's entry," he said after having talks
with his Canadian counterpart Llyod Axworthy.
</P>
<P>
Axworthy arrived here Tuesday for a three-day visit to
Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN now groups Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines,
Singapore, Thailand, Vietnam, Laos and Myanmar. Cambodia was
delayed to enter the grouping because of political crisis in the
country.
</P>
<P>
Alatas along with Thai Foreign Minister Prachuab Chaiyasarn and
Philippine Foreign Minister Domingo Siazon plan to meet Cambodia's
Second Prime Minister Hun Sen in Phnom Penh late this week.
</P>
<P>
"Certainly, ASEAN is interested in helping to end the crisis in
Cambodia, but this is not the right time for me to tell the
press," he said.
</P>
<P>
Alatas did not elaborate on the topics the three ministers will
discuss with Hun Sen.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, an agreement between the two warring
factions, namely, the Cambodian People's Party (CCP) led by Hun
Sen and FUNCINPEC led by First Prime Minister Norodom Ranariddh,
plays a significant role in ending the Cambodian crisis.
</P>
<P>
He said a formation of a coalition cabinet and Cambodia's
election next year are two important factors to end the conflict.
"Whoever wins the election should be acknowledged by the Cambodian
people," he added.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Condemns Jerusalem Bomb Attack </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Egypt strongly denounced today the
two bomb explosions that rocked a bustling market in Jerusalem,
killing 13 people and wounding more than 150, the Middle East News
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak condemned the two deadly
bombings as "a sabotage" to the peace process and conveyed his
condolences to relatives of the victims.
</P>
<P>
"The Egyptian stance is clear, which denounces all kinds of
violence that works against the Mideast peace process," Mubarak
told reporters.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian leader said he had had telephone contacts with
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and President Ezer
Weizman after the bloody suicide bombings which took place at
around 10:15 GMT.
</P>
<P>
In another telephone conversation with Palestinian National
Authority President Yasser Arafat after the tragedy, Mubarak said
he stressed the importance of going all out to fight back "those
provocations against the efforts to save Mideast peace."
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Amr Moussa also expressed his condolences to
families of the victims and said the bombings "apparently do not
contribute to peace."
</P>
<P>
He stressed that all kinds of perpetrations against the peace
process have wrecked great pains upon both Palestinians and
Israelis.
</P>
<P>
The peace process should not be stopped, he said, adding that
"At this crucial time, it is important to continue the efforts to
achieve just and lasting peace."
</P>
<P>
Moussa also called for "restraint" from all parties in the
aftermath of the deadly bombings. "I hope all peace-loving people,
especially those in Israel, to cling to saving the peace process,
which is the only way to safeguard their security," he noted.
</P>
<P>
So far no one has claimed responsibility for the suicide
bombings in the main fruit and vegetable market in West
Jerusalem. But Israel blamed them on Palestinian militants which
oppose peace with Israel and have launched similar attacks in the
past.

JOHANNESBURG, July 30 (Xinhua) -- South Africa today condemned
a suicide bombing in West Jerusalem, in which 18 people were
killed and more than 150 others injured.
</P>
<P>
In its statement, the South African Foreign Affairs Department
described the bombing as "a despicable atrocity", and urged
parties concerned to avoid any actions or retaliation which might
exacerbate tensions, and to continue with peace talks.

accept that the only road to a lasting and just peace lies in
negotiation.
</P>

The statement also expressed regret at the loss of life and
extended condolences to those injured and the families of those
killed.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Urges Arafat To Take Stiff Anti-Terror </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu today urged Palestinian National Authority (PNA) to take
stiff anti-terror actions following two bomb explosions in
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
"We expect not words of consolation from the Palestinian
Authority. What we expect is action to apprehend these terrorists
and their leaders," said Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu announced the statement when he was addressing a
hastily-arranged press conference following the twin bomb
explosions in the central open market in Jerusalem this
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
A total of 14 people, apparently including two suicide bombers,
were killed and 170 were injured. The incident is the most serious
one in terms of casualties since he came to power more than a year
ago.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the bombing attack, Palestinian President Yasser
Arafat telephoned Netanyahu condemning the attack and expressing
condolences to the families of the victims.
</P>
<P>
Referring apparently to Arafat's gestures, Netanyahu said in
his statement that Israel needs cooperation from the
PNA. "Security cooperation can stop terrorism," he added.
</P>
<P>
Instead, he said, the PNA released some 150 terrorists of Hamas
and Islamic Jihad and they were set free to approach Israel's
cities and streets and commit barbarous acts.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu said: "we expect action to collect explosives and
weapons. They are there in the field and can be collected."
</P>
<P>
The premier concluded: "I expect (from the PNA) not words of
condolence alone, words of condemnation alone, words of reproach
alone, but words that educate and call on the Palestinian
population to rise against terrorism." "That is what we expect
and we have every right to expect that," he said.

<HEADLINE> Chiluba Urges Revitalization of China-aided </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania and Zambia have no
plans to privatize the China-aided joint Tanzania-Zambia railway
(TAZARA) but would further commercialize and revitalize it,
Zambian President Frederick Chiluba said today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters here this afternoon at the end of his
three-day state visit, Chiluba said TAZARA has been privatized
enough and the immediate task is to raise efficiency and
innovativeness.
</P>
<P>
"We are not talking about privatization of TAZARA. Our goal is
to enhance efficiency and enable TAZARA to compete effectively in
this liberalized market," the Zambian president said.
</P>
<P>
He paid tribute to the founding fathers of the two nations,
Julius Nyerere and Kenith Kaunda, saying the spirit of TAZARA
must not be killed by those running the entity.
</P>
<P>
"If the management lacks innovativeness and enterprise then
something must be done about it," said Chiluba.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the two presidents have urged the private sector to
boost economic production, trade and investments in agriculture,
manufacturing industry, small-scale mining, communication,
transport and tourism.
</P>
<P>
According to a joint communique issued here today, the two
presidents have also agreed to reactivate the sub-commission on
trade, industry and finance to facilitate and promote cooperation
in trade, industry and finance.
</P>
<P>
They further agreed on improving the performance of the two
jointly-owned institutions, TAZARA and the Tanzania-Zambia
Pipeline (TAZAMA).
</P>
<P>
On regional issues, the two presidents reaffirmed support for
the decisions made on Burundi on April 16 this year, during the
fourth Arusha regional summit.
</P>
<P>
However, they expressed regret that the installation of the
government of national unity and reconstruction in Angola had so
far not led to the restoration of permanent peace and stability
in that country.
</P>
<P>
They expressed concern at the resumption of fighting in some
parts of the country and called upon the parties to the conflict
to adhere to the letter and spirit of the Lusaka protocol of
November in 1994.
</P>
<P>
On Liberia, the two presidents welcomed the holding of free
and fair elections and urged the people to embark upon the
reconstruction of their country.
</P>
<P>
President Chiluba and his delegation left for home after the
press conference and were seen off at the Dar es Salaam
International Airport by President Mkapa and other senior
government officials.

institutions in the country," Matiba said at a press conference.
</P>
<P>
"The conference must have a neutral chair, a neutral venue and
an open floor," noted Matiba, charging both the parliament and
the NCEC are strongly biased and thus do not represent the views
of Kenyans.
</P>
<P>
NCEC, an umbrella body set up in April by Opposition parties
to coordinate their campaign for reforms, now is an interested
party which cannot represent the Opposition in the reforms debate
with President Daniel arap Moi, Matiba stressed.
</P>
<P>
Main Opposition leaders, including several FORD-Asili members
of parliament, reached agreement last week to undertake the
dialogue through NCEC and within the institutional framework the
NCEC provides.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Matiba called on Moi to step down within five days
beginning today, otherwise FORD-Asili would begin mass action
including the boycott of shops and businesses, especially those
owned by Asian Kenyans, he said.
</P>
<P>
Matiba also vowed to take action to press for a fresh
population census, the establishment of an independent electoral
commission, free access by political parties to media, redrawing
of constituency boundaries and so on.
</P>
<P>
FORD-Asili is one of the five registered Opposition parties in
the east African country but its leader Matiba, a member of
parliament, did not register as a voter during the voter
registration held from May to June.
</P>
<P>
The opposition has so far failed to pick a team to discuss
constitutional reforms with the government since Moi softened his
stance by meeting with official Opposition leader Kijana Wamalwa
and 19 key religious leaders and pledging dialogue in mid-July.
</P>
<P>
The government's shifts of position came days after the most
violent conflicts between the police and the Opposition
supporters in seven years broke out, claiming 13 lives around the
country on July 7.

<HEADLINE> British Armed Forces to Maintain Global Military Role </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 30 (Xinhua) -- British Defense Secretary George
Robertson said here today that the new Labor government would seek
to make the country's armed forces continue to play a global role.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the House of Commons' defense committee early today,
Robertson said, "We have to keep a broad balance of capabilities
so we can do what the people want us to do. What we have rejected
is the idea of minimal defense."
</P>
<P>
He stressed that Britain should maintain its armed forces in a
rapidly changing world. "In Europe today, we can see how
instability can so easily escalate into major conflict with
consequences which spill over borders and threaten our own
national security," he said.
</P>
<P>
The defense secretary pledged that the coutry's defense
spending would not be slashed but he made it clear the military
would have to make better use of its budget.
</P>
<P>
"The British people want strong defense for this country but
they don't want defense at any price and we must justify every
pound which is spent in the defense budget," he said.
</P>
<P>
Writing in today's Independent Newspaper, Robertson said, "We
are going to examine whether Britain should spend the money to
have a substantial role in situations like Bosnia or other
international crises."
</P>
<P>
He said, "With the end of the Cold War we have the opportunity
to decide what kind of contribution we wish to make to
international security."
</P>
<P>
"In truth, the British people want Britain to play a
substantial role in NATO, and to play a wider role in
international politics," he added.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania's Export Earnings Decline Last Month </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Export earnings for the
country went down by 10.6 percent as import bill increased by
24.6 percent last June, the Bank of Tanzania (BoT) disclosed
today.
</P>
<P>
The BoT said in its monthly economic review report that export
earnings dropped largely due to a decrease of 24.6 percent in
traditional exports and a decline of 2.3 percent in
non-traditional exports.
</P>
<P>
The BoT explained in the report issued here that the level of
receipts from traditional exports was low on account of a
decrease in both the volume and unit prices.
</P>
<P>
It said coffee was the only traditional crop which realized
increase in export earnings by one percent while others such as
cotton, sisal, tea, tobacco and cashew nuts registered decreases
in export volumes.
</P>
<P>
The BoT report, however, said sisal and tobacco enjoyed higher
export unit prices, but the sharp decline in export volume led to
lower earnings from tobacco.
</P>
<P>
It said the overall decrease in export volume was the major
factor for the poor performance of traditional exports.
</P>
<P>
On imports, the report said the major reasons for the increase
recorded was due to increases in all major categories, namely,
capital goods, intermediate goods, and consumer goods which
increased by 9.8 percent, 68 percent and 6 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhilets, the report said there was a surge in the imports of
building and construction equipment and machinery within the
capital goods category, which was an indication of expanding
investment activities in both construction and the manufacturing
sector.
</P>
<P>
The report also indicated that imports of food and food stuffs
increased by 102.3 percent during June, while other consumer
goods declined by nearly 4 percent to 21 million U.S. Dollars.
</P>
<P>
The BoT said in its report that the government's budgetary
performance last month was outstanding, with revenue collection
picking up from 46.3 billion Tanzania shillings (about 77 million
US Dollars) in May to 57.2 billion T. Shs. (about 95 million US
Dollars) and expenditure stagnating at around 52 billion T. Shs
(about 86 million Dollars).
</P>
<P>
It said the favorable situation improved the monthly overall
balance from a deficit of 5.8 billion T. Shs. (about 9.6 million
US Dollars) in May to a surplus of 4.6 billion T. Shs. (about 7.6
million US Dollars), while revenue collection reached 572 billion
T. Shs. (about 953 million US Dollars) in 1996/97, equivalent to
17.3 percent of GDP.
</P>
<P>
The bank said the records compared favorably with the revenue
target for the year, which was 563.8 billion T. Shs. (about 939
million US Dollars) or 17.1 percent of GDP.

<HEADLINE> Round-up: Bombs Kill 14 in Jerusalem, Setting Back </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 30 (Xinhua) -- In a major setback to the
Israeli-Palestinian peace process, two suspected Palestinian
suicide bombers blew themselves up in a bustling Jerusalem market
today, killing 14 people and injuring 170 others.
</P>
<P>
This was the first suicide bombing attack since the March 22
suicide bombing of a Tel Aviv cafe and one of the worst terror
attacks against Israel since the peace process began in 1993.
</P>
<P>
Two loud explosions occurred in seconds apart around 1:15
p.m. local time in the Mahane Yehuda open market, which was
packed with customers shopping for vegetables, fruits and other
daily necessities.
</P>
<P>
Eyewitnesses said that they saw two Palestinians wearing
shirts and ties entering the market, each carrying a huge bag
which police investigators late estimated to contain 10 kilograms
of explosives. One of them sat in front of a store at the
junction linking the market to the busy Jaffa Street and
detonated his bomb, and 20 seconds later another bomber blew
himself up.
</P>
<P>
Police said at least 14 people, including the two bombers,
were killed and 170 others were wounded in the blasts, which
badly devastated the nearby stores and cut down people from all
directions.
</P>
<P>
The scene was covered with bodies, blood and debris, and the
crowd there was chaotic, panic and hysteric as the wounded and
shocked survivors screamed and cried. Ambulances, police and
rescue workers quickly rushed to the site to evacuate the wounded
and collect body parts of some worst hit victims.
</P>
<P>
Police immediately sealed off the market area and ordered
the closure of the shops in order to search for more bombs
with bomb-sniffing dogs, but no other bombs were found.
</P>
<P>
So far, no one has claimed responsibility for the attacks,
though police suspected them to be carried out by anti-Israeli
extremist Palestinian organizations. Suicide bombings in Israel
were usually carried out by two militant Islamic organizations
the Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) and the smaller Islamic
Jihad. From late February to early March last year, they
launched a wave of suicide bombing attacks in public buses
in Jerusalem, Tel Aviv and Ashkelon, killing 62 people and
wounding hundreds others.
</P>
<P>
A large crowd gathered near the scene, many of them were
anxious to know whether any members of their family or relatives
were killed or wounded. Scores of ultra-rightist demonstrators
held a demonstration, shouting "Death to Arabs" and calling for
the government to end the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Police had to escort the Arab workers employed at the market
out of the area for fear that the extremist Jews would carry out
revenge attacks against them. Two leaders of the ultra-rightist
Kache Movement and three other demonstrators were arrested by the
police.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 30 (Xinhua) --
</P>
<P>
Reactions were swiftly coming from all sides. Israeli
government strongly condemned the Palestinian National Authority
(PNA) for refusing to crack down on anti-Israeli terrorism and
even encouraging it. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu held
immediate consulations with senior ministers, including Foreign
Minister David Levy and Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai and
Infrastructure Minister Ariel Sharon.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu's spokesman David Bar-Illan blamed the PNA for the
attacks, warning the peace process could not continue as long as
the terrorism was not eliminated. But he fell short of declaring
to cancel the planned resumption of the Israeli-Palestinian peace
talks within the week.
</P>
<P>
PNA President Yasser Arafat telephoned both Netanyahu and
Israeli President Ezer Weizman to condemn the attacks as "a crime
against the peace process." He offered condolences to the
victims, adding that much more needed to be done to prevent
further terror attacks.
</P>
<P>
However, Netanyahu told Arafat that condolences were not
enough and the PNA should make a U-turn in both his words and
actions by taking concrete measures to stamp out terrorism. In a
news conference held late the afternoon, Netanyahu demanded the
PNA act to crack down not only terrorist organizations, but
also the infrastructure that support them.
</P>
<P>
PNA officials called on Israeli government to act with
sanity and reason and to proceed with the peace process so
to stamp out the terrorism. Chief Palestinian Negotiator Saeb
Erekat said the PNA has been and will be doing 100 percent
to fight terrorism. He said the only answer to terrorism
should be for both Israelis and Palestinians to send out a
strong message by resuming and advancing the peace process.
</P>
<P>
For security reasons, Israeli troops reimposed a total
closure on the West Bank and Gaza Strip, and ordered over
50,000 Palestinians working in Israel to return home. And all
Israelis were barred from entering the Palestinian territories.
</P>
<P>
The bombing attacks also were condemned by international
leaders. U.S. President Bill Clinton called them a "barbarous
act" against innocent people. He called on the PNA to take
concrete actions to crack down on terrorism and increase
security cooperation with Israel. He said the only answer to
terrorism should be deepening determination by both Israel and
the PNA to advance the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Jordanian Foreign Minister Fayez Tarawneh said Jordan condemned
and categorically rejected such acts of terrorism. He also
hoped that the peace process would continue despite the
bombings.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak phoned Netanyahu today to
express condolences and the hope that the peace process would
continue.
</P>
<P>
Today's bombings came at a time when the Palestinians and
Israelis had agreed to resume peace talks this week, giving hope
to break the prolonged deadlock in the peace talks, which have
been stalled since Israel started building the Har Homa
settlement in East Jerusalem in March.
</P>
<P>
The long-term implications of the bombings remained unclear
at the time, but the immediate setback was the cancellation
of a planned visit here tomorrow by U.S. special peace envoy
Dennis Ross on a new round of mediation. Washington announced
to delay Ross' mission shortly after the bombing attacks.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that even if lower-level talks would be
resumed as scheduled, no major progress could be made when
the two sides remained dubious about each other's commitments
to peace.
</P>
<P>
The bombings, worst since Israel's hardline Likud government
came to power over one year ago, also tested Netanyahu's
election promises to bring the nation peace with security.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Condemns Bomb Attack in Jerusalem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus issued a statement today
strongly condemning the bomb attack in Jerusalem earlier in the
day, which left 14 people dead and more than 150 injured.
</P>
<P>
In the statement issued here this evening, the Ministry of
Foreign Affairs said "Cyprus is appalled by today's indiscriminate
terrorist bomb attack against civilians in Jerusalem which
resulted in the loss of so many innocent lives."
</P>
<P>
"Such condemnable acts can never be justified to support any
cause", the ministry said, noting that these acts undermine the
objective of all the parties concerned and aim at putting in
jeopardy the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Ministry said it is confident that "this abhorrent
act will not deter the protagonists from their efforts to
reinvigorate the peace process in the Middle East and to surmount
the hurdles that were put on its way".
</P>
<P>
It expressed sympathy to the government and the people of
Israel, as well as profound grief to the families of the victims.

<HEADLINE> Angolan Women Voice Their Demand for Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
(by Yin Yongjian)
</P>
<P>
LUANDA, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of women in the
war-plagued southern African country took to the street today
crying for their long-awaited peace.
</P>
<P>
Carrying placards inscribed with "We Want Peace, Not War",
"Stop Violence", "Build A Beautiful Future For Our Descendants"#,
these women marched to the national congress building of the
country.
</P>
<P>
Many of the demonstrators are women who have lost their
husbands or children in the two decades civil war in Angola.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators walked to the front of the national
congress building where parliament members were having a meeting
and presented their letter for peace.
</P>
<P>
The letter said that the Angolan women who have suffered most
from the war in the country would sacrifice whatever they have
for a final peace, so that their younger generations would no
longer fight each other in the meaningless wars.
</P>
<P>
Analia Pereira, a woman parliament member said that "we, the
mothers who have suffered physically and spiritually in the wars
and lost our children should be safeguards for peace."
</P>
<P>
She said that "Angolan women should, joining hands with
Angolan men, strive for the final peace in the country, and never
allow the tragedy of war to befall on the land again."
</P>
<P>
The peace demonstration was organized to mark the African
Women's Day on July 31. Women in some other cities in the
war-ridden country also held similar activities.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Lebanon Welcomes Lift of US Travel Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon welcomed U.S. Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright's decision to lift a 10-year-old ban on
U.S. citizens' travel to Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri described the decision as
"positive," saying it indicated a "confidence in Lebanon."
</P>
<P>
"Certainly the lift of the travel ban is good, and we call on
U.S. businessmen, who want to invest in Lebanon, to come here and
they will be welcomed and will find new opportunities of
investment in this country," the premier said at a press
conference in his office.
</P>
<P>
He believed that the decision will "positively" affect
Lebanon's economy "since it will encourage Americans of Lebanese
origin to travel to Lebanon and encourage American businessmen,
investors and bankers to come back to Lebanon bringing with them
their families."
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese prime minister also underlined that Lebanon is
"against terrorism" and the Lebanese government will "cooperate
with all friendly countries in order to consolidate the security
in our state."
</P>
<P>
He added that "the lives and security of U.S. citizens will be
assured in Lebanon exactly the same as other nationalities as well
as the Lebanese." He noted that contacts are continuously
conducted between Washington and Beirut for this purpose.
</P>
<P>
The travel ban, imposed in 1987 by the U.S. State Department
following a series of kidnappings of U.S. citizens in Lebanon, has
been automatically renewed every six months.
</P>
<P>
Hariri announced that he was informed earlier today by Albright
of the "decision of the U.S. government and herself" to lift the
ban, one day before a deadline for either retaining or ending the
restrictions.
</P>
<P>
Instead of the ban, Albright said, U.S. citizens "will be
warned (of dangers)" when they want to travel to Lebanon,
according to the Lebanese prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese Foreign Minister Farez Boueiz said that his country
"welcomes the decision to lift the travel ban for which we have
not found any justifications in the recent years after the
re-establishment of stability and security in Lebanon."
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister was quoted by the state-run Lebanese
National News Agency as saying that the U.S. government's decision
will be "comprehensive" and will allow the Lebanese flag-carrier
Middle East Airlines (MEA) to resume flights to the U.S., and the
U.S. consul in Lebanon to issue entry visas.
</P>
<P>
Khalid Mohammed Salam, MEA's director general, noted that the
U.S. decision was a "very positive fruit of the efforts exerted by
the Lebanese government on the issue."
</P>
<P>
He called on the U.S. government "to complete this step with
other practical steps" which will facilitate the MEA to resume
direct flights between Lebanon and the U.S.
</P>
<P>
Islamic fundamentalists in Lebanon were responsible for
abducting U.S. citizens and the U.S. has since demanded a Lebanese
government crackdown on Hezbollah, or Party of God, as a
precondition for lifting the ban.

<HEADLINE> ACP-EU Partnership to Be Based on "Co-operation" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
(by Wang Jinyu)
</P>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan Finance Minister Musalia
Mudavadi said today that the new partnership between
African-Caribbean-Pacific countries and European Union (ACP-EU)
should be based on true "cooperation" rather than on
"assistance".
</P>
<P>
He was speaking at the closing session of the Eastern Africa
Regional Seminar on the Future of the ACP-EU Cooperation held
here between July 28-30.
</P>
<P>
The minister noted that unprecedented changes had taken place
worldwide since the first Lome Convention signed between ACP
countries and EU 22 years ago.
</P>
<P>
One of the changes is that "development assistance seems to
have lost its priority on the political agenda of many European
countries," he told the seminar held to discuss the future ACP-EU
relations after the expiry of the Lome IV Convention.
</P>
<P>
Mudavadi pointed out that a number of donors had indeed
reduced their financial support to the third world, adding that
"it is our urgent duty to be aware of the effects of this trend."
</P>
<P>
He viewed the seminar as "an important step" in the long
process of re-defining, re-structuring and updating the terms of
this partnership established 22 years ago between the ACP
countries and the European Union.
</P>
<P>
In his opinion, the geographical scope and coverage of the
convention should be maintained and consolidated in a future
ACP-EU agreement.
</P>
<P>
The differentiation of aid portfolios should be in accordance
with the needs, strategies and capacities of recipient countries,
he noted.
</P>
<P>
The minister stressed that conditionalities should be a series
of well negotiated, transparent and positive goals rather than a
set of absolute punitive measures applied to ACP countries.
</P>
<P>
This regional seminar was designed to shape the common
position of the eastern African region towards the post-Lome
Convention debate.

<P>
Kaddoumi said Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his
government are directly responsible for poisoning the atmosphere
between Palestinians and Israelis, for freezing peace, and for the
eruption of such incidents.
</P>
<P>
"We have affirmed from the very outset our desire for peace,
and the Palestinian masses demonstrated in favor of the peace
process. They have even put flowers in gun barrels of Israeli
soldiers as an expression of their overwhelming support of peace,"
Kaddoumi said.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, "the racist Israeli government, ever since it
came to power, has perpetrated provocative acts against the
Palestinian people and has turned its back to the peace process
and to the singed agreements."
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian people are living until this very moment under
siege, suppression and terror, and are being denied the means of
dignified life, he pointed out.

<HEADLINE> UNDP to Focus on Nigeria's Agriculture, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 30 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Development
Program (UNDP) said today it will sharpen its focus on
agriculture and environmental issues in its fifth country program
of assistance in Nigeria from 1997 to 2001.
</P>
<P>
"Environment and natural resources management will be
implemented with agriculture in form of sustainable agriculture,
environment and rural development," a UNDP official said.
</P>
<P>
According to Ogo Okoro, UNDP's national program officer in
charge of environment, issues like conservation, agro-forestry
development, erosion and desertification, municipal waste
management and its conversion into organic fertilizer and
alternative sources of energy will be considered during the
period.
</P>
<P>
The program officer said that land degradation through sheet,
hydraulic and wind erosion, deforestation and pollution are the
major challenges to the country's environment.
</P>
<P>
Some international non-governmental organizations will be
invited to train Nigerians in participatory approaches, she said.
</P>
<P>
The fourth program, from 1992 to 1996, cost three million U.S.
Dollars and developed a blueprint for a national forestry action
plan in conjunction with the Federal Forestry Department and the
World Bank.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Vows to Continue Resistance Against Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese President Elias Hrawi
today vowed that his country will continue military resistance
against Israel until Israeli occupation is eliminated in south
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The president made the remark while commenting on Washington's
decision to lift a ban on U.S. citizens' travel to Lebanon imposed
by U.S. State Department in 1987 following a series of kidnappings
of U.S. citizens in the country.
</P>
<P>
Hrawi was quoted by the state-run Lebanon Radio as saying that
his country "has been combating terrorism with all its strength."
</P>
<P>
The president regretted that U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright and others consider the existence of resistance against
Israel in south Lebanon as "dangerous."
</P>
<P>
He denied that those fighting the Israeli occupation are
terrorists. "Is that not a right for Lebanon to resist when its
land is occupied?" he asked.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or Party of God, accused by
Washington as a terrorist organization, spearheads a guerrilla
warfare in south Lebanon to oust the Israeli occupation forces out
of the occupied land.
</P>
<P>
Hrawi noted that the lift of the travel ban will not only
promote Lebanon's morale, but will also encourage all those who
want to come to Lebanon to see what has been happening since the
end of the 15-year civil war and what has been achieved in the
field of reconstructing infrastructures in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, Albright informed Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik
Hariri of the U.S. government's decision to lift the ban on
travel to Lebanon, a day before a deadline for either retaining or
ending the restrictions.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Cypriots Ask EU Membership Talks Be Put off </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Northern Cyprus leader Rauf
Denktas said today the European Union's negotiations with Cyprus
for its full membership should be postponed to enable
U.N.-brokered direct bi-communal talks to continue.
</P>
<P>
According to reports reaching here today, Denktas said the
decision to demand the postponement of EU-Cyprus membership talks
was taken unanimously by the administration of northern Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
The east Mediterranean island has been divided into Greek
Cypriot south and Turkish Cypriot north since 1974 when Turkey
landed troops to protect Turkish Cypriots following a pro-Athens
coup seeking union with Greece.
</P>
<P>
After the two ethnic groups agreed to hold face-to-face talks
under U.N. sponsorship at the beginning of this month, the EU
executive body European Commission gave the green-light to Cyprus'
full EU membership talks.
</P>
<P>
Denktas requested EU to put off the negotiations for Cyprus'
entry scheduled for 1998. "Otherwise, U.N.-mediated Cyprus talks
will stop," he threatened.
</P>
<P>
Clerides has said the Greek Cypriots would not take part in the
peace talks if the negotiations with EU are postponed.
</P>
<P>
The Cyprus issue has remained unresolved since 1974 and the
Turkish Cypriot side declared unilaterally in 1983 a breakaway
state "the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus," which is
recognized only by Turkey.
</P>
<P>
More than 30,000 Turkish troops are stationed in the northern
part of the divided Mediterranean island to safeguard the security
of the Turkish Cypriots.

<HEADLINE> Hussein Called for Efforts to Prevent Violence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, July 30 (Xinhua) -- King Hussein of Jordan today called
for all efforts to salvage the Middle East peace process and
prevent violence such as this afternoon's suicide bombings in the
West Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The bomb blasts came at a time of frustration about the
stalled peace process, the king said in an address to the
graduate officers from the Royal Award Academy, Radio Jordan
reported.
</P>
<P>
No one knows the consequences of these incidents, he said,
adding minority groups were trying to tide up anti-Jewish
sentiments but they would not succeed.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, a Jordanian government spokesman condemned this
afternoon's suicide bombings in the West Jerusalem as terrorist
activity against the innocent people.
</P>
<P>
Two suicide bombs exploded at 13:15 this afternoon in an open
market in the West Jerusalem, killing 14 people, including the
two bombers and wounding more than 170.
</P>
<P>
This was the first suicide bombing attack since the March 22
suicide bombing of a Tel Aviv cafe and one of the worst terror
attacks against Israel since the peace process began in 1993.
</P>
<P>
The bomb blasts came at a time when the Palestinians and
Israelis had agreed to resume peace talks this week, giving hope
to break the prolonged deadlock in the peace talks, which have
been stalled since Israel started building the Har Homa
settlement in East Jerusalem in March.
</P>
<P>
The long-term implications of the bombings remained unclear at
the time, but the immediate setback was the cancellation of a
planned visit to the region tomorrow by U.S. special peace envoy
Dennis Ross on a new round of mediation. Washington announced to
postpone Ross' mission shortly after the bombing attacks.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that even if lower-level talks between the
Palestinians and the Israelis would be resumed as scheduled, no
major progress could be made when the two sides remained dubious
about each other's commitments to peace.

<HEADLINE> Jordan's Parliamentary Elections to Be Held As </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, July 30 (Xinhua) - Jordan's King Hussein said here today
that parliamentary elections will take place as "constitutionally
scheduled," despite declared boycott by six opposition parties.
</P>
<P>
Radio Jordan quoted the king as saying democracy would
continue in the kingdom despite any opposition while addressing
graduate officers from the Royal Award Academy.
</P>
<P>
The Jordanian government has decided to invite international
observers to oversee the elections due on November 4 in an effort
to defuse uproar from six opposition parties to boycott the
elections.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, the Muslim Brotherhood, a main opposition
party, became the first to declare boycott of the elections.
</P>
<P>
Its general supervisor Abdul Majeed Thneibat said on July 12
that the Press and Publication Law, the one-person, one-vote
election system, the normalization of ties with Israel, and "the
government's measures to marginalize political parties" were the
main reasons behind the party's boycott of the elections.
</P>
<P>
Later, five parties followed suit. They are the Jordan
People's Democratic Party, the Jordan Arab Constitutional Front,
the National Action Front, the Al Ansar and the Islamic Action
Front (IAF), the biggest opposition party in Jordan.
</P>
<P>
The boycott is also supported by some other parties, which have
yet to declare whether they wanted to join in. Opposition parties
now own 23 seats in the 80-member Lower House of Parliament.
</P>
<P>
Multi-party system was revived in the kingdom in 1989 as part
of a political reform launched after widespread riots that were
set off by economic hardships. The protesters called for wider
public participation in decision-making.

UNITED NATIONS, July 30 (Xinhua) -- The Security Council of the
United Nations today welcomed the successful holding of
presidential and legislative elections in Liberia on July 19,
1997.
</P>
<P>
In its presidential statement, the Security Council said that
the electoral process was free, fair, and credible, and that the
outcome of the elections reflected the will of the Liberian voters.
</P>
<P>
The council called upon all parties to abide by the results of
the elections and to cooperate in the formation of a new
government. It called upon the new government to protect the
democratic system and to promote human rights and fundamental
freedom under the rule of law.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council welcomed the goodwill and cooperation
demonstrated by the parties in the electoral process, which
provided a strong foundation for the people of Liberia to achieve
a durable peace, the re-establishment of constitutional
government, and a return to the rule of law.
</P>
<P>
The council expressed the hope that the successful holding of
election would encourage refugees to exercise their rights of
return, and it called upon the new government to fulfill its
obligations under international law regarding returning refugees.
</P>
<P>
Noting the successful holding of elections represented a
critical step towards economic development, the council urged

<HEADLINE> CBI Announces Initiatives to Meet Information </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 30 (Xinhua) -- British business needs to work in
new ways if it is to make the most of the opportunities offered by
electronic commerce and the information age, Adair Turner,
director-general of the Confederation of British Industry (CBI),
said today.
</P>
<P>
Launching both the CBI's own website and a new CBI initiative
to spread best practice, Turner said that the UK is well-placed to
be a global leader in the information society.
</P>
<P>
With a total output of 57.6 billion US dollars, growing at
around 7 percent a year, the UK's electronic and IT equipment
sector is the sixth largest in the world and is a major source of
innovation.
</P>
<P>
Eight of the top 20 investors in R&AMP;D in the UK are electronics,
IT or telecommunications companies, said Turner.
</P>
<P>
The markets open to electronic commerce are considerable and
are set to grow at a remarkable pace. Fifty million people in 150
countries are already connected to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that by the year 2000 there will be 250 million
subscribers and the US marketplace alone will be worth 112 billion
US dollars.
</P>
<P>
"Companies need to develop completely new ways of thinking and
acting to take advantage of these new markets," Turner said. "The
overall growth potential is huge, but the way in which these
markets will develop is still very unclear - that means both big
risks, but also big rewards."
</P>
<P>
Turner spelt out the issues business needs to consider as a
result of the rapid growth in information and communication:
</P>
<P>
-- The very rapid development of new technologies;
</P>
<P>
-- The convergence of different technologies --
</P>
<P>
telecommunications, electronics, multimedia and broadcasting;
</P>
<P>
-- The growing global business competition;
</P>
<P>
-- The urgent need for people with the right IT skills and
</P>
<P>
attitudes.
</P>
<P>
Turner said, "It's not enough simply to put information about
yourself on the Internet and think you're participating in the
information age. The potential is there to do your business
electronically -- and that's where the big benefits may well lie."
</P>
<P>
He also announced the setting up of the CBI's information
society forum. This is designed to spread best practice and help
member companies address the implications of the information age.
</P>
<P>
It responds to fast-growing member interest, and will focus on
such topics as technology in the retail supply chain, knowledge
management and valuation, the creative use of technology, as well
as a whole series on the specific challenges facing smaller firms.

<HEADLINE> UN Decides to Establish New Mission in Haiti </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 30 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Security
Council decided today to establish the United Nations Transmission
Mission in Haiti (UNTMIH) to help the state train its national
police force.
</P>
<P>
In a resolution unanimously adopted this afternoon, the
Security Council affirmed the importance of a professional,
self-sustaining, fully functioning national police force of
adequate size and structure, able to conduct the full spectrum of
police functions, to the consolidation of democracy and the
revitalization of Haiti's system of justice.
</P>
<P>
The UNTMIH would shoulder a mandate limited to a single
four-month period ending November 30 in order to assist the
Haitian government by supporting and contributing to the
professionalization of the Haitian National Police, according to
the resolution.
</P>
<P>
On the size of the new mission, the Security Council decided
that the UNTMIH be composed of up to 250 civilian police and 50
military personnel to form the headquarters of a security element.
</P>
<P>
The UNTMIH would also assume responsibility for all elements
and assets of the United Nations Support Mission in Haiti (UNSMIH)
remaining in Haiti to deploy as appropriate until they are
withdrawn. The mandate of the UNSMIH would terminate on July 31,
according to the resolution.
</P>
<P>
Recognizing that economic rehabilitation and reconstruction
constitute the major tasks facing the Haitian government and
people, the council stressed the commitment of the international
community to a long-term program of support for Haiti.
</P>
<P>
The council also requested all states to make voluntary
contributions to the trust fund for the Haitian National Police,
in particular for the recruitment and deployment of police
advisers to assist inspector general, directorate general and
department headquarters of the Haitian National Police.

PARIS, July 30 (Xinhua) -- French Defense Minister Alain
Richard today announced that France plans to reduce its
8,000-strong military deployment in Africa.
</P>
<P>
But he said that Paris will reinforce its means for staging
quick reaction operations in the black continent, like the Pelican
operation launched by French troops in Brazzaville last month to
evacuate foreigners from the Congo Republic.
</P>
<P>
Richard said in Libreville, capital of Gabon, which is the
first stop of his three-nation Africa tour, that the "global
number" of French troops will drop, but the means of transport and
projection of forces will increase, according to Agence
France-Presse (AFP).
</P>
<P>
He said that France will re-shuffle its troop deployments in
all the African states where it has military bases.
</P>
<P>
Richard refused to say whether France will close the Bouar
military base in the Central African Republic, which is one of
France's six permanent military bases in Africa.
</P>
<P>
He said that the military agreements between France and some
African states are too old and can no longer respond to the
"political objectives" of France.
</P>
<P>
The daily Le Figaro said that France will first withdraw its
1,400 troops based in the Central African Republic, as the first
step of a 40 percent reduction of its forces in Africa.
</P>
<P>
France now has 3,400 troops stationed in Djibouti, 1,400 in the
Central African Republic, 1,200 in Senegal, 800 in Chad, 600 in
Gabon and 600 in Cote d'Ivoire.

ATHENS, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Greece today strongly condemned the
bombings in Jerusalem as "a terrorist act," saying that such acts
have a negative effect on the Middle East peace process.

Yehuda market in Jerusalem which killed at least 18 people and
injured over 150.
</P>

"Such acts have a negative effect on the Middle East peace

negotiations as well as the promotion and completion of the peace
process can and must constitute the strong answer to terrorism,"

<HEADLINE> European Shares up, Frankfurt, Paris Hit New Records </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Major stock markets in Europe all
had a bullish day and surged strongly today, with Frankfurt and
Paris ending at new record closing highs, boosted by the Dow's
rally and the dollar's strength.
</P>
<P>
In London, Britain's leading FTSE 100 share index rose sharply
on Wall Street's overnight gains and a strong opening today, with
investors pouring into banking, oil and retail stocks. The FTSE
100 closed more than one percent up, or 50.7 points higher at
4,927.3.
</P>
<P>
However, dealers said they were still cautious ahead of a batch
of UK and US economic data.
</P>
<P>
On the Frankfurt market, German shares ended the session at a
new record closing high at 4,421.72, 40.3 points up, with trading
sentiment underpinned also by Wall Street's rally and the strong
dollar which helps the country's exporters.
</P>
<P>
French stocks followed Frankfurt's suit and finished at a new
record level, with the CAC-40 index at 3,069.30, 45.67 points
higher by the end of the session although below an all-time
intra-day trading high reached earlier in the day.

<HEADLINE> UK's Blair Clashes with Hague over Minister's Shares </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 30 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony Blair
today clashed with Conservative Party leader William Hague by
accusing him of spreading "vile and scurrilous" slurs in a
minister's share affairs.
</P>
<P>
While answering questions in parliament, Blair repeatedly asked
Hague to produce evidence that the minister had broken rules or to
withdraw his allegations.
</P>
<P>
Hague accused Lord David Simon, chairman of British Petroleum
Plc, of avoiding tax by holding one million pounds (1.64 million
U.S. dollars) worth of shares in an offshore trust. Simon joined
the Labor government in May as unpaid Minister for Trade and
Competitiveness in Europe.
</P>
<P>
Hague, who replaced former prime minister John Major as the
largest opposition Conservative Party last month, said he detected
"a strong smell of hypocrisy from the government benches".
</P>
<P>
"I don't think there has been a more vile and scurrilous
campaign than the one mounted against David Simon," Blair said of
Hague's accusation.
</P>
<P>
"Because under the previous government there were allegations
proven of misconduct they want to try to smear the new government,
to pretend all politics is the same. Well, all politics is not the
same and this Labor government is not that Tory government," Blair
said.

<HEADLINE> UNDP Launches Programs to Assist Tanzania, Bhutan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 30 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Development Program has launched a 13 million dollar program to
help Tanzania meet its goal of eradicating absolute poverty by the
year 2010, according to the latest UNDP Flash.
</P>
<P>
The initiative will strengthen civil society organizations
working locally to fight poverty through community initiatives,
and will build their alliances with the government.
</P>
<P>
Funding will also promote better aid coordination, capacity
building, advocacy and effective monitoring and evaluation of
economic and social conditions. Almost 50 percent of Tanzania's
population of 30 million live below the poverty line. High infant
mortality rates, malnutrition, lack of access to safe water and
environmental degradation contribute to widespread poverty.
</P>
<P>
The latest publication of UNDP also reported that UNDP has
approved a 6.5 million dollar program to improve horticultural
development in rural areas of Bhutan, with the objective of
improving income, living and nutritional standards among the
country's rural poor. The assistance will focus on strengthening
several critical aspects of the industry, including marketing,
post harvest storage, quality control, production technology,
extension services and processing of aromatic and medicinal
plants.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Warns of Lebanon Travel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 30 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. State Department on
Wednesday cautioned American citizens against traveling to
Lebanon after Secretary of State Madeleine Albright has allowed a
ten-year ban on visits to expire.
</P>
<P>
Albright made the announcement on her way back from Asia after
receiving assurances from Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri's
government it would cooperate "across the board" to fight
terrorism.
</P>
<P>
But the State Department said expiration of the ban to travel
"should not in any way be construed as a determination by the
Department of State that it is safe for Americans to travel to
Lebanon."
</P>
<P>
A department travel advisory said American citizens who go to
Lebanon despite the warning "should exercise extreme caution and
avoid traveling in the southern suburbs of Beirut, the Bekaa
valley and southern Lebanon."
</P>
<P>
The United States imposed the ban to travel to Lebanon in
1987 after hostage taking and numerous other attacks by
anti-American militants.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Urges Again Campaign Finance Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 30 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
voiced on Wednesday his strong support for an effort to bring a
bipartisan reform bill sponsored by Senators John McCain, a
Republican from Arisona, and Russell Feingold, a Democrat from
Wisconsin, before Congress for a vote in September.
</P>
<P>
The bill would ban unregulated "soft money" raised from special
interests by political parties, tighten restriction on political
action committees and offer incentives such as free and
reduced-cost television time to encourage compliance with
voluntary spending limits.
</P>
<P>
In a written statement Clinton said, "September will be the
time for members of the Senate to stand up and be counted for
reform. I will do what I can to see to it that 1997 is finally the
year that it is achieved."
</P>
<P>
Clinton blamed excessive fund-raising practices on "the special
interests and their allies."
</P>
<P>
Clinton said, "This year, those who seek to continue special
interest influence as usual will filibuster again. But this year,
we have an opportunity to come together across party lines to act
and pass reform that cleans up the campaign finance system."

<HEADLINE> US House Approves Balanced-budget Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 30 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. House of
Representatives approved today a legislation to balance the U.S.
budget over five years and the bill moved toward final passage in
the Senate.
</P>
<P>
The bill, which was approved by a vote of 346-85, designed to
rid the nation of deficits for the first time since 1969. U.S.
President Bill Clinton has pledged to sign it.
</P>
<P>
In all, the measure would curtail future spending by about 130
billion dollars over five years, thus helping balance the budget
in 2002, the first time in nearly 30 years.
</P>
<P>
Much of the savings in the balanced-budget bill would come from
Medicare, largely in the form of a squeeze on payments to doctors,
hospitals and other health care providers. Other savings are
anticipated from Medicaid, and, to a lesser degree, veterans
programs, student loans and other benefit programs.
</P>
<P>
A companion bill to cut taxes by about 150 billion dollars over
five years was next on the agenda for U.S. lawmakers. The measure
would cut taxes for families with children, students and investors
targeted. The bill will also increase tax by about 60 billion
dollars in the next five years. The measure was expected to breeze
to final passage in both houses before week's end.
</P>
<P>
Some U.S. lawmakers have opposed the tax measure. Tobacco state
lawmakers said they were unhappy with a provision raising the
tobacco tax, and some conservatives were expected to oppose the
child health program -- one of the features Democrats liked the
best.
</P>
<P>
A Senate vote on the balanced-budget bill was expected either
later today or Thursday.
</P>
<P>
U.S. government and Republican-controlled Congress reached an
agreement in May to balance the U.S. budget by 2002 by cutting
spending and tax. The balanced-budget bill will end the two years
and an half fierce struggle between the two U.S. parties on
whether and how to balance the U.S. budget.

<HEADLINE> Albright: Arafat Committed to Restoring Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright said on Wednesday that Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
has assured her to commit himself to "restore a secure atmosphere"
after two bombings in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Albright, on her way back from a trip to Asia, said in
Honolulu, Hawaii, that she called Arafat from her U.S. Air Force
jet and was assured by Arafat that "he was committed to restoring
a secure atmosphere."
</P>
<P>
The two bombings occurred at a crowded market in Jerusalem on
Wednesday afternoon that killed 14 Israeli people and wounded more
than 150.
</P>
<P>
Albright said the Palestinian leader "condemned the act" and
was meeting his security officials. Arafat "said to me they were
doing everything they could to make sure the security situation is
restored," she added.
</P>
<P>
Albright also called Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu. "We talked about the importance of returning to the
peace process and I urged him to do so and he said he understood
the importance of returning to the peace process ... He did say
he would," she said.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, July 30 (Xinhua) -- New York stocks advanced to new
highs today as bond-market interest rates sank to their lowest
level in more than a year.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average added 80.36 points to 8,254.89
for its third consecutive record high and its sixth in seven
sessions.
</P>
<P>
The Dow surpassed 8,200 mark just two weeks after its first
close above 8,000.
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 5-to-2 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, with NYSE volume totaling 568.48
million shares as against 544.55 million in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock list rose 10.00 to 952.29, the
NYSE composite index rose 5.14 to 645.32, and the American Stock
Exchange composite index rose 5.12 to 645.32. All three measures
closed at record highs on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Nasdaq composite index rose 15.73 to 1,588.05, beating its
previous record finish at 1,580.63 on July 16.
</P>
<P>
The blue-chip gauge has now risen about 28 percent this year,
already surpassing last year's 26 percent advance and triple what
many experts had forecast.
</P>
<P>
Stocks drew most of their strength from the bond market, where
the yield on the 30-year Treasury fell to 6.32 percent. The
long-bond yield hasn't finished a day that low since February
1996.
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Department reported that new home sales jumped 6.1
percent to 819,000 in June to the highest level since March,
spurred by favorable mortgage rates and solid job and income
growth. The May tally, however, was revised downward from 825,000
to 772,000.

<HEADLINE> Former U.S. Peace Envoy Return to Balkans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Former U.S. peace mediator on
Bosnia Richard Holbrooke will visit the Balkans next week as part
of a U.S. team that will press for implementation of the Dayton
peace accords, the State Department announced today.
</P>
<P>
Holbrooke will join a U.S. team led by Robert Gelbard, U.S.
special representative for Dayton implementation, and would visit
Bosnia, Serbia and Croatia, said State Department spokesman James
Foley.
</P>
<P>
He said the mission would discuss U.S. concerns about
implementation of the agreement, which was reached in November
1995 largely thanks to the efforts of Holbrooke, who was an
assistant secretary of state at the time.
</P>
<P>
The delegation, expected to include State Department, Pentagon
and National Security Council officials, would travel to the
region and meet key Balkan leaders.
</P>
<P>
Holbrooke quit government service in February 1996 to join
Credit Suisse First Boston bank, a position he still holds. He was
recently appointed a part-time U.S. envoy on the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
The aim of sending the team to Bosnia "clearly is to send a
very strong signal to the parties of our very strong expectation
that they get with it on Dayton implementation," Foley said.
</P>
<P>
The move reflects the U.S.'s anxiety that unless the major
elements of the accords were fully implemented, it will be
difficult for the U.S. and its allies to withdraw all their troops
out of the region by next June.

<HEADLINE> German Flooded Area Faces Another Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, July 30 (Xinhua) -- About 15,000 people was told today to
be ready to abandon their homes at a moment's notice after the
swollen Oder River on the German-Polish border threatened to flood
a vast low-lying area of eastern Germany.
</P>
<P>
Some 4,000 troops who had been fighting a losing battle
overnight to save the weakening dikes in the northern part of the
Oder were forced to retreat from the riverside when a
50-meter-long stretch of dike was torn open by floodwaters.
</P>
<P>
Local officials said the dikes at Hohenwutzen in the Oderbruch
region had partially collapsed, but the situation was not yet
totally hopeless. Helicopters were still dropping sandbags to try
to block the gap.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, rescue workers were still laboring to pile up
sandbags along another dike in the background which would serve as
a second defense against floodwaters.
</P>
<P>
Although no serious dike damages were reported in other parts
of the Oder, authorities said it was uncertain whether they could
cope with another wave of high water expected to come soon.
</P>
<P>
It had already been a miracle that the sodden dikes had managed
to withstand the huge pressure of the water mass for the past two
weeks, officials said.
</P>
<P>
To make things worse, weather forecasters on Wednesday
predicted scattered heavy thundershowers for the region into the
weekend. The swollen river would not ebb until next week, experts
said.

WASHINGTON, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Ten high school band students
were killed in a crash between a tractor-trailer and a utility
vehicle when the vehicle was trying to pass in a no-passing zone
on a wet country road in North Carolina today.

Olympic programme in the next century, John Helmick, Olympic
attache of the International Union of Modern Pentathlon and
Biathlon (IUPMB), said here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"Modern pentathlon has a unique place because it is the only
sport that was organized specifically for the Olympics by the
international Olympic Committee," said Helmick.
</P>
<P>
The International Union of Modern Pentathlon and Biathlon
has introduced some changes in the organising of the Olympic
Modern Pentathlon championships.
</P>
<P>
"The athletes compete in all five events on one day while the
one day format has attracted various sponsors. We have great
improvement on the sport, on sponsors and on TV," Helmick said.
</P>
<P>
As a conclusion, Helmick emphasized: "Modern Pentathlon is an
important Olympic sport for the upcoming century. With the new
format, the Modern Pentathlon was the only sport that sold all
tickets for every session at the 1996 Olympic Games. No other
sport can do the same. I hope a sellout for all the tickets and
seats for the men's competitions as well as women's competitions
in the 2000 Olympics. That is the real goal for the Modern
Pentathlon."

<HEADLINE>   Peru's Record Industry Losing Millions to Pirates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LIMA, July 30 (Xinhua) -- The record industry in Peru has lost
400 million U.S. dollars over the past 10 years due to piracy, a
music industry executive said today.
</P>
<P>
For every legal cassette, there are 12 pirated copies, which
means more than 90 percent of the cassettes on the market are
counterfeit, said Guillermo Bracamonte, legal counsellor of Latin
American Federation of Audio and Videocassette Productions.
</P>
<P>
With sales of compact discs now outstripping cassettes,
counterfeiters have turned to producing pirated CDs, he said.
</P>
<P>
Peru imports 10 million blank cassettes every year, said
Bracamonte. But the legal record industry sells an average of
800,000, the remaining 9.2 million cassettes are used for pirated
recordings.
</P>
<P>
The amount lost lies not only in the sales of cassettes but in
the payment of recording royalties, explained Bracamonte.

MEXICO CITY, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Mexico's foreign reserves have
reached 22.5 billion U.S. dollars after increasing by 38 million
dollars last week, said the Banco de Mexico (Banxico).

to nearly 15.2 billion dollars during the week of July 18-25.

The latest figures, it said, partly result from the state-owned

the Mexican federal government's net outflow of 31 million dollars.
</P>

In addition, they reflect the gain of 74 million dollars from

<TEXT>
<P>
SAN JOSE, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Three Mexican multinational
companies in Costa Rica today denied newspaper reports they would
withdraw.
</P>
<P>
Mabe, a household appliances manufacturer, ICA and Tribasa, two
construction companies, confirmed they would continue their
business in Costa Rica.
</P>
<P>
Last October, a Costa Rican company producing refrigerators
filed a complaint against Mabe with the economy ministry. Although
the company withdrew its complaint in March, the ministry
continued its investigation, although no results have been made
public.
</P>
<P>
ICA participated in the building of the Angostura Dam, an major
project of the state-owned Costa Rica Electricity Institute.
Although it's widely believed ICA is owed money for the project,
the company maintains its intention to invest in Costa Rica,
the Costa Rican newspaper "la Nacion" reported.
</P>
<P>
The Tribasa case has political repercussions since doubts
have emerged about Carlos Hank, a Mexican businessman and
politician who has ties with the company.
</P>
<P>
The Controller General's Office of Costa Rica annulled the bid
Tribasa won to rebuild part of the inter-American highway in the
midst of a scandal involving Hank and for his ties with important
opposition politicians here.
</P>
<P>
A Tribasa spokesperson denied the company is thinking of leaving
the country while the Controller General's Office is trying to
settle the problems that originated from the annullment of the
winning bid.

</P>
<P>
Jiang added that all members of the PLA must hold high
unswervingly the banner of Deng Xiaoping's theory of building
socialism with Chinese characteristics.
</P>

WASHINGTON, July 30 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton in
a statement today stressed that the country's legislative body
"must act to change the campaign finance laws."
</P>
<P>
The campaign finance system, he said, "has been overwhelmed by
a flood of campaign cash" and has pitted the Democratic and
Republican parties in an "ever-escalating arms race" for more.
</P>
<P>
"September will be the time for members of the Senate to stand
up and be counted for reform," Clinton said, promising that he
will try best to push the reform through both congressional floors.
</P>
<P>
"I will do what I can see to it that 1997 is finally the year
that it is achieved," he said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton endorsed a bill co-sponsored by Senator John McCain, a
Republican from Arizona, and Senator Russell Feingold, a Democrat
from Wisconsin, to ban unlimited "soft money" contributions.
</P>
<P>
McCain today said he would try to persuade Senate Majority
Leader Trent Lott to bring up the bill as a free-standing measure
for Senate debate in September.
</P>
<P>
If that fails, McCain said he would offer it as an amendment to
an unrelated measure.
</P>
<P>
In an interview, Feingold said he and McCain picked September
for Senate action because it must be done in time to establish
rules for next year's campaigns.
</P>
<P>
The budget prevented earlier action, and the 1998 campaigns,
with lawmakers out seeking re-election, will prevent action then,
he said.

<HEADLINE> Northeast China's Grain Production Threatened By Drought </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 31 (Xinhua) -- The autumn grain output in
northeast China's Heilongjiang, Jilin and Liaoning provinces is
now threatened by a sustained drought this summer.
</P>
<P>
According to today's China Daily, some local rivers in the
three provinces have dried up for more than 40 days due to this
summer's long dry and hot weather there--the worst during the past
15 years.
</P>
<P>
In Jilin, the paper said, the rain fell between June 1 and July
21 was 43 percent less than the corresponding period last year and
16 percent less rainfall than in its worst ever drought 15 years
ago.
</P>
<P>
"Northeast China's severe drought will pose a serious threat to
the autumn grain crops scheduled for harvesting in about three
months if there is no rain in the next several weeks," the paper
said.
</P>
<P>
According to the paper, to date 12 million hectares of land
have been affected by the drought.

<HEADLINE> Asia Becomes Top U.S. Aerospace Export Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Asia has supplanted Europe as
the top market for U.S. aerospace exports, which rose almost 20
percent in 1996 to 39.6 billion U.S. dollars, the Aerospace
Industries Association (AIA) said.
</P>
<P>
The increase in export sales covered civilian and military
products, said David Vadas, director of AIA's Research Center in
an analysis, according to the latest edition of the Defense News
weekly.
</P>
<P>
Vadas said, Aerospace sales in Asia accounted for about 13
percent of total industry sales and 41 percent of all exports,
while the sales to the European Union accounted for 39.7 percent
of all exports.
</P>
<P>
"The Asia-Pacific market is critical to the industry's
success... and it's ours to lose," he said. U.S. restrictions on
defense sales to China, Vietnam and other Asia Pacific nations
give a free hand to Russia, Vadas added.
</P>
<P>
According to AIA figures, the Middle East ranks third for U.S.
aerospace exports, with 7.2 percent of all export sales, followed
by Canada, 7 percent, Latin America, 4.1 percent, and Central
Europe, 0.6 percent.

<HEADLINE> Nation to Begin Rural Pilot Census </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 31 (Xinhua) -- The State Council has decided to
begin a pilot census in China's small towns and to tighten census
management in rural areas, China Daily reported today.
</P>
<P>
State Council Secretary-General and State Councillor Luo Gan
said yesterday that the decision has been made in line with the
requirement for building socialist market economy.
</P>
<P>
Luo told a national teleconference yesterday that improving the
census in counties, townships and rural areas was important to
people's lives and was linked with economic development, social
progress and stability.
</P>
<P>
The changes were needed because in the last few years many
farmers have moved from the countryside to small towns in search
of work. The population shift has made the government's job of
providing social services difficult.
</P>
<P>
Under the new system, people who used to be farmers but are
currently working in pilot counties and townships can apply for
permanent residence in the small towns.
</P>
<P>
Those who have stable jobs and have lived at least two years in
the new areas can become permanent residents there.
</P>
<P>
This will help promote the orderly transfer of surplus rural
labor to small towns, ease population pressure on large- and
medium-sized cities and help modernize rural areas, Luo said.

indicated at a meeting with German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel
today that his country may seek entry into the European Union (EU).

<P>
SOFIA, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Modern Pentathlon will remain in the
Olympic programme in the next century, John Helmick, Olympic
attache of the International Union of Modern Pentathlon and
Biathlon (IUPMB), said here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"Modern pentathlon has a unique place because it is the only
sport that was organized specifically for the Olympics by the
international Olympic Committee," said Helmick.
</P>
<P>
The International Union of Modern Pentathlon and Biathlon
has introduced some changes in the organising of the Olympic
Modern Pentathlon championships.
</P>
<P>
"The athletes compete in all five events on one day while the
one day format has attracted various sponsors. We have great
improvement on the sport, on sponsors and on TV," Helmick said.
</P>
<P>
As a conclusion, Helmick emphasized: "Modern Pentathlon is an
important Olympic sport for the upcoming century. With the new
format, the Modern Pentathlon was the only sport that sold all
tickets for every session at the 1996 Olympic Games. No other
sport can do the same. I hope a sellout for all the tickets and
seats for the men's competitions as well as women's competitions
in the 2000 Olympics. That is the real goal for the Modern
Pentathlon."

<P>
BEIJING, July 31 (Xinhua) -- The UN Development Program (UNDP)
is joining China's efforts to reform water management and improve
the environment.
</P>
<P>
The UN agency and China International Center for Economic and
Technical Exchanges recently signed agreements on three new
projects into which the UNDP will put in more than two million US
dollars in grant assistance, said UNDP's China Office.
</P>
<P>
The projects are 21st Century Urban Water Management in China,
Capacity Building for Environmental Education in Primary and
Middle Schools through the Production of Interactive Teaching
Materials, and Capacity Development for Improving Traffic
Pollution Control in Beijing, according to today's "China Daily".
</P>
<P>
The urban water management project is expected to start next
month and last for two and half years. It aims to achieve
sustainable water use in urban areas, said Hou Xi'an with UNDP's
China Office.
</P>
<P>
The project will assist the Ministry of Construction in
improving water and waste water management by developing and
demonstrating an effective process for institutional reform and
implementation of a water demand management strategy.
</P>
<P>
Pilot activities will be carried out in Shijiazhuang, capital
of Hebei Province, to determine the most appropriate methodology.
</P>
<P>
An institutional reform strategy and an action plan will be
developed for a revised tariff structure to establish
self-financing water supply and waste water companies in the pilot
city. The results will be disseminated to other cities throughout
the country.
</P>
<P>
The China/UNDP environmental education project will last until
July 2000. It is designed to strengthen environmental awareness
and compliance by promoting interactive environmental education to
children.
</P>
<P>
The traffic pollution control project in Beijing aims to reduce
adverse social, environmental and economic consequences of
traffic-related air pollution in the capital city.
</P>
<P>
The two-year project, starting this month, will strengthen the
existing air pollution monitoring system in Beijing and collect
key data on vehicle emissions.

<P>
WASHINGTON, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Ten high school band students
were killed in a crash between a tractor-trailer and a utility
vehicle when the vehicle was trying to pass in a no-passing zone
on a wet country road in North Carolina today.
</P>
<P>
The vehicle driver lost control after crossing the center line
to pass three cars in a light rain in an area about 170 kilometers
east of Raleigh, local media reports quoted police as saying.
</P>
<P>
The victims belonged to the Plymouth High School band and were
taking a lunch break from summer band camp at the school. Nine of
the ten students died on the spot and the only student to survive
the 1:30 p.m. crash died later at a hospital.
</P>
<P>
The truck driver was treated for minor injuries at a hospital
and released.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, two adults and nine children under 12 were killed
in southern Michigan when their pickup truck rolled past a stop
sign and was crushed by a dump truck. Two other children were
critically injured.

<HEADLINE> German Flooded Area Faces Another Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, July 30 (Xinhua) -- About 15,000 people was told today to
be ready to abandon their homes at a moment's notice after the
swollen Oder River on the German-Polish border threatened to flood
a vast low-lying area of eastern Germany.
</P>
<P>
Some 4,000 troops who had been fighting a losing battle
overnight to save the weakening dikes in the northern part of the
Oder were forced to retreat from the riverside when a
50-meter-long stretch of dike was torn open by floodwaters.
</P>
<P>
Local officials said the dikes at Hohenwutzen in the Oderbruch
region had partially collapsed, but the situation was not yet
totally hopeless. Helicopters were still dropping sandbags to try
to block the gap.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, rescue workers were still laboring to pile up
sandbags along another dike in the background which would serve as
a second defense against floodwaters.
</P>
<P>
Although no serious dike damages were reported in other parts
of the Oder, authorities said it was uncertain whether they could
cope with another wave of high water expected to come soon.
</P>
<P>
It had already been a miracle that the sodden dikes had managed
to withstand the huge pressure of the water mass for the past two
weeks, officials said.
</P>
<P>
To make things worse, weather forecasters on Wednesday
predicted scattered heavy thundershowers for the region into the
weekend. The swollen river would not ebb until next week, experts
said.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, July 30 (Xinhua) -- New York stocks advanced to new
highs today as bond-market interest rates sank to their lowest
level in more than a year.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average added 80.36 points to 8,254.89
for its third consecutive record high and its sixth in seven
sessions.
</P>
<P>
The Dow surpassed 8,200 mark just two weeks after its first
close above 8,000.
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 5-to-2 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, with NYSE volume totaling 568.48
million shares as against 544.55 million in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock list rose 10.00 to 952.29, the
NYSE composite index rose 5.14 to 645.32, and the American Stock
Exchange composite index rose 5.12 to 645.32. All three measures
closed at record highs on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Nasdaq composite index rose 15.73 to 1,588.05, beating its
previous record finish at 1,580.63 on July 16.
</P>
<P>
The blue-chip gauge has now risen about 28 percent this year,
already surpassing last year's 26 percent advance and triple what
many experts had forecast.
</P>
<P>
Stocks drew most of their strength from the bond market, where
the yield on the 30-year Treasury fell to 6.32 percent. The
long-bond yield hasn't finished a day that low since February
1996.
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Department reported that new home sales jumped 6.1
percent to 819,000 in June to the highest level since March,
spurred by favorable mortgage rates and solid job and income
growth. The May tally, however, was revised downward from 825,000
to 772,000.

<HEADLINE> Former U.S. Peace Envoy Return to Balkans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Former U.S. peace mediator on
Bosnia Richard Holbrooke will visit the Balkans next week as part
of a U.S. team that will press for implementation of the Dayton
peace accords, the State Department announced today.
</P>
<P>
Holbrooke will join a U.S. team led by Robert Gelbard, U.S.
special representative for Dayton implementation, and would visit
Bosnia, Serbia and Croatia, said State Department spokesman James
Foley.
</P>
<P>
He said the mission would discuss U.S. concerns about
implementation of the agreement, which was reached in November
1995 largely thanks to the efforts of Holbrooke, who was an
assistant secretary of state at the time.
</P>
<P>
The delegation, expected to include State Department, Pentagon
and National Security Council officials, would travel to the
region and meet key Balkan leaders.
</P>
<P>
Holbrooke quit government service in February 1996 to join
Credit Suisse First Boston bank, a position he still holds. He was
recently appointed a part-time U.S. envoy on the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
The aim of sending the team to Bosnia "clearly is to send a
very strong signal to the parties of our very strong expectation
that they get with it on Dayton implementation," Foley said.
</P>
<P>
The move reflects the U.S.'s anxiety that unless the major
elements of the accords were fully implemented, it will be
difficult for the U.S. and its allies to withdraw all their troops
out of the region by next June.

<HEADLINE> US House Approves Balanced-budget Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 30 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. House of
Representatives approved today a legislation to balance the U.S.
budget over five years and the bill moved toward final passage in
the Senate.
</P>
<P>
The bill, which was approved by a vote of 346-85, designed to
rid the nation of deficits for the first time since 1969. U.S.
President Bill Clinton has pledged to sign it.
</P>
<P>
In all, the measure would curtail future spending by about 130
billion dollars over five years, thus helping balance the budget
in 2002, the first time in nearly 30 years.
</P>
<P>
Much of the savings in the balanced-budget bill would come from
Medicare, largely in the form of a squeeze on payments to doctors,
hospitals and other health care providers. Other savings are
anticipated from Medicaid, and, to a lesser degree, veterans
programs, student loans and other benefit programs.
</P>
<P>
A companion bill to cut taxes by about 150 billion dollars over
five years was next on the agenda for U.S. lawmakers. The measure
would cut taxes for families with children, students and investors
targeted. The bill will also increase tax by about 60 billion
dollars in the next five years. The measure was expected to breeze
to final passage in both houses before week's end.
</P>
<P>
Some U.S. lawmakers have opposed the tax measure. Tobacco state
lawmakers said they were unhappy with a provision raising the
tobacco tax, and some conservatives were expected to oppose the
child health program -- one of the features Democrats liked the
best.
</P>
<P>
A Senate vote on the balanced-budget bill was expected either
later today or Thursday.
</P>
<P>
U.S. government and Republican-controlled Congress reached an
agreement in May to balance the U.S. budget by 2002 by cutting
spending and tax. The balanced-budget bill will end the two years
and an half fierce struggle between the two U.S. parties on
whether and how to balance the U.S. budget.

WASHINGTON, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright said on Wednesday that Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
has assured her to commit himself to "restore a secure atmosphere"
after two bombings in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Albright, on her way back from a trip to Asia, said in
Honolulu, Hawaii, that she called Arafat from her U.S. Air Force
jet and was assured by Arafat that "he was committed to restoring
a secure atmosphere."
</P>
<P>
The two bombings occurred at a crowded market in Jerusalem on
Wednesday afternoon that killed 14 Israeli people and wounded more
than 150.
</P>
<P>
Albright said the Palestinian leader "condemned the act" and
was meeting his security officials. Arafat "said to me they were
doing everything they could to make sure the security situation is
restored," she added.
</P>
<P>
Albright also called Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu. "We talked about the importance of returning to the
peace process and I urged him to do so and he said he understood
the importance of returning to the peace process ... He did say
he would," she said.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 30 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. State Department on
Wednesday cautioned American citizens against traveling to
Lebanon after Secretary of State Madeleine Albright has allowed a
ten-year ban on visits to expire.
</P>
<P>
Albright made the announcement on her way back from Asia after
receiving assurances from Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri's
government it would cooperate "across the board" to fight
terrorism.
</P>
<P>
But the State Department said expiration of the ban to travel
"should not in any way be construed as a determination by the
Department of State that it is safe for Americans to travel to
Lebanon."
</P>
<P>
A department travel advisory said American citizens who go to
Lebanon despite the warning "should exercise extreme caution and
avoid traveling in the southern suburbs of Beirut, the Bekaa
valley and southern Lebanon."
</P>
<P>
The United States imposed the ban to travel to Lebanon in
1987 after hostage taking and numerous other attacks by
anti-American militants.

WASHINGTON, July 30 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
voiced on Wednesday his strong support for an effort to bring a
bipartisan reform bill sponsored by Senators John McCain, a
Republican from Arisona, and Russell Feingold, a Democrat from
Wisconsin, before Congress for a vote in September.
</P>
<P>
The bill would ban unregulated "soft money" raised from special
interests by political parties, tighten restriction on political
action committees and offer incentives such as free and
reduced-cost television time to encourage compliance with
voluntary spending limits.
</P>
<P>
In a written statement Clinton said, "September will be the
time for members of the Senate to stand up and be counted for
reform. I will do what I can to see to it that 1997 is finally the
year that it is achieved."
</P>
<P>
Clinton blamed excessive fund-raising practices on "the special
interests and their allies."
</P>
<P>
Clinton said, "This year, those who seek to continue special
interest influence as usual will filibuster again. But this year,
we have an opportunity to come together across party lines to act
and pass reform that cleans up the campaign finance system."

<HEADLINE> UN Decides to Establish New Mission in Haiti </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 30 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Security
Council decided today to establish the United Nations Transmission
Mission in Haiti (UNTMIH) to help the state train its national
police force.
</P>
<P>
In a resolution unanimously adopted this afternoon, the
Security Council affirmed the importance of a professional,
self-sustaining, fully functioning national police force of
adequate size and structure, able to conduct the full spectrum of
police functions, to the consolidation of democracy and the
revitalization of Haiti's system of justice.
</P>
<P>
The UNTMIH would shoulder a mandate limited to a single
four-month period ending November 30 in order to assist the
Haitian government by supporting and contributing to the
professionalization of the Haitian National Police, according to
the resolution.
</P>
<P>
On the size of the new mission, the Security Council decided
that the UNTMIH be composed of up to 250 civilian police and 50
military personnel to form the headquarters of a security element.
</P>
<P>
The UNTMIH would also assume responsibility for all elements
and assets of the United Nations Support Mission in Haiti (UNSMIH)
remaining in Haiti to deploy as appropriate until they are
withdrawn. The mandate of the UNSMIH would terminate on July 31,
according to the resolution.
</P>
<P>
Recognizing that economic rehabilitation and reconstruction
constitute the major tasks facing the Haitian government and
people, the council stressed the commitment of the international
community to a long-term program of support for Haiti.
</P>
<P>
The council also requested all states to make voluntary
contributions to the trust fund for the Haitian National Police,
in particular for the recruitment and deployment of police
advisers to assist inspector general, directorate general and
department headquarters of the Haitian National Police.

<HEADLINE> France Announces Plan to Reduce Troops in Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 30 (Xinhua) -- French Defense Minister Alain
Richard today announced that France plans to reduce its
8,000-strong military deployment in Africa.
</P>
<P>
But he said that Paris will reinforce its means for staging
quick reaction operations in the black continent, like the Pelican
operation launched by French troops in Brazzaville last month to
evacuate foreigners from the Congo Republic.
</P>
<P>
Richard said in Libreville, capital of Gabon, which is the
first stop of his three-nation Africa tour, that the "global
number" of French troops will drop, but the means of transport and
projection of forces will increase, according to Agence
France-Presse (AFP).
</P>
<P>
He said that France will re-shuffle its troop deployments in
all the African states where it has military bases.
</P>
<P>
Richard refused to say whether France will close the Bouar
military base in the Central African Republic, which is one of
France's six permanent military bases in Africa.
</P>
<P>
He said that the military agreements between France and some
African states are too old and can no longer respond to the
"political objectives" of France.
</P>
<P>
The daily Le Figaro said that France will first withdraw its
1,400 troops based in the Central African Republic, as the first
step of a 40 percent reduction of its forces in Africa.
</P>
<P>
France now has 3,400 troops stationed in Djibouti, 1,400 in the
Central African Republic, 1,200 in Senegal, 800 in Chad, 600 in
Gabon and 600 in Cote d'Ivoire.

On the Frankfurt market, German shares ended the session at a

<HEADLINE> UK's Blair Clashes with Hague over Minister's Shares </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 30 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony Blair
today clashed with Conservative Party leader William Hague by
accusing him of spreading "vile and scurrilous" slurs in a
minister's share affairs.
</P>
<P>
While answering questions in parliament, Blair repeatedly asked
Hague to produce evidence that the minister had broken rules or to
withdraw his allegations.
</P>
<P>
Hague accused Lord David Simon, chairman of British Petroleum
Plc, of avoiding tax by holding one million pounds (1.64 million
U.S. dollars) worth of shares in an offshore trust. Simon joined
the Labor government in May as unpaid Minister for Trade and
Competitiveness in Europe.
</P>
<P>
Hague, who replaced former prime minister John Major as the
largest opposition Conservative Party last month, said he detected
"a strong smell of hypocrisy from the government benches".
</P>
<P>
"I don't think there has been a more vile and scurrilous
campaign than the one mounted against David Simon," Blair said of
Hague's accusation.
</P>
<P>
"Because under the previous government there were allegations
proven of misconduct they want to try to smear the new government,
to pretend all politics is the same. Well, all politics is not the
same and this Labor government is not that Tory government," Blair
said.

The initiative will strengthen civil society organizations
working locally to fight poverty through community initiatives,
and will build their alliances with the government.

Funding will also promote better aid coordination, capacity
building, advocacy and effective monitoring and evaluation of
economic and social conditions. Almost 50 percent of Tanzania's
population of 30 million live below the poverty line. High infant
mortality rates, malnutrition, lack of access to safe water and
environmental degradation contribute to widespread poverty.

The latest publication of UNDP also reported that UNDP has
approved a 6.5 million dollar program to improve horticultural
development in rural areas of Bhutan, with the objective of
improving income, living and nutritional standards among the
country's rural poor. The assistance will focus on strengthening
several critical aspects of the industry, including marketing,
post harvest storage, quality control, production technology,
extension services and processing of aromatic and medicinal
plants.
