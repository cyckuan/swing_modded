UCLA ROUTS MARYLAND AND MOVES ON

<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS - A month ago, UCLA lost at Arizona State by 29
points. Two weeks ago, the Bruins were on the brink of NCAA
Tournament elimination. Nine days ago, they squeaked past
Washington State, the worst team in the Pac-10.
</P>
<P>
   Today, they're in the Sweet 16 - and playing like a national
championship contender.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just incredible,'' Bruins forward Rico Hines said.
``That's the only word I can think of. It's incredible how we've
responded the last month. People thought we had given up. Instead,
we did some soul-searching. We knew we were better than we showed
in Arizona, and we've come out and proven it. Now, we feel like
we're unstoppable.''
</P>
<P>
   They'll get no argument from third-seeded Maryland, which
watched helplessly as the Bruins rolled to a 105-70 second-round
victory Saturday before 26,358 in the Metrodome - a victory as
stunning as it was devastating.
</P>
<P>
   No. 6 UCLA will play No. 2 Iowa State on Thursday in the Sweet
16 at The Palace of Auburn Hills (Mich.).
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if anyone could beat UCLA tonight,'' Maryland
forward Terence Morris said. ``It would be pretty tough.''
</P>
<P>
   Not only was Bruins point guard Earl Watson the best player on
the floor, he was perfect: no turnovers, four steals and a
school-record 16 assists. He also made four consecutive 3-pointers
in surreal two-minute stretch early in the second half, pushing
UCLA's 16-point halftime lead to 30.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew coming into the game that I couldn't turn the ball
over,'' Watson said. ``I had six turnovers against Ball State. I
came out more conservative, more solid, and it allowed me to focus
more.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins (21-11) were awesome in the final 30 minutes against
Cal and brilliant in the season-finale against Washington. But they
haven't played this well in the tournament since the 1995
championship charge, when Ed O'Bannon's team smashed Mississippi
State by 19 points in the Sweet 16.
</P>
<P>
   Not even the 1997 Bruins, who won the Pac-10 title and came
within eight points of the Final Four, put on a show like this. And
that team wasn't flirting with tournament elimination on March 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's crazy,'' forward Jason Kapono said. ``In the middle of
the Pac-10 season, people were counting us out. They said we were
pansies and we didn't work hard. But we've proven them wrong. We're
in the Sweet 16.''
</P>
<P>
   Everything worked for UCLA, nothing for Maryland. Big men Jerome
Moiso and Dan Gadzuric combined to make 12-of-14 shots, score 27
points and grab 15 rebounds. Wing men JaRon Rush and Kapono made
five 3-pointers and scored 25 points. The Bruins shot 72.4 percent
in the first half and 62.5 percent for the game. They had 28
assists. Gadzuric made his free throws. Even slumping shooter Ray
Young buried a 3-pointer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tonight was a breakthrough game,'' Bruins coach Steve Lavin
said. ``I thought our halfcourt offense was as sharp as it's been
all year.''
</P>
<P>
   This was the antithesis of the matchup in Puerto Rico in Nov.
'98, when the high-flying Terps thrashed timid, grounded UCLA.
Saturday, the Bruins did the dunking, with four alley-oops in the
first half.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the lobs and dunks mentally take away from the other
team's rhythm,'' Watson said. ``They've been there all year, and
I've been throwing them all year. It's really nothing new. They
just got completed.''
</P>
<P>
   UCLA broke the game open with a 15-2 surge to close the first
half. It started when Matt Barnes tipped home a Rush miss. A
Maryland turnover became Gadzuric's double-pump layup. Instead of
calling timeout, the Terps played on, and Taj Holden missed an
ill-advised jumper. Before Maryland crossed midcourt, Watson found
Rush for an alley-oop. Suddenly,the three-point lead had expanded
to 40-31, and the Terps frantically called timeout.
</P>
<P>
   ``UCLA was really sharp,'' Terps coach Gary Williams said.
``They looked quicker tonight than they ever did on tape.''
</P>
<P>
   The timeout did no good. Maryland committed two consecutive
turnovers, and with 2:22 left Gadzuric kissed a difficult
turnaround off the backboard. The lead was 42-33.
</P>
<P>
   Morris' nifty baseline drive slowed the Bruins' momentum for all
of one minute. Then Moiso scored from the low post and Watson hit
Rush with yet another alley-oop. A few seconds later, Watson stole
the ball from Morris and found Young in the corner for a 3-pointer.
His swish gave the Bruins a 49-33 halftime lead.

MARINOVICH SIGNS WITH ARENA LEAGUE'S AVENGERS

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Former USC and Raiders quarterback Todd Marinovich
will play football in Los Angeles again, after signing a contract
Saturday with the L.A. Avengers of the Arena Football League.
</P>
<P>
   It's another comeback attempt for Marinovich, 30, who spent last
season with British Columbia of the Canadian Football League before
being released.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it would be a great match. It's an opportunity to
play and have some fun,'' Marinovich said. ``It's definitely an
adjustment to go from a huge field (in Canada) to a small field in
an indoor stadium.''
</P>
<P>
   Marinovich is best known from his days with USC (1989-90) and
the Raiders (1991-92). He also drew headlines in 1997 when he was
sentenced to six months in jail after pleading guilty to a felony
charge of cultivating marijuana. He served three months.
</P>
<P>
   As part of a standard Arena League contract, Marinovich will
undergo random drug tests, according to Avengers coach Stan Brock.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had problems in the past, but it's all been a learning
experience,'' Marinovich said. ``Hopefully, we learn from them and
move on.''

A DREAM COME TRUE FOR ONE BRUIN 
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS - Brandon Brooks figured the first basket of his
UCLA career would come in the final seconds of a regular-season
rout against a Pac-10 patsy, like Washington State or Oregon State.
</P>
<P>
   Not in the NCAA Tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Not against third-seeded Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   Definitely not in the Sweet 16.
</P>
<P>
   ``This situation is a dream come true,'' Brooks said. ``And
getting a dunk in the tournament is even better.''
</P>
<P>
   Brooks' dunk, with 2:49 left, was one of many highlights in UCLA
's 105-70 victory over Maryland. But his background makes it
special: Brooks, a freshman, was the starting goalie on UCLA's NCAA
champion water polo team. He joined the basketball Bruins as a
walk-on early in the sea son because they needed a big body for
practice. He had played sparingly in seven games before Saturday.
His resume consisted of one free throw.
</P>
<P>
   They'll be talking about the dunk from Westwood to Honolulu,
Brooks' hometown.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got the ball about the free throw line,''he said. ``I took a
couple dribbles downcourt and looked around, and I saw I was ahead
of everybody. That's when I started looking at the rim.''
</P>
<P>
   Perfect? Perhaps: Asked if this was UCLA's best game of the
season, Bruins coach Steve Lavin hedged.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stanford still kind of sticks out because of the conditions _
being at Maples Pavilion, playing the No. 1 team in the country on
their Senior Day, with our backs to the wall,'' Lavin said. ``It
was a kind of single-elimination, Russian-roulette, NCAA
Tournament-kind of urgency.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today was a breakthrough in terms of our transition attack.
Defensively, we had some pretty impressive sequences.''
</P>
<P>
   Quick start: To some extent, the Bruins follow forwa rd Jerome
Moiso's lead. When he plays well, especially early, they do, t oo.
</P>
<P>
   Against Ball State, Moiso played tentatively and made 5-of-14
shots.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, he was aggressive and effective, scoring UCLA's first
two baskets and making 7-of-8 shots for the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now is the time,'' Moiso said. ``At this point, you can't
expect the game to come to you. You have to go get it. That's what
I'm trying to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``I need to see the ball, and when I do, I can get going pretty
good.''
</P>
<P>
   Problem solved? In recent weeks, freshman Jason Kapono has
struggled in the first half and played well in the second.
Thursday, for instance, he was scoreless in the first and had 17
points in the second.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what it is,'' Kapono said. ``I'd like to think
it's that I'm a crunch-time player. Or maybe I'm not in rhythm in
the first half. Or maybe I don't try hard enough. Or maybe I'm
trying to be a passer in the first half and a scorer in the
second.''
</P>
<P>
   Kapono found a balance against Maryland, with two 3-pointers and
three assists in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   Odds and ends: UCLA was a four-point underdog Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins set a school record with 14-pointers.
</P>
<P>
   Earl Watson's 16 assists broke the school record set by Darrick
Martin against Pittsburgh in 1991. It also tied an NCAA Tournament
first - and second-round record.
</P>
<P>
   It was the fourth-largest tournament victory in UCLA history.
The largest was a 49-point win over Wyoming in 1967.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins are 6-0 against Sweet 16 opponent Iowa State,
including 3-0 in the tournament.

15-YEAR-OLD JUMPS INTO OLYMPIC PICTURE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN POWERS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SOUTH DENNIS, Mass. _ There are times when it all seems like one
big blur. Jennifer Kirk goes to Germany a couple of weeks ago
hoping just to stay on her feet. She ends up winning the World
Junior Figure Skating title and suddenly finds herself on the road
to Olympus. Huh?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all been so quick,'' marvels the 15-year-old Newton
native, who trains at Tony Kent Arena here amid the sand and scrub
pines of the Cape. ``It's taken some time to sink in. Just because
I landed two programs . . .''
</P>
<P>
   Just like that, Kirk poked her head up from the pack of teens
who are going to chase Michelle Kwan all the way to Salt Lake City
in 2002. Just like that, she adds herself to the list of contenders
for next year's US elite world team.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Kirk was a novice, crowding around a TV with
friends to watch Tara Lipinski win the gold medal at Nagano.
</P>
<P>
   ``You watch and you imagine yourself doing that,'' she says.
``Now, it's become more of a possibility.''
</P>
<P>
   The imaginary becomes possible just that quickly in women's
skating, where 13-year-olds can become prime-time stars and
15-year-olds can become millionaires. And possibility vanishes just
that quickly, too. Kirk understands that, which is why she's
keeping her toe picks dug firmly into the present.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as she got back from Germany, gold medal in hand, Kirk
went back to Harwich High School to resume her sophomore year.
She'll still be there next season, taking assignments with her when
she competes overseas.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of skaters are home-schooled, but I don't want that kind
of a life,'' Kirk says. ``It's too much on skating. Anybody can get
injured at any time. What do you have to fall back on? Nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   It's slippery out there, as skaters like to say, and this
winter's darling can fall out of the spotlight as quickly as it
takes to splatter a double axel.
</P>
<P>
   ``With a young skater,'' muses Evy Scotvold, Kirk's coach, ``six
months is an eternity.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year's wondergirl was Naomi Nari Nam, the 13-year-old
daughter of Korean immigrants who leaped up from nowhere to finish
second behind Kwan. This year, she tumbled to eighth.
</P>
<P>
   This year's wondergirl was Sasha Cohen, the 15-year-old daughter
of a Ukrainian mother and American father who also leaped up from
nowhere to finish second behind Kwan. All she needed to claim her
ticket to next week's world championships in France was win a
medal, any medal, at the junior event.
</P>
<P>
   ABC followed Cohen all week, filming the lead-up to what
everyone figured would be a walk-through. But she didn't even
survive the short program, falling on both the triple lutz and the
double axel. Kirk climbed out of second place to overtake Deanna
Stellato and amaze herself as much as anyone else.
</P>
<P>
   The title capped a breakthrough season for a girl who didn't
begin skating until she was 9 after watching the 1994 Olympics in
Lillehammer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the whole Nancy-Tonya thing,'' Kirk says. ``Nancy was
so great and I admired her so much for what she went through.''
</P>
<P>
   Kirk had been a gymnast and a Boston Ballet dancer who performed
five times in ``The Nutcracker'' (``lamb twice, polichinelle once,
party girl twice''). But once she got a taste of skating at the MDC
rink in Watertown, Kirk found herself hooked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I skated like every place in Massachusetts where there was
ice,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Kirk ended up at the Skating Club of Boston, then migrated to
the Cape to work with Scotvold and his wife, Mary, who had directed
Nancy Kerrigan to a pair of Olympic medals. What they saw
immediately was a precocious leaper and natural performer who
soaked up instruction like a sponge.
</P>
<P>
   ``She went from a double lutz to a triple salchow in two
weeks,'' remembers Evy. ``It was the most amazing thing I ever
saw.''
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago Kirk was third at the novice nationals, and could
have won. Last year she was third at the junior nationals, and
should have won. Sara Wheat, who did win, was resigned to second
after watching Kirk skate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Inside, I felt I won,'' says Kirk, who lost because two judges
put her fourth. ``I know now it really didn't matter. But then it
was like someone punched me in the stomach.''
</P>
<P>
   Kirk could have taken another shot at the US junior crown this
year, but thought it pointless.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to move up and get going,'' she says. ``All the other
girls were doing it.''
</P>
<P>
   Nam and Sarah Hughes, both younger than Kirk, were already
competing at the elite level. Wheat and Cohen were moving up.
Stellato was taking the giant step from novices. Why wait?
</P>
<P>
   The step was bigger than Kirk had bargained for, even though she
had all the triple jumps she needed. When she turned up at
Cleveland for last month's US championships at Gund Arena, Kirk
admitted to being overwhelmed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The place was so big and everyone was so good,'' she said. ``I
just felt so little.''
</P>
<P>
   Buried in 11th after falling in the short program, Kirk came out
for Saturday's prime-time finale, saw a nearly full house buzzing,
and realized that all of America was watching.
</P>
<P>
   ``She came into the dressing room after warmup and she burst
into tears,'' Mary Scotvold says. ``She said, `I can't go out
there. There's too many people.' But within five minutes, she
bucked right up.''
</P>
<P>
   Just pretend your friends are around the boards watching,
Scotvold told her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want to go back on the ice,'' Kirk concedes. ``But
after the first jump the people were clapping so hard, I thought,
`They're all here to watch me.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Kirk ended up seventh, and might have been fifth had she not
fallen on the triple flip. She wasn't alone there; Kwan had fallen
on an easier jump in the short program.
</P>
<P>
   ``That made me feel better,'' Kirk says. ``I'm not the only
one.''
</P>
<P>
   Next year, when the championships are at the FleetCenter, Kirk's
friends will be around the boards watching. And she'll be decidedly
more ready for prime time. She'll have a second triple-triple
combination and possibly a tougher one. She'll have more nuanced
artistry. She'll have gotten more international exposure. She could
be ``the next Nancy.'' She could be at Olympus.
</P>
<P>
   Could, could, could. It's all conditional, Kirk realizes. A girl
named Sydne Vogel won the world junior title three years ago. Where
is Vogel now?
</P>
<P>
   Salt Lake City is still two years off, which is why Kirk is
still studying her biology and geometry. Because it's slippery out
there.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, Kirk and Hughes and Nam and Cohen and Wheat and
Stellato are chasing Kwan. But they're being chased, too. Two of
America's top three novices, Colette Irving of Winchester and
Louann Donovan of Medford, train with Kirk at Tony Kent Arena.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to keep looking in back of you and in front of you,''
says Kirk.

BRUINS GETTING THE HANG OF IT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY MARRAPESE-BURRELL  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Bruins coach Pat Burns was spitting tacks after
Thursday's overtime loss to the Chicago Blackhawks. He was still
furious during practice Friday, angry at his team for its mistakes,
frustrated at the club's inability to hold two-goal leads on three
occasions.
</P>
<P>
   But his goodwill was greatly restored Saturday after the Bruins
held off the Pittsburgh Penguins, 3-2, at the FleetCenter.
</P>
<P>
   It was pretty hairy at times, especially in the final minute
with Penguins goalie Ron Tugnutt pulled for an extra attacker, but
in the end, the young Bruins held on.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was inexcusable the other night,'' said Burns. ``I was
mad at them, I was mad at them at yesterday's practice. You can't
do that. But then, I sleep on it and say, `How many times have they
been involved in games like that, maybe five or six in their
careers?' Some of them none. But you've got to put them out there,
you've got nobody else. Then I sort of forgive them.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins' offense was sparked by defenseman Kyle McLaren, who
had 3 points _ a goal and two assists. It's been an eventful week
for McLaren, who last Wednesday became a father for the first time
when his daughter Madison Star was born. McLaren's output Saturday
tied a career high set back on April 7, 1996, his rookie year, in a
contest against Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins got off to a flying start, dominating an opening
period in which they outshot the Penguins, 13-2.
</P>
<P>
   Cameron Mann put Boston ahead, 1-0, with his fifth goal of the
year as he finished off a three-on-two and beat Tugnutt from the
left circle with a shot into the top right corner.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Nickulas made it a two-goal advantage with his second
strike of the year. Nickulas's tally came as a result of a booming
shot off the right wing reminiscent of former Bruin Cam Neely. The
shot, a slapper from atop the right circle, rocketed past Tugnutt's
glove at 16:04.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins got a scare just 1:05 into the second when Brandon
Smith was drilled into the boards from behind by Pittsburgh's Jan
Hrdina. Smith had just moved the puck up ice when Hrdina slammed
him into the boards and drew a five-minute major and game
misconduct for boarding. Smith was shaken up but played the rest of
the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think Hrdina really meant to do that, I think he lost
his balance at the time of the contact,'' said Burns. ``But it was
still hitting from behind, (Smith) was lucky.''
</P>
<P>
   As the period went on, the Bruins inexplicably stopped skating
and the Penguins picked up steam.
</P>
<P>
   Pittsburgh cut the lead in half at 9:56, cashing in on a
three-on-one rush. Martin Straka dished a pass to Tyler Wright in
the right circle. Wright beat John Grahame over his glove.
</P>
<P>
   The momentum shifted dramatically in Pittsburgh's favor after
the goal as Boston had a hard time handling the surging Penguins.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins received the biggest lift of the game from McLaren
with only 2.4 seconds remaining in the second when his hard slapper
from the right point buzzed past Tugnutt to restore Boston's
two-goal lead at 3-1.
</P>
<P>
   McLaren nearly had another strike only 1:18 in the final period
when he got the puck from Andre Savage and blasted a low shot from
the right side. It went under the glove of Tugnutt but hit the
right post.
</P>
<P>
   At 3:48, Matthew Barnaby brought the Penguins as close as they
would come. A shot by Michal Rozsival pinballed off a Bruin skate
and over to Barnaby, who redirected it past Grahame for his 10th
goal of the year. Late scoring bids by Straka and Janne Laukkanen
had everyone on the edge of their seats but Grahame held the fort.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were six guys on the ice trying to get a goal,'' said
Grahame. ``Sometimes it was a bit chaotic but we came out on top so
it's good.''
</P>
<P>
   As the season winds down, Burns said he and the club are
enjoying the role of spoiler.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're certainly going to cause some chaos in this conference
right now,'' said Burns. ``Some other people are probably a little
bit worried.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd really have to be very, very fortunate for teams to lose
a lot of games and us to win a lot for us to make it. There are six
teams fighting for two spots. Games are running out. I think just
the question of spoiling the parties for certain teams, that's
going to be our motivation.''

   TUCSON _ For one of them, it is over already. He will never wear
his college uniform again.
</P>
<P>
   Over the course of four seasons, Brian Cardinal of Purdue and
Eduardo Najera of Oklahoma have elevated their sport. Each has
brought muscle, coordination, shooting skill, determination,
brains, and, most of all, heart to every single basketball game.
Neither has ever taken so much as a second, let alone a day, off.
</P>
<P>
   They are so similar, and yet so different. Each is 6 feet 8
inches and change. Each is ruggedly built. Each can score inside
and out. Each would stand in front of an 18-wheeler to take a
charge. Each would run through the locker room door without opening
it if it was necessary to help win the game.
</P>
<P>
   But there is a major personal difference. Kneepad-wearing Brian
Cardinal is pure red, white, and blue. He is right out of a World
War II movie. He is a product of the heartland. His dad, Rod, is
the basketball trainer at the University of Illinois. He embodies
all the old-fashioned virtues coaches love to preach.
</P>
<P>
   Five years ago, Eduardo Najera didn't speak English. There
wasn't much need for it in his hometown of Chihuahua, Mexico. Today
he barely has an accent. But there is no way Brian Cardinal, or any
American, could relate to the path that led Eduardo Najera to this
NCAA tournament confrontation with the player he most resembles in
college basketball.
</P>
<P>
   It was perhaps the best subplot in the entire first two days of
the NCAA tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``They play a lot alike,'' said Purdue coach Gene Keady. ``They
dive on the floor. They take charges. They hit threes. They score
inside. They go all out. They are very similar in the way they play
the game.''
</P>
<P>
   True enough. But Oklahoma coach Kelvin Sampson saw it in a bit
more colorful vein.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I close my eyes and think of Eduardo and Brian,'' Sampson
rhapsodized, ``I picture the Revolutionary War with the fife and
drum. One of them has the drum, the other has the fife. Being
Eduardo's coach, I see him starring as the drummer. I see Brian
with his fife, wearing a white headband with blood all over it.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are throwback guys,'' Sampson continued. ``We hear a lot
about throwback guys, but these guys really are throwback guys.
They could have played in earlier times. It's a compliment to them
that they play in this time, but these are guys who would look good
in tight shorts. There are a lot of guys today who wouldn't look
good in tight shorts. They wouldn't even wear them. But Eduardo
would wear them. Brian would wear them. That's what makes them
special.''
</P>
<P>
   Something else makes them special in Sunday's game. Together
they have played in 254 college games. Each is a battle-tested
senior. Each came into a scary situation, wondering whether he
could ever fit in. Each redshirted as a freshman. Each made a nice
impression in his first year, but not enough to suggest he would
become a star. Each has gotten better and better. Each is viewed as
the emotional center of his team. And each is totally grateful for
having the full range of experience a complete college career can
provide.
</P>
<P>
   ``These last five years have been the best of my life,'' said
Najera. ``I have had so much fun. I've matured. I've experienced so
many things that it's hard for me to explain. Those guys who go
straight to the pros after one or two years, they miss so much, and
they can never get it back.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Those guys who go straight to the pros miss pretty much
everything,'' echoed Cardinal. ``Not just the basketball, but
college life in general. I've had so many great experiences. I've
traveled overseas twice. I've been to Maui. I've had many great
NCAA experiences. I'm very thankful to have been in this
position.''
</P>
<P>
   Strictly speaking, there are differences in their games. Najera
runs the floor and puts the ball on the floor better than Cardinal.
Cardinal is probably a bit more reliable outside shooter. He has a
veteran's confidence; witness a cold-blooded 3-pointer with just
over a minute left that put Purdue ahead by 3 in its 1-point
victory over Dayton Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   But in terms of basic versatility in a midsized body, and in
terms of bringing every physical, mental, and emotional resource to
the table, they are the same player. Each is as admired by his
teammates for who he is as for how he plays.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are the type of guys who will knock each other down and
then pick each other up,'' said Oklahoma center Renzi Stone, who
has known Najera for four years and strongly considered attending
Purdue. ``That's the way truly great competitors should be. It's
definitely not going to be nasty.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a lot of respect for Brian,'' said Najera. ``He plays
hard. He does what it takes to win. I feel I'm the same way.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Najera is a great player,'' countered Cardinal. ``Very strong.
Very physical. It's going to be an intense battle between us.''
</P>
<P>
   In a similar NBA situation, we could look forward to as many as
seven of these knock-down, drag-outs. But in the NCAA tournament,
we get only one. It's times like this when a VCR becomes an
indispensible ally.

CUBAN DEFECTOR RELISHES OPPORTUNITY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT CHARLOTTE, Fla. _ Jorge Diaz took 15 minutes of batting
practice with Rafael Palmeiro and Ivan Rodriguez on Saturday, spent
another 15 minutes taking ground balls from Bucky Dent and seemed
thrilled with every second of it.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Diaz proclaimed the experience a dream come true,
which is understandable considering he is the only known former
Cuban national player to defect not once but twice from that
country's Communist regime.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I didn't think it would happen,'' Diaz said after
his first workout with the Texas Rangers. ``Thank God it did.''
</P>
<P>
   Diaz, a second baseman who arrived in Florida on Thursday after
signing with the Rangers on Feb. 28, now faces the challenge of
making it to the majors. He hasn't played in an organized game in
almost three years and general manager Doug Melvin said getting
Diaz into an exhibition game will be difficult with only two weeks
left in spring training.
</P>
<P>
   Diaz most likely will start the season in Triple A where he will
have to prove he belongs in the major leagues. But after all he
went through to get to the United States, that might be the easiest
part of all.
</P>
<P>
   ``The difficult times are over,'' said Diaz, using Rangers scout
Sammy Melendez as an interpreter.
</P>
<P>
   Known as ``The Spider'' because of his defensive reputation,
Diaz played four years with Villa Clara during Cuba's regular
season and another three years for Centrales in their All-Star
Series. But his life was changed forever in July 1997 when he was
suspended indefinitely from baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Diaz's crime was talking by telephone to former Villa Clara
teammate Rolando Arrojo, who had defected earlier that year and
signed with the Tampa Bay Devil Rays.
</P>
<P>
   ``They considered him a security risk,'' his agent Joe Kehoskie
said.
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to play baseball again, Diaz attempted to defect in March
of the following year. He and several others, including Mets
infielder Jorge Toca, floated off the island in a 12-foot boat.
</P>
<P>
   The currents took them to the Bahamas where they were picked up,
detained and, with the exception of Toca, returned to Cuba. Diaz
was not treated kindly.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a little easier for him because he was high-profile
baseball player,'' Kehoskie said. ``He just couldn't disappear like
a lot of people disappear. But it wasn't a picnic. He was brought
in for interrogation by the state security people every three days.
Sometimes he was brought in three days in a row when there was a
political event going on.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was just hanging on with his family and scraping by.
Sometimes friends gave him meals. Arrojo sent him money, but that's
a tricky business. When we first met him he was all skin and
bones.''
</P>
<P>
   Diaz decided to defect again. His reasons were clear although he
refuses to speak out against Cuban dictator Fidel Castro because he
has family still on the island.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had nothing to lose,'' Diaz said. ``I went through a very
hard time. Once you leave the country, when you come back, you're
marked as a defector. You're considered no good, especially with
the people who are for the Cuban government. People point at you
and say, `there's a defector.' ''
</P>
<P>
   This time, in August 1998, the plan was a little more
coordinated, and he escaped by yacht, first to Honduras, then
Mexico, Nicaragua and finally Costa Rica where he was granted
residency in February 1999. He and Osmani Garcia, who also signed
with the Rangers, moved to the Dominican Republic in October and
were working out there.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers gave Diaz a $50,000 signing bonus, far below the
millions paid to pitchers Orlando Hernandez, Livan Hernandez,
Arrojo and Danys Baez. Diaz was a .283 hitter in Cuba with good
speed but little power.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was on the shelf a long time, and major-league baseball
really hasn't figured out the Cuban position player,'' Kehoskie
said. ``I know this may sound crazy but he's close. He's much more
advanced than a lot of people give him credit for. His bat is going
to need time, but I've not seen five better defensive second
basemen in my life.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers will begin determining that now and Diaz said,
``they've given me this opportunity, and I'll do anything
possible.''
</P>
<P>
   He has already shown that. nn

ROY IS CHAMPION OF BOURQUE'S CAUSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY MARRAPESE-BURRELL  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ When Patrick Roy was traded to the Colorado Avalanche
that fateful day _ Dec. 6, 1995 _ after publicly announcing he had
played his last game for the Montreal Canadiens, it was hard to
imagine seeing Roy in any uniform other than the bleu, blanc, and
rouge.
</P>
<P>
   When Ray Bourque was sent West to that same destination, asking
to be moved after nearly 21 years in a Bruins uniform, it was even
harder to imagine him in anything but black and gold.
</P>
<P>
   So it seemed fitting that Roy, Bourque's Olympic and All-Star
teammate, chaired the welcome wagon committee in Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   Roy wouldn't go so far as to say Bourque is playing like a man
who has just been released from jail, but it's not that much of a
stretch.
</P>
<P>
   ``He looks like 34 years old,'' said Roy, making a sly reference
to his own age. ``It's fun to see the way Ray is playing right now.
He looks younger. Sometimes when you get moved, it brings a little
fun and sometimes it's good to make a change. We're all afraid of
making change, but when it happens, sometimes you think it might
give a second wind to your career.''
</P>
<P>
   This year in Boston, Bourque, at 39, clearly looked like a man
at the end of the road. Though he remained as gracious as always,
he smiled less, kept to himself more, and on the ice, he looked as
if the weight of the world were on his shoulders. A former teammate
said he watched in agony as Bourque grew sadder and sadder.
</P>
<P>
   But with the Avalanche, Bourque is surrounded by talent and is
playing with more energy, more enthusiasm, and so much hope.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice to see the way he's playing right now,'' said Roy.
``You see him play against you or play with him in the Olympics but
when you see him play every night, you see him so solid
defensively. He's taking a little bit of chances but he's so good
defensively. One on one, he's hard to beat. He's made some great
plays on the blue line and his shot is so accurate, it's fun to
watch.''
</P>
<P>
   The additions of Bourque and Dave Andreychuk have bolstered the
Avalanche's chances of making a ferocious Stanley Cup run. But Roy
was as shocked as Bourque when the trade was made, because most on
the Avalanche thought Bourque was bound for Philadelphia, as he had
requested.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought we were not in the hunt,'' said Roy. ``When we
heard the news, we were very excited. It brought a lot of
excitement to the team and maybe it was the kind of spark that we
needed. Since he's been here, we haven't lost, and the team is
playing better and better every game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like our chance to win the Cup right now,'' said Roy, a
three-time Vezina Trophy winner who has three Stanley Cup rings
from 1986, '93, and '96.
</P>
<P>
   Roy is no small part of Colorado's equation. Going into the
weekend, he had a record of 27-19-8, on pace to reach 30 victories
for the 10th time in his 15-year NHL career. With 439 career wins,
he is chasing Terry Sawchuk's NHL mark of 447.It has only been in
the last three or four years that he started paying close attention
to the record.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started thinking maybe it would be possible when I reached
300 wins when I was in Colorado,'' said Roy. ``I thought maybe it
would be touchable. When you look at it, it's hard to believe,
especially when you start your first season, that you're going to
one day be close like I am right now. When you're starting your
first year, you say, `That's a little far, and I'll be very happy
if I can survive 10 years in this league.' ''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Roy, who was always fond of his visits to Boston, has followed
the hockey situation here, especially with regard to the future of
Pat Burns. Burns coached Roy for four years in Montreal, and though
they didn't always see eye to eye then, Roy has a somewhat
different perspective now. ``Pat Burns is a very, very good
coach,'' said Roy. ``All the years he was with us in Montreal, I
certainly learned a lot from the way he was coaching. People are
hard on him in Boston right now but I think he does a very good job
in that situation. He's certainly one of the best coaches is this
league and he's certainly one of the best coaches I ever had. It
was always a pleasure to play under him. Maybe there were things I
didn't understand (about) what he was doing and I regret today but
overall all I can say is I have a lot of respect for this man as a
coach and as a person as well.'' . . . It is impossible not to be
horrified by the graphic video that shows Toronto defenseman Bryan
Berard getting struck in the face by the stick of Ottawa forward
Marian Hossa. Berard, just 23, is facing exploratory surgery on his
right eye, which has a 3/4-inch cut, and he could lose sight in it
if the retina cannot be reattached. The incident has prompted a
renewed debate about face shields. Some players, such as Bruins
defenseman Don Sweeney, wouldn't go without one. ``I just felt with
the way I play, at my size and my height, I just caught too many
accidental things,'' said Sweeney. ``I used to practice a little
bit without one. Now it's even worse. It's not so much that the
intent is ever there, but you've got too many accidental things
coming your way. The shield for me just took care of those things.
Everybody goes through a little bit of a stigma about it, like
you're hiding behind it or it's not a brave thing to be wearing it
and stuff like that.'' Sweeney, who is pound for pound as tough a
player as there is in the NHL, would much rather endure the verbal
abuse than deal with the dire prospects facing Berard. ``You do go
through that period where guys are giving you a hassle about it,
like `Take off the phone booth' or some comment that comes your
way, but why take it off?'' said Sweeney. ``With Berard, obviously,
you just feel sick. You get a real empty feeling in your stomach
when you hear anything about it.'' The issue hits home with Sweeney
more than others because one of his prematurely born twins is
having vision problems. ``Obviously, I'm a little sensitive because
of what my boys have gone through,'' said Sweeney. ``It's just
crazy unfortunate for Berard. You just feel bad for him.'' But
Sweeney doesn't necessarily favor an edict from the league
requiring shields. ``It should be everybody's choice still,'' he
said. ``You do look at guys who do come in and ask, `Why would they
take that risk?' It just brings up that question. But I wouldn't
look down on anybody for taking it off or putting it on.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He was raised in Ludlow, so even though San Jose general manager
Dean Lombardi toils on the West Coast, he still keeps an eye on the
hockey in his native state. He has followed the Bruins' travails
this year, and as a fellow executive, he thinks Harry Sinden is a
little misunderstood here. ``One thing about Harry he doesn't
really get enough credit for, is he really does care,'' said
Lombardi. ``Sometimes it doesn't come across because of the hard
line with the money. Sometimes he gets ticked off and maybe says
some things. But deep down, he really cares about hockey. I think
he's really concerned about where some things are going. I don't
think, having grown up in Massachusetts, that you always appreciate
that until you see him every day and go to (the GMs) meetings and
see him operate.'' Vancouver GM Brian Burke likened the experience
of being on committees with Sinden to the E.F. Hutton commercials
in which everyone leans in to hear what one person is saying.
Lombardi said it sometimes takes a minute to absorb Sinden's point.
``A lot of times he'll say something and at first you'll go,
`What's he talking about?' '' said Lombardi. ``And then you sit
back and think about it and say, `Oh yeah,' and everybody goes,
`Why didn't I think of that?' Other times, you'll think, `Where's
he going with this?' and then you think, `Damn, he's right.' '' . .
. The Kings, who looked as if they were poised to do some damage in
the Western Conference playoffs, were dealt a gigantic setback when
they lost Ziggy Palffy with a sprained right shoulder. Palffy, one
of the most dynamic forwards in the league, is expected to be
sidelined 2-4 weeks. He was tied for the team lead in scoring . . .
21 days until this sorry season ends in Boston.

FOR REVOLUTION, A POINT WELL TAKEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. _ The revamped Revolution rallied to make
a positive start to their fifth MLS season Saturday &UR;  &LR; night. They
played the Miami Fusion to a 1-1 tie, and became the first
beneficiary of a league policy that rewards a point to each team
for drawn games, in concert with FIFA rules.
</P>
<P>
   But the Revolution experienced major difficulties in the first
half, especially from striker Diego Serna, who scored in the 61st
minute. Coach Fernando Clavijo made key tactical adjustments in the
second half, and the Revolution equaled on a goal by Imad Baba in
the 80th minute.
</P>
<P>
   By then, the Revolution had asserted themselves in midfield with
the addition of 22-year-old Costa Rican William Sunsing on the
right wing and striker Eduardo Hurtado.
</P>
<P>
   ``I liked that when we got down we kept playing and nobody lost
their head,'' said Clavijo, the fifth head coach of the Revolution.
``Little by little we will get to know each other better. For a few
minutes we got out of what we want to do, but we kept our
composure. But this is only one of 32 games. I've said all along
that we have the talent.''
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution struggled in central defense, though their
problems were caused as much by the elusiveness and persistence of
Serna as their own deficiencies. In fact, the combination of Brian
Dunseth and Ivan McKinley appears to have matured since they were
last paired in '98, though McKinley was cautioned late in the first
half.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, the Fusion were applying consistent pressure on
goalkeeper Jeff Causey, who made a point-blank stop on Andy
Williams midway through the half. But in the second half, Leonel
Alvarez and John Harkes began pressuring Miami's defensive
midfielders, and Sunsing opened the attack on the right wing in
place of Johnny Torres.
</P>
<P>
   Right back Rusty Pierce, playing his first MLS game in place of
Mike Burns, limited Eric Wynalda and displayed poise until
departing with leg cramps midway through the second half.
</P>
<P>
   Hurtado replaced Mauricio Ramos in the 74th minute, joining
Wolde Harris in attack. Harris, whose ability to retain possession
and dribble through defenders keyed the Revolution offense in the
first half, combined with Hurtado and Sunsing to nearly decide the
contest in the 88th minute. But Harris was stopped by goalkeeper
Jeff Cassar on the edge of the goal area as a torrent of rain
scattered a crowd of 8,782.
</P>
<P>
   ``I should have first-timed it, but I took a long touch and it
was a slippery surface,'' Harris said. ``But we played well and
it's a matter of time for us to play even better. I would love to
have (Hurtado) up top with me because then the defense can't only
key on me. For most of the game, the defense was looking only for
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Clavijo said Hurtado and Sunsing have a chance to start next
week at Tampa Bay.
</P>
<P>
   This was the third consecutive Revolution season opener to
finish 1-1 in regulation. The Revolution lost to D.C. United (1998)
and Miami ('99) in shootouts.
</P>
<P>
   But the league switched this season to a 10-minute golden goal
overtime, and the Revolution nearly capitalized. They missed the
victory by inches as Harkes's 25-yard drive from straight on in the
second minute of overtime somehow curled off the left side of the
net. Harkes, who replaced Burns as captain, had a strong game and
helped hold the Revolution together in midfield.
</P>
<P>
   Baba and Ted Chronopoulos also showed improvement in their fifth
season, and combined for the goal as Chronopoulos curled a free
kick from the left and the Fusion left Baba open. Baba calmly
volleyed a hard, low shot just inside the post for his first goal
since Sept. 19, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``We showed a lot of character fighting back,'' Harkes said.
``We were more together than we were last year and now we have to
come together more. If we are patient and take care of the final
ball better, we will be OK.''

NETS CAN'T SEEM TO GET THEMSELVES UNTANGLED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ For those fans of the New Jersey Nets _ yes, there are
some _ this past week was a killer. Here was a team priming for a
playoff run while getting prepared to welcome back Jayson Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Then, on one of those innocuous moves at practice, it all fell
apart for the apparently cursed Williams. His right knee, the one
that sidelined him all season, held up. His left foot did not. He
broke his toe, and he's gone for the year. It remains to be seen
whether the team goes with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what it all means,'' sighed coach Don Casey. ``I
guess it must mean that God is telling me to go play golf. But I
don't play golf.''
</P>
<P>
   It's one more slap in the face to a team that had very
legitimate playoff aspirations. There also was the early-season
loss of Kerry Kittles, the shuffling of positions, the strange play
of Keith Van Horn and, of course, the implausible 2-15 start.
</P>
<P>
   ``We started off dysfunctional,'' Casey said. ``I think we all
look back now and say, `How did we ever go 2-15?' But that's over.
We've recovered.''
</P>
<P>
   Since that dreadful start, the Nets are 26-21. They are fighting
with the Celtics and others for a playoff spot. They've got a point
guard in Stephon Marbury, who, according to Rick Pitino, is playing
as well as, or better than, any point guard in the league.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the bad news. Williams stepped on the foot of Even
Eschmeyer and the next thing Casey knew, his center was limping and
having a serious talk with the trainer. That is not what he wanted
to see. He knew then something was amiss.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the big thing was that we were disappointed more than
anything else,'' Casey said. ``Everyone saw how hard he worked.
Everyone saw how well his knee was holding up. It's a shame, it
really is. He went over and above what he needed to do and you
wanted him to make it back for all kinds of reasons.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though the Nets have Marbury, Van Horn, and Kittles, they
have only one All-Star: Williams (from the 1998 game). Take his
$12.375 million salary off the books and the Nets go from having
the fifth-highest payroll ($52-plus million) to the 19th ($40-plus
million).
</P>
<P>
   But Williams is missed as much for what he does off the court,
particularly as a mental bodyguard for Van Horn. That is why Casey
wants Williams to be with the team for as many games as possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a rallying-around type guy,'' Casey said. ``We want to
make him feel wanted because he's just devastated about it.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Nets are to get into the playoffs, they'll have to finish
ahead of the Celtics, because Boston has the tie-breaker. They've
learned to play without Williams all season _ his return kept
getting pushed back _ and Casey is thinking about dusting off
Gheorghe Muresan, who is playing well in practice.
</P>
<P>
   The coach can't do any more long-term thinking than that. He's
not under contract for next season. Rumors have been flying all
season about a top-to-bottom, Steinbrenneresque shakeup in the
organization. Casey said he's heard nothing about his future, but
it's impossible to miss the obvious: The team has made progress
despite all the hurdles.
</P>
<P>
   The latest one seems a bit of overkill. But the Hoop God isn't
fair; just ask the Warriors' Garry St. Jean or the Cavaliers' Randy
Wittman. The Nets have been resilient if nothing else, and the
final month will be another test.

   Kenny Anderson was asked about Chicago's Elton Brand for Rookie
of the Year and shook his head. ``Steve Francis is my man,'' said
Anderson. Is this a bonding thing among point guards? Well, sort
of. ``In general, it's always big first and small second in the
league,'' Anderson explained. ``Nowadays, they're getting a grip on
how important a point guard is, that he can turn an organization
around. When the little guy does something, it's more because we're
so undersized. It's a big man's game. To do what he's doing, as a
rookie, is great. He should get looked at not only as a great
talent, but because of the size he's doing it at. I think all of us
should get looked at like that. A lot of people don't understand
that we take serious physical abuse going in and out of the lane,
penetrating, going for rebounds, getting pushed. It's hell on a
little guy's body.'' . . . Francis, by the way, was summoned to a
meeting with commissioner David Stern and other league bigwigs at
the NBA offices when the Rockets passed through New York. The
reason: to impress upon him how important is it for young players
in the league to carry it into the new century with dignity,
respect, and George Sanders-like manners. Of course, Francis is
still Francis. Before Houston played the Bucks Thursday, he said he
was looking forward to going against another motormouth, Sam
Cassell. ``I'm going to light his butt up,'' Francis said. ``I
don't want to make it personal, but I'm going to light him up.''
Well, Francis had 22 points on 7-of-16 shooting. Cassell had 22
points on 7-of-14 shooting. Sounds like a standoff to me. The Bucks
won the game . . . Two nights after Sean Elliott's remarkable
return from a kidney transplant, the Spurs got spanked at home by
the Mavericks. In between the emotional victory over the Hawks and
the stunning loss to Dallas, Elliott talked about his comeback.
``It's worth it to me for a lot reasons,'' he said. ``It's not just
about myself. In a way it is, because there's a part of me that
wants to prove it to myself and I want to satisfy something in
myself. But there's another part of me that wants to make a
statement for a lot of people who have gone through my situation,
or other people who maybe aren't having kidney transplants, but
have faced illness or adversity and think they can't recover from
what they're going through.'' As for his rehab, Elliott said he
didn't exactly follow the Drew Carey Fit For Life Plan. ``I didn't
make my comeback wolfing down a cheeseburger, fries, and a 32-ounce
beer every day and sitting around,'' he said. ``I went out and took
care of my body and people don't see that aspect of it, so maybe
that needs to be talked about a little more.'' Elliott has moved
into the starting lineup, which has helped ease the constant
ovations. He played only eight minutes in the 22-point loss to
Dallas and had 2 points, 4 rebounds, a blocked shot, and a
turnover.

   Karl Malone has gone public on a lot of topics in, of all
places, Penthouse Magazine. You can read the interview in the April
issue, which, of course, is why people buy Penthouse . . . Dee
Brown has not had an easy season in Toronto. But the latest episode
may top them all. He was put on the IL with what was a ``wink,
wink'' upper respiratory ailment. Well, eventually word got out
that Brown was supposedly out of shape and he did not take kindly
to that spin. Brown and coach Butch Carter met for four hours to
try to smooth things out. Carter tried to take some heat by saying
he should never have brought Brown back after recent knee surgery.
Charles Oakley came to Brown's defense, calling the affair ``total
bull.'' That's how Brown sees it. But more important, he wants to
get back on the court because he's a free agent and needs to show
prospective employers he's able to play . . . Gotta love the Jazz.
They are assured of a winning season for the 15th consecutive year,
one shy of the record set by the Lakers, who went from 1976-77
through 1991-92 with a winning record. The Celtics went 19 straight
seasons (1950-51 through 1968-69) without a losing year, but in
1954-55, they went 36-36. ``The Jazz do it the way it's supposed to
be done, simple,'' says center Olden Polynice. ``There's nothing
flashy. We're probably the only team that follows the NBA
guidelines. We don't have guys with braids, running around, looking
crazy, shoelaces untied. Jerry Sloan treats everyone the same. As
long as you work hard, you'll be fine. It was hard for me at the
beginning. The little things like having your drawstring tucked in.
That drives him crazy if it's out. There was one game when Greg
Ostertag was going in for a layup and Jerry was yelling at him to
put his drawstring in. I'm thinking, `Let him make the layup
first.' ''

   Pitino is now looking for athletes (in addition to veterans, a
big man, and a scorer off the bench). One reason: His team has
trouble against quicker teams like Detroit, which has won five
straight from the Celtics over the last two seasons. ``It's why
they give us problems,'' he said of the speedy Pistons, citing
Jerry Stackhouse, Grant Hill, and the ultra-energetic Jerome
Williams. ``We have some fine basketball players: (Paul Pierce,
(Antoine) Walker, (Adrian) Griffin, Kenny. They're basketball
players, but I wouldn't distinguish them as great athletes. (Tony)
Battie has the potential to be a very good athlete. Antoine has
tremendous growth as an athlete. Paul has growth. Griff and Kenny,
well, what you see is what you're going to get.'' . . . Williams
should get some serious and well-earned consideration for the Sixth
Man Award, especially if Detroit continues to play well under
George (What, Me Worry?) Irvine. Former Georgetown coach John
Thompson did the Celtics-Pistons game last Monday on TBS and
offered these thoughts on his former player: ``Jerome has a
tremendous work ethic and what's in his favor is he does the things
in the game that people don't want to do. He will defend. He will
rebound. He will hustle. He can do things rebounding-wise that
reminds me of Dennis Rodman. You can't teach those things. It took
a while for Jerome to believe that. I think he perceived himself as
a point guard, as a swingman bringing the ball down the floor. All
the glamour stuff. But once he started focusing on rebounding and
defending, that got him more playing time.'' Thompson said Williams
was one of those players ``who fell through the cracks,'' because
he wasn't good enough either in high school (Magruder in
Germantown, Md.) or junior college (Montgomery County, Md.) to
attract a lot of recruiting interest. He was the 26th player taken
in the 1996 draft . . . The Bucks have opened the door for the
Celtics and Nets. The reason: They don't play defense, which is not
in keeping with a George Karl team. ``I guess they'll want me for
offensive clinics this summer,'' cracked Karl. ``Now I'm going to
be paid for my offense. I've gone from being a smart coach to a
dumb coach.'' How does he feel as he watches his team attempt to
defend? ``It drives me crazy,'' he said. ``We don't stop people.
The true great teams stop and score. They do both. When you're with
a good team, you gotta be able to win any way. You gotta be able to
win ugly, win good, win pretty, win fast, win slow, win big. Teams
are going to throw things at you and you have to adjust. It's not
real hard, the last time I checked. Sometimes our players really
don't understand.''

SCARY EPISODE HAUNTS CORDERO

   FORT MYERS, Fla. _ When Hollywood finally learns baseball is
ripe for a TV series, the star in the pilot should be Marty
Cordova. He's muscular, dark-haired, and handsome, and has one heck
of a tale to tell.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a bad 48 hours,'' is how Cordova looks back at last
Wednesday and Thursday. ``Worst 48 hours of my baseball career.
Weird.''
</P>
<P>
   Therein the tale.
</P>
<P>
   Cordova was back with the Red Sox Saturday, his ribs sore, his
mind a tad less confused than it was midweek, but still in limbo.
</P>
<P>
   He is _ and he is not _ a member of the Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   Therein the subplot.
</P>
<P>
   Let's first cut to the action, the opening scene, in which Red
Sox manager Jimy Williams and various Boston and Pittsburgh
trainers are in short left field of a small minor league field in
Bradenton, Fla., signaling for a stretcher. Red Sox shortstop Nomar
Garciaparra had just gotten to his feet after colliding with
Cordova, but there was Cordova, still on the grass, unable to get
up.
</P>
<P>
   And worse.
</P>
<P>
   Unable to breathe.
</P>
<P>
   Gasping.
</P>
<P>
   ``No way I'm going out on a stretcher,'' thought Cordova. ``I
said, `I'm OK,' but I turned over to try and get up and I couldn't
breathe. I'd never been hurt where I couldn't breathe like that.
I've had the wind knocked out of me where if I breathed in, it
hurt. But this time I couldn't breathe in or out.''
</P>
<P>
   And the stretcher was being carried to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't going to be put in any stretcher,'' said Cordova. ``I
always laugh at guys who fall down when they foul a ball off their
foot and they're hurt? I always say, `I'm never going to go off the
field like that.' So, no stretcher. No way.''
</P>
<P>
   Marty Cordova, tough guy. Flash back to some painful moments in
Cordova's career with Minnesota, when he would be in pain, but not
evidently so.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I got hit by a pitch, I'd go to first right away no matter
how badly it hurt,'' said Cordova. ``I broke my wrist in spring
training once _ broke it in half _ and I just got up and walked
off. But this time I couldn't breathe. It was weird.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, Cordova had to get off the field somehow. And the Red Sox,
particularly a distraught Garciaparra, whose knee had banged into
Cordova's ribs while the two were chasing a popup, saw the problems
Cordova was having breathing and were anxious. Not to mention
scared.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `Damn, there's something wrong with my chest,' ''
Cordova said. ``So I lay there for a moment and I didn't want to
move until I could see if I could get my breath. Then I was able to
sit up, and I just wanted to get off the field.''
</P>
<P>
   After about five minutes on the grass, Cordova was able to get
up and walk away before being taken to Manatee Memorial Hospital,
just a fungo from McKechnie Field.
</P>
<P>
   Now, to the subplot.
</P>
<P>
   Cordova was playing in the game just because Williams was being
nice (``I can't say enough how well Jimy Williams has handled
this,'' said Cordova) and just because playing might melt some of
the anger he felt from the previous day. That was when Cordova
learned that Red Sox general manager Dan Duquette was not signing
him to a major league contract as Cordova had expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was not particularly the best day in my career,'' said
Cordova.
</P>
<P>
   Some players might have sulked. Others might have ripped their
uniform to shreds. But go hell-bent for a popup in an exhibition
game?
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the way I am,'' said Cordova. ``I always play hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, back to real life.
</P>
<P>
   Cordova's sore ribs will keep him out of action for another day
or so (``I hope to be back hitting Tuesday'') and he's still in
limbo. He doesn't know whether he'll be a member of the Red Sox or
any other team.
</P>
<P>
   Duquette said Saturday that Cordova ``is still a viable
option.'' And Cordova said his agent has contacted other teams, but
``I don't know anything. I'm the kind of person who doesn't want to
know until it's definite. So I don't know what's happening with my
agent. I told him not to tell me anything until he has something
certain.''
</P>
<P>
   One minor point before Cordova does his pilot for the TV series.
First, he'd like to know all details of the plot.
</P>
<P>
   ``How hard did Nomar get me?'' Cordova asked, some details of
the crash still fuzzy. ``Was it really hard?''
</P>
<P>
   Uh-huh. Hard enough to show.
</P>

LOVE IS FINDING A WAY AT BAY HILL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM MCCABE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ORLANDO, Fla. _ As the golf world has slowly become Tiger
Woods's personal possession, there has been one consistent voice
determined not to fade quietly into the background: Davis Love.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, in the third round of the Bay Hill Invitational, Love
proved that he hasn't relented one bit. That as fruitless as it
seems sometimes, he again will challenge Woods. Love made his
statement with a dynamic 9-under-par 63 that equaled the course
record and vaulted him over 14 players into second place at
14-under 202. That the man in front is Woods (67_200) is of no
surprise to Love _ who is painfully familiar with the script.
</P>
<P>
   ``If anybody starts beating you, you start thinking about
that,'' said Love, whose round included a 40-foot birdie putt and a
pair of chip-ins _ one for eagle, one for birdie. ``He thrives on
that. But we just have to learn to compete with him.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a test for which Love has studied three times, without
success. Woods's first PGA Tour win (October 1996) came at the
expense of Love in a Las Vegas Invitational playoff. Last fall,
Woods beat Love in a low-key PGA Grand Slam event, but when the
stakes were raised for the Andersen Consulting Match Play
semifinals in February, the result was the same _ ``I just got
smoked,'' said Love, a 5-and-4 loser.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always used to say to the players out here, this guy (Woods)
is nowhere as good as he's going to be.''
</P>
<P>
   And now that Love's assessment has come true, he has more:
``He's the No. 1 player in the world. There's no getting around
that. He's going to be hard to beat. There's no getting around
that, either. But I've been saying for the past few months (while
Woods was putting together a six-tournament winning streak) that
someone has to knock him down in the dirt to show him that he can
lose.''
</P>
<P>
   To do so, it may take something like another 63 because Woods,
attempting to win for the third time this season, is as close to a
sure thing as there is in golf when he's leading. In his brief but
spectacular pro career, Woods has had the lead or a share of it 16
times through 54 holes. He has won 15 of those times. Nothing he
did in Round 3 Saturday indicated he'll let this one get away.
</P>
<P>
   Starting the day 11 under, one ahead of Mike Weir, Woods bogeyed
the par-3 second. A minor burp, because he drilled an 8-iron inside
of 3 feet at the third, made birdie, and led by three as Weir (72)
made bogey. It set Woods off deeper into red numbers. Weir's
second-round 64 was a distant memory when he made the turn in 36,
and though he got it to 12-under through 17, a double-bogey on the
closing hole dropped the Canadian into third, six behind.
</P>
<P>
   Love, who hasn't won in two years, pretty much made this into a
two-player race thanks to a series of dramatic shots that proved
good fortune and skill are tough to beat.
</P>
<P>
   He trailed by five shots when he drained that no-brainer at the
11th. When he chipped in for eagle at the 12th and followed with a
sand wedge to 6 feet for birdie at the 13th, he was 11-under and
breathing down Woods's neck.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was looking at the leaderboard,'' said Woods, nine groups
behind Love. ``Under these conditions, I thought it was difficult
to shoot a low round, but Davis proved otherwise.''
</P>
<P>
   ``With an asterisk,'' said Love, who birdied the par-4 15th even
though he chunked his approach short of the green, then eagled the
517-yard 16th after drilling his 5-iron approach to 12 feet. ``You
know, I did chip in twice. So you take those away and, well 65 is
still a very, very good round.''
</P>
<P>
   No argument, said Woods, who was more proud of his par saves at
the seventh, 10th, and 13th than the three birdies he made coming
in. The saves came at a time when Love was climbing the leaderboard
with frightening ease, and served notice that Woods would have to
be caught; he wasn't going to fall back.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what you need to do,'' said Woods of those
up-and-downs. ``You can't always hit the ball great.''
</P>
<P>
   And you can't keeping winning head-to-head against the same guy,
can you? Woods paused, knowing his track record against Love is
flawless.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can look at it two different ways,'' he said. ``You can
say he's due, or you can say there is an advantage (for me).''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With John Daly and Dennis Paulson in the lead group, it appeared
to be a track meet. The duo played in a shade over three hours,
though the quick pace obviously did not bother Paulson, who
finished birdie-eagle-par-birdie in a round of 68. Daly, after
turning in 35, made two doubles on the back to come in with 40_75 .
. . Steve Flesch has made the cut in all eight starts this year . .
. Olin Browne and Billy Andrade, who played with Woods the first
two days, found themselves paired for Round 3. Each played well,
with Browne reeling off four straight birdies starting at the
fourth in his round of 68_209. Andrade, who made the cut for just
the third time in eight starts, shot 69_210.

WATSON'S FLAWLESS GAME HAD SHADES OF WALTON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS - UCLA guard Earl Watson's play Saturday night
against Maryland was like Kevin Spacey's acting, Tyra Banks'
complexion, the Hope Diamond. It was like the downtown L.A. skyline
after the Santa Anas have swept away the smog.
</P>
<P>
   It was mesmerizing. Flawless. Breathtaking.
</P>
<P>
   It broke the spirit of Maryland, which had no rejoinder for the
sweetest performance by a UCLA player in the NCAA Tournament since
Bill Walton made 21 of 22 shots against Memphis State in the 1973
title game.
</P>
<P>
   In the Bruins' 105-70 annihilation of the No. 3-seeded
Terrapins, Watson distributed a school record 16 assists.
</P>
<P>
   In Watson's hands, the basketball some days is a firecracker.
But in the biggest game in his 20-year-old life, he handled it like
a baby in swaddling clothes. Implausibly, he didn't turn the ball
over once in 26 minutes against a defense that prides itself on
making opposing point guards feel like they're dribbling into the
eye of a hurricane.
</P>
<P>
   Incredibly, he made 6 of 7 shots, including 5 of 6 from beyond
the 3-point arc.
</P>
<P>
   Implacably, he added four steals; five if you include his
wresting of the spotlight from everybody else on the floor (plus
upset-minded Gonzaga in Tucson and Syracuse in Cleveland).
</P>
<P>
   Inexplicably, he did all this just 48 hours after a six
turnover, 0-for-3-from-beyond-the-arc showing in a sloppy
first-round win over Ball State.
</P>
<P>
   ``He did just about everything you can do as a point guard,''
Maryland coach Gary Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   On this night Williams was guilty of a couple of things; not
preparing his team for the backcuts by JaRon Rush and Jerome Moiso
that begat a half-dozen alley-oop dunks, for one thing. And making
sure one of his players preferably someone who ate garlic cloves
for his pregame meal was breathing in the face of freshman gunner
Jason Kapono, for another.
</P>
<P>
   But in his assessment of Watson's play, Williams was not guilty
of overstatement.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind the Terrapins; the way Watson was running the team,
the Bruins would have beaten the Washington Wizards.
</P>
<P>
   Watson had earned the right to swagger into the postgame press
conference. Instead, he sort of limped up to the podium, favoring
the right knee he had skinned in the play that augured his august
night.
</P>
<P>
   Three-and-a-half minutes into the game, which most people had
expected to be a nail-biter, Maryland guard Steve Blake stole the
ball from Watson around midcourt. Blake took the ball to the hoop
for what looked to bean easy layup.
</P>
<P>
   Watson, though, had other ideas. He swooped in and knocked the
ball cleanly out of Blake's hand as the freshman was bringing the
ball up to the glass. Blake looked startled and Watson was
momentarily stunned; he landed hard against the basket stanchion
and suffered a cut above his left eye that probably was going to
need two or three stitches. On the way down, he suffered the floor
burn on his knee.
</P>
<P>
   At the other end, Jerome Moiso slammed home a dunk to give the
Bruins a 14-2 lead and Watson his third assist.
</P>
<P>
   ``For him to make a defensive play like that, that tells you the
kind of intensity he brought to the game tonight,'' Rush said.
</P>
<P>
   What followed shortly thereafter was the first fireworks
display. The Metrodome lit up when Watson lobbed a pass to Rush,
who rose with his back to the basket and forcibly guided the ball
over his head and through the hoop to put the Bruins ahead 23-19.
</P>
<P>
   Watson would alley-oop the Terrapins to death. He set up four of
the highlight-reel plays in the first half alone. The surprise
wasn't that he opted time and again for the razzle dazzle it was
clear to anybody who watched UCLA's eight-point win over Ball State
that it's UCLA's preferred play.
</P>
<P>
   The shock was that the Terrapins defended it like it was the
last thing they expected to see.
</P>
<P>
   When the Bruins' rhythm is right, the alley-oop is a
devastatingly effective weapon. It was like a dagger to Maryland's
heart. ``I think it takes a little bit out of (an opponent)
mentally,'' Rush said.
</P>
<P>
   At the start of the second half, Watson twisted the dagger in
deeper when he made four 3-pointers and added a dunk off an
alley-oop from Kapono. In four furious minutes it was Watson 14,
Maryland 2, and Williams had no choice but to use his final timeout
to try to revive his stunned soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   The final 16 minutes, 42 seconds was like a slow-motion replay
of a very bad dream for the 16th-ranked Terrapins. For the Bruins,
the time flew. Every player who suited up contributed at least one
point to the rout.
</P>
<P>
   Watson made it all look elementary.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, as he pointed out, he couldn't have done it without
his teammates, who shot 62.5 percent from the field. ``I have the
easiest part, just giving them the ball,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, but on this night he did it all.

WHICH WAY TO TURN WITH CART?

<P>
   ORLANDO, Fla. _ You'll excuse PGA Tour officials if they appear
confused. In golfing terminology, they are in between clubs, unsure
of which to hit.
</P>
<P>
   Losing a court battle with Casey Martin for the second time in
two years seemed to leave the PGA Tour with one logical option:
quit while it was behind. Surely, pursuing such a case against a
kid who has lined up one notable ally after another would be a
public relations nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Martin, who suffers from Klippel-Trenaunay-Weber
Syndrome, a circulatory problem in his lower right leg, probably
expected to hear this past week that the PGA Tour's Policy Board
had decided not to argue its case to the Supreme Court. Not quite.
Instead, commissioner Tim Finchem said Wednesday that the Tour was
still between clubs. ``The board has determined to defer a decision
of whether to seek a Supreme Court review,'' said Finchem.
</P>
<P>
   On the surface, it appears to be a case of not knowing when to
quit, but in Finchem's defense, there is reason to wait. One day
after a 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals (San Francisco) upheld
Martin's first victory _ which allowed him to use a golf cart in
PGA events _ a 7th US Circuit Court of Appeals
(Indiana-Illinois-Wisconsin) upheld a lower court's ruling that the
US Golf Association did not have to grant a cart to an Indiana club
pro named Ford Olinger.
</P>
<P>
   Confused? Finchem sure is.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a nutshell, what we have is a situation where we have two
cases of identical facts under the American With Disabilities
Act,'' said Finchem, himself a lawyer, though that didn't stop him
from shaking his head at times. ``The two courts came out on
diametrically opposed sides of the issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for Olinger, whose degenerative hip disorder led him to
request a cart for US Open qualifying, have said they would appeal
_ first in a re-hearing with the 7th Circuit, then to the Supreme
Court. (Finchem said the Tour definitely would not ask for a
re-hearing with the 9th Circuit because ``based on what we've seen
out of the 9th Circuit, we're not excited about asking them for
another opinion.'')
</P>
<P>
   Finchem made a point of saying, ``This case has less and less to
do with Casey Martin,'' a comment that made the Tour rookie
bristle. Martin told reporters that since he's the one who fought
for the right to a cart, the case certainly is still about him.
</P>
<P>
   There is much to admire about Martin, and he deserves to be held
up as a courageous hero, but Finchem has a legitimate concern.
Similar cases were handled entirely differently by two courts,
which leaves the PGA Tour (and any other sports league) still
wondering about the very heart of its argument: Can it set its own
policies and govern its sport?
</P>
<P>
   So while the PGA Tour sits and waits, the USGA has a dilemma. It
voluntarily allowed Martin use of a cart in US Open qualifying the
last two years, but after its court win over Olinger, will it say
no to Martin this time? A spokesman for the USGA said an
announcement would be made in late April.

   Arnold Palmer revealed that he gave serious thought to not
playing in his Bay Hill Invitational, one of two PGA Tour events in
which he still takes part (the other is the Bob Hope Chrysler
Classic). ``There was some question,'' said Palmer, ``simply
because my game, number one, is not good enough, and two, I'm not
playing that well on the Senior Tour.'' Still, friends insisted he
play, and when he gave it more thought, it turned out to be an easy
decision. Palmer is 70, he has been mourning the death of his
beloved wife Winnie the past few months, and at times his struggles
on the course are difficult to watch. After opening with an 82 at
Bay Hill Thursday, Palmer trudged off, looking very much like a guy
who wouldn't be back as a competitor in 2001. But, as always, he
was the definition of class, character, and grace as he walked from
the green to the clubhouse. He signed nearly everything shoved at
him by fans and didn't hesitate to answer reporters' questions . .
. Palmer was paired with Colin Montgomerie for the first two
rounds, a circumstance that pleased him greatly. How, Palmer was
asked, did that come to be? ``Well, I suggested it,'' said Palmer
with a grin. ``I didn't put any pressure on.'' . . . In a
roundabout way, Palmer was asked if he thought Tiger Woods at 35
would be as effective as he is now after another 10 years of trying
to meet all the demands on his time. ``My advice would be to just
keep on working and enjoying it _ once you stop enjoying it, don't
do it,'' said Palmer, who related a story about his series of
matches in the 1960s with Gary Player and Jack Nicklaus, both
younger than he. Player and Nicklaus, said Palmer, both insisted
they wouldn't be playing competitively when they reached 45, but
today, Nicklaus and Player _ 60 and 65, respectively _ are
``playing more golf than they have ever played in their life.'' . .
. Asked if there will be any special significance to this year's
Masters, his 46th, now that he is a member of Augusta National,
Palmer kicked his enthusiasm into an even higher gear. ``I have a
very definite feeling,'' he said. ``I have written a note to the
powers at Augusta and said that since I am now a member, I'd like
to play the members' tees.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Most players will still say they don't like the fact that PGA
Tour winners aren't exempt into the Masters. The decision to give
world rankings more weight was made a year ago, and Finchem was
asked if the Masters folks consulted with his people. ``Consult
might be a strong word,'' said Finchem. ``They invite us to comment
and we do, but they feel very strongly about the field size and
having all their champions being able to play.'' And to those who
criticize tournament officials, Finchem offers this: ``I certainly
wouldn't want to be one to argue that it detracts from the quality
of the impact of the Masters.'' . . . Sergio Garcia confirmed what
was a poorly kept secret: He will play in the inaugural Ballesteros
Cup in England the week after the Masters. Though he originally
committed to play the MCI Heritage Classic, Garcia relented because
``Seve called me.'' The tournament will pit Continental Europe vs.
Great Britain/Ireland in match play. Garcia had threatened to skip
it as a protest against European PGA Tour executive director Ken
Schofield. They are at odds over guidelines for qualifying for this
year's NEC Invitational. Did he consider calling Seve Ballesteros?
``I think if somebody wants me to play in one tournament, I think
the tournament has to call the player,'' said Garcia, who at times
seems years removed from the innocent youngster who captivated the
golf world last summer . . . How times have changed: Next week's
purse for The Players Championship is $6 million. In his career,
Nicklaus is credited with $5.6 million in prize money. Next week's
winner will receive a check for $1,080,000, which is more than half
of Palmer's career prize money.

   When Vijay Singh shot 68 to share the first-round lead at Bay
Hill, it wasn't a shock because his scoring average before the cut
(69.07) ranks 14th on Tour. But if a disturbing trend continues, he
doesn't figure to win the tournament. His third- and fourth-round
scoring averages (70.71, 71.71) rank 86th and 125th, respectively.
Singh opened with a 65 at Doral two weeks ago, but faded to T-36,
and he has but two Top 10s this season . . . Gary Koch, a former
winner at Bay Hill, was forced to withdraw, thus opening up a spot
for Sandy Lyle. But Koch did not go home. He simply put away the
clubs and picked up a microphone, working the tournament for NBC .
. . Mike Nicolette was asked about beating Greg Norman in a playoff
at Bay Hill in 1983, but he stopped the reporter short. ``I ended
up winning, but Greg three-putted,'' said Nicolette. ``Beating is
when you make a birdie. He lost.'' . . . No ego problems for
Nicolette. ``Most people think I'm Corey Pavin,'' he said. ``If
you're not up on your golf trivia, you have no idea who I am.'' . .
. At the recent Massachusetts Golf Association spring conference,
Jeanne-Marie Boylan was introduced as the 20th person from
Massachusetts to be named to the USGA's executive committee. A
Milton native and three-time women's state amateur champion, Boylan
has served on the USGA's women's committee for several years. At
the spring conference, Boylan represented the USGA and presented a
grant of $25,000 to the MGA to help support its golf camps in
Springfield, Cambridge, Lowell, and Chelsea . . . You may be
looking down the road to something else, but for some, the official
2000 amateur season kicks off with the annual Seagulls event at
Hyannisport the first two weekends in April . . . One of the fun
events of the season will take place May 19 at Duxbury Yacht Club:
the Ouimet Eight Club Tournament. Why eight? That is how many
Francis Ouimet carried in 1913 when he stunned the golf world with
his US Open triumph at The Country Club. The event will be a net
best-ball of four and applications are due May 8. For information,
call 781-891-6400 . . . It will be with great sadness that the
golfers of Kernwood CC in Salem tee it up in coming weeks, for
their friend Peter Oppenheim, a 15-time club champion, died last
week at the age of 51. A member of the MGA Executive Committee,
Oppenheim made it into match play of the State Amateur five times
and once qualified for the US Amateur.

WALKER, CELTICS TURN INTO ROAD WARRIORS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ If you've got an incurable case of Bracket Fever, or
are fretting over who's going to close for the Red Sox, you might
want to take a step back and look at what the Celtics are doing.
</P>
<P>
   It's nothing short of amazing given where they were not too long
ago.
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics looked a lot like a lottery lock two weeks ago after
losing 15 of 19. They have, to be precise, turned it around.
Saturday &UR;  &LR; night, playing a very warm Dallas team (consecutive wins
over Phoenix, Indiana, and San Antonio), the Celtics came away with
a stirring 104-99 victory. It was their seventh win in eight games,
their second straight road win, and represented the first time
since Nov. 3 they've managed to win back-to-back games anywhere.
They had previously lost 17 straight on the second night of
back-to-backs.
</P>
<P>
   It was another tour de force for Antoine Walker, who had 29
points (10-of-15 shooting, including 4 treys), 10 rebounds, and 6
assists. It also was another big night by the oft-maligned bench,
which got big games from Eric Williams (18 points), Tony Battie (8
points, 10 rebounds), and Dana Barros (11 points).
</P>
<P>
   With the win, the Celtics closed to within a game of the eighth
playoff spot. One game. They also are six games under .500; they
haven't been that close to the water line since winning in Utah
Feb. 15. They've climbed back into it due to a much-improved
defensive effort, much-improved play from the bench, and the
overall celestial play of Walker.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's such a weapon right now,'' Rick Pitino said of Walker.
``He's playing like one of the premier players in the game, and
we're very excited about it.''
</P>
<P>
   They should be. Walker was coming off a sparkling show in
Atlanta, but that was against the comatose Hawks. This was a
different story. The Mavericks actually play like they care, even
though they're out of the playoff hunt in the talent-loaded West.
Dallas got a routine 28 from Michael Finley, and an unexpected and
career-high 25 from Greg Buckner, who matched his season total with
five treys. Dirk Nowitzki added 21, but missed all five of his
treys, including a critical boinger in the final minute.
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics never trailed after an 11-2 second-quarter run.
Dallas tied the game early in the third and did not go quietly,
even after Walker's layup (off a nice feed from Kenny Anderson)
with 3:38 left made it 98-87. Two minutes later, the Mavericks had
the deficit to 5 and, with less than a minute to play, it was down
to 99-96.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Pierce then stepped into the breach. He had only 15 points
due to limited time (foul trouble) and has mostly been yapping
about his beloved Kansas Jayhawks the last few days. But he hit a
big second-chancer (Anderson snuck in for an offensive rebound
after his own miss) over Erick Strickland with 19.8 seconds left to
make it 101-96. After a Finley trey made it 101-99, Pierce calmly
swished two free throws with 8.3 seconds to play to settle it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It feels good, real good,'' said Williams. ``We know we still
have work to do, but we feel like the team is starting to jell.
We're coming together at the right time. We've just got to keep it
going.''
</P>
<P>
   That would seem to be a difficult task with the next stop Monday
night in Phoenix. But the Celtics feel nothing is out of their
grasp right now. ``We are playing the best basketball we've been
playing all year,'' said Pierce.
</P>
<P>
   Walker has taken over the pack-mule role, carrying the team
during this run. He is averaging almost 28 points a game in the
past five games. But what's making him lethal is his all-around
game. He's also averaging 6 assists, which is the number Pitino
said he'd like to see Walker average this season. He's averaging 8
rebounds and he's shooting 54 percent from the field and 77 percent
from the line.
</P>
<P>
   ``Antoine is keeping everyone involved,'' Pitino said. ``They
know that if they give him the ball, and cut and move, that they'll
get it back.''
</P>
<P>
   Give and take. All for one, one for all. It's all looking so
easy now you wonder why it took as long as it did. But the point is
that it's here, now, and the Celtics think it's going to last.

CLIPPERS START HOT, END COLD

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Despite its $400 million sticker price, the
Clippers have managed to transform Staples Center into the Outhouse
of Pain.
</P>
<P>
   Too bad the blueprint didn't include a few escape windows.
</P>
<P>
   With such structural limitations, only the Clips were able to
bail out during Saturday's 104-83 loss administered by the
Sacramento Kings before 18,964.
</P>
<P>
   What makes this clouting even more painful than normal was a
blown 23-point, second-quarter lead and evidence of Clipper
nastiness when they didn't have the ball. Yeah, their typical
poodle-in-a-junkyard defense had enough first-quarter bite to limit
the Kings to eight points, a franchise record for one quarter by
the home team.
</P>
<P>
   But the event returned to its regularly scheduled planet in the
second quarter, and the Clippers - playing their fourth game in
five days - posted their 53rd defeat in 67 games.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings (38-27) were led by center Vlade ``The Inhaler'' Divac
and Peja Stojakovic who each put up 20 points. Point guard Jason
Williams, who sold most of the tickets, spent the evening in a
relative coma (8 points, 1 assist).
</P>
<P>
   Derek Anderson, the future free agent who now plays as if he
should have a bar code tattooed to his deltoid, had 25 points for
the Clippers. Lamar Odom produced 18 points, 9 rebounds and 6
fouls. Eric Piatkowski contributed a career-high 13 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson outscored the Kings by himself in round one, knocking
in 5 of 8 shots from the field for 10 of the Clippers' 24 points
and two more than the visitors could manage. Odom contributed
7points and 6 rebounds during the period, as the Clips appeared to
be in decent shape despite coughing up 7 turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   Webber found the range in the second quarter, putting up 8
points, while Darrick Martin threw in 6 off the bench, helping he
Kings close to 45-41 by intermission.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson had 16 in the first half, but Odom had 3 fouls to go
with his 9 points. His runner in the lane provided the Clips'
biggest lead, 36-13, at 8:31 in round two. The Clippers had a 40-18
edge when he went to bench as punishment for foul play with 5:41
left in the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The siege continued in the third, with the Kings grabbing a
47-45 lead on a bucket by Vlade Divac at the 10:17 mark. Sacramento
built its biggest third-quarter lead, 68-63, on a drive by Williams
at 1:32 of the third. But Piatkowski's steal and buzzer-beating
3-pointer earned a tie at 68 at the end of three.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings started the final stanza with an 11-1 run to win this
one in a walk.
</P>
<P>
   Notes: The Clippers waived forward Mario Bennett, who was signed
to a 10-day contract March 7. Bennett played in one game and
clocked three minutes. He missed the last two games due to soreness
in his recently repaired left knee. ... Bennett's spot on the
active roster was filled by Keith Closs, whose lower-back woes
pushed him to the injured list. ... Tyrone Nesby returned to the
team Saturday after missing Friday's loss at Denver. Nesby remained
in L.A. to be with his mother who suffered two strokes. ... The
Denver trip was made complete by illness to Odom, who gave an
indication of his availability for the evening by throwing up
during the first quarter. Odom had 10 points and 4 rebounds in 24
minutes vs. the Nuggets.

GALAXY WINS OPENER 2-1

<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA -- For verbally attacking the referee's following the
Galaxy's 2-0 loss to D.C. United in November's MLS Cup -- Galaxy
coach Sigi Schmid was slapped with a $1,000 fine and a suspension
for Saturday's Major League Soccer season opener with Colorado at
the Rose Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   It's a good thing Schmid was far from the field for this one,
because he would have come out of his shoes when a questionable
call resulted in a Colorado penalty kick, erasing a 1-0 second half
lead for Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for Schmid's health, a make-up call minutes later
allowed Greg Vanney to convert a penalty shot in the 75th minute,
giving the Galaxy a 2-1 victory over the Rapids in front of 24,831.
</P>
<P>
   The Rapids, riddled with injuries, played defensive for most of
the night, nearly walked away with a draw. But in the end, the
Galaxy's dominant play was rewarded.
</P>
<P>
   After a scoreless first half, Cobi Jones received an innocent
pass from Mauricio Cienfueogs, and turned it into a 1-0 Galaxy
lead.
</P>
<P>
   Facing the goal just outside the penalty area, Jones took
Cienfuegos' pass, touched the ball two times to his right, then
directed a perfect shot to the right, netting from just inside the
penalty arc in the 59th minute.
</P>
<P>
   Before they could celebrate, however, Colorado answered back on
the first of a series of questionable calls.
</P>
<P>
   First, Paul Bravo appeared offside on a deep cross into the
Galaxy penalty area. Then, Bravo tried to dribble by Galaxy
goalkeeper Kevin Hartman, but the two were tangled. As the ball
rolled away, refereee Ricardo Valenzuela whistled a penalty kick,
calling a tripping penalty on Hartman.
</P>
<P>
   Bravo converted the penalty kick, tying the game 1-1 in the 61st
minute, ending Colorado's MLS record 743 minute scoreless streak
that dated back to last season.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps feeling a little guilty, Valenzuela awarded a penalty
kick to the Galaxy minutes later, whistling Colorado defender
Marcelo Balboa for an innocent-looking tackle to Cienfuegos in the
penalty area. Defender Greg Vanney converted the the shot, giving
the the game-winner in the 75th minute.
</P>
<P>
   Despite constant pressure, the Galaxy couldn't take advantage of
a couple early chances.

GONZAGA RIDES OUT RED STORM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TUCSON _ Whoa. Not a good day for the big seeds in the West, eh?
</P>
<P>
   First, Wisconsin takes out top-seeded Arizona up in Salt Lake
City. About 2 1/2 hours later, the No. 2 seed was also sent home as
the Gonzaga Bulldogs took charge in money time to topple Big East
champion St. John's, 82-76, Saturday &UR;  &LR; night at the McKale Center.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago the then-unknown `Zags came oh-so-close to knocking
off 1999 Big East champ Connecticut in the regional finals. This
time the West Coast Conference titans got the job done behind the
clutch play of senior guard Matt Santangelo, who scored 26 points,
18 of on 3-pointers.
</P>
<P>
   Senior poise and senior ability won this for Gonzaga, which
didn't take its first lead until the 2 1/2-minute mark of the
second half, but assumed command in the final 8 1/2 minutes,
frustrating St. John's with a superb all-around display of
basketball.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzaga broke the final tie (54-54) on a Mark Spink layup with
8:20 left. Santangelo followed with his fourth 3-pointer, and St.
John's never got closer than 3 again.
</P>
<P>
   But long before Santangelo stuck in the final daggers, Gonzaga
had taken control on the inside. St. John's had gone a long way
this year with a front line that topped off at 6 feet 7 inches, but
size finally caught up with them in the second half when 6-9 Casey
Calvary, foul-hampered in the first half, powered in for some easy
baskets that seemed to break the Red Storm's spirit. With the
inside game established, Santangelo was freed up to deposit some of
his signature bombs. So Gonazga, the 10th seed in the West, moves
on to play sixth-seeded Purdue Thursday in Albuquerque. No longer
should anyone, anywhere, doubt the legitimacy of this team.
</P>
<P>
   Purdue advanced by virtue of a 66-62 triumph over Oklahoma. It
was pretty much the same senior story, as the Boilermakers got
superb clutch play from senior guard Jaraan Cornell and senior
forward Brian Cardinal to advance into the Sweet 16 for the third
straight year.
</P>
<P>
   St. John's certainly huffed and puffed, and there were probably
times when the Red Storm players thought they were going to blow
down the Gonzaga house. But that was just not going to happen. St.
John's led by only 3, 36-33, at the half.
</P>
<P>
   St. John's had a wire-to-wire advantage in the first half,
scoring the first 6 points of the game, even as Calvary was busy
picking up two personals in the first 1:39. The Big East champs
would lead twice by 9 (the last at 34-25) and twice by 8, but the
resilient boys from Spokane have been through too much during the
past two seasons to be fazed by anything as piddling as those
deficits.
</P>
<P>
   And you had to suspect that the 'Zags were feeling pretty good
at the half, considering that leading scorer Richie Frahm had laid
a nice 0-0-0 goose egg.
</P>
<P>
   With Frahm silenced, Gonzaga needed a boost from Santangelo, and
the cagey vet delivered with a desperately needed 13 that included
three 3-pointers.

SOURCES SAY FLINT'S JOB SAFE 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Bruiser Flint is expected to remain as head coach at
the University of Massachusetts, two sources close to the
basketball program said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   UMass officials are scheduled to meet with Flint Sunday and his
future at the school ``looks positive,'' one source said. ``It's
more than OK,'' said another.
</P>
<P>
   Flint's status as head coach had been a matter of speculation
since UMass lost to Siena in the first round of the National
Invitation Tournament on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   University chancellor David Scott Saturday praised Flint for
fielding a winning team free of off-court troubles, with players
who graduate. But Scott said the school still has concerns about
financial issues, such as sagging attendance, and added that a
decision regarding Flint will be made ``within a week or so.''
</P>
<P>
   And while that decision could come as early as Sunday, the
program hangs in the balance despite calls from noted alumni such
as Julius Erving and Bill Cosby to endorse Flint's return.
</P>
<P>
   Flint is left with little to say about his future to current
players and prospects. He has talented junior college player Jackie
Rogers on campus for an official recruiting visit, and the player
is said to be waiting to see if Flint will stay on as coach before
he makes his decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told my players not to worry about it,'' said Flint.
``They're kids, and I know they want me to be the coach. They've
expressed that. I don't want them to make any decision in haste, so
I told them I will discuss things when everything is said and
done.''
</P>
<P>
   Flint, who is 71-56 with three postseason appearances in four
years, scoffed at rumors he might be asked to make a staff change,
saying, ``No one has asked me do do that.'' He also denied rumors
he has been offered a buyout, and declined to comment on the
possibility of him being reassigned to another position within the
university.
</P>
<P>
   The coach, who met separately with Scott and athletic director
Bob Marcum on Friday, has a base salary of about $132,000, with
incentives that push it to around $450,000. A buyout would call for
the school to pay him for the rest of this year, plus $175,000 for
each of the two remaining years.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the wait is unnerving, Flint said, ``Of course. It has
to be. I just want to know what's going on. I'm just going about my
job, and I won't stop working.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott said removal of a person from a position at UMass such as
head basketball coach would come only following the recommendation
of a department head, which in this case would be Marcum. As of
Saturday, he had not received any such recommendation.
</P>
<P>
   Marcum scoffed at a report that he had had a verbal
confrontation with professor John Bracey and Ricardo Townes,
assistant vice chancellor for campus activities, with regard to
Flint's future. ``The only thing I can tell you is that they
approached me before the Siena game and asked me why am I not
supporting Coach Flint, and I said, `Yeah, right, I'm not
supporting him. Right,' and I walked away,'' said Marcum. ``Who in
the hell do they think gave him the (contract) extension?''
</P>
<P>
   Judging from the vocal support Flint is receiving, you would
think a decision on his future would be a formality.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think if you look at the overall picture, Coach Flint is
quite commendable,'' said Scott. ``He has taken us to the
postseason in three of his four years. He is 71-56, and that can't
be seen as a bad record. He has done well with players in terms of
graduation. His program has had no trouble with him as coach. And
all of these things are important to us.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the chancellor would not say that those attributes add up to
a vote of confidence. ``There are other issues to consider, such as
attendance at games,'' he said. ``A program's success has to be
judged, to some extent, by participation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a concern to us. It is not the only thing, but it is an
important aspect. Sometimes (a drop in attendance) is the coach's
fault. Sometimes it's the fault of the team. Sometimes the fault is
the dynamics and behaviors of fans. But it is something we have to
be concerned about.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott acknowledged Flint's sensitive timetable _ such as the
fact that he has a recruit on campus who is awaiting word on the
coach's future. ``He needs to know. In yesterday's meeting, he
talked and I listened,'' said the chancellor. ``We talked about the
program's future. I told him we have not come to a decision yet but
a lot of what he had to say was important to our overall
thinking.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott said he is concerned that fans might have reached
unrealistic expectations about the program, believing it must make
the NCAA tournament every year. He also acknowledged that Flint was
handed a huge burden his first season, when UMass was coming off a
Final Four run and was embroiled in controversy after then-star
center Marcus Camby admitted to receiving cash and gifts from a
would-be agent. ``I'm sure other coaches in his profession used
that against him in recruiting,'' said Scott.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, with all that said, the chancellor still pointed to
attendance at the Mullins Center, which averaged 5,836 this season,
down from 8,499 a season ago. ``One has to be realistic,'' said
Scott. ``We're running a big program. We have 29 sports and we have
gender equity concerns. We have to be successful.''
</P>
<P>
   But Scott said the coach's fate is not solely tied to sagging
attendance figures. ``This is not a place where an administration
makes judgments solely on attendance or anything else,'' he said.
``We give people an opportunity to build programs and establish
themselves. I think our record dictates that we don't make
judgments just because of revenue.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about lingering talk that the possible removal of Flint,
who is African-American, might divide the school along racial
lines, Scott said, ``I have a strong commitment to building
diversity on this campus in all areas. I think it is important to
have visible diversity in athletics as well as other areas. It is
important to the university to make those efforts.''
</P>
<P>
   If sources close to the basketball program are correct, it might
not turn out to be an issue.

ONE WRITER'S CHOICE FOR HALL OF FAME ELECTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON INDRISANO  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The Hall of Fame ballot has arrived. The announcement
of the inductees will be made during Kentucky Derby week, and
enshrinement will take place at the National Museum of Racing at
Saratoga, N.Y., in August.
</P>
<P>
   To be eligible, a jockey must have ridden for 15 years; a
trainer must have conditioned thoroughbreds for 25 years; a
contemporary horse must have been retired for five years; and a
horse of yesteryear must have been retired for 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   Here is a look at the nominees, and how one turf writer voted:
</P>
<P>
   JOCKEY &QC;
</P>
<P>
   The nominees: Earlie Fires, Julie Krone, Jack Westrope.
</P>
<P>
   The vote: 1. Fires; 2. Krone; 3. Westrope.
</P>
<P>
   Krone, the most accomplished of female jockeys, will be the
fashionable pick, but this voter thinks Fires is a superior rider.
There is no bias here against Krone. When she was good, she was
very, very good. Krone retired in 1999, her skills greatly
diminished by injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Fires is still going at age 53. He was the nation's leading
apprentice in 1965, and has won more than 6,000 races. Because he
has been based in the Midwest, he has never gotten the recognition
he deserves. No one is better on a front-runner.
</P>
<P>
   If Krone, who won 3,545 races, doesn't get elected this year,
she will soon. She won more races and earned more money in purses
($81.8 million) than any other female rider, and she is the only
woman to win a Triple Crown event, capturing the Belmont on
Colonial Affair in 1993. Even though favored Prairie Bayou broke
down in that race while making a big move, Krone still deserves
credit for putting on a rousing come-from-behind ride. Krone had
courage, and she would go through a small hole. That sense of
bravado led to many spills, which shortened her career.
</P>
<P>
   Those who dislike Krone feel she received favorable treatment
from stewards, and, more importantly, garnered more publicity than
she deserved. At the height of her game, she may have had trouble
fitting in with the top 10 male jockeys, some of whom barely got
mentioned. This writer has voted for Fires before, against tougher
competition. This writer would also vote for Krone in the right
spot.
</P>
<P>
   Westrope was the leading jockey in the country in 1933. He was
killed when his mount threw him into the rail during the running of
the Hollywood Oaks in 1958. He may have been a better rider than
both Fires and Krone, but how many are left to know?
</P>
<P>
   TRAINER &QC;
</P>
<P>
   The nominees: Neil Drysdale, Richard Mandella, Willard Proctor.
</P>
<P>
   The vote: 1. Mandella; 2. Drysdale; 3. Proctor.
</P>
<P>
   Mandella has been terrific over the last two decades, in a class
with D. Wayne Lukas, Bill Mott, and relative newcomer Bob Baffert.
His starters have earned more than $75.5 million, and he has
saddled 100 stake winners. He has trained the likes of Kotashaan
(1993 Horse of the Year), Gentlemen, Wild Rush, Siphon, Sandpit,
Best Pal, Phone Trick, and Afternoon Deelites. He also conditioned
Dare And Go, who ended Cigar's record-tying 16-race winning streak
when they met in the 1996 Pacific Classic. If you've watched him
work, you know how good he is.
</P>
<P>
   Drysdale, who trained 1992 Horse of the Year A.P. Indy, will
certainly be elected soon, if not this year. He has won five
Breeders' Cup races, and could be a very big deal this year, as he
has several talented 3-year-old colts, including War Chant.
</P>
<P>
   Proctor, who died in 1988, trained for more than 40 years. He
was a jockey in the 1930s. Again, who knows? Maybe the Hall of Fame
needs an old-timers committee, as Major League Baseball has.
</P>
<P>
   CONTEMPORARY MALE HORSE &QC;
</P>
<P>
   The nominees: A.P. Indy, Precisionist, Unbridled.
</P>
<P>
   The vote: 1. A.P. Indy; 2. Unbridled; 3. Precisionist.
</P>
<P>
   A.P. Indy was hampered by injury, but he was a great racehorse.
He ran only 11 times, winning eight and earning nearly $3 million.
He won the Santa Anita Derby in 1992 but was scratched the morning
of the Kentucky Derby because of a foot problem. Missing the Run
for the Roses cost him in the fame game. The son of Seattle Slew
came back to win the Belmont Stakes, and, at age 4, he won the
Breeders' Cup Classic and earned the Golden Eclipse. Simply put, he
was a monster.
</P>
<P>
   Unbridled was brilliant when he was in the mood. He took the
Kentucky Derby and the Breeders' Cup Classic in 1990. However, he
had a lot of off days and won only 8 of 24 races. He is worthy of
election but is no match for A.P. Indy.
</P>
<P>
   The versatile Precisionist was competitive from 6 furlongs to 1
1/4 miles. He was very good, but not as good as the other two
nominees.
</P>
<P>
   CONTEMPORARY &QC; 
FEMALE HORSE &QC;
</P>
<P>
   The nominees: Flawlessly, Mom's Command, Winning Colors.
</P>
<P>
   The vote: 1. Winning Colors; 2. Mom's Command; 3. Flawlessly.
</P>
<P>
   Winning Colors is one of just three fillies to win the Kentucky
Derby, scoring in 1988 to join Regret and Genuine Risk. That alone
puts her in the Hall. Forty Niner may have won that Rose Run with a
better ride from Pat Day, but Winning Colors lasted at the wire.
The same season, Winning Colors staged a memorable duel with the
undefeated Personal Ensign, arguably the greatest filly of all time
(hello, Ruffian), losing the Breeders' Cup Distaff when Personal
Ensign caught her in the last stride. Winning Colors won just 8 of
19 starts, but she won the one that counts _ a rarity for a female.
</P>
<P>
   This voter requested that Mom's Command, owned by local
sportsman Peter Fuller and winner of the 1985 Triple Tiara, be
nominated after an absence of a couple of years, but I can't vote
against a Kentucky Derby victor. Hopefully, Mom's Command will get
another chance.
</P>
<P>
   Flawlessly was a tremendous turf mare, but no match for the top
two.
</P>
<P>
   HORSE OF YESTERYEAR &QC;
</P>
<P>
   The nominees: Bowl Of Flowers, Cougar II, Needles.
</P>
<P>
   The vote: 1. Needles; 2. Cougar II; 3. Bowl of Flowers.
</P>
<P>
   Needles took the 1956 Kentucky Derby, was second in the
Preakness (to Fabius), and won the Belmont. Cougar II was a grass
horse, and Bowl of Flowers was a filly.

FATHER-IN-LAW CLEARED POLI FOR TAKEOFF 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ Bill Parcells was asking the hard questions,
the way a father-in-law can. He was asking about the new job and
where the man who'd just married his daughter thought he was going
with it. He was asking tough questions, which is something Parcells
is better at than most people in the NFL which is why he wins more
often than most people in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   Now came the moment Scott Pioli had to come up with the answers.
Only problem was, this was also his boss asking tough questions
about a new job in a new city, a job working for a guy Parcells had
come to despise and for a team Pioli's present employer had come to
view the way the Red Sox view the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   As Parcells waited, the young New York Jets' director of pro
scouting thought about his friend Bill Belichick up in Foxborough,
who had rejected the Jets' plan for him to replace Parcells as head
coach and taken a job with the Patriots, an act that led to warfare
between the teams before a deal was made that cost New England its
No. 1 draft choice.
</P>
<P>
   Belichick then asked Pioli, whose work he'd grown to admire, to
come with him as assistant director of personnel, a promotion by
any standards. He was asking Pioli, for all intents and purposes,
to come help him beat the Jets twice a year. But the Jets had
initially denied Belichick permission to talk with Pioli for that
reason _ and probably a few less noble ones.
</P>
<P>
   It was a tit-for-tat spat that the Jets probably knew they
couldn't win, but Pioli didn't want it to go that way. Instead, he
sat with his father-in-law and discussed the situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``He asked me some difficult but very fair questions,'' Pioli
explained recently about last month's dilemma. ``He asked me
questions that made me think. He wanted me to think through what I
was doing and he had a responsibility to the Jets which I
understood. I was under contract.''
</P>
<P>
   After the discussion, Parcells was satisfied, and within 24
hours, Pioli was a Patriot _ and a mortal enemy of the Jets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know some people thought this was all about the Jets vs. the
Patriots and Bill's situation up here but I don't know enough about
that rivalry,'' said Pioli. ``Unlike Bill, I hadn't been with the
Patriots before. I didn't have enough background with the personal
things to understand anything about that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the anxiety was my own internal anxiety. Bill did not
make it personally difficult for me. He didn't make it too
difficult a situation. I wanted to do what I felt was best for me
and my wife without disrespecting family. I wasn't going to
disrespect Bill.''
</P>
<P>
   Initially, Pioli wasn't aware permission had been denied for
Belichick to speak with him but he found out because Parcells told
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I accepted that as his right,'' Pioli said. ``Business is
business. I was under contract with the Jets, just as I was in
Baltimore when I went to the Jets. But this was not a lateral move.
A lateral move is not the way I think you conduct your business
when you're under contract. That would have been disrespectful to
Bill and to the Jets and I wouldn't do that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to be fair to the Jets but they knew I had an
opportunity out there with New England. This was a decision more
about opportunity and responsibilities, not personal relationships.
Once I made the decision, I knew it was the right thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Pioli knew it was the right decision because he knew Belichick,
who had befriended him years ago while he was an All-New England
defensive tackle at Central Connecticut and Belichick was a rising
face on Parcells's New York Giants coaching staff.
</P>
<P>
   Pioli would visit the Giants' training camp and later would help
Belichick when the coach went to scout college players at Syracuse,
where Pioli was a graduate assistant. A relationship and a respect
grew, and when Pioli decided to leave a coaching job at Murray
State in 1992 to take a scouting position with the 49ers, he got a
call that led him to make a decision few sane men back then would
have.
</P>
<P>
   Pioli chose to move to Cleveland when he could have lived in San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill heard I was pursuing a job in personnel with the 49ers
and he called me from Cleveland (where Belichick was the Browns'
head coach) and asked why I hadn't called him,'' Pioli recalled.
``I had committed to an interview in San Francisco but then I flew
directly to Cleveland. When I got there, there was a message
offering me a job with the 49ers and Bill said, `You've got a job
here, too.'
</P>
<P>
   ``There were greater responsibilities in Cleveland, even though
it was an entry-level position. It was just prior to the free agent
explosion, and as pro scouting became a bigger thing, I was there
to learn and get involved with the salary cap and contracts plus
scouting players.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were things I loved about coaching, but I think I'm
better in player evaluation than coaching the X's and O's. I loved
what I was doing immediately.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Browns moved to Baltimore after the 1995 season, Pioli
went with them, even as Belichick was fired. The front office had
been gutted as well as the coaching staff, and because of that,
Pioli's responsibilities grew. As his expertise increased, his
relationship with Belichick remained close, so close that when
Belichick became the Jets' head coach, he asked the Ravens for
permission to talk to Pioli.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, the first time Bill became head coach of the Jets he
called,'' Pioli said with a laugh, referring to the few days
Belichick was the boss before Parcells ironed out a deal with
Patriots owner Bob Kraft that allowed him to jump his contract and
go to New York following New England's 1996 Super Bowl season.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually Pioli ended up in New York, where he met Dallas
Parcells. The two fell in love and got married less than a year
ago, and now Pioli has followed his mentor and friend to New
England, where his job will be simple: Find Belichick the players
he needs to beat the Jets, something the Patriots haven't been too
adept at since Parcells left New England.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the reasons this job was attractive is I know Bill and
understand his philosophy,'' Pioli said. ``I understand the kind of
players he needs for his system and that makes it easier to be
successful. Personnel people need to understand the coach's
philosophy because once you do you have a greater chance of
success.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill is one of the hardest-working and most meticulous people
I've ever been around. And one of the most loyal. We work well
together.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, they are doing it with Bill Parcells's blessing,
too.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This is a slow time of year around the NFL, but one bit of local
news emerged last week when Needham native Mike Tannenbaum was
promoted by the Jets from salary cap guru to director of pro player
development. Although his name is not well known to the public, he
is one of the sharpest young contract men in the business and a
good part of the reason the Jets have been able to avoid the
crippling cap problems predicted for them since the day Parcells
signed Curtis Martin as a free agent . . . A sad story came to an
end Thursday when 49ers offensive line coach Bobb McKittrick died
after a long battle with cancer. The 64-year-old McKittrick was
brave and upbeat to the end, a fighter from his days in the Marines
to his final days in the NFL. He was the architect of one of the
ablest offensive lines of the 1980s and '90s and had much more to
do with the 49ers' long run of offensive success than he was ever
given credit for. The way he handled his repeated battles with
cancer and his steadfast insistence on coaching to the end was an
example of what courage and grit are all about. He will be missed
by the 49ers and by everyone who ever had the pleasure to sit down
with him for a few hours and listen to how football was supposed to
be played or a life was supposed to be led . . . Free agent Tedy
Bruschi is a good guy wandering in a wilderness he doesn't seem to
quite fathom. Bruschi was close to signing a reported two-year, $3
million deal with the Patriots that included a $1 million signing
bonus. That is a far cry from his starting point of seeking a four-
to five-year deal averaging $2.5 million a season and including a
$3 million bonus. Those were numbers he was never likely to
receive, but what is worse is that he left on the table a five-year
offer worth $9 million that included a $1.5 million bonus in Green
Bay. That averages out to $1.8 million a season, which means if he
ends up in New England under the present parameters, he will have
cost himself $600,000 over the next two years. More importantly,
Bruschi seems to think the market will increase as time passes, but
history indicates that it decreases after the initial burst of
activity. His hope remains Cleveland, because it has the cap room
to do what it wants, but the fact is if it wanted to do something
big with Bruschi, it would have been done already. So, if he's
smart, he'll grab what he can today.

SYDNEY ORGANIZERS RUNNING IN THE RED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN POWERS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Though the Lords of the Rings gave them an enthusiastic
thumbs-up during a recent visit Down Under, the Sydney organizers
are facing a hefty budget deficit with the Summer Games only six
months off.
</P>
<P>
   After wildly overestimating both ticket and sponsorship income,
the organizing committee, SOCOG, is nearly $125 million in the red
after promising a profit.
</P>
<P>
   ``There won't be a profit,'' beleaguered committee president
Michael Knight finally conceded.
</P>
<P>
   To keep things from getting even worse, the government has taken
over budgeting for every competitive venue.
</P>
<P>
   The good news is that all of the facilities are ready to go. And
International Olympic Committee president Juan Antonio Samaranch,
as always, is predicting that the Games will be ``the best ever.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   New US Olympic Committee chief executive Norman Blake didn't
waste any time flexing his muscles. Less than a month after taking
over from former executive director Dick Schultz, Blake also nudged
Schultz out of his transitional job as head of OPUS, the joint
marketing arm of the USOC and the Salt Lake organizers. The idea is
to have Blake use his own corporate contacts to rustle up more
sponsors . . . Still on the hook is IOC vice president Kevan
Gosper, who is being investigated by the committee's new ethics
commission after bid documents showed he and his family took a ski
trip to Utah before Salt Lake won the 2002 Games. Gosper, who
insists he reimbursed the bidders, has stepped down from the ethics
panel, which has turned over the case to a yet-unnamed
``independent expert of high reputation.'' . . . Disappointing
reentry by skater Todd Eldredge, who ended up fourth at the Four
Continents championship after winning the short program. Eldredge
not only missed his quadruple jump, he also scaled back three other
jumps. Eldredge knows he'll have to have the quad down solid by
next season to have any hope of making the US team. All three men
who beat him at Four Continents (Canada's Elvis Stojko and China's
Li Chengjiang and Zhang Min) landed the quad . . . Another free
pass to the world skating championships for alternate Angela
Nikodinov. Last year, she went to Helsinki because US runner-up
Naomi Nari Nam was too young to compete. This time, she goes to the
Riviera because runnerup Sasha Cohen failed to win a medal at the
world juniors . . . Newest members of the US Figure Skating Hall of
Fame are Debi Thomas (former world champion and 1988 Olympic
medalist), Scott Allen (youngest US men's champ at 14 in 1964),
six-time US women's titlist Gretchen Merrill of the Skating Club of
Boston, and Frank Zamboni, who invented the ice-cleaning machine.
Named to the world Hall is Ron Ludington, who won five US titles as
pairs coach and the 1960 Olympic bronze as a competitor . . .
Terrific showing by Brookline's Dan Weinstein, who skipped classes
at Harvard long enough to place fourth at the recent world
short-track speedskating championships in England. Weinstein, who
had a rock-bottom seeding after missing virtually all of the World
Cup season, also won three medals in individual races and set an
American record in the 500 meters. Top US woman (in 11th) was Amy
Peterson. The US men finished fifth in the earlier team
championships in the Netherlands, where the women (with Natick's
Caroline Hallisey and Arlington's Sarah Lang) were seventh.

   Silver lining for US long-track speedskater Christine Witty, who
finished second overall (and won both 1,000-meter races) at the
recent world sprint championships after struggling during the early
season because of overtraining. And a predictable finish for
rookies Nick Pearson (16th) and Joey Cheek (18th), who made the US
men's team after Casey FitzRandolph was injured and Kip Carpenter
missed his trials race with a broken skate. As expected, Canada's
Jeremy Wotherspoon and Germany's Monique Garbrecht retained their
crowns. Witty followed with a bronze in the 1,000 (the only US
medal) at the world single-distance championships . . . Not that it
was a surprise, but Austrians _ Hermann Maier and Renate Goetschl _
swept the World Cup overall skiing titles for the first time since
Karl Schranz and Gertrud Gabl did it in 1969. The Herminator also
became the first to crack the magic 2,000-point mark. ``My first
year I would have been happy with 400 points,'' mused the
27-year-old Maier. ``Now I have five times that. It's incredible.''
. . . Maybe the Americans should dig up Lillehammer's Olympic
downhill course and haul it around the World Cup circuit with them.
Daron Rahlves, who'd never won a Cup race, grabbed back-to-back
downhills this month on the same Kvitfjell run where Tommy Moe won
the 1994 gold medal and where Kyle Rasmussen recorded the last Cup
win by a US male five years ago. Meanwhile, slalom ace Kristina
Koznick came alive down the stretch, with a silver at Are and a
gold at Sestriere . . . Encouraging showing by the US skeleton
sledders at the world championships in Austria. Jim Shea and Tricia
Stumpf both won bronzes in the belly-flop sport, which will be a
medal event in Salt Lake City . . . Not that US biathlon has become
a one-man team, but all $78,500 of the USOC's Podium 2002 grant is
going to Jay Hakkinen, the best prospect since Josh Thompson in
1988. Hakkinen had a promising showing at the recent world
championships in Oslo, with three top 35 placements . . . Best
recycling project of the new century is the start and finish
platforms at Lake Placid's new combined bobsled/luge run, which the
US Plastic Lumber folks made from a million recycled milk jugs
reinforced with fiberglass.

   Last chance for the US women's field hockey team to make it to
Sydney comes at this week's final qualifier in England, where the
Americans must place in the top five in the 10-team field. To make
matters worse, they're in a tough preliminary pool with Germany
(World Cup bronze medalist), Spain (1992 Olympic champion),
Ireland, and India. The US, which was 1-2-2 against the Irish in a
recent tuneup series in California, can't be any lower than third
in its pool to advance. On the squad are seven returning Olympians
plus local players Tara Jelley of Greenfield and Kristen Holmes of
Raynham . . . Though gold medalists Shannon Miller and Dominique
Moceanu weren't invited to Bela Karolyi's latest gymnastics boot
camp last week, they could still petition their way to July's
national championships in St. Louis based on their resumes. ``I'm
positive they would get the green light,'' says Karolyi. ``But they
better come and perform. They will not make the Olympic team if
they are not proving it on the floor.'' . . . No surprises on the
US synchronized swimming team for Sydney. Tammy Cleland-McGregor
and Heather Olson are gold-medal veterans from 1996, and newly
naturalized Anna Kozlova competed for the Unified Team (i.e. Soviet
Union) in 1992. The remaining members _ Carrie Barton, Bridget
Finn, Kristina Lum, Elicia Marshall, Tuesday Middaugh, and Kim
Wurzel _ have been with the team since Atlanta . . . Gold medals
will be the least of what the Belarussian athletes will be
competing for Down Under. ``Just produce the result and you'll have
an apartment and dozens of thousands of dollars and you'll provide
for yourself for the rest of your life,'' promises president
Alexander Lukashenko. ``I'll buy you anything you need, be it guns,
boats, swimming trunks, even undershorts. But God forbid if I hear
any complaint or question on the eve of your departure for
Sydney.''

GALAXY WINS OPENER 2-1
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED J. ROBLEDO  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA _ For verbally attacking the referee's following the
Galaxy's 2-0 loss to D.C. United in November's MLS Cup, Galaxy
coach Sigi Schmid was slapped with a $1,000 fine and a suspension
for Saturday's Major League Soccer season opener with Colorado at
the Rose Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   It's a good thing Schmid was far from the field for this one,
because he would have come out of his shoes when a questionable
call resulted in a Colorado penalty kick, erasing a 1-0 second half
lead for Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for Schmid's health, a make-up call minutes later
allowed Greg Vanney to convert a penalty shot in the 74th minute,
giving the Galaxy a 2-1 victory over the Rapids in front of 24,831.
</P>
<P>
   The Rapids, riddled with injuries, played defensive for most of
the night, nearly walking away with a draw. But in the end, the
Galaxy's dominant play was rewarded.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew that we were going to give up possession because we
had a lot of inexperienced players on the field,'' said Colorado
coach Glenn Myernick. ``What do you do as a coach? You back up,
give them possession in areas of the field that don't count and see
if you can counter-attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``We almost pulled this one out, but I still thought we came in
here and battled very well.''
</P>
<P>
   Schmid, talking afterward, was disappointed the Galaxy couldn't
convert a few more chances, but he was satisfied with the overall
performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Based on the run of play, it was a deserved win for us,'' said
Schmid. ``The game was pretty much the way I thought it would be. I
felt they would play fairly conservative and sit in the back. If we
finished some of our chances in the first half it would have opened
up the game and been a lot worse.
</P>
<P>
   ``Still, it was a first game and first games you always have
nerves,'' he continued. ``I still think we could be quicker, take
people on sooner and be more dynamic in what we do.''
</P>
<P>
   After Cobi Jones gave the Galaxy a 1-0 lead in the 60th minute,
the series of questionable calls followed.
</P>
<P>
   First, Paul Bravo appeared offside on a deep pass into the
Galaxy penalty area. Then, Bravo tried to dribble by Galaxy
goalkeeper Kevin Hartman, but the two were tangled. As the ball
rolled away, referee Ricardo Valenzuela whistled a penalty kick,
calling a tripping penalty on Hartman.
</P>
<P>
   Bravo converted the penalty kick, tying the game 1-1 in the 64th
minute, ending Colorado's MLS record 743 minute scoreless streak
that dated back to last season.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps feeling a little guilty, Valenzuela awarded a penalty
kick to the Galaxy minutes later, whistling Colorado defender
Marcelo Balboa for an innocent-looking tackle to Cienfuegos in the
penalty area. Vanney converted the the shot, giving the the
game-winner.
</P>
<P>
   For a change, Schmid, Myernick and Galaxy assistant coach Ralph
Perez were unanimous that the referees had a lot to do with the
outcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll take this (question) because I want to see Sigi at our
next game,'' said Perez, when asked about the referee's decisions
on both ends.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're at the worst seat in the house, but after watching the
replay, it appeared that he (Bravo) was offside and if you talk to
our guys, I'm sure they will tell you they didn't think we took him
(Bravo) down,'' said Perez. ``That's soccer, I'm sure if you talk
to Myernick, he'll tell you he didn't think there was a penalty the
other way. But that's soccer and you have to live with these
decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite constant pressure, the Galaxy couldn't take advantage of
a couple early chances and one late in the opening half.
</P>
<P>
   Jones freed himself from two Colorado defenders along the right
side, but his cross drifted back toward the penalty spot. Clint
Mathis back-pedaled, getting just enough of his head to send a
looping shot toward the Colorado net, but it bounced off the
crossbar in the seventh minute.
</P>
<P>
   A few minutes later, Cienfuegos picked up a loose ball in the
penalty area and split two Rapids defenders, but his shot
ricocheted off the near post.
</P>
<P>
   Jones and Mathis combined later to give the Galaxy another good
chance minutes before the half.
</P>
<P>
   From 40 yards out, Jones sent a cross to the middle of the
penalty area for Mathis. Running away from the goal, Mathis snapped
a back-header to the far post, but Rapids goalkeeper Adin Brown
lunged to his left to tuck it in.

WILLIAMS' METHODS MIGHT EVEN MAKE ORANGE BLOOD CURDLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GIL LeBRETON 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you're an Orangeblood, yes, Ricky Williams is one of your
own, and that is worth something.
</P>
<P>
   But all Heisman Trophies aside, has this guy gone nuts, or what?
</P>
<P>
   The Rastafarian-locked one was on the wrong side of the news
again last week, this time slamming New Orleans _ the city, the
team, the secretaries (''They'll rat on you''), even the new head
coach, whom he's met exactly once.
</P>
<P>
   The first temptation is to write this off as yet another episode
of indiscretion by a still-very-immature California kid, who was
possibly taken advantage of by a slick magazine writer (John Ed
Bradley) who gave him that
hey-I-was-a-player-and-I-know-where-you're-coming-from line.
</P>
<P>
   But it's time that people quit making excuses for Ricky
Williams, the one-time pride of the Texas Longhorns. He is 22 years
old, and there are high school kids who show more poise, more
social sophistication and more simple common sense than Williams
seems to have.
</P>
<P>
   In the current issue of ``Sports Illustrated'', he told Bradley,
``I'd fire everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They should move the team to San Antonio. Change the name. I'd
live in Austin. I'd rather live in Austin than San Antonio. New
Orleans is a great place to hang out, but it's not a great place to
live and to work. ... When I was hanging out there, I had the best
time of my life. But when I had to go to work there, I hated it.''
</P>
<P>
   He didn't elaborate. Bradley, a former college lineman,
described Williams' suburban New Orleans home as something of an
upscale pig sty. Food on the floor. Dirty clothes piled everywhere.
Except for a weekly visit to Hooter's, Williams seldom ventured
anywhere, preferring to stay home and wait for friends from Austin
to visit him.
</P>
<P>
   His rookie NFL season was, by most standards, a failure. He
seemed to stay injured _ an elbow, an ankle, a toe. After a senior
season at Texas in which he scored 28 touchdowns, Williams in a
Saints uniform scored only two. He gained 884 yards.
</P>
<P>
   The seven-year, $68 million contract that he signed was so laden
with clauses based upon performance, Williams reportedly earned
just $225,000 in salary last season. He reached only one of the
ill-conceived contract's 25 incentives.
</P>
<P>
   On draft day then-coach Mike Ditka had raised brows _ and fans'
expectations _ by trading all of the Saints' draft picks (plus
first and third-round picks this year) for the rights to select
Williams. As a sign of their new bond, the two appeared in wedding
garb _ Ricky wearing the bridal dress _ on the cover of a national
magazine.
</P>
<P>
   But by the end of the 3-13 season, even Ditka was no longer
blindly defending his ``bride.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams said that because the Saints have never had a star
player, no one there knew how to treat him.
</P>
<P>
   Not likely. How much book learning do you need to know how to
treat a lazy, overrated dog?
</P>
<P>
   No stars? Earl Campbell and Archie Manning were once Saints, as
were Hall of Famers Doug Atkins and Jim Taylor. A ridiculous
argument.
</P>
<P>
   But then, the entire NFL career of Ricky Williams has been
pretty much ridiculous, from the big trade, to the wedding gown, to
refusing to do interviews unless he had his helmet and face shield
on, to curling up in the fetal position in his locker after the
game in Baltimore, to these latest bizarre comments.
</P>
<P>
   The irony is that in college, while the Texas PR machine was
cranking out tall tales about Ricky commemorating his heroes and
helping old ladies cross streets, the dispatches all made reference
to what a ``genuine'' person he was.
</P>
<P>
   He was so genuine that he spurned advice and enlisted rapper
Master P to negotiate his NFL contract, a deal that Williams now
thinks the Saints should tear up and ``correct.'' And he was so
genuine that upon meeting the Saints' new coach, Jim Haslett, for
the first time last month, he was offended because Haslett had the
nerve to ask Mr. Heisman if he had been working out.
</P>
<P>
   He hasn't, by the way.
</P>
<P>
   On the Ricky Williams Web site _ ``my official Web site,'' it
says _ visitors were invited to weigh in on the ``Sports
Illustrated'' article. And they did, dozens worth, with comments
such as ``quit whining, you crybaby,'' ``shut up and put up,'' and
``I hope you get drilled.''
</P>
<P>
   Haslett conceivably could trade him, if he thought he could get
equal value and somehow escape the $8 million salary-cap charge
that it would cost the Saints. But it isn't likely.
</P>
<P>
   Ricky Williams and the Saints are forever wedded, in more ways
than one. He hardly acts old enough to even know it. nn

VISORS SUCH A PAIN, BUT SO IS LOSING AN EYE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JENNIFER FLOYD 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Next time,'' Stars winger Brenden Morrow always says when his
mom, Lucille, pleads with him to wear a half-shield protective
visor while playing.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's worried something is going to happen to me. ... I've had
a couple of close ones, a skate right by the eye, a puck in the
eye, too,'' Morrow admits. ``Each time I said next time I get
stitches I'll put one on.''
</P>
<P>
   Only ``next time'' comes and he never does.
</P>
<P>
   And as Toronto defenseman Bryan Berard, 23, learned, sometimes
``next time'' is too late.
</P>
<P>
   Berard was injured eight days ago when Ottawa's Marian Hossa
followed through on a slap shot and caught him on the eye with the
stick. Optimism remains because Berard can distinguish light from
dark, but doctors say chances that he'll regain sight in the eye
are slim.
</P>
<P>
   Without sight in the eye, his chances of continuing his hockey
career are also slim.
</P>
<P>
   Tragic. Horrible. Terrible. Scary.
</P>
<P>
   You name it. NHL players have said it about Berard's injury.
</P>
<P>
   But while Berard's injury had everyone in the NHL talking about
wearing visors, the reality is it hasn't convinced anybody to wear
one.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like them,'' Stars winger Brett Hull said.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't like them until he had his nose flattened by an errant
stick earlier in the season, forcing him to wear one for his safety
when he returned. Then, he really didn't like them. The full cage
shield he had to wear because doctors wouldn't let him return
without it was gone after two games.
</P>
<P>
   He isn't alone either.
</P>
<P>
   Stars defenseman Darryl Sydor had to wear one earlier in the
year to protect an eye injury. But as soon as he was allowed to
take it off, he did. The list goes on and on ...
</P>
<P>
   Yes, close calls have a way of making players think about
wearing a visor.
</P>
<P>
   But, the reality is that they rarely do.
</P>
<P>
   OK, sometimes they do. A close call prompted Stars center Guy
Carbonneau to wear one for almost eight years. He had been skating
in practice in Montreal when he was hit with a stick in the eye. It
scratched his cornea. When he returned a week later, it was with a
visor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd play a game and I'd look at the visor afterwards and there
were always black marks,'' Carbonneau remembers. ``And I'd say
`Wow, that could be my eye.'''
</P>
<P>
   But you're probably saying to yourself, I've seen Guy Carbonneau
play. He doesn't wear a visor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got tired of it,'' Carbonneau explained.
</P>
<P>
   He stopped wearing it right before coming to Dallas. His reasons
are like the ones you hear from most of the players. Visors are hot
and sweaty. They increase the amount of stick work in the league.
You can't see the puck at your feet.
</P>
<P>
   The reasoning sounds as if it makes a lot of sense until you
consider that Bryan Berard might not be able to see at all.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, when you think about it that way, Lucille Morrow makes a
lot more sense.
</P>
<P>
   Next time, after all, may be too late.
</P>
<P>
   SPOTLIGHT ON: TONY AMONTE
</P>
<P>
   Blackhawks winger Tony Amonte has 75 points this season (38
goals and 37 assists), which ranks him fifth in the NHL behind only
players like Pittsburgh's Jaromir Jagr and Florida's Pavel Bure.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, he says he considers this season a complete failure.
</P>
<P>
   Why?
</P>
<P>
   Well, the fact that his Blackhawks have 66 points in the
standings, which ranks them fifth-worst in the NHL, ahead only of
teams like Atlanta and the New York Islanders, goes a long way to
explaining his thinking.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are on a losing club, nobody is really successful, and
that's the bottom line,'' Amonte said. ``When you are losing,
numbers don't matter except for maybe, `Could I do more to help the
team win?`''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, bad teams are especially hard to stomach for good
players.
</P>
<P>
   Who would've blamed Amonte if he had been asked to be traded to
a contender before last week's deadline? The Hawks were, after all,
having a fire sale, with players like Sylvain Cote and Doug Gilmour
getting out of town just in time.
</P>
<P>
   There were rumors about Amonte, too.
</P>
<P>
   But he said he wanted to stay, wants to stay and help return the
Blackhawks to contenders.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know they want to win,'' Amonte said. ``I know (owner) Mr.
(Bill) Wirtz wants to have a winning club and put a winning team on
the ice.''
</P>
<P>
   Winning is one thing. Winning a Stanley Cup is quite another.
</P>
<P>
   Amonte, 29, wants to win a Stanley Cup. He never has. He says
plenty of time remains.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still am young and I think I'll have a couple of more
chances in my career,'' Amonte said.
</P>
<P>
   Amonte also realizes while the Blackhawks have won a couple of
games lately, including some impressive victories against
contenders, that doesn't mean they are ``that'' close.
</P>
<P>
   And if they were, they might be even tougher to swallow.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would mean we should've been doing it all year,'' Amonte
said. ``We should've, too. The group of guys we have isn't too
different from the group of guys we started with.''
</P>
<P>
   ROAD TO THE STANLEY CUP
</P>
<P>
   The start of the Stanley Cup playoffs is 31/2 weeks away, and
here's a look at who's who and what's what on the path there: WHO'S
HOT
</P>
<P>
   DETROIT: They are 7-2-2 in their last 11 games. The Wings are
heating up at just the right time.
</P>
<P>
   COLORADO'S JOE SAKIC: He has 11 goals and seven assists in the
past nine games. Colorado needs him firing on all cylinders if
they're going to advance far in the playoffs. WHO'S NOT
</P>
<P>
   NEW JERSEY: They're 4-5-1 in their past 10 games. What does it
say about the East's chances for a Cup when its best hope is the
struggling Devils?
</P>
<P>
   RANGERS' THEO FLEURY: He has 15 goals this season. Didn't the
Rangers sign him to get them to the playoffs?
CUP FRONT-RUNNER
</P>
<P>
   DETROIT: Yes, Chris Osgood still is in goal, but the rest of the
team is looking pretty good.
CUP DARK HORSE
</P>
<P>
   THE STARS: Don't count out a chance for a repeat just yet. The
Stars have shown amazing resiliency this season.
THE TOP 3 LIST Here's the top three explanations for why the
Buffalo Sabres have gone from Cup finalists to likely missing the
playoffs:
</P>
<P>
   3. The signs were there, but they didn't shake it up until it
was too late.
</P>
<P>
   2. Mr. All-Everything, Michael Peca, has only 17 goals and 19
assists.
</P>
<P>
   1. No Dominik Hasek. Repeat. No best goalie in the NHL for most
of this season. nn

ANOTHER PETTY READY FOR WINSTON CUP DEBUT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHN STURBIN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Teen-ager Adam Petty said patience is a
virtue that doesn't mix well with who he is and what he does.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I learned how to be more patient last year. But at 19
years old, being patient in a race car is really, really hard,''
said Petty, the fourth-generation NASCAR driver who plans to make
his Winston Cup debut at Texas Motor Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your emotions get going when you get in that seat and you get
pumped up about seeing the lead. You say, `Hey, man, I want to get
there. I got to get there. I'm going to do whatever I can to get
there.'
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really tough to get in your head to be calm.''
</P>
<P>
   The grandson of NASCAR legend Richard Petty, Adam is the first
fourth-generation athlete in any professional sport. If he does
crack the 43-car field for the DirecTV 500 on April 2, Adam will
race against his father, Kyle Petty, for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Luckily, I'm real comfortable at Texas,'' said Petty, a
second-year competitor in NASCAR's Busch Grand National Series,
where he is driving the No. 45 Sprint Chevrolet Monte Carlo. ``We
went there with the Busch car and qualified third (last March). But
I was a little impatient and didn't run good in the race.''
</P>
<P>
   Petty crashed after 84 laps and finished 39th in his TMS Busch
debut. But he returned for a NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series event in
one of King Richard's Dodge Rams last summer, accumulating
experience on the 1.5-mile quadoval.
</P>
<P>
   The Cup race at TMS is the first of five Petty plans to run in
2000, keeping him eligible for the 2001 Raybestos Rookie of the
Year chase. Adam's graduation to NASCAR's premier series will
coincide with Petty Enterprises' switch from the Pontiac Grand Prix
to the new Dodge Intrepid R/T program.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning with great-grandfather Lee Petty, the clan has enjoyed
a storied relationship with DaimlerChrysler. At this stage of his
career, however, Adam is more interested in logging lap after hot
lap.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not being cocky or anything, but I think I can go out
there and drive a Winston Cup car,'' Adam said. ``My ultimate goal
is if the race is 500 laps, to go out there and run 500 laps. If
it's 300 laps, go out there and run 300 laps. Keep the fenders on
it, and just learn as much as I can.'' nn

UCLA STAFF KEPT IT SIMPLE

<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS - As game plans go, this was a da Vinci. UCLA's
coaches had a short list of goals to beat Maryland - nothing
unusual, all standard fare - and the Bruins executed them
perfectly.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the same stuff we've been preaching to the guys all
season, and we just hit on all cylinders,'' said Bruins assistant
Jim Saia after the 105-70 second-round victory Saturday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Watching Maryland's defense live and on film, the Bruins saw
nothing that necessitated drastic changes.
</P>
<P>
   If fast-break opportunities existed, UCLA went to the rim. If
not, point guard Earl Watson was instructed to back off and run the
halfcourt offense. As they have throughout their eight-game winning
streak, the Bruins ran the 1-4 high attack Saia and coach Steve
Lavin implemented in October.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins did not, however, anticipate as many alley-oop passes
as Maryland allowed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing with the lob passes is that Earl and JaRon (Rush)
have been playing together since AAU ball, and they have a feel for
each other,'' Saia said. ``Earl was putting them on the button.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins did make one subtle change from their first-round
game against Ball State: instead of settling for 3-pointers, they
got big men Dan Gadzuric and Jerome Moiso involved early and often.
The duo combined to make 9 of 9 shots and score 20 points in the
decisive first half.
</P>
<P>
   Defensively, the Bruins contained Maryland's fast break and
prevented slashing point guard Steve Blake from creating offense
through penetration. They also shadowed Juan Dixon, Maryland's
leading scorer and one of the top shooters in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Dixon did not score for 10 minutes, then had 10 points in a
four-minute stretch midway through the first half, then went
scoreless as the Bruins pulled away.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to be physical with him and limit his touches,''
assistant coach Steve Spencer said. ``He wasn't able to get in the
paint.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the Bruins stopped Maryland's favorite play: a flex
pick that creates easy shots for Dixon, center Lonny Baxter and
forward Terence Morris in the low post.
</P>
<P>
   Here's how it works: Two players are aligned on the baseline;
the man closest to the basket turns and sets a screen; the other
player rubs his defender off the screen and flashes into the lane
for a six-footer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got good pressure on the (passer), which is something we've
done well for the last few weeks,'' Spencer said. ``When you get
good ball pressure, it's harder to make the pass into the lane.''
</P>
<P>
   Maryland shot 37.1 percent for the game - 10 percent below its
season average.

CENTER SPECIES: THE EVOLUTION OF THE NBA BIG MAN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICHIE WHITT 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SOMEWHERE IN THE VERY REMOTE FORESTS OF SPRINGFIELD, MASS. _
Thanks for your attendance and welcome to the NBA's newest theme
attraction, ``Fantastic! Park''.
</P>
<P>
   I'm your pith-helmeted tour guide, Dr. James Naismith, here to
escort you on an educational fast break through the evolution of
basketball's biggest and baddest creatures, the center. Your two
$100 courtside tickets, lifetime Personal Seat License and purchase
of a mid-level luxury suite entitles you Homo Sapiens to join us as
we track the metamorphosis of NBA centers from the Neanderthal
nuances of George Mikan to the state-of-the-art skills of Tim
Duncan.
</P>
<P>
   Prepare to be amazed at the irrefutable evidence proving Charles
Darwin's ``Tree of Life'' theory is alive and well on the hardwood,
with each new era of stars merely branching out from its roots.
</P>
<P>
   Right this way. And, as a reminder, no feeding the players and,
even more dangerous, no autographs. IN THE BEGINNING
</P>
<P>
   Our journey begins at the first NBA game in 1946, 55 years after
I hung the first peach basket. On your left, that's 6-foot-8
Toronto Huskies center George Nostrand. Considered such a freak at
the time, any fan taller than Nostrand got into the game free.
Today, of course, 6-8 players are point guards, dwarfed by the
league's 34 7-footers.
</P>
<P>
   Next up is the first truly dominant mammal to pace the parquet,
a 6-10, 245-pound bundle of awkward intimidation.
</P>
<P>
   Mikan became the NBA's first superstar by making sweeping hook
shots with either hand. In an era in which final scores rarely
inched above 70, Mikan produced the league's first four 50-point
games. His dominance produced five championships for the
Minneapolis Lakers and prompted rules changes geared at him that
outlawed goaltending and widened the lane from six to 12 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Considered a marvel at the time, Mikan's traits would be dissed
by modern big men. Like the fact he used to travel to cities days
ahead of his team to drum up interest for upcoming games, refused
to dunk because ``it's too embarrassing for other players,'' and
signed a first contract for five years, $25,000.
</P>
<P>
   Giving more credence to Darwin's ``strongest shall survive,''
Mikan's dominance eroded along with his knees and the arrival of a
bigger, better ooze of Cretaceous chromosomes. You'll find the
decade of the '60s, ruled by two giants who despised, yet
respected, each other _ Wilt Chamberlain and Bill Russell.
</P>
<P>
   While players like Walt Bellamy made 30-rebound nights routine
and Nate Thurmond recorded the first quadruple-double in history,
Russell and Chamberlain accelerated the transformation of big men
from awkward-to-awesome like no two in the past 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   Chamberlain was perhaps the most ferocious offensive center
ever. While Mikan dominated with finesse, Wilt was a 7-1, 275-pound
terror. He still owns 56 NBA records (Michael Jordan has five).
Despite making only half his free throws (51 percent) and having
only one offensive move (the ``Big Dipper'' finger roll),
Chamberlain produced the top three highest-scoring games in league
history, topped 50 points 45 times in one ``season'' and averaged
23 rebounds per game in his career.
</P>
<P>
   To get a perspective of how much bigger and better Chamberlain
was than his opponents, imagine a rookie in today's league standing
8-foot, 400 pounds with the skills of a small forward. Despite the
evolutionary advancements in size and skill, there's not a
warm-blooded vertebrate in the paint today who could consistently
muzzle Chamberlain.
</P>
<P>
   And that feisty, gangly left-hander brave enough to torment
Chamberlain? That's none other than Russell, who revolutionized
defense as Chamberlain transformed offense. Russell led the league
in rebounding five times, averaging 22.5 for his career, and once
grabbed 32 rebounds in a half _ a league record.
</P>
<P>
   Russell ultimately won his rivalry with Chamberlain, leading his
team to 11 championships in 13 years. Almost as impressively,
Russell forced Chamberlain to develop a fadeaway jump shot. SKY'S
THE LIMIT
</P>
<P>
   Next stop is the '70s, where big men expanded their domination
by isolating their talents. Centers like Willis Reed thrived by
relying on heart as much as physical skills, Dave Cowens survived
physical limitations with relentless hustle, and shorter centers
like Wes Unseld (6-7) earned MVP honors by shake, shake, shaking
his enormous booty.
</P>
<P>
   But while the '60s were defined by one rivalry, the '70s were
engulfed by one shot _ Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's sky hook.
</P>
<P>
   Using the single most lethal, unstoppable shot in basketball
history, Jabbar flicked his way to a record 38,387 points in an
unprecedented 20 seasons. Once he began the smooth motion of the
shot out to 18 feet, opposing prey was at his mercy. So effective
and economical was his shot, that Jabbar was named MVP of the
Finals at age 38.
</P>
<P>
   Jabbar's skillful shot seemingly was only an evolutionary
asterisk that got lost in the NBA's DNA. Inexplicably, the sky hook
is extremely rare in modern big men, though it counts just as much
as today's more popular two-handed dunks complete with hanging on
the rim and mugging to the television cameras.
</P>
<P>
   Now see under those trees, stretched out in the shade doing
nothing? That coagulation of bony elbows and knobby knees is better
known as Shawn Bradley, Ralph Sampson, Chuck Nevitt, Tom
Boerwinkle, Swen Nater, Ralph Drollinger, Gheorge Muresan and
Manute Bol. That group was blessed with extraordinary height, but
few other skills necessary to combat NBA centers. Yet every time we
think their breed is near extinction, another Chris Anstey or
Dwayne Schintzius shows up in a box score.
</P>
<P>
   One thing that hasn't changed _ you can't teach height. That's
why, skilled or not, most 7-footers will never find their careers
6-foot under. HIGHER ORDER
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to our last stop, where you'll recognize the sleek
modern mix of brawn and ballerina. In other words, these are not
your father's father's centers.
</P>
<P>
   This higher order of big man first arrived with Hakeem Olajuwon
in the '80s. A stark contrast to Moses Malone's bull-headed desire
and brut force, Olajuwon was the league's first 7-foot dancer. He
ran the court effortlessly, and was one of the first players to
combine two, or even three, moves into one effective shot. His
``Dream Shake'' jumper is one of the defining shots in big man
evolution.
</P>
<P>
   Players like Patrick Ewing, David Robinson and Alonzo Mourning
followed the pattern, each possessing the strength to devour
opponents near the basket, but also the skill to consistently make
shots on the perimeter. Their careers, however, are fading faster
than Dennis Rodman. Ewing may still be powerful enough to get
comped at Atlanta's ``Gold Club'', but he and Olajuwon are hobbled
by injuries, and it's just a matter of seasons before the league
belongs to two drastically different types of center.
</P>
<P>
   On your right is Shaquille O'Neal, a renaissance big man. He's a
throwback to the days of Wilt Chamberlain, a one-trick plow horse
with a game based on strength and slam dunks. At 7-1 and 330
pounds, he would tower over George Mikan by three inches and 100
pounds. Mikan also never starred in a movie, topped $50 million in
endorsements or recorded a couple of rap CDs.
</P>
<P>
   While O'Neal has as many low-post moves as a mailbox and shoots
free throws flatter than Midland or Odessa, Tim Duncan is the
prototype big man for the 21st century. Not only can Duncan win
games with his defense, rebounding and blocked shots, he also adds
an unprecedented quality to his offensive arsenal _ the ability to
drive to the basket with the dribble.
</P>
<P>
   Feel free to chuckle at the thought of Mikan _ or Chamberlain or
Malone, for that matter _ trying one of Duncan's cat-quick
cross-over dribbles.
</P>
<P>
   No matter their specialty _ be it Jack Sikma's fadeaway, Bill
Laimbeer's 3-pointers, Robert Parish's high-arcing floaters,
Darrell Dawkins' dunks, Dikembe Mutombo's blocks or Arvydas
Sabonis' passes _ big men before the 7-foot, 255-pound Duncan were
basically stationary players. Duncan, however, can alternate
possessions of drilling a 20-foot jumper, scoring on a right-handed
post-up dunk, lofting in a left-hand hook, and finishing off his
defender by pump-faking on the perimeter to set up a dribble drive
and a pull-up 6-foot bank shot.
</P>
<P>
   Not only is substance revolutionary, so is his style. Quiet and
unassuming in an age when centers' heads are bigger than their
ancestors' only because of their egos, Duncan is a hybrid
Frankenstein who has 162 double-doubles since '97. O'Neal, next on
the list, has only 118.
</P>
<P>
   Duncan, still yet to talk his first trash, is by far our most
advanced species. Cloning procedures are well under way. But we'd
better hurry.
</P>
<P>
   At this rate of big-man evolution, even Duncan will someday be
outmoded and eventually extinct. nn

CLIPPERS START HOT, END COLD

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Despite its $400 million sticker price, the
Clippers have managed to transform Staples Center into the Outhouse
of Pain.
</P>
<P>
   Too bad the blueprint didn't include a few escape windows.
</P>
<P>
   With such structural limitations, only the Clips were able to
bail out during Saturday's 104-83 loss administered by the
Sacramento Kings before 18,964.
</P>
<P>
   What makes this clouting even more painful than normal was a
blown 23-point, second-quarter lead and evidence of Clipper
nastiness when they didn't have the ball. Their typical
poodle-in-a-junkyard defense had enough first-quarter bite to limit
the Kings to eight points, a franchise record for the fewest points
allowed in one quarter.
</P>
<P>
   But the event returned to its regularly scheduled planet in the
second quarter, and the Clippers - playing their fourth game in
five days - posted their 53rd defeat in 67 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems to be a pattern that we've fallen into a bit,''
interim Clippers coach Jim Todd said of his team's nasty habit of
building a lead, then pushing the plunger on the dynamite. Much of
the destruction was provided by 27 Clipper turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings (38-27) were led by center Vlade ``The Inhaler'' Divac
and Peja Stojakovic who each put up 20 points. Point guard Jason
Williams, who sold most of the tickets, spent the evening in a
relative coma (8 points, 1 assist).
</P>
<P>
   ``We approached the game the wrong way,'' Divac said of spotting
the woebegone Clippers a 23-point advantage. ``Even though they
beat us here last time, we took them lightly and we can't do
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Derek Anderson, the future free agent who now plays as if he
should have a bar code tattooed to his deltoid, had 25 points for
the Clippers. Lamar Odom produced 18 points, 9 rebounds and 6
fouls. Eric Piatkowski contributed a career-high 13 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson outscored the Kings by himself in round one, knocking
in 5 of 8 shots from the field for 10 of the Clippers' 24 points
and two more than the visitors could manage. Odom contributed 7
points and 6 rebounds during the period, as the Clips appeared to
be in decent shape despite coughing up 7 turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   Webber found the range in the second quarter, putting up 8
points, while Darrick Martin threw in 6 off the bench, helping he
Kings close to 45-41 by intermission.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson had 16 in the first half, but Odom had 3 fouls to go
with his 9 points. His runner in the lane provided the Clips'
biggest lead, 36-13, at 8:31 in round two. The Clippers had a 40-18
edge when he went to bench as punishment for foul play with 5:41
left in the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's learning on the fly,'' Todd said when asked about Odom's
prolonged struggle to avoid fouls. ``But it really hurts us when
he's on the bench. With him at point guard, we're able to exploit a
lot of matchups.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sacramento siege continued in the third, with the Kings
grabbing a 47-45 lead on a bucket by Divac at the 10:17 mark.
Sacramento built its biggest third-quarter lead, 68-63, on a drive
by Williams at 1:32 of the third. But Piatkowski's steal and
buzzer-beating 3-pointer earned a tie at 68 at the end of three.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings started the final stanza with an 11-1 run to win this
one in a walk.

D.A.'s OFFICE IGNORED WARNINGS 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(EDITORS: This is a copyrighted story) 
By GREG GITTRICH 
and BETH BARRETT  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The District Attorney's Office ignored early signs
of corruption in the LAPD Rampart Division, despite the repeated
efforts of one prosecutor to expose the actions of rogue cops more
than a year before the scandal was uncovered, the Daily News has
learned.
</P>
<P>
   On at least two separate occasions in 1997, Deputy District
Attorney Michael Kraut sounded alarms about the dishonesty of
Officer Rafael Perez, now the central figure in the massive LAPD
corruption scandal, according to confidential documents and
interviews.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutor's warnings came six months before Perez stole
nearly $1 &UR;  &LR; million worth of cocaine from a LAPD evidence room,
triggering what would become the largest police corruption probe in
city history.
</P>
<P>
   Kraut's first attempt to notify his supervisors about Perez has
been so widely reported that it is commonly referred to as ``the
Kraut memo.'' But the exact reasons behind the memo, the validity
of Kraut's concerns about Perez, and information about how senior
prosecutors addressed Kraut's concerns had not been clear.
</P>
<P>
   The Daily News has learned that the tightly guarded memo was not
Kraut's only effort to direct the attention of senior prosecutors
toward Perez. He made at least one other attempt.
</P>
<P>
   Disturbed by Perez's actions in another criminal case, Kraut
again forwarded his concerns about the dirty cop up the chain of
command only weeks after he wrote ``the memo,'' according to
sources and confidential documents.
</P>
<P>
   However, Kraut was ignored and rebuked by his superiors, an
informed source said.
</P>
<P>
   When contacted recently, Kraut referred to the Daily News'
findings as a ``pending criminal investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   Bound by his ethical duties as a lawyer and prosecutor, Kraut
said he would not discuss the matter. He declined further comment.
</P>
<P>
   District Attorney Gil Garcetti was unavailable to comment
Saturday. His office assigned Head Deputy District Attorney Sally
Thomas to speak about the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas said the District Attorney's Office has been conducting
an internal review of the two cases that raised Kraut's suspicions.
Thus far, there is no indication that a more thorough review of the
cases would have led to exposing Perez any earlier, she argued.
</P>
<P>
   Despite those assertions, the failure of the District Attorney's
Office to immediately inform police about the possibility of Perez
being dirty, based upon Kraut's concerns, has contributed to LAPD
Chief Bernard C. Parks' and other investigators' mistrust of the
county prosecutorial office, sources said.
</P>
<P>
   Kraut's actions are the most specific examples yet known that
give credence to serious questions about whether the District
Attorney's Office should have known that Perez and other cops were
framing dozens of suspects and testifying falsely to send them to
prison.
</P>
<P>
   ``This guy (Kraut) did what he was supposed to do. He thought
Perez was a bad cop and he told his supervisors. They ignored
him,'' a source said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they (the District Attorney's Office) had done their job,
there's a good chance Perez gets nailed before he did. But they sat
on it.''
</P>
<P>
   To date, Garcetti has rejected any criticism of his office and
refused to carry out an office-wide internal investigation to
determine how potentially hundreds of people could have been
prosecuted and convicted based upon false evidence and testimony
without raising the suspicion of anyone in his office.
</P>
<P>
   (2ND TAKE FOLLOWS.)
</P>
<P>
   Garcetti has come to refer to the scandal as the Los Angeles
Police Department's ``mess.''
</P>
<P>
   He has turned down repeated requests to release ``the Kraut
memo.'' While Garcetti has confirmed that Perez lied in the
criminal case that first raised Kraut's concerns, he has vaguely
criticized the rationale the prosecutor used.
</P>
<P>
   LAPD officials said Saturday prosecutors did not notify them of
Kraut's concerns in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Police only became fully aware of his warnings after Perez's
arrest in August 1998. Prosecutors turned over the information last
year, around the time when Perez agreed to become an informant in
exchange for a lighter sentence for stealing 8 pounds of cocaine
from a LAPD evidence room, sources said.
</P>
<P>
   Detectives interviewed Kraut and other prosecutors late last
year. The probe is ongoing and LAPD officials intend to forward
information about the incidents to the U.S. Attorney's Office and
other prosecutorial agencies.
</P>
<P>
   LAPD Cmdr. Dave Kalish, the department spokesman, declined
comment, citing the confidentiality of the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, we all have learned that it would be healthy if each
law enforcement agency in Los Angeles conducted a comprehensive
self-analysis,'' Kalish said. ``If the information (raised by
Kraut) is accurate, it would have been helpful and of critical
importance for the department in 1997.''
</P>
<P>
   The LAPD and District Attorney's Office have been feuding for
months over handling of the probe. The long-simmering tension
exploded last week when Garcetti accused Parks of refusing to
cooperate with his office and Parks responded by accusing Garcetti
of political grandstanding and lying.
</P>
<P>
   On June 16, 1997, Kraut was preparing to give his closing
argument in a cocaine case against an alleged gang member when he
took the highly unusual step of asking the judge to dismiss the
charges.
</P>
<P>
   Kraut said he had serious concerns about the credibility of
police testimony in the case. Superior Court Judge Fred Wapner
granted the motion, and subsequently Kraut explained his move to
his superiors in ``the Kraut memo.''
</P>
<P>
   Kraut has repeatedly declined to discuss why he lost trust in
Perez and his testimony. His reasons remain hidden in the
confidential memo.
</P>
<P>
   What has been learned is that Perez recently told investigators
Kraut did the right thing. The case was tainted.
</P>
<P>
   Perez was the key witness and testified shortly before the
charges were dropped on June 16, 1997. He said he and his partner
saw Gutierrez throw a white ``bindle'' to the ground in an alley.
</P>
<P>
   ``I picked it up, opened it up and noticed it contained
</P>
<P>
   I don't know maybe about 10, flat, off-white rocks, which in my
expertise, were ... rock cocaine,'' Perez testified.
</P>
<P>
   Kraut's concerns were not related directly to the evidence,
sources said. Rather, he had proof that Perez was lying about who
his partner was on the day of the arrest and other circumstances
surrounding the bust.
</P>
<P>
   In a sworn statement to task force investigators last September,
Perez admitted that he planted drugs on Gutierrez, according to
confidential transcripts obtained by the Daily News. He described
his relationship with Kraut as a ``pissing match.''
</P>
<P>
   According to District Attorney's Office policy, Kraut was
required to get approval from his supervisor, Head Deputy District
Attorney Richard Sullivan.
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan approved Kraut's decision and reviewed ``the memo'' and
the case file, but determined he didn't need to take any further
steps, Thomas said.
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan, who could not be reached for comment, did not notify
police about the case, LAPD officials said.
</P>
<P>
   According to sources and confidential documents, Kraut no longer
trusted Perez. He would soon completely lose faith in him.
</P>
<P>
   Not long after Kraut outlined his reasons for backing away from
the Gutierrez case, he reviewed the file of another failed criminal
case that one of his fellow prosecutors had handled, sources said.
</P>
<P>
   The file revealed that only 10 days after the Gutierrez case had
been dismissed, another judge threw out drug charges against a
defendant because the prosecutor could not proceed within the
court-mandated time limit.
</P>
<P>
   Again, Perez was involved.
</P>
<P>
   Court records show Perez and his partner Nino Durden arrested
alleged dope dealer Victor Perez no relation to the officer on June
5, 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Six days later, Victor Perez posted $10,000 bail. Over the next
two weeks, things proceeded normally and Deputy District Attorney
Janis Johnson was ready to prosecute the case as scheduled on June
27, 1997.
</P>
<P>
   (3RD TAKE FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
   But on the day of the preliminary hearing, the case fell apart
when the officers reported the drugs confiscated during the arrest
could not be found in the evidence room.
</P>
<P>
   ``Perez told her that they had looked for two hours and couldn't
find the drugs,'' a source said.
</P>
<P>
   To Johnson, who could not be reached for comment, it likely
appeared as an unfortunate mix-up. But when Kraut saw the file
later and went over details, sources said, he called the LAPD and
asked about the missing evidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``They put him on hold for a few moments, came back and told him
it was sitting there. It was never missing,'' an informed source
said.
</P>
<P>
   Believing Perez had again lied to prosecutors and botched a
criminal conviction, Kraut wrote a note outlining his concerns and
placed it in the Victor Perez file, sources said.
</P>
<P>
   Just as with the earlier memo, Kraut sent the file to Sullivan,
his supervisor. The file sat on Sullivan's desk for about a year,
sources said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It became an office joke,'' an informed source said. ``The
file just sat there and no one did anything about it until after
Perez was arrested.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas said her review of the case has found no note.
</P>
<P>
   ``If someone is in receipt of any such note,'' she said. ``I'd
certainly like to see it.''
</P>
<P>
   Victor Perez was later re-tried on the drug charges. The second
time there was no problem finding the evidence. He was sentenced to
135 days in prison, Thomas said.
</P>
<P>
   In April 1998, Thomas said she was put in charge of the
prosecutorial division where both the Gutierrez and Victor Perez
cases were handled.
</P>
<P>
   Upon her recommendation a few months ago, Thomas said, Garcetti
ordered an internal review of the cases to determine if they were
handled properly.
</P>
<P>
   Thus far, Thomas said, she believes that Officer Perez would not
have been nabbed any earlier if the Kraut warnings were handled
differently.
</P>
<P>
   If she found a note from Kraut to Sullivan regarding the Victor
Perez case that didn't contain any startling new information, it
would not change her assessment, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas said the office's current policies have been working well
to catch dirty cops.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, because we are trying to maintain the
confidentiality of the investigation, it may have appeared that we
were not sharing information,'' Thomas said. ``That may have
appeared sinister or negative. However, we have been paying
attention and what we are doing is continuing our effort to see if
there is any way to improve procedurally (within the office), which
is a positive thing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That is exactly Mr. Garcetti's directive,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Since being taken into custody in August 1998, Rafael Perez has
told investigators that he and other cops shot at least one unarmed
suspect, brutally beat several people and routinely framed
suspected gang members.
</P>
<P>
   Some 40 criminal convictions have been set aside and hundreds
more are expected to be overturned. At least 20 cops either have
been fired, suspended, or have resigned. Administrative
disciplinary hearings have been scheduled for many of the cops,
including Durden.
</P>
<P>
   The charges against Durden include his involvement in the case
against Victor Perez. Kraut is expected to testify about the case
during Durden's LAPD Board of Rights hearing later this year.
</P>
<P>
   Calls continue for an outside review of the LAPD, but there has
been significantly less pressure for a review of the District
Attorney's Office.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't seen any prosecutorial misconduct. We haven't seen
any misconduct by anyone (in the D.A.'s Office),'' Garcetti told
Daily News editors and reporters shortly before the March 7 county
primary.
</P>
<P>
   Garcetti ran second to Head Deputy District Attorney Steve
Cooley in the primary and now must face a runoff in November.
</P>
<P>
   During his meeting at the Daily News, Garcetti maintained
internal reviews of his office's prosecutorial decisions are done
at ``every step.'' Therefore, he said, he sees no reason for a
special office-wide internal review or an outside examination of
the law enforcement agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I hire people I tell them what their obligation is,'' he
said, banging his hand on the desk. ``When I meet with my deputy in
charge, head deputies, supervisors we continue to talk about our
ethical responsibilities.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I am very confident there is not a problem within our office
in this area, just talking to the people getting the feedback. I
talk to a lot of people in our office. I get a lot of information.
... I know the checks and balances.''

 &HT;    ARAB CHRISTIAN MINORITY ANXIOUS FOR PAPAL SUPPORT
 &HT;    (550&AMP;ADD)
 &HT;    With Photo.
 &HT;    By LARRY KAPLOW

<P>
   JIFNA, West Bank _ Local Christians, who have kept their
religion alive here in the place where it was born, seek a morale
boost from this week's visit of Pope John Paul II.
</P>
<P>
   Over the decades, Christians have nervously watched their
influence drop with the upsurge in Jewish and Muslim populations.
They know that many Westerners scarcely know they exist. They hope
the Pope will bring them some recognition here and abroad.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will encourage the Christians, the local people here,''
said Samer Salameh, a 32-year-old Roman Catholic from this small
West Bank town. ``It is to be respected by both sides, the Jews and
the Muslims _ to show we are not weak, that we have people
supporting us.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pope is scheduled to arrive in Amman, Jordan, Monday, where
he will spend just over 24 hours and deliver a Mass in a sports
stadium. Tuesday, he heads to Jerusalem, for the start of a six-day
pilgrimage to the Holy sites.
</P>
<P>
   Officials continued with preparations Sunday. Workers built
stages for, churches are setting aside spots on hundreds of buses
to take worshippers to the Pope's masses in Bethlehem and near the
Sea of Galilee.
</P>
<P>
   They were also painting over a Nazi Swastika and other graffiti
painted on the Pope's Jerusalem helicopter pad _ which police say
is likely the work of Jewish extremists.
</P>
<P>
   But, among Christians throughout Israel and the West Bank,
preparations took on a festive feel.
</P>
<P>
   Posters and bumper stickers were up on church walls and shop
doors, welcoming the 79-year-old pontiff. In Bethlehem, motorists
flew the yellow-and-white Vatican flags from stands mounted in car
windows.
</P>
<P>
   There are an estimated 150,000 to 180,000 Christians in Israel
and the Palestinian-controlled West Bank. They comprise about 2
percent or 3 percent of the population, down from about nine
percent 50 years ago. The majority of local Christians live in
Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Just under half the local Christians are followers of the Pope _
either in the Roman Catholic or Greek Catholic, or Melkites,
churches. The rest are from eastern Orthodox churches, along with a
small number of Protestants.
</P>
<P>
   Jifna has gone from being all Christian to a mix of 800
Christians and 200 Muslims. About a thousand Christians from Jifna
now live in California. Salameh, a university lecturer in computer
science, says he feels a ``mission'' to remain.
</P>
<P>
   Other once-Christian towns have already become mostly Muslim,
including Bethlehem. Bethlehem residents claim there are more
Bethlehem Christians in Santiago, Chile, than the 20,000 or so
still here.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts give a number of reasons for their emigration. Like
other Palestinians, the Christians in the West Bank have faced
Israeli occupation that has choked off commerce and prompted
violent uprisings. Christians have more money and contacts abroad,
easing emigration.
</P>
<P>
   As an example of their bind between two stronger powers,
Christians in the Israeli city of Nazareth were infuriated last
year when Israel approved plans for a mosque near the plaza of the
Basilica of the Annunciation. The church is where tradition states
that the Virgin Mary was told she would give birth to the son of
God.
</P>
<P>
   It appeared that Muslim activists, staging weeks of protests,
had strong-armed the Israeli government over the objections of the
local Christians.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   While few Christians claim they are victims of official
persecution, they do claim that they have trouble getting jobs or
buying land from Muslims. Sometimes, they say, they are called
heretics, by Muslims. Meanwhile, with Jews, Christians say they
face the same barriers as other Arabs.
</P>
<P>
   The Pope is expected to urge Christians to maintain their
presence among their fellow Palestinians and the Holy sites.
Christians frequently say their religion's emphasis on love and
forgiveness is an important message for the Middle East. They worry
that their churches could become empty museums.
</P>
<P>
   ``The moral support is very important,'' said Jerusalem Greek
Catholic Archbishop Lutfi Laham. ``He will tell them, 'You have a
responsibility to your society.'''
</P>
<P>
   But some Christian Palestinians worry that a papal visit without
a strong pitch for Palestinian rights could anger their Muslim
neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need a strong statement from the Pope that will make it
clear that the people who are oppressed and living under occupation
are the Palestinians,'' said the Rev. Naim Ateek(CQ), a Protestant
Palestinian theologian. ``If the Pope does not do it, some of us
are going to be embarrassed.''
</P>
<P>
   Organizers of the visit appear intent on sensitivity toward the
Muslims. The Pope will visit the Dheisheh Refugee Camp in
Bethlehem, a neighborhood of 10,000 Muslims and no Christians.
</P>
<P>
   He will deliver a Mass on Bethlehem's Manger Square Wednesday,
which will likely coincide with the mid-day Muslim prayer time.
Officials organizing the event said Friday that they expect that
the Pope will pause when the mosque on the square broadcasts the
eight-minute call to prayer.

 &HT;    THOUSANDS OF PROTESTERS SURROUND RULING PARTY HEADQUARTERS,
DEMAND PRESIDENT LEE'S RESIGNATION
 &HT;    Moving in both (i) International and (w) Washington categories.

   TAIPEI _ It would be unthinkable in communist China: thousands
of angry Chinese citizens gathering en masse, lobbing eggs at the
headquarters of the ruling party, calling for the party chairman to
step down, shouting at the city's mayor as he addressed the
emotionally-charged crowd.
</P>
<P>
   This was the scene in Taipei a day after the Nationalist Party
suffered a stunning defeat in Taiwan's presidential elections, not
only coming in a distant third but failing to carry a single county
or municipality.
</P>
<P>
   The protesters were angry, they said, not because they lost but
because they were betrayed by their party's own leader: President
Lee Teng-hui, who is also chairman of the Nationalist Party.
</P>
<P>
   It is widely thought Lee, who has been president of Taiwan since
1988, privately urged party faithful to vote for the opposition
candidate, Chen Shui-bian, who was elected president Saturday with
39 percent of the vote. Lee denied it several times during the
campaign, but the rumors persisted, based partly on the perception
that Lee secretly harbors the goal of an independent Taiwan, much
like the opposition Democratic Progressive Party.
</P>
<P>
   ``By day he's in the Nationalist Party, but by night he works
for the Democratic Progressive Party,'' said Hwang Chu Fang, a
housewife who was furious with Lee. ``He cheated the party and he
cheated the people.''
</P>
<P>
   Through a party spokesman, Lee said he would step down as party
chairman in September. But it wasn't soon enough for the angry
masses, who remained at the party headquarters, a 13-story building
next to the Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall, well past midnight.
</P>
<P>
   ``As president and chairman, he should apologize for losing,''
said Chang Chung Rong, an engineer, as he watched the police
spraying water cannons in an effort to disperse the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Protesters have vowed to return to the building every day until
Lee steps down.
</P>
<P>
   ``The U.S. should be concerned if there's going to be a central
authority,'' said Tom Gold, a University of California-Berkeley
professor of sociology and expert on Taiwan. ``How is this going to
be defused? There's going to be a collapse of public order here.''
</P>
<P>
   President-elect Chen, who will be inaugurated May 20, called for
calm Sunday, urging people to return to their normal lives. He
reached out to his political rivals as well, both on the island and
abroad. He has called for building multi-party coalitions and has
invited Chinese leaders to visit Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   As far as easing tensions with China, any of the three major
candidates would've been better than Lee, whose ``strategy has been
to delay, stall, abort'' talks, said Shelley Rigger, an American
expert on Taiwanese politics in town to observe the elections.
</P>
<P>
   American officials have been working with Chen since it became
clear several years ago that he'd be a figure in Taiwanese
politics, said Gold. He said China's muted response to Chen's
victory _ basically that it would wait and see what the new
president does _ is a hopeful sign.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an opportunity to clear the air,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Chen's victory was made possible by a split in the Nationalist
Party. Lee refused to allow James Soong to be on the ticket,
insisting on his unpopular vice president Lien Chan. Soong launched
an independent populist campaign, winning a good deal of support
from longtime party members.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the protesters Sunday had voted for Soong. A few were
even Chen supporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can sympathize with them,'' said Ivy Tsai, a health policy
researcher who voted for Chen. ``This party has frustrated too many
people. Lee is too corrupt.''
</P>
<P>
   Shelley, professor of political science at Davidson College in
North Carolina, doesn't believe Lee actually tried to get Chen
elected but said he made strategic errors that allowed for Chen's
victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's just been around too long, become too dictatorial,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Lee has been praised both in Taiwan and abroad for overseeing
widespread democratic reforms in Taiwan, but since he became the
first directly-elected president four years ago, corruption in the
party has overshadowed his other achievements.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't trust the government any more,'' said Wendy Fei, a
make-up artist.
</P>
<P>
   The crowds were largely cooperative, but when several black
sedans with party officials left the building in the afternoon,
some enraged protesters attacked the cars, pummeling them with
their fists, flagpoles, motorcycle helmets and anything else at
their disposal. They succeeded in smashing a few windshields while
police stood by.
</P>
<P>
   An angry mob chased senior party adviser Hsu Li-teh down the
sidewalk, kicking, punching and beating him with poles. They
knocked him to the ground, but he was able to stand up and scurry
into a building.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday night, they had gathered in front of Lee's official
residence just a few blocks away, not dispersing until almost 7
a.m. (local time) Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   They returned to the party headquarters Sunday afternoon,
blasting air horns, chanting slogans and launching a brief rain of
raw eggs at police while they waited for Lee, who was convening an
emergency party meeting with party officials. Crowds thinned around
dinner-time, after the party officials left, but swelled again to
several thousand by night-time.
</P>
<P>
   Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou, a Nationalist Party stalwart who
announced he was resigning from the party central committee, came
out to talk to the protesters, calling for calm and saying he would
talk to Lee. He stayed for more than an hour, answering written and
oral questions from the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Around midnight, Ma returned to announce to a smaller crowd that
Lee had a slight cold and had gone to bed. Chants of ``Lee Teng-hui
step down'' changed to ``Lee Teng-hui get out of bed.''

   Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou, a Nationalist Party stalwart who
announced he was resigning from the party central committee, came
out to talk to the protesters, calling for calm and saying he would
talk to Lee. He stayed for more than an hour, answering written and
oral questions from the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Around midnight, Ma returned to announce to a smaller crowd that
Lee had a slight cold and had gone to bed. Chants of ``Lee Teng-hui
step down'' changed to ``Lee Teng-hui get out of bed.''

ROBERT L. ``BOB'' BLACKMAN, 81; LONGTIME DARTMOUTH COACH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MAC DANIEL  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Robert L. ``Bob'' Blackman, who coached Dartmouth College to
undefeated seasons in 1962 and 1965 and devised innovative plays _
including one that helped put the Tennessee Titans into the Super
Bowl this year _ died Friday. He was 81.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Blackman died after contracting an unknown disease while
touring Singapore and Malaysia, his wife, Kay, said. He was deemed
well enough to return to his home in Hilton Head, S.C., but he fell
ill again during the flight, she said.
</P>
<P>
   After the plane made an emergency landing in San Francisco, Mr.
Blackman was taken to Peninsula Medical Center in Burlingame,
Calif., where he died of complications.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Blackman also coached at the University of Illinois and
Cornell University, but he made his mark at Dartmouth and was
inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   He began his coaching career as a student at the University of
Southern California after his own promising career was derailed
when he contracted polio during his freshman year. Unable to
abandon the sport, Mr. Blackman became a student assistant to the
coaching staff at USC.
</P>
<P>
   After graduation, he coached several naval base teams during
World War II. He coached Monrovia High School in California after
the war before taking a position at Pasadena City College, where
his 1951 team won the National Junior College championship.
</P>
<P>
   Then, after two years at Denver University, Mr. Blackman
succeeded Tuss McLaughry at Dartmouth in 1955.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a revelation to me,'' retired Boston Globe columnist
and former Darmouth sports information director Ernie Roberts said
Saturday from his home in Hobe Sound, Fla. ``He was an innovator in
what seemed to be mundane things, such as the way the team came out
of the dressing room and broke up into groups, with every group at
a particular part of the field, like The Rockettes. Everything was
organized. He didn't leave anything to chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Blackman was remembered as an imaginative coach, with many
people pointing to the final play in this season's NFL playoff
match between the Buffalo Bills and the Titans: a kickoff return
that ended with a cross-field lateral that led to the winning
touchdown. Mr. Blackman has been credited as the originator of the
play, which he once used to beat Harvard.
</P>
<P>
   In 16 seasons, Dartmouth garnered seven Ivy League titles and
tied for three more. Mr. Blackman's 1970 team, his last at
Dartmouth, is considered among the best in school history,
compiling a 9-0 record while outscoring opponents by a 311-42
margin. That season also included six shutouts. The team received
the Lambert Trophy as the best college football team in the East
that year, beating out Penn State.
</P>
<P>
   When he retired from Dartmouth, Mr. Blackman left as the
winningest coach in school history with a record of 104-37-3. Years
later, he was made an honorary member of Dartmouth's Class of 1941,
the year Mr. Blackman graduated from USC.
</P>
<P>
   In retirement, Mr. Blackman was affiliated with the East-West
Shrine Game.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his wife, Mr. Blackman leaves his daughter,
Julie, of Hilton Head, S.C. Funeral arrangements were incomplete.

   DINOSAURS _ CORTADERAS CAMP, Argentina _ In science, truth is

Conventional wisdom has long held that giant meat-eating dinosaurs
like Tyrannosaurus rex operated pretty much on instinct. They fed
themselves about as automatically as, say, Venus' flytraps _ and
with the same social skills. But maybe not. Contrary evidence comes
from a dig here in the Argentine desert, sustained in part by the
$1.25 million Fernbank is paying for models of two giant fossilized
dino skeletons unearthed nearby. Paleontologists Phil Currie and
Rodolfo Coria have found new evidence that giant meat-eating
dinosaurs weren't as dumb as we've thought. They were apparently
smart enough to live in family groups, with adults nurturing their

   ELEGANT-UNIVERSE _ ATLANTA _The newest wonderboy in theoretical

Greene will speak at Georgia Tech on Thursday, promoting the new
paperback edition of his book ``The Elegant Universe.'' One of
Greene's specialties is superstring theory, which he will
illustrate by means of video tape. In 1990 Greene and a colleague
discovered mirror symmetry, which opened new fields in mathematics
and physics. later, they discovered topology change, showing that
the fabric of space can tear, refuting Einstein's theory that space
can stretch but not tear. ``The Elegant Universe'' was nominated
for a 1999 New Yorker book award, named a nytimes Notable Book of
the Year and received the 1999 Phi Beta Kappa award in science.
Skube is attending the talk and video presentation at Tech tonight,
and talking to Greene tomorrow. After dusting off his high school

promises to make this accessible and enlightening. (Skube, Atlanta

 &HT;    Volume explores `Souls' of folk art
 &HT;    By Catherine Fox
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _``Souls Grown Deep,'' the 1996 Olympics exhibition of
art by Southern African-American self-taught artists, was a
landmark survey of its subject, and a revelation.
</P>
<P>
   Now comes ``Souls Grown Deep,'' the book. Sure to be a landmark
as well, the hefty tome is the first of at least three volumes that
aim to provide a comprehensive exploration of this complex art
form. At 544 pages, with reproductions of works by 100 artists and
photographs of environmental art as well as 40 artist profiles and
essays by 35 contributors, Volume 1 is an impressive start.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first volume is an introduction to the field,'' says
Atlantan William Arnett, who has championed the art for 15 years
and conceived the book in 1987. ``We want to bring people up to
date.''
</P>
<P>
   To that end, it sets out a historical context. Scholars note
African influences on African-American artists. Early forms of
African-American object-making _ funerary art, charms, quilts _ are
discussed as antecedents. U.S. Rep. John Lewis (D-Ga.), who
contributes an essay, sees the connection between the civil rights
movement and the flowering of this art in ``this whole desire to be
liberated, not just from physical barriers but being free of spirit
and free of mind.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's important for the American community to know
about this art,'' Lewis says. ``It's ordinary people being very
creative, doing what they can using their hands and minds.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Souls'' is encyclopedic but not an encyclopedia. Instead of
organizing the book alphabetically or chronologically, Arnett and
son Paul, who are executive editors, chose to arrange the profile
section according to the materials the artists use: stone, wood
(including roots), paper, canvas, found objects.
</P>
<P>
   They took great pains to include essays from authors with a
broad spectrum of viewpoints and specialties. All of them came to
Atlanta to review the Arnetts' extensive collection of the material
and met as many of the artists as possible. Artists write where
possible, or are interviewed.
</P>
<P>
   Planned for wide distribution in late spring, the book is
already getting a strong response. It aroused unusual enthusiasm
when the Museum of American Folk Art debuted it at the Outsider Art
Fair in New York in January.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had 100 books and sold every one of them,'' says Marie
DiManno, director of museum shops for the New York facility.
``People are coming in the shop just for the book. They're asking
to be notified when the second volume comes out. Dealers, students
_ everyone is buying it. It's becoming a must-have.''
</P>
<P>
   The book can be ordered online for $95 at
www.soulsgrowndeep.org.

 &HT;    A physicist at `cosmology's cutting edge'
 &HT;    By Michael Skube
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ One night when Brian Greene was 9 years old, his
mother fixed spareribs for dinner. He has been a vegetarian ever
since.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were so horrible,'' he says, sitting in the lobby of the
Ritz-Carlton, ``I declared I'd never eat meat again.'' And with
that he proceeded to rummage about in the refrigerator, where he
found the makings of a salami sandwich.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess you know salami's meat too,'' his father said.
</P>
<P>
   In the 29 years since, Greene, a physicist at Columbia
University, has learned his way around more than just the
refrigerator. He wants to understand nothing less than the universe
itself, its smallest invisible kernels of energy as much as its
unfathomable distant galaxies.
</P>
<P>
   When his book ``The Elegant Universe'' became a best seller last
year, the media all but canonized Greene as the successor to the
late Carl Sagan _ an engaging, telegenic theoretical physicist who
can communicate the wonder and mysteries of the cosmos. From ABC's
hourlong ``Nightline in Primetime'' to a bit part in the upcoming
Dennis Quaid movie ``Frequency,'' Greene is showing up everywhere.
At 38, he is the rising star of superstring theory.
</P>
<P>
   He looks almost too boyish for the part _ impish in his wit,
casually chic in black jeans, an enthusiast of tofu.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago he went completely vegan, adding eggs and dairy
products to ribs, sausage and porterhouse steaks. Most people know
you can fill your belly rather nicely at the Ritz-Carlton, but what
about Brian Greene?
</P>
<P>
   ``I took a cab to this place called the Sunflower Cafe last
night,'' he says, face brightening, ``and had pad thai. I want to
tell you, that was one of the best meals I've ever had.'' He sounds
as if he wishes you had been there to share it.
</P>
<P>
   Greene is at cosmology's cutting edge and yet is, in his own
way, normal as the next guy. He is an occasional jogging partner of
George Stephanopoulos (they were Rhodes scholars together at Oxford
University) and has written dialogue for John Lithgow's character
in ``3rd Rock From the Sun.''
</P>
<P>
   But an hour with him persuades you he is not content merely to
be rich and famous. Sagan _ fairly or unfairly _ came to be seen by
many physicists as a popularizer who cultivated his audience more
assiduously than any scientist should.
</P>
<P>
   If some people consider Greene a budding media star, he is not
among them. At both Columbia and Cornell, he teaches a course
called Physics and Geometry, and says nothing excites him like the
possibility of discovering something that eluded Einstein the last
30 years of his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Black holes are out there, no question. They exist,'' he says.
There is a note of both assertion and anticipation in his words, as
if the final discovery, the one that would explain everything, is
within mortal reach.
</P>
<P>
   In a talk last week at Georgia Tech, Greene spoke of the great
conundrum of science: The two pillars of modern physics are
incompatible with each other. One is Einstein's general theory of
relativity, which describes the universe on the largest scale _ the
stars, galaxies and beyond. The other is quantum mechanics, which
describes the unseen universe of subatomic particles _ electrons,
quarks and, perhaps, elements yet unknown.
</P>
<P>
   ``Experiments show it's right on the money,'' he says of
Einstein's theory of relativity. But other experiments prove, with
just as much accuracy, that quantum physics is likewise
unassailable.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that, as currently understood, the two cannot
both be right.
</P>
<P>
   And so workaday physicists _ and even very good physicists _
plow the field they know. They do big physics or they do little
physics, and sometimes have little patience for one another.
</P>
<P>
   But now comes superstring theory to say that two departments of
the most prestigious branch of modern science not only require one
another but _ through the most arduous mathematics imaginable _ can
make a happy marriage of it.
</P>
<P>
   Not just happy, Greene says, but inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   Superstring theory _ it refers to infinitesimally small
subatomic noodle-like units of vibrating energy _ thus dares to
bridge general relativity and quantum mechanics. Many, including
Nobel laureates, called it folly for 20 years. They don't anymore.
</P>
<P>
   By their nature, Greene says, physicists ``will not be satisfied
until they feel that the deepest and most fundamental understanding
of the universe has been unveiled. This is what Stephen Hawking has
alluded to as a first step toward knowing `the mind of God.'''
</P>
<P>
   Greene isn't so immodest as to think he would find it all by
himself _ science almost never works that way _ but the thrill of
discovery energizes him. Physics, he explains, is about just that _
the energy that underlies everything that is. It may or may not
stop with strings. ``There is tantalizing evidence,'' he says,
``that there might be something smaller yet.''
</P>
<P>
   An hour before his talk, he ate a lunch of curried tofu, guava
nectar and barley malt, and listened as a Tech physicist much older
than himself expounded a theory of creation that Greene clearly
thought unlikely. When the theory reached a point where first
causes had to be waived, Greene said, ``Are you satisfied with
that?''
</P>
<P>
   It is not enough, you gathered, to know just that the strings
exist. Greene wants to know ``who plucks the strings and what they
are playing _ rock or Bach, or something else?''

 &HT;    Make or break year for farmers
 &HT;    By Ginger Livingston
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CONETOE, N.C. _ Before preparing sweet potato beds for the
seedling harvest and beginning work on dormant farm equipment last
Friday, Wayne Harrell talked with his insurance adjuster.
</P>
<P>
   Six months since September's flooding, Harrell is still haggling
over his losses. He found out Friday morning that he will have to
hire a lawyer and go to court to pick an arbitrator to settle his
claims.
</P>
<P>
   ``Twenty-five to 30 percent of every day I spend dealing with
the flood,'' said Harrell, an Edgecombe County farmer.
</P>
<P>
   Hurricane Floyd's flooding caused $550 million in agriculture
losses statewide. Before farmers like Harrell and his
brother-in-law, Willie Owens, can prepare for this year's growing
season, they're still trying to recover from last year's
catastrophe.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problems keep going on and on, it's like a running
river,'' Owens said.
</P>
<P>
   It is a make or break year for many farmers, agriculture experts
say. Commodity prices remain low and the flooding stripped away any
cushions farmers had to protect them if yields are low this year.
And that's a distinct possibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of them have that extra cushion if there is a bad
production season this year,'' said Mitch Smith, director of the
Pitt County Cooperative Extension Service. ``We are going into (the
growing season) at a greater risk than we have historically.''
</P>
<P>
   One farmer from the Pitt County town of Fountain is unwilling to
take that risk.
</P>
<P>
   The 55-year-old man quit farming this year after 29 years in the
fields. He asked that his name not be used.
</P>
<P>
   ``Would you want people to know you were almost beat down?'' he
asked.
</P>
<P>
   The farmer only lost 50 acres of soybeans to floodwaters, but
the heavy rains associated with Hurricane Floyd and the series of
other tropical rainmakers last year reduced his yield. Coupled with
low commodity prices, the farmer couldn't pay off his credit line
for the first time since he started farming.
</P>
<P>
   ``You always wish next year will be better, but I got to the
point where I wasn't going to fool myself any longer,'' he said.
``My banker said, 'As a friend I hate to see you quit, but from a
business standpoint I think you're right.'''
</P>
<P>
   There are no firm statistics on how many farmers quit this year.
</P>
<P>
   'Every day it seems we have another story of someone who had
decided not to farm this year,'' Smith said. ``It's going to take
us a long time before we fully know how this has affected us and
will continue to affect us.''
</P>
<P>
   The numbers may increase after this growing season if crop
prices remain low, Smith and other experts say.
</P>
<P>
   There is no unusual increase in farmers quitting, said Gene
Charville, president of East Carolina Farm Credit, the region's
largest farm lender.
</P>
<P>
   ``The 1990s were generally pretty good for agriculture, which
means most farmers have entered this adversity in good financial
shape, and it will help them get through adverse times like last
year,'' he said. ``But they can't continue to weather these
problems.''
</P>
<P>
   The 2000 growing season is critical for the Harrell and Owens
Farms of Conetoe.
</P>
<P>
   Founded by Floyd and Ernestine Harrell in 1955, the 5,000-acre
operation is now run by Harrell; his brother, Carl; brother-in-law,
Willie Owens and their wives. Their parents also remain involved.
</P>
<P>
   Harrell and Owens estimate their operation lost $1.5 million to
the flood.
</P>
<P>
   With crop insurance and federal aid, the family reduced the loss
to $300,000. If more aid becomes available, as expected, the loss
can be further reduced, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The monetary losses are only part of the story, Owens said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a whole lot of pain beneath those figures,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Owens, his wife, Pamela, and their two children lost their home
in the flood. The mortgage was paid off eight months earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The operation is also fighting its insurance company for a
settlement on the farm equipment and buildings that were damaged by
the flood. Fearing repercussions, Harrell declined to name the
insurance company.
</P>
<P>
   ``(A friend) told me I'd get sad, I'd get mad and then I'd get
glad. I didn't think I'd ever get over the mad part,'' Owens said.
</P>
<P>
   It has been difficult watching the family struggle, said Roy
Stancill, a family friend and their crop insurance agent.
</P>
<P>
   ``When these boys first got flooded it looked bad and they
weren't sure if they could keep going,'' Stancill said. ``But they
got their crop insurance and the government kicked in and last time
I saw them they were in a better mood now.''
</P>
<P>
   Harrell and Owens said their moods fluctuate. But their
treatment by the insurance company has infuriated them.
</P>
<P>
   ``From what I'm hearing, in general, is farming in general is
being targeted not to settle. They look at tractors and they think
they are invincible. But there is a whole lot more electronics and
computers on them.''
</P>
<P>
   The company offered $15,000 settlement for a $175,000 peanut
combine.
</P>
<P>
   The claim was sent to arbitration, but the parties can't agree
on the arbitrator. They found out Friday morning the court must now
appoint an arbitrator. That requires hiring a lawyer to represent
them, Harrell said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're caught in limbo and they won't settle and now is the
time to be planting,'' Harrell said.
</P>
<P>
   The company has offered a myriad of excuses, he said. It offered
$1,800 to pay off a $3,000 tobacco barn. The reason: tobacco quotas
were cut last year so barns cost less, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Without an insurance settlement the Harrells and Owens has been
forced to pay for expensive repairs. Meanwhile, things keep
breaking down just as they gear up for planting season.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the work, like taking all the tires off their 27 peanut
trucks so they can repair bearings, they do themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Their efforts are slowed because they have to take time off to
deal with other flood issues.
</P>
<P>
   An employee is setting up a new mobile home and has needed time
off. Owens is building a new house and needed time to complete the
paperwork, file property titles, select a builder and inspect the
work. All the siblings have taken time to help their parents repair
their flood-damaged home.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you farm and don't have time to start with, and this
lands in the middle of the planting season, this is time of year
you can't make up,'' Owens said.
</P>
<P>
   Farming wasn't always been such a risky proposition, said the
Fountain farmer who quit this year. When he started it seemed like
a good bet.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the time I was in public work and as far as the pay scale
went farming looked good,'' the farmer said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I started farming in 1970-71, you could buy gas for 24
cents and corn was bringing about $3.75 to $3.80 (a bushel) and
soybeans was $7 to $8,'' he said. ``Today we're looking at
$1.45-1.50 gas and we sold beans for less than $5 and some boys
sold corn for less than $2.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the economic climate of the 1980s ended many family
farms, the Fountain farmer and his neighbors were somewhat
insulated because of profitable tobacco production.
</P>
<P>
   But starting in the mid-1990s tobacco quotas were cut. The
farmer saw his income plunge $200,000 over a three-year period.
</P>
<P>
   The farmer spent three months debating if he should remain in
agriculture. His decision came in January.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the first year in 29 years I couldn't pay my credit
line,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A credit line is the cash farmers borrow every year to fund
their farming operations in the upcoming year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've carried debt at other times, but I could always pay off
my credit line before going to the bank,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While his banker offered to help with financing, the farmer said
he worried about going deeper in debt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feared filing bankruptcy because if I have a debt I like to
pay it off,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Facing a combined debt of about $200,000, the knowledge that his
tobacco quotas would probably be cut again and the almost-certain
knowledge that crop prices were not going to dramatically increase,
the farmer decided to call it quits.
</P>
<P>
   He sold his equipment and tobacco barns to pay off the debt. He
also sold 88 acres of farmland he and his wife purchased several
years ago. They had wanted to hold the land and then sell it to
fund their retirement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a pond on it that I enjoyed carrying the grandchildren
to, but we tried to look at it as we were blessed to have it to pay
off our debt instead of filing bankruptcy,'' he said. ``I had two
daughters I walked down the aisle and (the sale) was harder.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week the farmer began his new career as a trainee salesman
for a local agri-business operation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't used a computer before in my life and yes, it is
hard,'' he said. ``I quit school in the eighth grade. Back when I
was in school lots of kids helped on the farm and they weren't
encouraged to stay in school.''

   JIFNA, West Bank _ Local Christians, who have kept their
religion alive here in the place where it was born, seek a morale
boost from this week's visit of Pope John Paul II.
</P>
<P>
   Over the decades, Christians have nervously watched their
influence drop with the upsurge in Jewish and Muslim populations.
They know that many Westerners scarcely know they exist. They hope
the Pope will bring them some recognition here and abroad.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will encourage the Christians, the local people here,''
said Samer Salameh, a 32-year-old Roman Catholic from this small
West Bank town. ``It is to be respected by both sides, the Jews and
the Muslims _ to show we are not weak, that we have people
supporting us.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pope is scheduled to arrive in Amman, Jordan, Monday, where
he will spend just over 24 hours and deliver a Mass in a sports
stadium. Tuesday, he heads to Jerusalem, for the start of a six-day
pilgrimage to the Holy sites.
</P>
<P>
   Officials continued with preparations Sunday. Workers built
stages for, churches are setting aside spots on hundreds of buses
to take worshippers to the Pope's masses in Bethlehem and near the
Sea of Galilee.
</P>
<P>
   They were also painting over a Nazi Swastika and other graffiti
painted on the Pope's Jerusalem helicopter pad _ which police say
is likely the work of Jewish extremists.
</P>
<P>
   But, among Christians throughout Israel and the West Bank,
preparations took on a festive feel.
</P>
<P>
   Posters and bumper stickers were up on church walls and shop
doors, welcoming the 79-year-old pontiff. In Bethlehem, motorists
flew the yellow-and-white Vatican flags from stands mounted in car
windows.
</P>
<P>
   There are an estimated 150,000 to 180,000 Christians in Israel
and the Palestinian-controlled West Bank. They comprise about 2
percent or 3 percent of the population, down from about nine
percent 50 years ago. The majority of local Christians live in
Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Just under half the local Christians are followers of the Pope _
either in the Roman Catholic or Greek Catholic, or Melkites,
churches. The rest are from eastern Orthodox churches, along with a
small number of Protestants.
</P>
<P>
   Jifna has gone from being all Christian to a mix of 800
Christians and 200 Muslims. About a thousand Christians from Jifna
now live in California. Salameh, a university lecturer in computer
science, says he feels a ``mission'' to remain.
</P>
<P>
   Other once-Christian towns have already become mostly Muslim,
including Bethlehem. Bethlehem residents claim there are more
Bethlehem Christians in Santiago, Chile, than the 20,000 or so
still here.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts give a number of reasons for their emigration. Like
other Palestinians, the Christians in the West Bank have faced
Israeli occupation that has choked off commerce and prompted
violent uprisings. Christians have more money and contacts abroad,
easing emigration.
</P>
<P>
   As an example of their bind between two stronger powers,
Christians in the Israeli city of Nazareth were infuriated last
year when Israel approved plans for a mosque near the plaza of the
Basilica of the Annunciation. The church is where tradition states
that the Virgin Mary was told she would give birth to the son of
God.
</P>
<P>
   It appeared that Muslim activists, staging weeks of protests,
had strong-armed the Israeli government over the objections of the
local Christians.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   While few Christians claim they are victims of official
persecution, they do claim that they have trouble getting jobs or
buying land from Muslims. Sometimes, they say, they are called
heretics, by Muslims. Meanwhile, with Jews, Christians say they
face the same barriers as other Arabs.
</P>
<P>
   The Pope is expected to urge Christians to maintain their
presence among their fellow Palestinians and the Holy sites.
Christians frequently say their religion's emphasis on love and
forgiveness is an important message for the Middle East. They worry
that their churches could become empty museums.
</P>
<P>
   ``The moral support is very important,'' said Jerusalem Greek
Catholic Archbishop Lutfi Laham. ``He will tell them, 'You have a
responsibility to your society.'''
</P>
<P>
   But some Christian Palestinians worry that a papal visit without
a strong pitch for Palestinian rights could anger their Muslim
neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need a strong statement from the Pope that will make it
clear that the people who are oppressed and living under occupation
are the Palestinians,'' said the Rev. Naim Ateek(CQ), a Protestant
Palestinian theologian. ``If the Pope does not do it, some of us
are going to be embarrassed.''
</P>
<P>
   Organizers of the visit appear intent on sensitivity toward the
Muslims. The Pope will visit the Dheisheh Refugee Camp in
Bethlehem, a neighborhood of 10,000 Muslims and no Christians.
</P>
<P>
   He will deliver a Mass on Bethlehem's Manger Square Wednesday,
which will likely coincide with the mid-day Muslim prayer time.
Officials organizing the event said Friday that they expect that
the Pope will pause when the mosque on the square broadcasts the
eight-minute call to prayer.

   MIDEAST-POPE-$ADV18 _ JERUSALEM _ Advancing Pope John Paul's
long-anticipated visit to the Holy Land the last 10 days of the
month. We take an in-depth look at what may be the last trip for
this pontif _ the most well-traveled pope ever, and the only pope
known to an entire generation. He is in failing health, and one
wonders if this is his mecca. What do Christians here think of his
coming? Are special preparations being made by the Israeli,
Jordanian and Palestinian governments? What places will he visit,
and why? (Kaplow).

Tequila. There are some 500 types and brands of the Mexican spirit
available here. As a result, wine-making has had a difficult time
taking off over the years. And when it did, the product was just
plain bad. But efforts to improve the quality of Mexico's wines
have begun paying off. With help from expert vintners from its
neighbor to the north _ California _ winemakers here are
experiencing a mini-boom. (Ferriss).

   RUSSIA-COMMUNISTS-$ADV19 _ TULA, Russia _ Despite the hype
surrounding Vladimir Putin, almost 50 percent of Russians are
expected to vote for other candidates in the upcoming presidential
elections. Twelve candidates are running in the race, and some of
the strongest opposition to Putin comes from the Communist Party
rank-and-file members, who disagree with Putin's views on relations
with the United States and on economic issues like land reform. In
a Communist bulwark town, regular Russians give their views about
politics and why they stand behind their man, candidate Gennady
Zyuganov. (Coker).

   GORE-WOMEN _ GORE-WOMEN _ WASHINGTON _ When Tipper Gore formally

last fall, she autographed a poster marking the state's
first-in-the-nation primary. ``The fun starts here. New Hampshire
rocks!'' she wrote. But the driving beat of the vice president's
campaign has come mostly from another brainy, beautiful blonde in
the family _ Al and Tipper's eldest daughter, Karenna Gore Schiff.

   TECH-FUTURE _ LOS ANGELES _ Americans participated in two great
migrations in the 20th century. First, they moved by the millions
from farms to cities, seeking jobs, and after World War II, they
moved again, this time from central cities to suburbs. In the new
century, yet another demographic pattern may emerge: immigrants and
young people will leave suburbs everywhere to find work in the
nation's booming high-tech clusters. Certain states, including
California, Texas, New York, Florida and Georgia, will get a surge
of growth from Asians, Hispanics and others seeking jobs, while the
majority will become relatively whiter, older and less prosperous.
Will we become, in essence, two countries, one old, white and
slow-growing and the other younger, multicultural and more
entrepreneurial? (Geewax).

   BOTBALL _ RESTON, Va. _ At first glance, the pre-teens and

But to the high-tech firms that pick up the tab for the regional
and national ``botball'' competitions, they're something far more
valuable: potential employees. In a mix of altruism and need for an
educable work force, high tech firms are trying to influence
students' interests and choices at a younger and younger age. The
finals will be in Austin. (Mollison).

to suddenly scrap plans to build a new salt mining factory on the

it would not harm the whales. (Ferriss).

Russia for the United States: Billions of dollars in direct, and

   AFRICA-AIDSORPHANS-$ADV26 _ ZIMBABWE _ In sub-Saharan Africa,
23.3 million people _ most of them women _ are infected with
HIV/AIDS, compared to less than 1 million in North America. There
were 2.2 million deaths from AIDS in the region in 1999 _
representing 85 percent of the world's HIV-related fatalities, even
though only 10 percent of the world's population lives in the
region. Efforts to stop the disease's progress have been largely
futile and few Africans can afford treatments more readily
available in the West, such as AZT. Cultural and religious issues
also prove thorny. The disease is destroying entire villages, but
beyond that is robbing these countries of a whole generation of
potentially productive people. Perhaps the most grim by-product is
the staggering fact that the disease has created more than 10
million orphans a number that is expected to soar to 13 million
next year. The implications of this are devastating. (Roughton).

   WIRED-CITY _ SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. _ The future is being carved from
a piece of Arizona desert. A new subdivision taking shape near
Phoenix is the most wired community in America. Across the country,
real-estate developers and architects are collaborating on new
neighborhoods with high-speed wiring built into the homes. The
broadband information and entertainment access is designed for
telecommuters and destined to change the way we live. At the DC
Ranch development here, the town has its own Intranet that allows
homeowners to reserve a community tennis court, set a scout meeting
on the community calendar and check their kids' grades. The
technology is intended to create a strong sense of community, not
isolate the homeowners, the developer says. (Holmes).

   AFRICA-HUNGER-$ADV01 _ NIGERIA _ One of the fundamental issues
hindering Africa's development is inadequate agricultural
production. Many nongovernmental organizations are trying to
address this with programs intended to teach farmers methods to
increase their yields. The Carter Center's Global 2000, in
partnership with the Japanese Sasakawa Africa Association, has
helped started hundreds of small-scale farm programs that have
increased crop yields by 200 percent to 300 percent by applying
technologies and materials already available in Africa. But the
programs are fragile propositions that rely on often unpredictable
governments fighting military and paramilitary factions to provide
a window in which they can work. (Roughton).

   UNIVERSE _ WASHINGTON _ Almost every day, an explosion of
unimaginable cataclysm occurs somewhere in the universe and a burst
of gamma rays lasting only a few seconds reaches the Earth.
Discovered in the 1960s by military satellites deployed to watch
for nuclear explosions, the gamma ray bursts are over before
telescopes on the Earth or in orbit can detect anything more than a
faint afterglow. Yet, for a few seconds they seem to represent a
flash of energy greater than that of an entire galaxy. NASA is
building a satellite that will be able to detect the flashes from
``the corner of its eye'' and wheel around in a few seconds to take
a closer look. (Nesmith).

 &HT;    Paradigm lost
 &HT;    By Bill Hendrick
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CORTADERAS CAMP, Argentina _ In science, truth is what
scientists manage to agree it is.
</P>
<P>
   A case in point, which tangentially involves Atlanta's Fernbank
Museum of Natural History: Conventional wisdom has long held that
giant meat-eating dinosaurs like Tyrannosaurus rex operated pretty
much on instinct. They fed themselves about as automatically as,
say, Venus' flytraps _ and with the same social skills.
</P>
<P>
   But maybe not. Contrary evidence comes from a dig here in the
Argentine desert, sustained in part by the $1.25 million Fernbank
is paying for models of two giant fossilized dino skeletons
unearthed nearby. Paleontologists Phil Currie and Rodolfo Coria
have found new evidence that giant meat-eating dinosaurs weren't as
dumb as we've thought. They were apparently smart enough to live in
family groups, with adults nurturing their young.
</P>
<P>
   Although this finding may be of fleeting interest to non-dino
buffs, Currie and Coria's theory is a major concern within
paleontology. A scientific truth may be undone.
</P>
<P>
   ``This falls into the category of a paradigm shift,'' declares
Currie, of Canada's Royal Tyrrell Museum.
</P>
<P>
   It will probably take a couple of years before we know for sure.
In the deliberate _ and sometimes petty _ scientific community,
paradigms almost never turn on a dime. Modern research is based on
the cold objectivity of the scientific method: Theories are
proposed and evidence proves them correct or not. But finding
consensus on what that research means remains a more subjective
political process, in which old truths sometimes hang on
tenaciously before giving way.
</P>
<P>
   How many findings must Currie and Coria demonstrate to prove
their theory? There is no right answer; other scientists will
decide. Before the theory is accepted, the pair must present their
research to other paleontologists at a scientific conference, where
their ideas will be analyzed and questioned. And they'll have to
publish their work in a respected journal, which will print it only
after a review panel of other prominent scientists agrees that the
research is sound.
</P>
<P>
   This system, called ``peer review,'' is designed to weed out
phony claims and misguided theorizing _ which it often does.
Remember ``cold fusion''? In March 1989, two chemists from the
University of Utah announced at a news conference what seemed like
the discovery of the century. They said they'd found an inexpensive
and clean way to produce virtually unlimited amounts of energy,
through nuclear fusion reactions. When their claims were subjected
to peer review, other scientists soon found the experiments
couldn't be replicated. Soon the term ``cold fusion'' had become a
joke.
</P>
<P>
   The system, however, can also slow recognition of good ideas,
says Lester Stephens, a science historian at the University of
Georgia. Peer panels often include scientists who've spent a
lifetime developing their own points of view, which may be
threatened by a new theory. And sometimes personality comes into
play. If a scientist is unpopular or unknown, a new theory is more
likely to be questioned.
</P>
<P>
   ``Issues like personality, envy, authority are likely to be
relevant to why scientists come to believe what they do,'' says
Steven Shapin, a science historian at the University of
California-San Diego. ``It's a very fuzzy, complicated, messy
picture.''
</P>
<P>
   Some truths have been delayed for many years.
</P>
<P>
   _ In 1837, Louis Agassiz concluded that there must have been an
ice age. This meant that glaciers, not the great flood of the
Bible, might have moved rocks around. Colleagues, however, were not
convinced. It took more than 30 years before Agassiz was
vindicated, his theory accepted.
</P>
<P>
   _ In the 1860s, Gregor Mendel, having discovered recessive
genes, proposed what was to become the basis for modern genetics
theory. But his writings were pooh-poohed. Only in 1900, after
Mendel's death, was the work rediscovered and given credence.
</P>
<P>
   _ In the early 20th century, Alfred Wegener theorized that all
the continents had long ago been part of a single land mass. But
conventional wisdom _ that the continents were a permanent feature
of the Earth's crust _ held until the 1960s, decades after Wegener
had died. Today, the ``continental drift'' theory is widely held.
</P>
<P>
   'ANTEDILUVIAN MONSTERS'
</P>
<P>
   New truths do tend to break through, even if old ones sometimes
get in the way. As with most branches of science, paleontology has
accepted dramatic paradigm shifts in the past 200 years.
</P>
<P>
   Until the mid-19th century, dinosaur fossils were thought to
have been the remains of ``antediluvian monsters,'' animals Noah
couldn't fit on his ark. Or perhaps the remains of trolls and
dragons.
</P>
<P>
   As late as the mid-1960s, conventional wisdom held that
dinosaurs were reptiles. Now it's accepted by most scientists that
dinos were direct ancestors of modern birds, and only distant
cousins of reptiles. But just last month in the journal Science,
two biologists said new findings cast doubt on the dino-bird
theory, and debate is raging anew.
</P>
<P>
   On the issue of behavior of carnivorous dinosaurs, conventional
wisdom has held that only smaller dinos cooperated with each other.
Not so Tyrannosaurus rex and the even-larger Giganotosaurus (one of
the dinos whose skeletons will be permanently displayed at
Fernbank, starting this year), which have been considered too dumb
to cooperate.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1997, Currie and his Argentine colleague Coria found the
fossils of a group of T. rexes that had died together in Canada.
They found no bones from other dinos at the site.
</P>
<P>
   If the animals had been eating when they were killed, bones of
their victims would have been found. Had the animals died
separately in a flood that washed their bones into a common grave,
the water also would have killed and buried many other creatures in
the same place. The discovery seemed to say that the T. rexes had
been a social group or family.
</P>
<P>
   Then in 1998 Coria found a new species of meat-eater in the
Argentine desert. Yet to be named, the dino was even larger than
the Giganotosaurus. More important for the pack theory, it was
found in a group: six or seven of the animals, including at least
three juveniles, at the same site.
</P>
<P>
   They'd all died together. Again, there were no bones of other
creatures in the boneyard, a strong clue that the animals were
traveling in a pack or resting when they were killed suddenly,
perhaps by a muddy flash flood. The presence of young dinos
suggests the pack was a family.
</P>
<P>
   ``They clustered together for some reason,'' Currie says.
``Science always works on laws of probabilities. The odds of this
grouping of six dinosaurs, including two juveniles, teenagers of
sorts, and one that's even smaller, are so minuscule it's almost
impossible unless it was a family group.''
</P>
<P>
   He speculates that the giant meat-eaters, like lions, cooperated
when hunting, perhaps with the youngsters scooting along to cut a
huge plant-eater out of a galloping herd to make it easier prey for
stronger adults.
</P>
<P>
   MORE PROOF OFTEN KEY
</P>
<P>
   Other prominent paleontologists seem receptive to the new
theory.
</P>
<P>
   Karl Flessa of the University of Arizona, past president of the
Paleontological Society, says the latest find ``could be evidence
that these dinosaurs had `family values' _ that is, they cared for
their young during some part of their growth and development. This
will get people's attention.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Holtz Jr. of the University of Maryland, one of the
world's leading specialists on giant meat-eaters, agrees. ``What's
going on in the field now looks like a paradigm shift,'' he says.
``We can conceive of smaller pack-hunters because we have them
today in lions and wolves. But the idea of carnivores bigger than
elephants living in groups seems truly bizarre and weird.''
</P>
<P>
   Currie and Coria's evidence is strong, he says, and the
implications are important.
</P>
<P>
   ``What this means is that these big animals may not have been as
stupid as thought,'' Holtz says. ``Although they wouldn't have been
as smart as modern birds or mammals, dinosaurs _ and carnivores in
particular _ were probably a lot smarter than modern lizards or
crocodiles, so there could have been a certain amount of
communication between each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the paradigm hasn't fully shifted just yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``The concentration of bones certainly suggests there was a
group behavior,'' allows Paul Sereno of the University of Chicago,
but he would like to see more similar finds before science can
``solve decisively'' the question.
</P>
<P>
   That's a common refrain in establishing scientific truths: Give
us more proof, says Robert Silliman, a science historian at Emory
University. Scientists are conservative about shifting paradigms
and ``not really on the lookout for novelty,'' Silliman says.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, as with cold fusion, this caution is healthy. But
other times, Silliman says, worthy theories can be held back
because of biases in favor of accepted beliefs, some of which the
critics may have authored.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a kind of pressure cooker,'' he says of the search for
scientific truth, ``with different forces pushing you to go forward
or hold back. You can get out on a limb and have it sawed off if
you're not careful.''
</P>
<P>
   It's one thing to discover a new comet; that can be easily
verified. It's another to deduce behavior of creatures that lived
millions of years ago. So Currie and Coria will have to argue
effectively when they circulate their theory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Scientists who arrive at truths still have the job of making
the truth credible or believable to other scientists in their
field,'' says Shapin of the University of California-San Diego.
``That means no matter how certain they are, they have got to use
rhetoric, persuasion, any influence that's available to them to
persuade people that what they believe to be true is true.''
</P>
<P>
   If that sounds a lot like politics, it can be. And as with
politics, in scientific persuasion, money plays a role.
</P>
<P>
   The New England Journal of Medicine, for example, is one of the
most prestigious medical journals in the world. Ideas that are
published there are generally nearing the truth stage in scientific
politics.
</P>
<P>
   But the journal is not free of conflicts of interest. On Feb.
23, after being exposed by the Los Angeles Times, it admitted that
it had violated its own ethical rules by publishing articles from
authors linked financially to the drug companies whose products
they reviewed _ without acknowledging those interests.
</P>
<P>
   The journal's editors said such lapses occurred 19 times in
three years. The articles in question focused on AIDS, hair loss,
breast cancer, diabetes, alcoholism and
attention-deficit-hyperactivity disorder. The journal promises to
be more careful about disclosures of conflicts, but even so, much
of the published research will continue to be funded by
corporations that seek to profit by it.
</P>
<P>
   Money and politics intersect with science in other ways, too.
Because there's never enough funding for everything that scientists
want to study _ it's estimated, for example, that less than $1
million a year is spent worldwide on paleontological digs _ some
feel they must ``hype'' their theories to garner the attention
needed to get funds, says Ronald Numbers, a science historian at
the University of Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   ``More and more,'' Numbers says, ``scientists have shown the
importance of rhetoric, how you go about persuading people why you
should be believed over others, especially since most people aren't
going to go out and do the observation themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   BATTLE WITH END IN SIGHT
</P>
<P>
   To judge by the informal comments from paleontologists, Currie
and Coria's proposal seems likely to become a truth. A theory that
big carnivorous dinos traveled in packs or families ``isn't likely
to be one of those battles that goes on forever,'' says Ed Larson,
a Pulitzer Prize-winning historian at the University of Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after Currie and Coria publish their findings in a major
scientific journal, he predicts, ``pack-hunting of dinosaurs will
make news in every newspaper in the Western world.''
</P>
<P>
   Acceptance of the theory ``doesn't require that every last
scientist agrees with the new interpretation,'' says Flessa of
Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Or at least it shouldn't. Considering the potential messiness of
the system, Flessa jokes, ``Cynics will tell you that a new truth
is established when the last supporter of the old interpretation
has died.''

 &HT;    Zen in the wind
 &HT;    By Chris Riemenschneider
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Jimmie Dale Gilmore won't have many more
weekends at home this year, what with the recent release of his
``One Endless Night'' CD and the miles that must be put in to prove
its magnificence.
</P>
<P>
   The 54-year-old singer hasn't released a new album in four years
and has never put one out on his own label, a tactic that can
either prove independence _ like John Prine _ or blur one's
visibility, as it did for the former Prince.
</P>
<P>
   So Gilmore and his wife, Janet, are making the most of this
Friday evening at their modest, porch-wrapped house on five acres
west of town. They've planned a family night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone's coming over at 8,'' Gilmore tells his son, Colin,
25, who has just arrived. ``We're just having pasta, something
easy.''
</P>
<P>
   Not so easy is trying to pin down the lineage of Gilmore's
family. The Texas music legend has three kids, including two
daughters, none of whom have the same mother and all of whom came
before Jimmie met Janet 16 years ago. Sounds like a regular country
song, don't it? But like so many other unconventionalities in
Gilmore's life, he somehow makes it work.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a lot of fun,'' Gilmore says, seated at the
Spanish-tile table in his kitchen and beaming proudly, like he's
just another dad. ``Colin just graduated from Southwest Texas,'' he
says. ``He studied music, so he has a much better understanding of
the technical aspects of it than I do. He just started writing
songs, too, and I tell you, I think he's got it. I had him play
some songs for Butch and Joe, and I really think they were as
impressed as I was.''
</P>
<P>
   Butch and Joe, of course, are Butch Hancock and Joe Ely,
Gilmore's band mates in the short-lived Flatlanders, who have
performed a couple of dozen shows together over the last month and
are flirting with a reunion run. Together, they embody the holy
trinity of Texas music. Hancock was the songwriting troubadour.
Ely, the stalwart live performer. And Gilmore. ...
</P>
<P>
   Well, for one, he's often credited as the true singer of the
bunch, with his warbling, lonesome voice, an echo of the Texas
Panhandle wind of his youth. That voice is truly at its peak on
``One Endless Night,'' in near-operatic covers of Walter Hyatt's
``Georgia Rose,'' Willis Alan Ramsey's ``Goodbye Old Missoula'' and
more.
</P>
<P>
   But the quality Gilmore truly brings to the Flatlanders myth,
and that shows throughout Texas' caldron of great performers, is
his deep well of independent spirit.
</P>
<P>
   Gilmore ignores radio formats and hops from one musical style to
another like a jack rabbit finding oasis after oasis in the desert.
He makes the records he wants to make, and for that, he's a hero.
Not just in Texas, either: He earned one Grammy nomination in the
hip ``contemporary folk'' category for 1991's ``After Awhile''
album; he was voted best country artist two years running in
Rolling Stone magazine; he even fell in with the '90s college-rock
crowd, collaborating with Natalie Merchant in her 10,000 Maniacs
days and Mudhoney at the height of the Seattle grunge craze.
</P>
<P>
   As Ely recently said about Gilmore, ``You're never exactly sure
what musical can of worms Jimmie's going to bring to the table.''
</P>
<P>
   Jimmie Dale Gilmore is one of a kind, and there are all kinds of
ways he can present himself. That's never been more evident than
with the new album.
</P>
<P>
   From a straight-ahead country cover of the Grateful Dead's
``Ripple'' to a rollicking, bluesy cut of Townes Van Zandt's ``No
Lonesome Tune'' to the ethereal, haunting rendition of the
Weill/Brecht standard ``Mack the Knife'' _ the latter offering the
so-called Zen-country sound that Gilmore has refined on his own _
``One Endless Night'' is as seemingly conflicted as any of the
singer's five other solo albums.
</P>
<P>
   For Gilmore, mixing so many musical genres comes as easily as
pressing the puree button on a blender. ``I'm tagged a country
artist because of my voice, but really, I enjoy blues, folk and
rock 'n' roll just as much,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was playing, like, five nights a week around Austin (in
the early '80s), my set wouldn't really change whether I was
playing emmajoe's, the Broken Spoke, the Hole in the Wall or La
Zona Rosa, all very different clubs. Sometimes I would be playing
country music to rock 'n' roll people who had never heard it, and
sometimes it was the opposite, but it never mattered to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Gilmore actually started picking his guitar in Austin on
extended stays in the late '60s, before acts like Willie Nelson,
Doug Sahm and Asleep at the Wheel landed here permanently.
</P>
<P>
   At the height of Austin's cosmic cowboy scene in the latter half
of the '70s, Gilmore was away leading a life that, to many who
heard about it, truly seemed out in the cosmos. He spent six years
in an ashram, having been introduced to Eastern religion during his
short-lived stint as a philosophy student at Texas Tech University.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though I really am sort of a skeptic and rationalist,
I've always had a leaning toward mysticism, and Eastern religion
really appealed to that,'' Gilmore explained.
</P>
<P>
   When he left for Colorado, his life had already had its ups and
downs. His first, brief marriage to Jo Carol Pierce _ now a
well-known songwriter and playwright in Austin _ had deteriorated.
His stint with the Flatlanders didn't fare much better. Once he
turned full time to religion, Gilmore had all but given up music as
anything but a hobby.
</P>
<P>
   In 1980, Gilmore found a balance between religion and music and
returned to Austin. He gigged steadily until he finally released
back-to-back albums in 1988-89 on the Hightone record label. These
discs limited him to traditional country sounds. It wasn't until
his first record through the giant Elektra Records, ``After
Awhile,'' that his records showed a blend of edgier country, folk
and blues, thus permanently tagging Gilmore a critic's darling and
giving him a cult following worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   Musically, Gilmore grew even bigger and bolder on his next two
albums with Elektra. The 1993 gem ``Spinning Around the Sun'' _
Gilmore's best seller with just under 100,000 copies sold _ was
produced by Elvis accomplice Emory Gordy Jr. and featured a finely
orchestrated, decidedly classic sound. For 1996's ``Braver, Newer
World,'' Gilmore recruited avant-garde record producer T Bone
Burnett to craft a wild mix of experimental country and even a few
all-out rock tunes. But the album wouldn't sell half of what
``Spinning'' did.
</P>
<P>
   ``I learned so much about the recording process with that
record,'' Gilmore said, ``and I used a lot of what I learned for
this record.''Though a return to ``After Awhile's'' rootsier sound,
``One Endless Night'' is still far from a standard Gilmore album.
</P>
<P>
   First of all, only three of its 13 songs were written by
Gilmore. Though a proven songwriter with classics including
``Dallas,'' ``Tonight I Think I'm Gonna Go Downtown'' and ``Treat
Me Like a Saturday Night,'' the singer instead turned to some of
his favorite tunesmiths, including others such as John Hiatt, Jesse
Winchester, Hal Ketchum, David Hammond and, as always, Butch
Hancock.
</P>
<P>
   Explained Gilmore, ``A lot of people think of me as a
songwriter, but I primarily think of myself as a singer. I've
always been prone to sing whatever songs I like, whether I wrote
them or not....I'm not real prolific, but I do have enough new
songs to make an album of all-new material. This time, that just
wasn't what I wanted to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Another thing Gilmore didn't want to do was make another CD for
Elektra, or any major record label. His previous three albums
produced modest profits, but not the kind that encourage big
companies to focus on the artist. Though Elektra reps wanted
Gilmore to remain with them, he turned down the option, in pursuit
of yet more individuality.
</P>
<P>
   Even the folks at Elektra admit the move might have been to
Gilmore's advantage. ``Everybody here loved him, but sometimes
artists as pure as Jimmie deserve more attention than we're able to
give them,'' said Elektra's vice-president of publicity, Joel
Amsterdam, adding a no-hard-feelings bonus that the new album ``may
be the best that he's ever done.''
</P>
<P>
   Gilmore's longtime manager Mike Crowley thinks so, too. He
gambled his own money and time on co-creating the Windcharger Music
label with Gilmore, which is releasing ``One Endless Night.''
Though record companies smaller than Elektra such as Rykodisc and
Nonesuch jumped at the chance to sign Gilmore, the artist and his
manager paid for the album on their own. Eventually, a modest
distribution deal was struck with well-established Massachusetts
indie Rounder Records, but only after the album was finished.
</P>
<P>
   Though they eventually plan on a strong Internet sales base,
immediate plans to support ``One Endless Night'' call for the
typical touring jaunts to night clubs everywhere. Band members this
go-round include guitarists Rob Gjersoe and Chris Gage, backup
singer Christine Albert and bassist Brad Fordham. That's right,
there will be no drummer, and since it's Jimmie Dale Gilmore we're
talking about, there's no real point in asking why not.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I've always liked it when people called my music
experimental or unconventional,'' Gilmore said. ``Maybe they won't
say that so much about the music on this one, but I'll be just as
happy if they say it about my approach to the music business.''

   TAIWAN-LEE (Taipei, Taiwan) _ ``He betrayed Taiwan!'' ``He's a

native Taiwanese majority, who engineered Taiwan's first direct
elections for president and who bravely asserted the island's
separate identity against a hostile mainland China. By Erik
Eckholm.

   TAIWAN-ASSESS (Taipei, Taiwan) _ Analysis of the vote in Taiwan:
How nervous is Washington? By David E. Sanger.
</P>
<P>
   TAIWAN-CHINA (Beijing) _ As Beijing's leaders continued their
silence on Chen Shui-bian's victory in Taiwan, many Chinese people
mulled over a result they found shocking: Taiwan had chosen the
independence party, if not independence. The idea that Taiwan will
inevitably reunite with the mainland is one of the most emotional,
deeply held beliefs of ordinary Chinese. But Chen's upset victory
forced many Chinese to reflect for the first time on the depth of
their conviction, pitting their abstract belief against their
personal self-interest, since war would mean renewed hardship. By
Elisabeth Rosenthal.

<P>
   POPE-SECURITY (Jerusalem) _ While the religious and political
dimensions of the pope's six-day trip here are large, the
logistical and security preparations by both Israel and the
Palestinian Authority are unprecedented. The visit also requires an
unparalleled cooperation between the two governments, which so far,
despite the minor sniping of Jerusalem officials on both sides, has
gone very smoothly. Both sides are united by their joint
determination to avert trouble and avoid embarrassment. By Deborah
Sontag.
</P>
<P>
   BANGLADESH-U.S. (Dhaka, Bangladesh) _ Three decades after
Bangladesh's difficult birth after a war of independence against
Pakistan, it remains one of the world's poorest nations. A million
villagers each year lose their homes to fickle rivers that engulf
their land. Democracy suffers prolonged malfunctions, in part
because the two women who run the main political parties hate each
other down to the bone. And yet, in most ways Bangladesh now is
decidedly in less of a mess, with the poverty rate drifting down
and economic growth rates inching up. Indeed, many here fear that
President Clinton is coming not just to shake hands but to pick
pockets. It seems that Bangladesh may be sitting on a small fortune
in natural gas. By Barry Bearak.

<P>
   INDIA-CLINTON (New Delhi, India) _ President Clinton,
accompanied by his daughter, Chelsea, arrived to a low key welcome
here Sunday night for a state visit that the administration hopes
will set the foundation for a new relationship with India. Clinton
is the first American president to visit India in 22 years, and the
last visit by President Carter _ who made some unflattering remarks
about the government before an open microphone _ did not go so
smoothly. This time, and with those memories faded, both sides
appear determined to make a good impression on each other. By Jane
Perlez.
</P>
<P>
   PRAGUE-CEMETERY (Prague, Czech Republic) _ A rare archaeological
discovery has turned into a political and moral quandary for the
Czech government. What to do with the remnants of a medieval Jewish
cemetery in downtown Prague _ how to acknowledge the needs of
modernity while respecting the dead _ has become an issue the Czech
government will take up this week. What began as a construction
project for an insurance company has turned into a confusing,
hurtful and emotional battle between the Czechs and a large number
of Jews around the world. By Steven Erlanger.
</P>
<P>
   ISRAEL-SHAS (Jerusalem) _ The furor over the Shas Party's attack
on the education minister for including a Palestinian poet in the
school curriculum has escalated into a major battle. By Deborah
Sontag.

<P>
   AIR-TRAFFIC-COMPUTER (Memphis, Tenn.) _ As the FAA and the
airlines prepare, with some dread, for another busy summer, when
there are more planes in the sky and more thunderstorms to skirt
around, the Memphis airport is counting on a new computerized
system that allows a controller to study a much broader swath of
sky and test new routes with a few mouse clicks. By Matthew L.
Wald.
</P>
<P>
   WACO-REENACT (Waco, Texas) _ The government's credibility will
be put to the test this weekend when critical portions of the 1993
assault at Waco are re-enacted on Sunday at a military base with
tanks, a helicopter and camouflaged gunmen. The re-creation could
challenge the government's unequivocal assertion that federal
agents fired no shots at the Branch Davidian compound in the final
hours of the 51-day siege. By Jim Yardley.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; POLITICS &LR;  (Moving in ``p'' news file.)
</P>
<P>
   BUSH-REFORMER (Austin, Texas) _ With the long march to November
under way, Gov. George W. Bush is arguing that his record in Texas
proves he is best suited to bring reform to Washington. He has even
coined a campaign slogan: ``A Reformer with Results.'' Without
question, Bush has been a popular governor, yet few Texans would
describe him as a reformer. By Richard A. Oppel Jr. and Jim Yardley
</P>
<P>
   REPUBS-ROTH (Wilmington, Del.) _ As chairman of the Senate
Finance Committee, Bill Roth is shepherding some of the Hill's
hottest issues this year, from China trade to taxes to health care.
He's a rare Republican who's made a career of working with
Democrats to get things done. But at 79 and facing a stiff
re-election fight from Delaware's popular Democratic governor, Tom
Carper, Roth is one the GOP's most vulnerable incumbents. By Eric
Schmitt.

   McCAIN-SENATE (Washington) _ John McCain returns to the Senate

   NRA-STRATEGY (Washington) _ Why is the NRA talking so tough,
when it only seems to hurt them in political circles? It may be
because it draws more and more gun owners into their ranks. By Marc
Lacey.

<P>
   SCOTUS-RETURN (Washington) _ With more than three months to go

concentrated period of unusual intensity and potential import. The

Greenhouse.

   TV-NOTEBOOK (New York) _ After years of whining that they have
to do something different to prevent more viewers from deserting to
cable, the networks are finally trying to figure out what. The new
gimmicks being used are sometimes stylistic and sometimes a matter
of scheduling, but all smack of the desperate need to escape a
self-defeating, business-as-usual attitude. This is the season the
old formulas finally crashed. But where is the line between a

   EUROPE-ARTFAIR (Maastricht, Netherlands) _ When the doors to the
European Fine Art Fair opened here on Friday afternoon, the 198
exhibitors were all smiles, eager to talk about the prized
offerings they were placing before some 8,200 visitors who poured
into the convention center where the fair is held every March. But
beneath the polite banter, the atmosphere at this, the world's
largest art fair, was politically charged. Talk of the unfolding
federal antitrust investigation of auction houses in New York was
everywhere, and with it speculation about the increase the biggest
of the houses, Sotheby's and Christie's, plan to charge buyers. The

PROMOTION DISPUTE WITH WWF JEOPARDIZES FILM
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ The world of documentary filmmaking and the world of
professional wrestling do not often come together, but it might be
expected that if they did, there would be a fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Beyond the Mat,'' a documentary that tries to put a human face
on the larger-than-life characters who make their livings in the
middle and lower ranks of pro wrestling, opened on March 17 on 300
movie screens in 50 cities around the country. But prospects for
the film were greatly diminished, the film's producers say, after a
decision by the World Wrestling Federation not to allow any
television advertising for the documentary during any of the pro
wrestling group's programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vince McMahon, who runs the WWF, is an amazing business guy,
and he's done a remarkable thing with his organization, but this is
kind of the way he does business,'' said Ron Howard, co-founder of
Imagine Entertainment, which produced the documentary in
conjunction with Universal Pictures. ``He wants to totally dominate
and control anything that has anything to do with wrestling.''
</P>
<P>
   Barry W. Blaustein, who made ``Beyond the Mat,'' is best known
as the screenwriter for several Eddie Murphy comedies, including
``The Nutty Professor'' and ``Coming to America.'' The wrestling
film was a five-year labor of love, Blaustein said. In the film,
such pro wrestling luminaries as Mick Foley, who wrestles under the
name Mankind, and Jake Roberts, known as Jake the Snake, talk
candidly about their love of wrestling but also about the physical
and emotional toll it takes on them and their families.
</P>
<P>
   What makes all this so surprising to the filmmakers is that
McMahon and the WWF cooperated in the filming of the documentary,
and McMahon appears prominently in it along with several wrestlers.
Lions Gate Films, which is distributing ``Beyond the Mat'' in North
America, had signed contracts with the WWF to allow ads for the
movie during WWF programs and was not told until the day the spots
were to begin running, two weeks ago, that they would not be
allowed on the air during the wrestling shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never could get a straight answer about why they were doing
this,'' said Tom Ortenberg, co-president of Lions Gate. ``The truth
is, Vince always thought he'd be able to buy the film, and I
believe, when he was ultimately rebuffed, is when he turned on the
film.''
</P>
<P>
   Jim Byrne, senior vice president of marketing for World
Wrestling Federation Entertainment, said that, yes, the company did
refuse to broadcast the ads, but only because they violated a
long-standing WWF policy not to include any ``third-party wrestling
product'' in the WWF's shows. The ads were rejected shortly after
they were presented to the WWF, Byrne said, as is common practice
in television, even if contracts had previously been signed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just recently, we bought a Super Bowl commercial, and they
rejected it _ the very same sort of thing,'' Byrne said. ``It's
very commonplace. You wouldn't put out a press release about it,
unless you were trying to promote a movie.''
</P>
<P>
   Ortenberg said the filmmakers were puzzled.
</P>
<P>
   Howard said he suspected that McMahon had two motives for
rejecting the ads. After the attempt to invest in the film was
rejected, McMahon wanted to make sure no one had a success with pro
wrestling that did not include the WWF. ``He is just trying to
prove his point, to shut down the film,'' Howard said. But also,
Howard suspects, McMahon objects to the way the wrestlers are
presented, as real people rather than as mythic cartoon characters.
</P>
<P>
   ``What Vince McMahon doesn't seem to understand is that the film
is a love letter to wrestling,'' Ortenberg said. ``If the film were
successful, it would do much more for the WWF than it would do for
us.''
</P>
<P>
   It is true, Byrne said, that at one time McMahon wanted to buy
an interest in the film, but he denied that there was any
coordinated campaign of revenge against it. ``This all is just
completely a publicity stunt,'' Byrne said.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview this month with The Los Angeles Times, McMahon
was quoted as saying that ``we feel cheated that we have no equity
in the movie.'' But in an interview late last week, Byrne put a
different spin on it. The WWF's interest in buying part of the film
came before it was finished. After McMahon had seen the finished
film, he didn't like it and was relieved he had not invested in it,
Byrne said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just didn't find it entertaining,'' he said. ``Even though
we were denied the opportunity to participate, we probably would
have dropped the offer once we'd screened it, anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Without access to the most popular pro wrestling programs on
television, Lions Gate said it would have trouble connecting the
film with its most obvious audience. Ads will be shown on other pro
wrestling shows put on by some of the WWF's competitors as well as
on some cable channels and local radio stations with demographics
that include a high concentration of wrestling fans, but it is all
very expensive, difficult and imprecise, Ortenberg said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone in the pro wrestling world outside of Vince McMahon
has been hugely supportive, including many of the Internet pro
wrestling sites, so we're maximizing all of the promotional and
marketing opportunities that we can,'' he said. ``We are trying to
make lemonade out of lemons.''

 &HT;    SECURITY CONCERNS CAUSE CLINTON TO CANCEL VISIT TO BANGLADESH
VILLAGE
 &HT;    (600&AMP;ADD)
 &HT;    Moving in both (i) International and (w) Washington categories.
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS 
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW DELHI _ President Bill Clinton's week-long swing through
India, Bangladesh and Pakistan got off to a sour start Sunday, when
security risks forced him to scrub a planned visit to a village in
Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
   The stop at Joypura, where Clinton had hoped to visit with
villagers benefitting from U.S. assistance in health, education and
development programs, was to have been the centerpiece of the
president's program for Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday night, though, two hours after Clinton arrived in New
Delhi, White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said in a prepared
statement that the president would not be going to Joypura, a
picturesque and impoverished hamlet 20 miles outside of the capital
city of Dhaka, ``because of concerns raised by the Secret
Service.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a rocky start for Clinton's visit, the first by a U.S.
president to the Indian subcontinent since Jimmy Carter's trip to
India in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was still planning to go to Dhaka to meet with Prime
Minister Sheikh Hasina, becoming the first American president to
visit Bangladesh since the country of 128 million won its
independence from Pakistan in 1971.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials declined to elaborate on the cancellation.
Scrapping a scheduled stop, though, is unusual. As a matter of
practice, Secret Service agents preview prospective sites of
presidential visits well in advance of the actual visit.
</P>
<P>
   Bangladesh, a deeply impoverished and overwhelmingly Islamic
country, is plagued with a high level of politically-motivated
violence, including bombings and assassinations. Several dozen
people were killed in politically linked violence last year,
including two ruling-party workers who were making bombs at the
residence of a member of parliament.
</P>
<P>
   In 1975, army officers assassinated Prime Minister Sheikh
Mujibur Rahman and most of his family. His daughter, who happened
to be out of the country at the time, is the current prime
minister, Sheikh Hasina.
</P>
<P>
   Against that background, the idea of flying Clinton in the
presidential helicopter over the tropical forests and rice paddies
surrounding the village, was not on, the Secret Service concluded.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton arrived here Sunday night on the first leg of his tour
of the Indian subcontinent, hoping to defuse regional tensions and
tamp down a dangerous nuclear arms race.
</P>
<P>
   With daughter Chelsea holding onto his left arm, Clinton stepped
out of Air Force One and waved, as workers scrambled to finish
painting walls, repairing pock-marked roads and otherwise sprucing
up the city in anticipation of the visit.
</P>
<P>
   First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, engaged in a tight U.S.
Senate race in New York, is not on the trip. But her mother,
Dorothy Rodham, is.
</P>
<P>
   With no official activities on his schedule Sunday night,
Clinton told reporters he was headed to a restaurant in his
five-star hotel for dinner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love Indian food,'' he told reporters traveling with him
aboard the presidential aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   He came bearing gifts: nearly $200 million in aid meant to help
fight hunger, expand schools for children and clean up the
environment. Most of the aid will target Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
   The assistance consists of:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  $97 million worth of wheat and soybean oil, to be given to
Bangladesh to be used as pay to workers for such things as
repairing schools, building latrines and digging wells;
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  $84 million to Bangladesh, India and Nepal to promote clean
and renewable energy technologies and the use of natural gas.
</P>

 &HT;    SECURITY CONCERNS CAUSE CLINTON TO CANCEL VISIT TO BANGLADESH
VILLAGE
 &HT;    (600&AMP;ADD)
 &HT;    Moving in both (i) International and (w) Washington categories.
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS 
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW DELHI _ President Bill Clinton's week-long swing through
India, Bangladesh and Pakistan got off to a sour start Sunday, when
security risks forced him to scrub a planned visit to a village in
Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
   The stop at Joypura, where Clinton had hoped to visit with
villagers benefitting from U.S. assistance in health, education and
development programs, was to have been the centerpiece of the
president's program for Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday night, though, two hours after Clinton arrived in New
Delhi, White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said in a prepared
statement that the president would not be going to Joypura, a
picturesque and impoverished hamlet 20 miles outside of the capital
city of Dhaka, ``because of concerns raised by the Secret
Service.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a rocky start for Clinton's visit, the first by a U.S.
president to the Indian subcontinent since Jimmy Carter's trip to
India in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was still planning to go to Dhaka to meet with Prime
Minister Sheikh Hasina, becoming the first American president to
visit Bangladesh since the country of 128 million won its
independence from Pakistan in 1971.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials declined to elaborate on the cancellation.
Scrapping a scheduled stop, though, is unusual. As a matter of
practice, Secret Service agents preview prospective sites of
presidential visits well in advance of the actual visit.
</P>
<P>
   Bangladesh, a deeply impoverished and overwhelmingly Islamic
country, is plagued with a high level of politically-motivated
violence, including bombings and assassinations. Several dozen
people were killed in politically linked violence last year,
including two ruling-party workers who were making bombs at the
residence of a member of parliament.
</P>
<P>
   In 1975, army officers assassinated Prime Minister Sheikh
Mujibur Rahman and most of his family. His daughter, who happened
to be out of the country at the time, is the current prime
minister, Sheikh Hasina.
</P>
<P>
   Against that background, the idea of flying Clinton in the
presidential helicopter over the tropical forests and rice paddies
surrounding the village, was not on, the Secret Service concluded.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton arrived here Sunday night on the first leg of his tour
of the Indian subcontinent, hoping to defuse regional tensions and
tamp down a dangerous nuclear arms race.
</P>
<P>
   With daughter Chelsea holding onto his left arm, Clinton stepped
out of Air Force One and waved, as workers scrambled to finish
painting walls, repairing pock-marked roads and otherwise sprucing
up the city in anticipation of the visit.
</P>
<P>
   First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, engaged in a tight U.S.
Senate race in New York, is not on the trip. But her mother,
Dorothy Rodham, is.
</P>
<P>
   With no official activities on his schedule Sunday night,
Clinton told reporters he was headed to a restaurant in his
five-star hotel for dinner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love Indian food,'' he told reporters traveling with him
aboard the presidential aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   He came bearing gifts: nearly $200 million in aid meant to help
fight hunger, expand schools for children and clean up the
environment. Most of the aid will target Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
   The assistance consists of:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  $97 million worth of wheat and soybean oil, to be given to
Bangladesh to be used as pay to workers for such things as
repairing schools, building latrines and digging wells;
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  $84 million to Bangladesh, India and Nepal to promote clean
and renewable energy technologies and the use of natural gas.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  and $6 million to promote conservation of tropical forests in
Bangladesh, through a nature-for-debt swap.
</P>
<P>

PUTIN'S MEMOIRS SET FOR PUBLICATION IN U.S.  
 JOURNALISTS AMONG THE ONLINE CROWD 
</HEADLINE>
   LOOKING AT THE CITY FROM THE WALL ST. LEVEL  (mk) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PublicAffairs, a New York company that is fast becoming the
publishing house for Kremlin politicians, is preparing to rush into
print in May with an English translation of the memoirs describing
the life, travails and Cold War spying adventures of Russia's
acting president, Vladimir Putin.
</P>
<P>
   The original Russian version of ``First Person'' is still
unavailable in Russia, where the country's Central Electoral
Commission has temporarily barred publication until after the March
26 presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   The slim volume was written by two reporters for Kommersant, a
Russian daily newspaper, who interviewed Putin for a day. The
president discussed everything from his own rigid interpretation of
freedom of speech to his boyhood dream to become a Cold War spy.
</P>
<P>
   Friends and family members also were interviewed. Putin's wife,
Ludmilla, a former airline attendant, acknowledged that she burst
into tears when she heard about her husband's sudden appointment as
acting president. ``I understood that private life had finished for
at least three months, up to the presidential elections, or perhaps
for four years,'' she said, according to an outline of the book
from PublicAffairs.
</P>
<P>
   An excerpt from the Russian version appeared early this month in
Kommersant. But the book's publication was stalled; Russian law
prohibits the publication of anything that can be construed as
campaign propaganda unless it is paid for by the candidate. The
electoral commission ruled that the book could favor Putin, who
leads a field of 12 candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Boris Yeltsin also is publishing his memoirs of his career as
Russian president with PublicAffairs.
</P>
<P>
   Putin, the grandson of the chef to Lenin and later Stalin,
describes his boyhood growing up in a communal flat with no hot
water or kitchen, chasing rats in a freezing stairwell. He became
entranced by films about Russian spies and at 16 volunteered for
the KGB, only to be told that he needed a university education.
Eventually, he would become a KGB agent and be sent to East
Germany.
</P>
<P>
   But he clearly is a spy who has come in from the cold, ready to
shed some of his secretive ways. That means we can now be privy to
his wife's shopping habits and television preferences, and one of
the most difficult decisions of his life _ dumping his first love
shortly before a scheduled marriage.

   Print Types Online
</P>
<P>
   Some say the Internet poses a threat to print journalists. But,
according to a study by Middleberg &AMP; Associates, a public relations
and marketing agency, print journalists themselves may be among
those benefiting most from the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1999 survey of managing editors and business editors at
1,509 daily newspapers and 2,500 magazines, which was completed by
about 10 percent of those contacted, 73 percent said they went
online at least once a day, compared with 48 percent in 1998. The
new level was the highest percentage-point increase since the
survey was first conducted in 1994. That year, only 17 percent of
the respondents went online daily. In addition, in the latest
survey, the number of respondents who never or almost never went
online dwindled to 1 percent, from 5 percent in 1998 and 37 percent
in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Don Middleberg, chairman and chief executive of Middleberg &AMP;
Associates, conducted the study with Steven S. Ross, associate
professor of professional practice at the Columbia University
Graduate School of Journalism.
</P>
<P>
   The study also found trends in the ways print journalists used
the Internet. In 1999, the most popular use was research,
displacing e-mail, though both were up from 1998. Ninety percent of
respondents used the Internet to research articles or as a
reference source, up from 74 percent in 1998; 83 percent used the
Internet for e-mail, up from 80 percent in 1998. In 1999, more than
half said they used e-mail at least occasionally to communicate
with readers. Half of the respondents used the Internet to search
for ideas for articles, up from 30 percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Print publications are adapting to new media as well. In 1999,
67 percent of newspapers with Web sites used a common newsroom for
Web and print operations, up from 56 percent in 1998. And 40
percent of the respondents said their publications allowed their
Web sites to report information before its appearance in their
newspapers or magazines.

   Guys and the City
</P>
<P>
   You HBO viewers who have wondered what ``Sex and the City''
might be like from the male perspective: Pour yourself a
cosmopolitan and fasten your seat belts. Darren Star, the executive
producer of ``Sex and the City'' and the creator of ``Melrose
Place,'' is taping a pilot for Fox Entertainment that his staff is
already talking up as a male version of the popular HBO series.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not `Sex and the City,' exactly,''' Star said. ``It's
more like `Guys and Money and the City.'''
</P>
<P>
   Star, it appears, has grown a tiny bit weary of womanly concerns
and all those pages and pages of scripts about shoe shopping.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kind of wanted to think about the world from the male point
of view,'' he said. ``Certainly Wall Street is a great arena in
which to explore male issues.''
</P>
<P>
   The pilot, ``The Street,'' centers on a group of aggressive
young Wall Street brokers with testosterone to burn. It stars Tom
Everett Scott, who is fresh from a role in ``Boiler Room,'' a movie
about, coincidentally, a group of aggressive young penny-stock
brokers with testosterone to burn.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Earley, vice president for entertainment at Fox
Broadcasting, a unit of News Corp., said that the pilot, if it
blossoms into a series, is scheduled to begin in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   In the pilot, the men, rather than sit around neurotically
dissecting their love lives and passionately debating who gets
better discounts on Jimmy Choo sandals _ as their female
counterparts might in ``Sex and the City'' _ become really excited
about the initial public stock offering of an Internet company.
</P>
<P>

U.S. JUDGE BACKS EX-WORKERS OF PAN AM IN PENSION CASE
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   A federal judge has sided with employees of Pan American World
Airways in a case related to their pension plan and the way it was
administered by a federal agency after the airline went out of
business.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling, which eventually may lead to an increase in pension
payments for some of the 65,000 people who worked for Pan Am when
it went out of business in 1991, affects the way the Pension
Benefit Guaranty Corp. administers pension plans.
</P>
<P>
   According to the ruling, the guaranty corporation must put the
interests of workers in failed pension plans ahead of its own
interests and is subject to the same rules as a pension plan in
keeping workers and pensioners informed about their pension
benefits.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling was handed down last week by Judge Loretta A. Preska
of U. S. District Court in Manhattan. Preska ruled that the
guaranty corporation can be held to the standard of conduct
required of a trustee, known as a duty of loyalty or fiduciary
duty, and not just to that of a mere guarantor of payments.
</P>
<P>
   The decision may prompt new litigation from people unhappy with
how the guaranty corporation determined the amount they were due
from their employer's failed pension plan.
</P>
<P>
   The Association for Former Pan Am Employees contends that the
guaranty corporation did not properly determine the benefits due
65,000 workers of the airline, which filed for bankruptcy
protection in 1991 and went out of business. The association says
the guaranty corporation issued thousands of workers determinations
of the benefits due them that were improper because, among other
reasons, they failed to abide by the terms of the agreement
negotiated between Pan Am and its unions.
</P>
<P>
   The guaranty corporation, in court papers, says it is not bound
by the union contract or any Pan Am practices that went beyond the
requirements of the pension plan.
</P>
<P>
   A trial has not yet been scheduled.
</P>
<P>
   The association also maintains that at least 14,000 workers have
yet to be informed of the benefits due them nearly nine years after
the airline folded. Richard A. Brooks, president of the
association, said Preska's decision ``represents a substantial
victory not only for former Pan Am employees but also for all
similarly situated individuals.'' He said that the decision means
that the guaranty corporation ``will finally be forced to respect
the rights of former employees under terminated retirement plans in
the same manner as any other plan fiduciary.''
</P>
<P>
   The guaranty corporation said that it was confident it would be
found by the court to have treated all participants fairly and to
have fulfilled its obligations under federal pension law.
</P>
<P>
   The guaranty corporation characterized the decision as technical
and noted that Preska had dismissed fraud claims brought by the
former Pan Am workers against it. It said it might seek permission
from Preska to appeal her ruling prior to trial.

The good news is that he has a pension, good health and excellent

family's retirement nest egg has been squandered on unexpected

North _ and yet stands to be rejected by many voters when his
country goes to the polls on April 13? When he was decisively
elected South Korea's president in 1997, he was considered
something of a maverick, but nevertheless the right man for the
time and the job. &QL;

individual seats on chartered private jets. Starting April 17,
flights between New York and Atlanta will cost $900, only $40 more
than a business-class seat on Delta Airlines. The private jet in
America may be the last luxury toy for big boys. But in the land of
the car pool, the plane pool just might take off. &QL;

to abandon my native soil, my life, my soul, my country.'' So began
the column published last Sunday by Francisco Santos, the news
editor of El Tiempo, Colombia's main newspaper. By the time the
edition hit the streets, Santos and his family were already in the
U.S. _ before the death threats made against him could be carried
out. &QL;

   TAIWAN-RIOTS (Taipei, Taiwan) _ A day after Taiwan's Nationalist
Party was swept from power after more than 50 years, the fury of
the losers erupted, forcing President Lee Teng-hui to barricade
himself inside his party headquarters as thousands of disaffected
supporters battled for hours with police. By Mark Landler.

   TAIWAN-LEE (Taipei, Taiwan) _ ``He betrayed Taiwan!'' ``He's a
traitor who sold out the Nationalist Party!'' The venom of the
crowds here Sunday was directed at a man who was long called ``Mr.
Democracy'' _ the man who opened up the clubby Nationalists to the
native Taiwanese majority, who engineered Taiwan's first direct
elections for president and who bravely asserted the island's

Eckholm.

   BANGLADESH-U.S. (Dhaka, Bangladesh) _ Three decades after
Bangladesh's difficult birth after a war of independence against
Pakistan, it remains one of the world's poorest nations. A million
villagers each year lose their homes to fickle rivers that engulf
their land. Democracy suffers prolonged malfunctions, in part
because the two women who run the main political parties hate each
other down to the bone. And yet, in most ways Bangladesh now is
decidedly in less of a mess, with the poverty rate drifting down
and economic growth rates inching up. Indeed, many here fear that
President Clinton is coming not just to shake hands but to pick
pockets. It seems that Bangladesh may be sitting on a small fortune
in natural gas. By Barry Bearak.

`RIDING THE BULLET': CLICK IF YOU DARE _ IT'S THE CYBERCRYPT 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Publication notes are at end of review) 
(lb) 
 By CHRISTOPHER LEHMANN-HAUPT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   If anyone could write a book that would overcome the obstacles
of having to be read on a computer screen, Stephen King should be
the one, given his unusual gift for storytelling and his almost
universal popularity.
</P>
<P>
   So far his first attempt, a 16,000-word novella called ``Riding
the Bullet,'' appears to be succeeding spectacularly, with paid and
free downloads during the first few days of its online availability
flooding past the half-million mark. But is this the wave of the
future or just a confluence of unusual circumstances? As someone
habitually attached to the traditional form of book, I put my foot
into these new waters with the utmost hesitancy.
</P>
<P>
   I read King's book in two of the available formats: first, by
downloading it onto my laptop computer; second, on an e-book
supplied by the publisher. (Neither permits a user to print out a
copy).
</P>
<P>
   Each option had its advantages: The e-book, a book-size monitor,
proved handier and more booklike in size and shape. By contrast, my
laptop allowed me to highlight key words and sentences in highly
visible colors.
</P>
<P>
   Both allow you to turn pages, so to speak, with the touch of a
button. Both enable you to enlarge or shrink the print to a
visually comfortable size. And both permit you to go from beginning
to end of the text, or to any given page, or to any single word
even, with a couple of mouse-clicks or a few taps of a penlike
stylus.
</P>
<P>
   But with both formats I was also restlessly aware of the unusual
effort it was taking to read onscreen. As near as I can put my
finger on a reason, it is that the screen's backlighting makes the
words appear to float in the foreground and seem less solidly
present than they do on the printed page.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe it is King's story itself, not one of his best, that
made reading onscreen seem insubstantial.
</P>
<P>
   True, ``Riding the Bullet'' gets off to a strong start and
builds with its author's familiar skill. Alan Parker, a student at
the University of Maine at Orono, gets a telephone call telling him
that his mother has had a stroke and has been taken to a hospital
in Lewiston. Because his car has a broken transmission he decides
to hitchhike the 120-mile trip south to Lewiston to comfort her.
</P>
<P>
   The second ride he catches is in a car that smells of urine,
driven by an old man who refuses to dim his brights for oncoming
cars and who worries out loud about catching ``that forgettin'
disease, I can't think what in the world they call it, Anderson's
or Alvarez or something like that ....''
</P>
<P>
   The moon comes up, ``a huge orange ball hoisting itself over the
horizon,'' and the man tells Alan to wish on it. He wishes that his
mother would know him when he walks into her room, and then he
regrets the wish, thinking of W.W. Jacobs' famous story, ``The
Monkey's Paw,'' in which magic wishes backfire with horrifying
consequences.
</P>
<P>
   After being dropped off by the man, Alan walks past a graveyard,
stops to read an inscription on a gravestone, ``George Staub/ Jan.
19, 1977/ Oct. 12, 1998,'' and then hitches another ride. This
driver is young and has stitch marks around his neck as if his head
had been severed and sewn back on. He wears a button on his T-shirt
that reads, ``I rode the bullet at Thrill Village, Laconia.'' After
a few exchanges he introduces himself to Alan as George Staub.
</P>
<P>
   But after getting off to such a strong start, King writes
himself into a corner that makes Alan's scary adventure seem
something of a shaggy dog story.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the most intriguing thing about ``Riding the Bullet''
is the connection that can be made between the story's implications
and the recent accident King suffered, in which he was hit by a van
while walking on a road. ``Riding the Bullet'' is reportedly the
first thing he has been able to write since his accident.
</P>
<P>
   Would reading it onscreen have been improved had the story been
more substantial? Maybe yes, maybe no. Improvements will doubtless
be made to the e-book, especially if a project to produce one with
actual pages instead of a screen ever comes to fruition at the
Media Lab at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. And
generations are growing up now entirely comfortable with reading
print on a backlighted screen.
</P>
<P>
   But reading ``Riding the Bullet,'' I sorely missed the solidity
of good old print on paper. And who knows, maybe old-fashioned
print would have made King's story seem a little more substantial.

 By STEVE LOHR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   A huge company with deep pockets, IBM can afford to dabble in
promising technologies. And that is what the International Business
Machines Corp. seemed to be doing throughout much of last year with
Linux, an increasingly popular version of the Unix operating system
that is available free on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   IBM dispatched emissaries to speak with members of the Linux
community, a worldwide network of programmers who develop and debug
the code. IBM met with academics, consultants, economists and
venture capitalists to plumb the Linux phenomenon. It made small
investments in a couple of Linux start-ups, and offered Linux on
one line of its computers.
</P>
<P>
   But last fall, Big Blue suddenly got serious about Linux.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of October, fresh from a global tour, Sam Palmisano,
a senior vice president, reported that the Internet companies he
spoke with told him that the preferred language of the young
programmers they were hiring was Linux.
</P>
<P>
   At about the same time, Irving Wladawsky-Berger, an IBM
executive with longstanding ties to the nation's supercomputing
centers, was hearing that Linux was generating a lot of excitement
in these leading-edge research institutions. And he had been
sending e-mail to the company's other top technology executives
about the rise of Linux.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the technical community and in the marketplace,''
Wladawsky-Berger recently recalled, ``the signs were clear that
something profound was going on.''
</P>
<P>
   Less than two months later, a few days before Christmas, IBM had
fashioned _ and Louis V. Gerstner Jr., the chairman, had approved _
an ambitious Linux strategy. The company that personifies
mainstream corporate computing had itself done something profound:
embrace Linux, a symbol of software's counterculture, as the
operating system of the future for the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   IBM, it was decreed, would embark on a costly program to make
all its hardware and software work seamlessly with Linux. So
quickly did the company mobilize that even now hundreds of
engineers across the company are already engaged in the Linux
campaign, and IBM says its army of Linux engineers will number in
the thousands within a few years.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, other major companies in the industry, including
Hewlett-Packard, Dell Computer and Oracle, also have Linux efforts.
``But IBM has tightly focused on Linux more than any other big
company,'' observed Dan Kusnetzky, director of operating systems
research at the International Data Corp.
</P>
<P>
   IBM's Linux strategy represents more than a bold, and risky,
step in the field of software. The move is a textbook example of
IBM's management style under Gerstner, who has worked to overhaul
the company and its culture since he arrived in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   In the pre-Gerstner days, decision making at IBM was once
described as ``swimming through peanut butter.'' But these days,
after a brief period of intense scrutiny _ during which the
company's technical experts play a key role _ choices are made
decisively and with remarkable swiftness, given that IBM is a
sprawling, $80-billion-a-year corporation.
</P>
<P>
   In this most recent example, Palmisano, 48, who is regarded as a
leading candidate to someday succeed Gerstner, is the senior
executive who pushed most emphatically for the Linux initiative _
and has the most riding on its outcome. ``This is Sam's bet,''
Wladawsky-Berger said.
</P>
<P>
   The first step toward IBM's Linux strategy came in a Saturday
morning telephone call on Oct. 30 that Nick Bowen received at his
home in Newtown, Conn. The caller was his boss, Paul Horn, the head
of the IBM Watson labs. He told Bowen, a 39-year-old senior
researcher, that he would lead an 11-person team to make
recommendations on how IBM _ the entire company _ should adapt to
Linux. The investigation must be rigorous and exhaustive, Horn told
him _ and finished in seven weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The Bowen report, submitted to top management on Dec. 20,
presented a plan for using Linux to undermine the software
advantage enjoyed by IBM's two key rivals, Microsoft and Sun
Microsystems. Microsoft's Windows NT and Sun's Solaris are the
leading operating systems used today on server computers, the
data-serving machines that are the engines of corporate networks
and the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   To combat Sun and Microsoft, the report recommended, IBM should
retool all its server operating systems, from the mainframe OS/390
to AIX, IBM's version of Unix, to run Linux smoothly. The same
should be true of all IBM's database, Web applications and
messaging software, the report said. And IBM, the Bowen team
concluded, should push Linux as the operating system of choice for
the Internet _ more robust and reliable than Windows NT and
eventually overtaking Solaris, Sun's flavor of Unix, as the
industry standard for Unix.
</P>
<P>
   The goal would be to win the hearts and minds of perhaps the
most influential audience in computing _ the software developers
who write the applications that bring the Web to life and make
Internet commerce actually work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, Microsoft and Sun dominate the application development
seats,'' the report stated. ``We recommend that IBM aggressively
pursue a Linux-based application development platform. Doing so
would disrupt the Sun-Microsoft stranglehold.''
</P>
<P>
   The Linux strategy would ``provide our server business with a
single, homogeneous server platform,'' from desktops to mainframes,
giving IBM a ``level playing field'' in software and allowing it to
compete with Sun and Microsoft for ``mindshare in key software
growth segments and in universities.''
</P>
<P>
   The report, known as a ``corporate assessment'' inside IBM ran
just over 10 pages. In the pre-Gerstner days, such reports to top
management could be 100 pages in length. But today's IBM executives
are familiar with the Gerstner edict: If you cannot say it in 10
pages, you are not focused on the right thing.
</P>
<P>
   It was only at the beginning of last October that Palmisano took
over IBM's server business. And he started at once to scout for
``major initiatives'' to help revive the growth of IBM's big server
computers _ mainframes, minicomputers and AIX Unix machines. He
closely followed the activities of the Bowen assessment team, he
read early drafts of the group's report and he liked the finished
document: a coherent, top-to-bottom software strategy for IBM.
</P>
<P>
   Moving quickly, he said, was imperative. ``The Internet has
taught us all the importance of moving early, the advantage of
being a first-mover,'' Palmisano said in an interview. ``We want to
be riding that Linux momentum at the front, not trailing it and
defending the past. IBM understands, believe me, what it means to
be defending the past.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   When Bowen met on Dec. 20 with Palmisano and Nick Donofrio,
senior vice president for technology, at IBM's headquarters in
Armonk, N.Y., he noted a nontechnical recommendation in the report:
put one person in charge of the Linux effort companywide. ``I'm
already working on that,'' Bowen recalls Palmisano saying.
</P>
<P>
   And when Palmisano met with Gerstner two days later, the
chairman not only approved the plan but also agreed with his choice
of who should be the company's Linux czar: Wladawsky-Berger. At the
time, Wladawsky-Berger was general manager of the Internet
division, responsible for making sure Internet technology and an
Internet mindset was spread broadly throughout the company.
</P>
<P>
   That job, Gerstner and Palmisano agreed, was done; IBM ``got''
the Internet. Now, it was time for Wladawsky-Berger to move onto
the next, hearts-and-minds challenge. So the staff of the Internet
unit went elsewhere in the company, the division was folded and
Wladawsky-Berger assumed the title vice president of technology and
strategy in the computer-server group, headed by Palmisano.
</P>
<P>
   They are a contrasting pair. Tall and physically imposing,
Palmisano is regarded as a brilliant executive and hard-charging
salesman. Previously, he ran the company's fast-growing global
services group, where he had a special talent for bringing in big
computer services deals, which can span several years and total
billions of dollars. Palmisano's nickname at IBM is ``the closer.''
</P>
<P>
   Wladawsky-Berger is six years older and about a head shorter
than his boss. Raised in Cuba, he fled with his parents, Eastern
European immigrants who owned a store in Havana, when Castro came
to power in 1959. He holds a Ph.D. in physics from the University
of Chicago, speaks with a lilting Spanish accent and could easily
be mistaken for a college professor.
</P>
<P>
   After his postgraduate studies, Wladawsky-Berger joined IBM's
Watson labs in 1970 as a researcher, but he had a taste for the
business side of the company as well. He led the drive to transform
IBM's traditional mainframes by retooling them with low-cost
microprocessors, the chips best known as the engines of personal
computers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Linux issue,'' Wladawsky-Berger explained, ``is whether
this is a fundamentally disruptive technology, like the
microprocessor and the Internet? We're betting that it is.''
</P>
<P>
   IBM's Linux effort is a long-term strategy, not one likely to
affect its quarterly earnings any time soon. And the strategy
appeals to IBM, in part, because it has lost its operating system
battles with Microsoft and Sun. Its effort in personal computer
software, OS/2, was quickly crushed by Microsoft's
market-dominating Windows. And IBM's AIX version of Unix has become
an also-ran behind Sun's more popular Solaris.
</P>
<P>
   So IBM would love to drive the profit out of the operating
systems business of its rivals _ just as Microsoft did to Netscape,
the browser pioneer, by giving browsing software away free. ``The
operating systems wars of today are the equivalent of the browser
wars of a few years ago,'' said Scott Hebner, an IBM software
executive. ``The operating system is not where the value is.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet IBM's strategy can succeed only if Linux, which is
distributed free, does become a genuine alternative to Windows or
Solaris, thereby putting real pressure on their prices. And Linux
has a long way to go. Today, it is used mainly for simpler tasks,
like serving up Web pages, instead of for industrial-strength
computing chores like financial transaction systems that must
handle complex tasks, 24 hours a day, without crashing. Even IBM,
which plans eventually to use Linux as its unifying Unix platform
(shelving AIX), says Linux's true ascendance may not come for five
years or so _ until Linux is built up to become more powerful and
reliable.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the software field, the excitement surrounding Linux
has less to do with the technology itself than with the fact that
it is the leading example of so-called open-source software _
software that is distributed free, with its underlying source code
openly published, and is developed, debugged and improved by an
international community of programmers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the Web phenomenon coming to software development that is
intriguing,'' said Larry Smarr, director of the National Center for
Supercomputing Applications in Urbana-Champaign, Ill. ``We now have
the potential for collaborative, decentralized software authorship
on large complex systems.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, it is unclear whether the open-source approach can solve
the kind of complex software problems that have consumed countless
programming hours and billions of dollars at Sun and Microsoft. And
for IBM, there is a question of whether the Linux community, which
works mostly on personal computers, will have much to contribute to
the company's Linux efforts on mainframes and minicomputers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Linux on non-PC platforms is a nonstarter,'' said Greg
Papadopoulos, chief technology officer for Sun Microsystems. ``The
ecosystem of open source is not going to be working for IBM on
other platforms.''
</P>
<P>
   But Wladawsky-Berger says he will side with the recommendations
of IBM's best technical minds. ``Not only did they say, `Irving,
this is doable,''' he observed. ``They said, `Irving, do it.'''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, veterans of the open-source counterculture seemed to
have welcomed Big Blue into the fold. ``It should accelerate the
pace of adoption of Linux,'' said Eric Raymond, an evangelist of
the open-source movement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, there's some irony here, since IBM used to be the
enemy,'' Raymond said. ``But everybody in the community is happy
about IBM wanting to play with us.''

PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION COULD AFFECT TRIBUNE-TIMES MIRROR DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By STEPHEN LABATON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In the pending merger of Tribune Co. and Times
Mirror, the fate of three of Tribune's largest television stations
and three of Times Mirror's largest newspapers may ultimately
depend on who becomes the nation's next president.
</P>
<P>
   That is because Vice President Al Gore, the presumptive
Democratic candidate, favors keeping the current restrictions on
companies that own both television stations and newspapers. But
Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the apparent Republican nominee, is
tilting against the existing rules. Under Tribune's proposed
acquisition of Times Mirror Co., announced last week, Tribune would
control newspapers and television stations in New York, Los Angeles
and Hartford, Conn., once it completed the deal.
</P>
<P>
   But a 1974 federal regulation known as the cross-ownership rule
prohibits a company from owning a newspaper and a television
station in the same geographic market. Unless revised, that rule
would require the companies to either seek a rarely granted waiver
or sell the newspapers or stations when their broadcast licenses
come up for renewal.
</P>
<P>
   Despite years of lobbying by Tribune and top executives in the
newspaper and broadcast industries, neither Congress nor the
Clinton administration is expected to change the rule any time
soon. Gore and other officials in the administration say they
support the rule because it prevents too much media power from
falling into too few hands. Congressional Republicans, including
Sen. John McCain, who have tried to have it repealed, have been
blocked by top Democratic lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   While Bush has not publicly articulated a position about the
rule, his top economic advisers have said it is archaic and
unnecessary. And some aides have quietly promised industry
executives and lobbyists that a Bush administration would move
swiftly to eliminate it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been assured through reliable channels that the
governor would support repeal of the rule,'' said John F. Sturm,
the president and chief executive of the Newspaper Association of
America. Shaun Sheehan, Tribune's top lobbyist in Washington, said
that he, too, had heard that the governor's policy advisers had
said that Bush would repeal the rule.
</P>
<P>
   Echoing the position of the broadcast industry's lobbyists,
aides to the governor's presidential campaign said they believed
that the rule was out of date, now that consumers could get
information from a wide array of sources including the Internet and
cable and satellite television.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are now so many media outlets that it would make sense
to relax it,'' said Timothy J. Muris, a professor at the George
Mason University of Law, a former senior antitrust official in the
Reagan administration and one of Bush's top advisers on economic
and competition issues.
</P>
<P>
   Although support for and opposition to the rule now largely
follows partisan lines, the regulation was first adopted by a
Republican-controlled agency at a time of intense concern among
antitrust officials about the power, particularly in smaller
markets, of companies that owned both newspaper and television
outlets.
</P>
<P>
   After it was approved by the Federal Communications Commission a
quarter-century ago, television stations in a dozen cities had to
be sold. A few newspaper companies were permitted to keep their
stations in some larger cities under a grandfather clause. A
handful of other companies were treated leniently, as when Rupert
Murdoch's News Corp. was permitted to buy the New York Post even
though the company controlled a television station, on the
rationale that the newspaper might otherwise fail. Nonetheless,
regulators compelled Murdoch to sell another newspaper, The Boston
Herald, because his company owned a television station in the same
market.
</P>
<P>
   During debate over the Telecommunications Act of 1996, Gore, as
the administration's lead negotiator, managed to save the
cross-ownership rule from being repealed. As one of the final
compromises that led to passage of the legislation, the lawmakers
and the administration agreed that instead of repeal, the FCC would
conduct reviews every two years to reconsider the need for the
rule. The agency under the Clinton administration has shown no sign
of changing its stance.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The different views between the Bush and Gore camps over the
cross-ownership rule illustrate one of the many ways that the
presidential race could determine enforcement of antitrust and
competition rules in the coming years.
</P>
<P>
   During the Clinton administration, antitrust and competition in
telecommunications and other industries have been among the
business issues receiving the fiercest litigation and lobbying
efforts.
</P>
<P>
   The administration has revived antitrust enforcement and brought
some of the most significant cases in a generation, including
prosecution of a vitamin cartel that resulted in record-breaking
fines and, still in progress, the Microsoft case. Clinton antitrust
officials have also challenged a series of large and smaller
mergers that would have gone unchallenged in the Reagan and Bush
administrations, killing many corporate deals and ordering
extensive modifications of others.
</P>
<P>
   Bush and Gore have provided relatively few specific details
about their views on antitrust and competition. And while whoever
is in the White House sets the overall tone and philosophy,
antitrust policies are generally set by the top officials appointed
to the Federal Trade Commission and the Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the candidates and their advisers have begun to
drop broad hints that they have significantly different views of
the subject.
</P>
<P>
   ``I call it yin and yang,'' said Reed Hundt, a close friend of
Gore and an antitrust expert who has discussed competition policies
with the vice president. Hundt served as chairman of the FCC from
1993 until 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Al Gore view is to side with the following constituencies:
small companies, start-ups, innovators, and attackers of
incumbents,'' Hundt said. ``The Gore view of antitrust follows in
the tradition of Teddy Roosevelt through Thurman Arnold and the
current administration. George Bush's view is much more beholden to
large companies and incumbents and sees little role for the
government.''
</P>
<P>
   In his few public remarks about antitrust, Bush has suggested
that he would return to many of the principles of the Reagan
administration and the practice of selecting antitrust enforcers
whose primary goal would be to combat price-fixing _ rather than to
use antitrust laws to protect consumers in industries, like
telecommunications, transportation and energy, that have been
significantly deregulated.
</P>
<P>
   ``My own personal view is the application of antitrust laws
needs to be applied where there are clear cases of price-fixing,''
the governor said in an interview with The Financial Times last
month. Asked whether the laws should be applied to situations
beyond price-fixing, he replied, ``Well, no.''
</P>
<P>
   Aides to the governor later clarified his remarks to say that he
was not ruling out other kinds of antitrust enforcement. But they
also contended that the Clinton administration had stretched some
antitrust laws beyond recognition and that a Bush administration
would pursue a more laissez-faire approach similar to that of the
Reagan administration.
</P>
<P>
   The differences were perhaps best summed up in a recent article
by Muris, the senior adviser to Bush, about the FTC's enforcement
of monopoly law. The article, which appears in the current issue of
the Antitrust Law Journal, criticizes the agency for an overly
aggressive interpretation of the Sherman Antitrust Act, and has
chapter titles that include ``The FTC is Wrong on the Law,'' ``The
FTC is Wrong on Policy'' and ``The FTC is Wrong on the Facts.''

FORMULA TV FADES AWAY: SUDDENLY, EVERYONE'S GOT A GIMMICK 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By CARYN JAMES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``The Beat,'' a swift and engrossing series about a pair of
improbably good-looking police partners, begins with the men
sitting in a bar. Mike Dorigan (Derek Cecil), the fair-haired,
clean-cut half of the team, tells the dark and impulsive Zane
Marinelli (Mark Ruffalo), ``You have this thing for psycho women.''
Just then Zane's girlfriend wanders in wearing oversized pink
flannel pajamas. ``I was sleeping, then I woke up,'' she says in a
fog. ``Suddenly I felt compelled to see you.''
</P>
<P>
   Ordinarily that would be enough quirkiness for one show, but
``The Beat'' (created by Tom Fontana of ``Homicide'') soon reveals
a gimmick that makes a girlfriend in pink pj's look tame. When a
fight begins in the bar, Mike pulls out his badge and the camera
shifts from film, and the smooth glossy look of most television
dramas, to grainy video with the down-and-dirty style of cheap
reality programs like ``World's Wildest Police Chases.'' Throughout
the series, whenever the partners talk about their personal lives
we see film. When they do police work, on or off duty, the look
changes to video in a flash, often alternating within one scene.
This head-spinning approach makes ``The Beat'' feel like
``Homicide'' meets ``Cops,'' and it offers the best evidence that
even before the flood of reality programs turns up this summer, a
spring season of gimmickry has arrived.
</P>
<P>
   After years of whining that they have to do something different
to prevent more viewers from deserting to cable, the networks are
finally trying to figure out what. The stunts are sometimes
stylistic and sometimes a matter of scheduling, but all smack of
the desperate need to escape a self-defeating, business-as-usual
attitude. This is the season the old formulas finally crashed.
</P>
<P>
   But where is the line between a gimmick and true innovation? Are
these stunts, with all their accompanying hype, overshadowing the
shows' true strengths? Or is hype all there is?
</P>
<P>
   Though genuine iconoclasm is rare, the networks are brimming
with superficial changes. ``The Beat'' (beginning Tuesday night at
9 on UPN) offers the best hope of overcoming its gimmicky device.
``Titus'' (beginning Monday night at 8:30 on Fox) is less
promising. Christopher Titus, the autobiographical hero, is filmed
in black and white talking directly to the camera about his
dysfunctional family; the series blooms into color and uneven
comedy to dramatize what he is talking about. As in ``Action,'' the
failed Fox series in which words were routinely bleeped out, the
attention-getting trick can't make up for weak writing.
</P>
<P>
   CBS, stereotyped as the old-timers' network, may be shaking
things up the most. ``Falcone,'' a series about an FBI agent who
goes undercover in the mob, was delayed from a previous season
after the shootings in Littleton, Colo., and concerns about
violence on the screen. When it finally arrives on April 4, it will
play as a continuous miniseries (nine hours over eight nights)
rather than in weekly episodes. CBS is also turning to live drama,
with George Clooney producing and appearing in ``Fail Safe'' on
April 9 and Julie Andrews scheduled for a live broadcast of ``On
Golden Pond'' sometime next season.
</P>
<P>
   ABC had already created an upheaval with ``Who Wants to Be a
Millionaire.'' Only NBC seems dangerously content to coast along.
</P>
<P>
   The most attention-getting elements in these shows may be the
least important, though. Where does the film/video split get you in
``The Beat''? The series' true strength is its appealing, sometimes
confused characters, who are not cliches even when they sound as if
they are. The wholesome Mike is engaged to a medical student,
Elizabeth (Poppy Montgomery), and isn't picking up her hints of
reluctance about the wedding.
</P>
<P>
   Zane's girlfriend, Beatrice (Heather Burns), is wonderfully
crazed; she would be a horror in life but is hilarious on
television. She reacts to a lovers' spat by pouring lighter fluid
over everything in Zane's apartment. Later she finds him in a
grocery store. ``It's not my fault that...,'' she yells and reveals
something truly shocking about his troubled family history. (It's
not child abuse; that would be the predictable shock today.) In
black-and-white flashbacks in future episodes, Zane revisits that
childhood horror. Used sparingly, the black-and-white of his past
seems deft and effective rather than gimmicky.
</P>
<P>
   Fontana, probably the best creative mind in television, knows
how to do this kind of series, and his script for the first episode
displays more humor than usual. The first episode was directed by
Barry Levinson, also an executive producer, and Zane and Mike are
as well acted as they are directed and written. A running plot
about racial tension is handled with political savvy. Two of their
white colleagues have arrested a black suspect, who dies in
custody: heart attack or choke hold?
</P>
<P>
   With all this in its favor, why does ``The Beat'' need its video
gimmick? Maybe because it's on UPN, the wrestling network. At times
``Homicide'' seemed too tony for NBC, so a downscale touch of
``Cops'' injected into a UPN show is not a stupid idea. It is also
a way of reinvigorating what is, after all, a conventional cop
show.
</P>
<P>
   Still, this particular video trick seems counterproductive, even
though those head-spinning changes become less distracting after
the first episode. The camera-swirling style of ``Homicide''
reflected its chaotic, morally ambiguous world. In ``The Beat,''
the film-video split creates a false separation. Mike and Zane are
people whose jobs constantly bleed into their private lives; that's
one of their problems. Instead of reflecting that, the
film-to-video jumpiness works against the reality of their
characters.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Just as the video sections of ``The Beat'' echo the reality
programming that is television's next wave, the autobiographical
genesis of ``Titus'' takes that show in a similar direction.
Performance art meets the dysfunctional family sitcom.
</P>
<P>
   The show is based on the stand-up performances of Christopher
Titus. (Don't worry, no one else has ever heard of him, either,
though Fox pretends he's well known.) Here he plays a character
named Titus who makes customized cars for a living and, like the
real person, has a father who has been divorced many times and a
brother who is just as scarred by their family as he is.
</P>
<P>
   In his black-and-white addresses to the camera, interspersed
throughout the series, Titus is in a stark room with a bare light
bulb hanging from the ceiling. Despite its high concept, the show
frequently falls back on banal sitcom humor and is never as funny
as the annoying laugh track suggests. Titus and his brother think
their father must be dead because he has been in his room for four
days (cue the laugh track) without asking for a beer.
</P>
<P>
   The show's true radical element is not the cliched beer-drinking
father, but its rock-bottom assumption that dysfunction is the
all-American standard. At the start, Titus says: ``Sixty-three
percent of American families are now considered dysfunctional.
We're the majority.'' He means it. He explains that his father
``never missed a drink or a joint'' in his life but ``also never
missed a day of work or a house payment.'' This is the
dysfunctional father as heroic antihero (given perfect growling
obtuseness by Stacy Keach).
</P>
<P>
   Still, the series is better in its throwaway moments than in its
grasping, ambitious ones. Titus says that when he was a boy, if his
arm had been ripped off during a soccer game his father would have
strapped it back on and returned him to action. An irreverently
funny, colorful flashback shows a boy with a dangling, limp arm
telling Keach, ``Thank you, father, I'll be the best soccer player
ever.'' Another of the funniest lines is, similarly, a throwaway
about his girlfriend, Erin (Cynthia Watros). ``She has that Irish
temper,'' Titus says. ``Of course, she's Northern Irish so we don't
fight, she just puts a bomb in my car.''
</P>
<P>
   In the third episode, when Titus and Erin fight and say vicious
things to each other, he realizes that maybe he doesn't want to be
happy. This idea about the scars of dysfunction gives ``Titus'' a
chance to cross the line between sitcom and drama, but the episode
is psychologically astute without being funny or emotional.
</P>
<P>
   At least ``Titus'' is taking a creative chance, though, and this
season even a failed risk can be revealing. Like many other shows,
``The Beat'' has a Web site (www.thebeattv.com), a creatively
ambitious one that presents a prequel to the series, showing Mike
and Zane during their academy days. The visuals are stop-motion
jerky. Dialogue that might be amusing on screen sounds lame here.
(``What's in sauerkraut, Mike?'') The important thing about the Web
site is that it exists. And as with all these networks' gimmicks,
what looks like a stunt today may actually be pointing to a
different future.

ADVERTISING: MARKETERS STILL FLOCK TO ACADEMY AWARDS BROADCAST
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas, Mich.)  (rk) 
 By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The 72nd annual Academy Awards show is looking a lot like a
Super Sunday, and not just because that's the day the ceremony is
now held.
</P>
<P>
   The Oscar presentation on ABC has traditionally been the second
biggest day of the year for advertising, trailing only the Super
Bowl. This year, though, that gridiron-style hoopla and hyperbole
has permeated the broadcast to the point where the network ought to
bill it as ``Oscar Bowl LXXII.''
</P>
<P>
   The reason? There is still no end in sight to the strong demand
for commercial time among marketers _ whether dot-com or not-com _
which has intensified their need to break through the clutter. One
popular tactic is to sponsor so-called marquee programming like the
Academy Awards, which draws large audiences even in an era of
fragmented viewing patterns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our belief is that high-visibility events, from the Oscars to
the MTV Awards to the World Series, are the best way to keep our
brand top of mind,'' said Dawn Hudson, senior vice president for
strategy and marketing at the Pepsi-Cola Co. in Purchase, N.Y., a
unit of Pepsico Inc. returning for a second straight year as the
sole beverage advertiser.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were pleased with the ratings and the focus and attention
our brand got'' in 1999, said Hudson, who is deciding this week
which new ``joy of cola'' spots for Pepsi-Cola by BBDO New York _
part of the BBDO Worldwide unit of the Omnicom Group _ will fill
the three minutes of time the company bought.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the Oscar ratings fluctuate like the hemlines of the
dresses worn by the nominees for Best Actress. The numbers rose in
1998, when viewers tuned in to watch ``Titanic'' win 11 awards,
then fell last year for the longest show ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``How many years do you get a `Titanic?''' asked Marv Goldsmith,
president for sales and marketing at the ABC Television Network in
New York, part of the ABC unit of the Walt Disney Co.
</P>
<P>
   ``But even in the weak years,'' he added, ``it's still the
second-highest rated show'' behind the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   That perspective was echoed by one of the longest-running Oscar
sponsors, Eastman Kodak, an advertiser from 1965 to 1969 and then
again from 1985 through this year, when the company will unspool
three 30-second commercials.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ratings go up and ratings go down, but year in and year out
it's a terrific advertising showcase,'' said Dave Hardie, general
manager and vice president for marketing at the Kodak consumer
imaging division in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an annual decision for us to renew from year to year,''
he added, ``but we envision being part of the Oscars going
forward.''
</P>
<P>
   ABC, in a robust market, was able to sell a 30-second spot
during the program, which begins at 8:30 p.m. EST on Sunday, for a
record average of $1.3 million. That's 30 percent higher than the
previous record of $1 million set only a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Buyers besides Kodak and Pepsico include blue-chip names like
AT&AMP;T, American Express, Gap, General Motors, McDonald's, Merrill
Lynch, Motorola, Charles Schwab, Sony and Sun Microsystems. One
longtime sponsor, Revlon, the troubled cosmetics marketer, is
reducing its presence, to two spots from nine.
</P>
<P>
   ABC is not charging as much as it did for Super Bowl XXXIV in
January, when a 30-second spot went for an average of $2.2 million.
But with 48 30-second time slots scheduled during the show, the
total revenue is expected to top $62 million _ more than what the
Super Bowl brought in as recently as 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the entertainment Super Bowl, if you will,'' said Scott
Parks, vice president for advertising development at Blockbuster
Inc. in Dallas, a unit of Viacom Inc. that will advertise during
the program for the first time with two spots by Doner in
Southfield, Mich.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our commercials were created for the broadcast,'' he added,
``to celebrate the role that movies play in our lives.'' The spots
feature Carly Simon singing as baby pictures of stars like Lauren
Bacall, Whoopi Goldberg, Walter Matthau and Elizabeth Taylor appear
on screen.
</P>
<P>
   The decisions by Blockbuster and Pepsi-Cola to produce
commercials that will make their debuts during the show are
indicative of another way in which the Academy Awards program's
resemblance to the Super Bowl is growing. Other advertisers are
also asking their agencies to create Super Sunday-type spots
stuffed with stars, special effects and surprises.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to kick off our new campaign with a bang,'' said
Martin Homlish, executive vice president and chief marketing
officer at SAP in New York, the software maker that is another
first-time Oscar advertiser. ``And the Academy Awards is such a
powerful venue.''
</P>
<P>
   The SAP agency, Ogilvy &AMP; Mather Worldwide in New York, part of
the WPP Group, created a 90-second spot featuring the golfer Gary
Player and his careless but ingenious caddy. The commercial will
introduce the theme ``My SAP.com. You can. It does.''
</P>
<P>
   SAP is also running a 30-second spot during the ``Oscar Preview
Show,'' which begins 30 minutes before the awards presentation.
That too is like the Super Bowl in that ABC is capitalizing on the
robust demand by offering advertisers the option of buying
(cheaper) time in related programs.
</P>
<P>
   The festivities begin on Friday, with a special version of ``Who
Wants to Be a Millionaire'' with movie- and Oscar-themed questions.
The Sunday lineup is composed of the annual Barbara Walters
celebrity interview special, the preview program, then the main
event.
</P>
<P>
   Just like the Super Bowl, all that pre-game _ er, pre-show _
programming provides opportunities for advertisers that could not
or would not buy time during the primary program.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, Mastercard International cannot appear during the
Academy Awards because American Express is the exclusive advertiser
in the credit card category. So Mastercard and its agency,
McCann-Erickson New York, will run a new commercial in their
``Priceless'' campaign, with a movie theme, during the Walters
program. The spot will also appear in local breaks during the Oscar
show on ABC stations in Los Angeles and New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to do the next best thing,'' said Larry Flanagan,
senior vice president for marketing at Mastercard in Purchase.
``We'll get some good exposure.'' McCann is part of McCann-Erickson
Worldwide Advertising, a unit of the McCann-Erickson World Group,
owned by the Interpublic Group of Companies.
</P>
<P>
   Add it all up and the Academy Awards and the ancillary shows
will help ABC set a record for first quarter ad revenue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look at the figures and go `Holy mackerel,''' Goldsmith
said. ``But I'm in sales. No matter how you do, they say `Can't you
do better?'''

AUCTION HULLABALOO REVERBERATES AT ART FAIR 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By CAROL VOGEL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MAASTRICHT, Netherlands _ When the doors to the European Fine
Art Fair opened on Friday afternoon, the 198 exhibitors were all
smiles, eager to talk about the prized offerings they were placing
before some 8,200 visitors who poured into the convention center
where the fair is held every March.
</P>
<P>
   But beneath the polite banter, the atmosphere at this, the
world's largest art fair, was politically charged. Talk of the
unfolding federal antitrust investigation of auction houses in New
York was everywhere, and with it speculation about the increase
that the biggest of the houses, Sotheby's and Christie's, plan to
charge buyers.
</P>
<P>
   The effect all this will have on dealers is uncertain. The
negative publicity that Sotheby's and Christie's have been getting
is making the dealers look good, they say. Some already report that
they are being offered more goods from collectors who once relied
on auctions to sell.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are a little uncertain about selling at auction until
things get sorted out,'' said Timothy Bathurst, a director of
Artemis Fine Arts, a London gallery that specializes in old-master
and 19th-century paintings. ``In some cases we're being offered
things for sale that Sotheby's or Christie's would have normally
gotten.''
</P>
<P>
   But the situation is double-edged. Among the many dealers who
have traditionally relied heavily on buying their stock at auction
there is concern that they will not be able to buy as much, because
the expensive commissions these auction houses are charging _ as
much as 20 percent on the first $50,000 _ will eat too deeply into
their profits.
</P>
<P>
   There is also much speculation about the effects the
investigation will have on the spring fine-art sales, which are
held in New York every May. While the dealers here are secretly
hoping to benefit, officials at Sotheby's and Christie's maintain
that the May sales this year will remain strong.
</P>
<P>
   ``While there are no single big estates like a Whitney or a
Ganz, in terms of monetary value our main impressionist and
postimpressionist sale will be as big as it has been the last few
seasons,'' said Franck Giraud, head of Christie's impressionist and
postimpressionist art department worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at Sotheby's estimate that their impressionist and
modern art sale this May will be impressive too, with $100 million
to $135 million worth of art for sale.
</P>
<P>
   In today's strong economy, collectors are so hungry for good
material they will buy wherever the goods are. ``No dealer is
publicly gloating about all that's going on,'' said Nicholas Hall,
who runs the New York branch of Hall &AMP; Knight. The gallery, which
also has a branch in London, specializes in old-master paintings.
``People are going to continue to buy art regardless of the
behavior of the auction houses,'' Hall said.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the estimated 70,000 people who will have visited the
fair by the time it ends on March 26 are serious buyers. Within the
first 24 hours dealers were reporting brisk business.
</P>
<P>
   While the fair has always attracted serious collectors because
of the quality of its goods, this year's art, antiques and
antiquities are particularly impressive. There is a staggering
selection of every collecting category from old masters to
textiles, jewelry and contemporary art.
</P>
<P>
   Since it began 26 years ago, the fair has been known as the most
comprehensive place to see old-master paintings. It still is.
</P>
<P>
   Among the best is an early still life at Haboldt &AMP; Co., a
gallery with branches in Paris and New York. Its title is more or
less its full description: ``Figs on a Tazza With Vine Leaves, a
Basket of Grapes, Roses, Irises in a Glass Vase With Cherries,
Pears, Plums, Cob Nuts, Peaches and Other Fruit on a Draped Table
with Butterflies.'' It was done circa 1590-1600 by an artist known
only as the Master of the Hartford Still Life.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the beginning of still-life painting as we know it,''
said Bob Haboldt, the gallery's owner. ``Perhaps the inspiration
came from Caravaggio, perhaps the artist had met Bruegel the Elder,
but it's a complete invention. It comes without any baggage of art
history.''
</P>
<P>
   On a table draped with a white cloth is a well-balanced
composition of fruits and flowers that are so alive on the canvas
that they almost seem to be moving. Haboldt bought the painting in
a small auction in Italy earlier this year. A slightly smaller and
later version is in the Wadsworth Atheneum in Hartford, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   Another rare painting that is attracting interest hangs in Jack
Kilgore's booth. The painting, ``Madonna With Child and Angels,''
circa 1607 by the Dutch master Hendrick Goltzius, features the
Virgin clad in a bright pink dress gazing down at the child, with
angels hovering in the background.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unlined and signed on both the back and the front,'' said
Kilgore, who runs a gallery in New York. ``Goltzius was a graphic
designer who didn't start painting until 1600 and he died in 1617,
so there are only about 40 paintings by him.'' Kilgore said he
discovered the painting in a German collection.
</P>
<P>
   While the best works here tend to come from private collections,
the fair always features many paintings bought in January at the
important old-master paintings sales at Sotheby's and Christie's in
New York. Dealers buy them, have them cleaned and restored in time
for the fair and then mark them up for considerably more than they
paid for them.
</P>
<P>
   The London dealer Richard Green, for example, has a breathtaking
Canaletto from the mid-1730s, ``The Grand Canal, Venice, Looking
East From Campo di San Vio.'' He bought it at Christie's in January
for $6.6 million. He is asking $9.5 million.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   French &AMP; Co. also has its share of recent auction purchases. A
painting by Giovanni Segantini, ``Springtime in the Alps,'' for
which the gallery's chairman, Martin Zimet, paid $9.5 million at
Christie's in November, is now for sale at $17 million.
</P>
<P>
   Zimet is also selling Arcimboldo's ``Reversible Anthropomorphic
Portrait of a Man Composed of Fruit,'' which is considered an
ironic portrait of Emperor Rudolph II. His price is $7.5 million.
He paid just under $1.5 million for it at Sotheby's two months ago.
``Sotheby's called it an Arcimboldo but we have done extensive
research on the painting,'' Zimet said.
</P>
<P>
   Every year the fair's section of modern and contemporary art
gets stronger. Leslie Waddington, a London dealer who has been the
chairman of the event's painting's department, has been bringing in
more top dealers from Europe and New York. ``As word is getting
out, more modern collectors have started coming here,'' he said.
``They aren't people interested in icon-buying, they're educated
collectors.''
</P>
<P>
   On opening day, Waddington said, he had sold a painting by Agnes
Martin, one by Van Dongen and another by Dali.
</P>
<P>
   Furniture, decorative objects and antiquities were also getting
lavish attention at this year's fair. Among the rarest treasures is
a tapestry based on a 12th-century legend of the life of St. Anne,
dated 1527, which is being shown at the Rudigier Alte Kunst, a
gallery in Munich, Germany. ``There are only 11 tapestries of this
kind,'' said Gertrude Rudigier, who added that she found it in a
private collection in southern Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Bowman, a London dealer, discovered ``Vases of the
Titans,'' a pair of terra-cotta vases by Rodin, at a chateau in
France. The vases, which are signed by A. Carrier Belleuse, the
owner of the workshop where Rodin was working around 1879, come
from the collection of Henri Ardant, who owned the Ardant porcelain
factory in France.
</P>
<P>
   Each vase is held up by four crouching and intricately carved
titans and has a Greek key pattern at the top. Similar examples are
in the collections of the Rodin Museum in Paris and the Maryhill
Museum of Fine Arts in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   As the crowds poured in and out of Bowman's booth, he said he
was having his best fair ever. ``There are several factors that are
making this a success,'' he said. ``People are thinking the stock
market could crash, and it's a good time to buy art. At the same
time, the public is beginning to realize that the auction houses
are less concerned with expertise and more with making their
commissions.''

ALL OF HUMANKIND ARE STRANGERS IN A STRANGE LAND
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By MARGO JEFFERSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``I have contempt for those books,'' said a friend when I tried
to describe my mixed responses to photography books that try to
counter passive ignorance or battle active prejudice by celebrating
social diversity and emotional complexity. You know the kind I
mean. The ``those who have made significant contributions to their
people'' books. The books that focus on the rituals that make
``us'' just like everybody else. And those that glorify the
intimate, even exclusionary ties that bind a group: mothers and
daughters, say; the Jews of the Lower East Side; the Cherokee
people.
</P>
<P>
   Dances, weddings, funerals and childbirth always signal the
universal, something we can all understand. Certain kinds of work
photos signal a history of injustice and endurance that it is hoped
we all understand: a middle-aged black woman standing on a bale of
cotton looking down at her palm without expression as her white
boss counts a coin into it. Or a Mexican woman in a Texas factory,
wearing a Gap T-shirt and sewing an American flag. (Is she treated
like an American citizen when she gets off work, we wonder.)
</P>
<P>
   Certain photographs are surprising because in the social (as
opposed to the religious) realm we rarely believe or even think
about what we do not see. And because most of the American news
media have generally defined social reality (apart from ``special
interest'' stories) as WASP (in appearance at least), one is often
reduced to embarrassingly childlike exclamations like, ``Gosh!
Black, Japanese and Korean women serving in the Armed Forces during
World War II!'' Do such images matter? How can they not, given our
nation's continuing obsession with that war and the reverence for
its veterans?
</P>
<P>
   I've been studying three books in particular: ``Americanos:
Latino Life in the United States'' (Little, Brown), ``The Face of
Our Past: Images of Black Women From Colonial America to the
Present'' (Indiana University Press) and ``Shades of L.A.: Pictures
From Ethnic Family Albums'' (New Press).
</P>
<P>
   ``Americanos'' is meant to educate and disarm hostile or
suspicious Anglo readers while praising and reassuring Latino
readers. The section ``Latino Contributions'' begins, ``Far from
representing a threat to society, the Latino presence is
strengthening the basic institutions of society: the family, work
and education.'' And on the page opposite we see the photo of the
woman sewing the American flag.
</P>
<P>
   In his introduction Carlos Fuentes writes: ``We descend from all
the islands naming themselves twice or thrice, Indian and Spanish
and African, in the waters of the Caribbees. We have come down from
the mountains in the great backbone of the Americas, the vast
ranges stretching from the Rockies to the Sierra Madre to the Andes
to the archipelagos, falling off like cold beautiful grapes at the
foot of the continent, Chile, Argentina ... ''
</P>
<P>
   The text is in English and Spanish, which is exactly right. The
bifurcated audience is problematic. How do you talk to people you
see as family while simultaneously explaining them to strangers?
The language moves uneasily between exhortation, uplift and
instruction, between sophistication and condescension. That is the
tone employed for a mainstream audience, to assuage their sense
that a group is alien or deviant.
</P>
<P>
   The March 20 issue of Newsweek was a perfect example, with its
special report ``Gay Today: How the battle for acceptance has moved
to schools, churches, marriages and the workplace.'' The cover
photograph featured five gay people: a man in uniform (a reservist
and state representative), a policewoman, a woman in the ministry
and two men (one black and one white) in suits, who were, it turned
out, a teacher and a physician.
</P>
<P>
   Easy to throw up one's hands and ask why the struggle for
tolerance seems always to involve reinventing the wheel. This is
the visual equivalent of those song epics that preached tolerance
and minority-group virtue in the 1940s: ``Ballad for Americans,''
performed by Paul Robeson, and ``The House I Live In,'' made famous
by Frank Sinatra.
</P>
<P>
   But when we sang and declaimed ``Ballad for Americans'' in my
grade school music class, I was moved and, yes, grateful. It
mattered that the prejudice my parents were doing their best to
shield me from could be criticized, however piously, out loud. One
can wish fervently that conversion music, speech and photography
were fresher and subtler. But they matter. Not to flaming bigots.
(It may inflame them more, as in ``How dare these people look and
act as normal as we do?'') But they matter to those whose beliefs
can shift when their collection of stereotypes is clearly out of
date.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Face of Our Past'' and ``Shades of L.A.'' are aimed less
at outsiders and more at the people or descendants of those
photographed. Not that one doesn't get some of the same shocks.
``What variety, what range,'' you find yourself saying when you
thought you had been educating yourself very well for some time
about your race, gender or ethnicity.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But human beings are literal creatures. If society doesn't
provide visual evidence of one's existence in all its variety, or
if one doesn't work constantly to supply the lack, the mind's eye
will blur or close.
</P>
<P>
   The common stock of American imagery just doesn't include these
photographs of young black women in Gibson Girl hairdos and bathing
costumes, or of a black girl no more than 10 playing golf in a
sandlot with a club made from a stick. The year is 1905 and she
wears scuffed high-button shoes. Or young Indians dancing together
in the kinds of cowboy and cowgirl outfits that one used to see on
Roy Rogers and Dale Evans. (They were students at the Sherman
Institute in Los Angeles, a boarding school whose policy was
thorough-going assimilation). Or a room filled with elegant couples
attending the Los Angeles Chinese Tennis Club Dinner Dance of 1934.
Or a trio of pretty Korean women in 1931, posing in the sand
bathing-beauty-style, and looking as if they should be plucked from
Venice Beach and taken, along with their handsome escorts, straight
to a Hollywood studio.
</P>
<P>
   Was it George Eliot who found something melancholy about the
human gift for metaphor, since it meant we could only describe a
thing by calling it something else? There is something just as sad
about all our talk of diversity, pluralism and deconstructing
otherness. ``See the margins of the world,'' Fuentes writes in
``Americanos,'' ``where those who are different from us are waiting
to demonstrate that they are as human as we.'' His sentence is,
``Recognize yourselves in he or she who are not like you or me.''
But will we ever see the ``he or she'' he invokes as fully human
without first having to recognize ourselves in them?

   NEW YORK _ Mingling the traditional and the technological with
modern spectacle and time-tested skills at Madison Square Garden,
the Ringling Brothers and Barnum &AMP; Bailey Circus is marching,
dancing, swinging, soaring, pirouetting, plodding, prat-falling and
blasting off into its third century of lavish entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   In a world made smaller each day by electronic miracles, the
circus remains a reminder of an era when the exotic _ people,
performers, animals _ retained the power to evoke innocent awe and
childish wonder.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, recognizing that times and tastes do not stand
rooted, this Feld Entertainment presentation, with its colorful
costumes, up-to-the-minute lighting, swirling smoke and pulsing,
upbeat music, is a fast-moving combination of generous resort-style
song and dance and old-fashioned acts in modern trappings.

<P>
   If the 130th edition of the Greatest Show on Earth boasts no
single side-splitting clown or daredevil act capable of reducing
even jaded joyseekers to bated breath, it remains a big, bright,
something-for-everyone show.
</P>
<P>
   Among this year's noteworthy attractions are Sara, the tall,
blond, 22-year-old circus veteran who cuddles and controls a
cageful of handsome tigers, and the Quiros, costumed in top hats,
white ties and tails, who evoke the lithe grace of Fred Astaire
while dancing, jumping rope, dueling with canes, riding bicycles,
forming pyramids and otherwise risking their necks on two levels of
high wire.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to risking necks, Kanat Chalabayev's Congress of
Rough Riders, an equestrian troupe assembled from components of the
former Soviet Union, perform feats of horsemanship, like hanging
upside down from fast-moving steeds; and the Flying Tabareses, a
double trapeze act with two sets of flyers, soar and somersault
across the upper reaches of the Garden.
</P>
<P>
   Pretty in pink, the 18-woman Jinan Bicycle Gymnasts perform
synchronized pedaling and provide a wow finish when about a dozen
form a pyramid aboard a single bike.
</P>
<P>
   Michu the midget is back, with Jon Weiss, who not only takes a
couple of trips out of a cannon's mouth but also balances a buzzing
chain saw on his chin. And there are also trampoline artists,
capering horses and zebras, and the elephants, young and old, who
parade and perform.
</P>
<P>
   The Ringling Brothers and Barnum &AMP; Bailey Circus is back in
town, all dressed up and on the move into a new millennium.  &QL;

FREE MUSIC SOFTWARE MAY HAVE RATTLED AOL 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds., (NU)gnutella, in 8th graf, is CQ)

<P>
   Justin Frankel, a 21-year-old programming wizard who sold his
digital music company, but perhaps not his soul, to America Online
last year, did not endear himself to his new masters last week by
publishing free software that enables users to find and trade music
files quickly over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The software designed by Frankel and his team at AOL's Nullsoft
unit is a variation of a popular program called Napster. College
students and others have been using Napster in a frenzied exchange
of music, pirated and not. The Recording Industry Association of
America is suing Napster Inc. for copyright infringement.
</P>
<P>
   AOL executives directed that Nullsoft's program, called
Gnutella, be removed a few hours after it was made available on the
Internet last Tuesday. The shutdown may have been done for a simple
reason, like preventing a traffic jam as thousands of Internet
users rushed to get what was billed as a test version of the
software. But in the absence of an explanation from AOL, the
ensuing silence hinted at a more complicated situation. The site,
gnutella.com was reduced to an inscrutable one-liner: ``temporarily
down. come back later.'' An executive said Sunday, however, that
the program would not return.
</P>
<P>
   Nullsoft may have touched a nerve at AOL, which will own one of
the world's largest record companies after its planned acquisition
of Time Warner Inc. The record industry is fighting an epidemic of
music piracy by way of a digital format known as MP3, which
compresses music into files small enough to be zapped across the
Internet while maintaining almost CD-sound quality. Last year,
AOL's purchase of Nullsoft, a pioneer in the MP3 movement and maker
of the popular Winamp MP3 player software, was seen as lending
credibility to the standard.
</P>
<P>
   Some Internet companies argue that the record industry should
view the widespread copying of music online as a new business
reality and turn its energy toward capitalizing on it. Meanwhile,
more than a million music fans have registered for Napster, and
other programs like it are also attracting users.
</P>
<P>
   But since agreeing to buy Time Warner, AOL may increasingly find
itself on both sides of the digital music battle.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Nullsoft nor AOL would say anything about the Gnutella
episode beyond a statement issued by Josh Felser, the general
manager of AOL's music division, that said, ``The Gnutella software
was an unauthorized freelance project and the Web site that allowed
access to the software has been taken down.''
</P>
<P>
   But over the weekend, someone using Frankel's online handle,
deadbeef, on an Internet Relay Chat channel called (NU)gnutella
answered a long string of technical questions about the program and
confirmed that AOL was distressed about the implications for its
relationship with the recording industry.
</P>
<P>
   The creators of Gnutella _ the name refers to GNU, a licensing
system under which ``open source'' software is released to the
public _ had said they intended to release the source code of the
final version of their product within a month. The code would
enable outside programmers to develop versions of the software.
</P>
<P>
   Frankel appears still to be toying with the idea. In the
transcript of an online conversation in which he apparently
participated, deadbeef muses about ``accidentally'' sharing the
source code. ``I'd love to let it go,'' deadbeef wrote, ``and watch
it develop into something much more.''

ADVISORY PANEL ON INTERNET TAXES UNLIKELY TO REACH CONSENSUS
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Making the Internet a tax-free zone seemed the right idea in
Congress 14 months ago. The Senate voted 96-2 for a three-year
moratorium on any new taxes on electronic commerce, and the House
agreed by voice vote. Congress also created a national advisory
commission whose members, congressional Republicans expected, would
recommend a permanent ban on taxing Internet sales.
</P>
<P>
   Things are not turning out that way. As the commission begins
its final meeting Monday in Dallas, it will almost certainly fail
to reach a consensus about what national policy to recommend.
</P>
<P>
   To the surprise of the anti-tax forces who thought they had
control of the commission, two-thirds of the 19 commissioners have
come out in favor of a level playing field, meaning that if an item
is subject to sales tax it should be taxed whether the item is sold
at a store, on the telephone, by mail order or over the Internet.
And these 14 commissioners, six from business and eight from
government at various levels, also agree that as a prelude to this,
sales taxes should be radically streamlined to make it efficient
and easy to administer.
</P>
<P>
   But despite this agreement on principles, there appears to be
virtually no prospect that the 14 commissioners will get together
to recommend applying sales taxes to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   In a conference call on Thursday with Gov. James Gilmore 3rd of
Virginia, the commission's chairman and a staunch foe of taxes, the
six business representatives on the commission were persuaded to
agree to a plan whose practical effect would be to delay any sales
taxes on Internet transactions until at least 2006. And if that
happens, all sides agree, the anti-tax policy wins by default
because so much commerce will have moved to the Internet by then
that imposing sales taxes would be a political impossibility.
</P>
<P>
   Maintaining the status quo means that a growing volume of sales
on the Internet will be untaxed, creating a competitive advantage
for some businesses. According to Gov. Mike Leavitt of Utah, a
Republican member of the commission who favors applying sales taxes
without regard to how goods are sold, the status quo would also
mean a declining tax base to finance police, fire departments,
schools and other basic services provided by state and local
governments.
</P>
<P>
   If sales tax receipts fall, Leavitt said, those states with
income taxes will have to raise rates. And local governments will
have to raise property taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Outside of the six business members of the commission,
representing America Online, AT&AMP;T, Gateway, MCI WorldCom, Charles
Schwab and Time Warner, there is wide support in the business
community for a level playing field for sales taxes. Business
groups including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the hastily
formed E-Fairness Coalition, whose 1.4 million member companies
employ one of every five American workers, and individual companies
like Wal-Mart Stores and Circuit City, argue emphatically that
sales taxes must not be tied to how products are sold.
</P>
<P>
   Many of these businesses now sell over the Internet. But those
that operate nationally must collect taxes on Internet sales in
every state in which they have a traditional store. By contrast,
under current rules an e-commerce company like Amazon.com, which
has its operations in the state of Washington, is not required to
collect sales taxes in states where it has no physical presence.
</P>
<P>
   Steven M. Case, chief executive of America Online, which has a
seat on the commission, favors a level playing field. ``It is wrong
for the Internet to be a tax haven,'' Case said during a meeting
with reporters and editors in New York recently. ``But it's equally
wrong for catalog sales to be a tax haven.''
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, every major organization of state and local
officials also opposes exempting purchases over the Internet from
sales taxes, the largest single source of revenue for these
governments.
</P>
<P>
   But the commission's business members and eight of its
government representatives differ on how the transition to taxing
Internet sales should be made. The business members sought ironclad
assurances that the sales tax system would be simplified first and
only then would goods sold over the Internet, by telephone and by
mail order be subject to taxes. The government representatives
wanted a 13-month plan to write new rules to simplify the sales tax
system, followed by quick congressional action to authorize
taxation of sales that cross state lines.
</P>
<P>
   A proposal to resolve the differences between the two sides was
worked out in recent weeks between David Pottruck, president and
co-chief executive of Charles Schwab, and Utah's Leavitt.
</P>
<P>
   During a protracted conference call on Thursday, Pottruck tried
to sell this plan to the other five business members of the
commission. ``I was trying to get a little bit more of a moderate
position'' on how to make the transition to taxing Internet sales
work, Pottruck said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   But the commissioners could not agree, so they called Gilmore to
advise him of their discussions. According to four people who
listened to all or part of the conversation, Gilmore said that
while he agreed with the need to simplify sales taxes, he did not
believe that position led inevitably to taxation of Internet sales.
And Gilmore said he would not support any plan favoring any tax
expansion.
</P>
<P>
   The governor then offered his own proposal, which called for
streamlined sales taxes, but put off until 2006 any further action
on applying sales taxes to Internet sales. Gilmore ``did a
masterful job'' of steering the business members away from joining
forces with Leavitt's camp, Pottruck said.
</P>
<P>
   If Gilmore delivers the five anti-tax votes Tuesday to join a
proposal by the six business members to streamline existing sales
taxes and defer their application to the Internet, a new issue will
arise. The law that created the advisory commission requires a
two-thirds vote to make policy recommendations. That means 13 votes
on the 19-member commission, not the 11 votes Gilmore has lined up.
But Gilmore plans to ignore that requirement, his aides said. He
will release an opinion from the commission's general counsel
saying it can sidestep that rule by issuing a report rather than
making a formal recommendation.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Letters urging the commission to do just that were issued Friday
by Sen. Trent Lott of Mississippi, the Senate Republican leader,
and Rep. Dick Armey of Texas, the House Republican leader, who said
that a simple majority was sufficient so long as the majority
position would make the Internet tax free, the policy they had
favored from the start.
</P>
<P>
   This high-level involvement shows how Internet taxes are
becoming an important political issue. Gov. George W. Bush of
Texas, the presumptive Republican presidential candidate, supports
the current three-year moratorium on Internet sales taxes, and
Gilmore is considered a potential running mate on the Republican
ticket.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore, in contrast, says he favors a level
playing field for retailers regardless of how they sell their
goods. Grover Norquist, an anti-tax member of the commission who as
president of Americans for Tax Reform has been the Republicans'
chief strategist on tax issues in the past decade, said he was
advising the Bush campaign to refer to Internet sales taxes as
``the Al Gore tax.''
</P>
<P>
   Leavitt said exempting the Internet and other remote sales from
taxation would create a situation that neither governments or
business could tolerate. If Internet sales remain untaxed, he said,
he expects business executives and business owners will ``besiege
Capitol Hill with one phrase on their lips _ level playing field.''

   TAIWAN-RIOTS (Taipei, Taiwan) _ A day after Taiwan's Nationalist
Party was swept from power after more than 50 years, the fury of
the losers erupted, forcing President Lee Teng-hui to barricade
himself inside his party headquarters as thousands of disaffected
supporters battled for hours with police. By Mark Landler.
</P>
<P>
   TAIWAN-LEE (Taipei, Taiwan) _ ``He betrayed Taiwan!'' ``He's a
traitor who sold out the Nationalist Party!'' The venom of the
crowds here Sunday was directed at a man who was long called ``Mr.
Democracy'' _ the man who opened up the clubby Nationalists to the
native Taiwanese majority, who engineered Taiwan's first direct
elections for president and who bravely asserted the island's
separate identity against a hostile mainland China. By Erik
Eckholm.
</P>
<P>
   BANGLADESH-U.S. (Dhaka, Bangladesh) _ Three decades after
Bangladesh's difficult birth after a war of independence against
Pakistan, it remains one of the world's poorest nations. A million
villagers each year lose their homes to fickle rivers that engulf
their land. Democracy suffers prolonged malfunctions, in part
because the two women who run the main political parties hate each
other down to the bone. And yet, in most ways Bangladesh now is
decidedly in less of a mess, with the poverty rate drifting down
and economic growth rates inching up. Indeed, many here fear that
President Clinton is coming not just to shake hands but to pick
pockets. It seems that Bangladesh may be sitting on a small fortune
in natural gas. By Barry Bearak.
</P>
<P>
   WACO-REENACT (Waco, Texas) _ The government's credibility will
be put to the test this weekend when critical portions of the 1993
assault at Waco are re-enacted on Sunday at a military base with
tanks, a helicopter and camouflaged gunmen. The re-creation could
challenge the government's unequivocal assertion that federal
agents fired no shots at the Branch Davidian compound in the final
hours of the 51-day siege. By Jim Yardley.
</P>
<P>
   McCAIN-SENATE (Washington) _ John McCain returns to the Senate
on Monday facing a peculiar challenge: how to use his new
prominence to propel forward his signature issue of campaign
finance overhaul at a moment when everyone in politics is posing as
a reformer. By Alison Mitchell.
</P>
<P>
   NBA-SINKING-RATINGS (Undated) _ Just two years ago, the NBA was
a very hot sports attraction on network television, the ratings for
its playoff finals at times eclipsing those for baseball's World
Series. But that was the last season for Michael Jordan, the
transcendent sports star of the 1990s, and two years after his last
game, the NBA has seen its popularity on network television
plummet, to the despair of its network partner, NBC. By Bill
Carter.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ So many feelings in each awkward kiss; such endless
shades of response in a quick clasping of hands.
</P>
<P>
   Every time Cherry Jones and Gabriel Byrne make physical contact
in the heart-stopping new production of ``A Moon for the
Misbegotten,'' the floodgates open to a tide of clashing emotions.
</P>
<P>
   Exaltation and disgust, hunger and resignation and, most
acutely, a sorrow that is all the more profound for the faint
sparks of hope it lets shine through: You see flickers of all these
elements from the moment Jones, the Tony-winning star of ``The
Heiress,'' and Byrne, the accomplished Irish film actor, first
brush against each other in the revival of Eugene O'Neill's great,
elegiac love story that opened Sunday night at the Walter Kerr
Theater.
</P>
<P>
   The characters they portray _ Josie Hogan, a Junoesque farm
woman, and James Tyrone, a self-consuming alcoholic actor _ are, on
one level, as opposite as the quick and the dead, as the flesh and
the spirit. Jones is the image of earthy robustness, with her
wide-legged stance and wrestler's arms; Byrne has the wan,
mechanical air of a man who has already abdicated his spot among
the living.
</P>
<P>
   But it is clear here that Josie and James are each wearing a
mask that only the other can remove.
</P>
<P>
   What makes this ``Moon,'' which has been lovingly directed by
Daniel Sullivan, so illuminating is the extraordinary transparency
of its stars: their ability to play, and display, all those layers
at once. To watch Jones, Byrne and Roy Dotrice, who completes the
triangle of principal performers, react to one another is to
realize the degree to which O'Neill's last completed play is about
how everyone is an actor, a deceiver by necessity.
</P>
<P>
   Accusations, delivered both playfully and angrily, of lying and
of bluffing are leveled throughout this account of one of the
strangest and most transfixing courtships in American theater. The
practical ruses and schemes perpetrated by Josie and her
hard-drinking, conniving father (Dotrice) are reflections of deeper
forms of illusion.
</P>
<P>
   As in his other, better-known play featuring James, ``Long Day's
Journey Into Night,'' O'Neill considers the routines of speech and
attitude, often as fixed as vaudeville acts, with which family
members and friends deal with one another. In ``Moon,'' however, he
allows his characters glimpses into the truth of themselves that
heal instead of sear.
</P>
<P>
   Its great, fabled moment of redemption for James, a part modeled
closely on O'Neill's brother (also named James), comes from having
confession lead to absolution. This may be natural cause and effect
in the Roman Catholic Church, into which O'Neill was born; it is
usually not the case in the harsh universe of his plays.
</P>
<P>
   Written in 1943, ``A Moon for the Misbegotten'' has a fitting
history for a play about redemption. O'Neill described it in later
years as ``a poor thing,'' which ``I have come to loathe.'' When it
was first seen on Broadway, in a 1957 production starring Wendy
Hiller and Franchot Tone, it was greeted with head-shaking sadness.
``It is not so much an ascent into tragedy as a descent into
squalor,'' wrote Brooks Atkinson in The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   Yet 16 years later Walter Kerr, writing in the same paper, said
the play ``just may be O'Neill's richest work for the theater.''
This assessment was inspired by a new production, with Colleen
Dewhurst and Jason Robards directed by Jose Quintero, that was
regarded as definitive.
</P>
<P>
   When a third Broadway incarnation arrived in 1984, directed by
David Levaux, the critical response, especially to Kate Nelligan's
Josie, suggested that there was still room for theatrical
variations on ``Moon.'' Masterpieces, it seems, never stop growing,
and the current production emanates both a springtime freshness and
an autumnal mellowness.
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan and his company have infused the play with a mixture of
clear-eyed observation and a warm, luminous empathy that melts the
performance's solid three hours into a quick-coursing stream. This
achievement is the more remarkable when you consider that the
script's components, examined individually, seem as dense and blunt
as the rocks that dominate the landscape of the untillable
Connecticut farm on which the play takes place.
</P>
<P>
   Those rocks are very much in evidence in Eugene Lee's set, which
suggests a rural scene by Thomas Hart Benton. There before you is
the requisite ramshackle farmhouse and the rusty old pump and the
laundry of overalls on the line. Theatergoers new to ``Moon'' might
anticipate a New England answer to ``Tobacco Road.''
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, they wouldn't be wrong. Josie and her
professionally Irish father, Phil, spend much of the play's first
half-hour indulging in a gruff, showy banter that doesn't quite
disguise the overly extensive exposition about their friend and
landlord, James, and their relationship with him.
</P>
<P>
   Dotrice's Phil initially comes across as a Gaelic Pappy Yokum,
cute and crafty and full of blarney. The first act's comic
centerpiece has Josie and Phil assuming the roles of threatening
Irish barbarians, humiliating an arrogant, rich neighbor (Tuck
Milligan). They're putting on a show, of course, for themselves and
for their appreciative audience of one, James, who has by that
point arrived and hidden inside the house.
</P>
<P>
   What this production makes especially clear is that they have
been putting on a show all the time. So has James, whose talk with
Phil and Josie takes the form of barbs and banter that you know is
the product of long association. Yet as soon as Byrne enters, you
can sense that James, obviously near the end of a fraying tether,
has grown impatient with this particular currency of friendship.
``Cut out the kidding, Josie,'' he says wearily. Getting past the
kidding, it turns out, is what gives this production its momentum.
</P>
<P>
   Each of the three principal players dextrously suggests a
slightly exaggerated, slightly bogus persona on first appearance,
while allowing a sense of a more fragile, serious self to peek
through. Dotrice is all feisty charm and drunken palaver, yet his
eyes are shrewd and, fleetingly, a bit frightened.
</P>
<P>
   Jones' Josie, the self-proclaimed strumpet of the countryside,
has the air of a roguish Rabelaisian giant, tough-tongued and
intimidatingly large of gesture. (Just watch her rip the laundry
off the clothes line or unlace a pair of boots.) But there is
evidence of an uncertain girlishness behind the bravado.
</P>
<P>
   Byrne's James has the wry papery voice and stylized mannerisms
of the wastrel actor who has spent too many nights on Broadway and
the Bowery of the early 1920s. Then there are those truly shocking
moments when his face goes as blank as a cadaver's, and you realize
that those fancy finger waves with which he punctuates the lighting
of a cigarette are used to camouflage delirium tremens.
</P>
<P>
   The unmasking of these characters in the play's second and third
acts is both inevitable and startling. Watch for Dotrice's abrupt,
magical conversion from delirious drunkenness into
all-too-conscious sobriety. And the seduction gone wrong between
Josie and James that is the play's dramatic center is magnificently
executed by Jones and Byrne.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   They grope through a maze of poses and stratagems to define
their feelings for each other, a process that offers some
memory-searing moments.
</P>
<P>
   Watch what happens every time this pair tries to kiss or
embrace, rendered as a sharply limned series of conflicting
impulses. Pay attention to Josie's hapless, yet stirringly sexual,
attempt to play the vamp, hiking her skirt above her knees. And
notice how James registers the abrupt arrival of poisonous memories
with the startled pain of someone stabbed from behind.
</P>
<P>
   Each is finally brought to a painfully wrought climax of
self-revelation. Jones delivers hers with a sad yet enchanting air
of violated modesty, and then generously turns the stage over to
Byrne for the astonishing confession of shame he offers up while
cradled in Jones' arms.
</P>
<P>
   Criticism of previous productions of ``Moon'' has often centered
on Josie's dominance in a play that was written by O'Neill as a
benediction for the dead brother on whom James is based.
</P>
<P>
   This is definitely not a problem here. Byrne's long third-act
monologue, its shifts in mood exquisitely set off by Pat Collins'
lighting, is a harrowing act of self-administered surgery, etched
in escalating degrees of pain. It is, in a word, brilliant, itself
the stuff of theatrical legend.
</P>
<P>
   Jones is quiet for most of that speech, which is not to say that
she disappears. She becomes instead an almost elemental presence,
embodying the radiant spirit of acceptance and forgiveness that
makes ``Moon'' unlike anything else O'Neill wrote.
</P>
<P>
   She also somehow remains affectingly, achingly human in her
transfiguration. And we leave the theater wishing not only that we
could have such a confessor as Jones' Josie, but also that we might
have the power to offer such comfort to another. O'Neill assumed
both roles in writing this play. This splendid production makes
sure that, vicariously, we do, too.

INSURANCE COMPANIES CAUTIOUSLY ENTER THE INTERNET WATERS
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By BOB TEDESCHI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Insurance companies have always seen fit to take the long view
of business, scanning actuarial tables for potential revenue
streams years after their products are sold.
</P>
<P>
   It is not surprising, then, that the industry has greeted the
fleet-footed world of Internet commerce with, at best, muted
enthusiasm.
</P>
<P>
   Executives acknowledge the Web's potential for simplifying the
byzantine process of finding insurance quotes and applying for
coverage, but they also note the downsides. For one, they say
consumers cannot use the Web to speak with real people in real time
about the complexities of coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Of far greater concern for insurance carriers like State Farm
and Allstate, though, is the notion that if they sell directly to
consumers through their own Web sites, they risk an insurrection
among the insurance agents who have been their bedrock source of
revenue.
</P>
<P>
   In Internet vernacular, this is referred to as ``channel
conflict,'' the same malaise that has besets countless companies
that depend on retailers for profit. Apparel makers like Tommy
Hilfiger, consumer goods companies like Procter &AMP; Gamble, and music
marketers like Sony have all waded cautiously into the e-commerce
waters rather than risk abandonment by their retailers. And yet, as
Internet insurgents start to peck away at their bottom line, many
mainstream businesses are accepting the fact that they must sell
directly to consumers online, while doing what they can to mollify
retailers.
</P>
<P>
   So it is with insurance. Companies like Allstate have announced
plans to sell online, and others are indicating that they may not
be far behind. But these are modest steps at best. Forrester
Research predicts that by 2004, $13.5 billion of insurance will be
sold online _ a fraction of an annual total of about $900 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the reason for such gradualism, analysts say, is that
even those carriers that want to sell some of their various types
of insurance over the Web have run into technological hurdles. Each
type of insurance can have widely varying underwriting rules,
depending on where it is sold and to whom it is sold and the
companies must work intensively to build systems that make such
information available on the Web, when potential customers want it.
</P>
<P>
   ``With a lot of sites, you can fill out forms, but they send you
an e-mail quote two days later,'' said Todd Eyler, a Forrester
analyst. In addition, many sites for insurance carriers have an
agent call the customer directly with the quote after the forms
have been completed online. ``The Internet is all about immediate
gratification, and this flies in the face of that idea,'' Eyler
said.
</P>
<P>
   Technology companies are racing to build systems that allow
insurance carriers to provide real-time quotes and either sell
policies online or allow so-called insurance marketplaces like
Intuit's Quicken Insurance, Insurance.com and InsWeb to do so. And
though these technology companies spare the carriers the time and
expense of building their own systems, the task of integrating the
carriers' old software with the new can take six months or more.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, the technology companies operate the online
insurance marketplaces as well. InsWeb, for example, provides
insurance quotes on its site on behalf of other companies, while
also selling software that helps carriers like Amica and Sun Life
sell insurance on their own sites.
</P>
<P>
   Hussein A. Enan, InsWeb's chief executive, said the company got
most of its revenue from referral fees it collected while operating
its own site. By selling the technology that allows carriers to
provide quotes online, however, InsWeb has created a revenue stream
that will surpass the company's other revenues ``not too far in the
future,'' Enan said.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said insurance marketplace sites could thrive even
without such business-to-business revenues. ``If you go to each
carrier's site you have to fill out the same 50 questions,'' said
Eyler of Forrester. ``So the first chance a consumer gets to answer
the questions once and get quotes quickly from all the big
companies, that's pretty powerful.''
</P>
<P>
   Eyler said he expected all the major insurance carriers to go
online in the next year and at least offer quotes, if not sell
directly to consumers. The resulting growth of product offerings
within the insurance marketplaces could enliven competition, which
has grown stiffer with Insurance.com's entrance earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   Although the marketplaces do not regard the individual carriers'
sites as competition _ because they expect consumers to want to do
comparison shopping _ the carriers could encroach on the
marketplaces' turf in the future.
</P>
<P>
   One insurance executive who spoke on condition of anonymity
suggested that the insurance carriers could follow the lead of
United Airlines, which not only gives prices for its own flights on
the company Web site, but also provides prices of competitors.
Indeed, Progressive Insurance, a carrier that sells auto and other
insurance directly to consumers on its Web site, enables users to
get quotes from its company and three competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Marketplaces that also sell the systems that put carriers onto
the Web say such a prospect is not alarming. ``That's OK,'' said
Enan of InsWeb. ``Even if that happens, whose technology are they
going to use?''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Online insurance sellers have generally kept their prices
consistent with those of their offline counterparts, preferring to
highlight the convenience of comparison shopping. But that could
change, given the operational costs that companies can save by
using the Web. Alan Bauer, who leads Progressive's Internet unit,
said most prices were based on the expected lifetime costs of the
customer, which include the company's advertising and overhead
costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't really know the claim or retention characteristics of
online buyers yet,'' Bauer said. ``If the evolution of e-commerce
means brand loyalty fails, it could be that our costs might not go
down. On the other hand, someone might be willing to make a bet on
those costs and cut their prices.''
</P>
<P>
   That is precisely the strategy of ePolicy, a spinoff of
CalSurance, a broker of insurance for small businesses. Donald E.
Martin, the chief executive of both CalSurance and ePolicy, said
that ePolicy had begun selling policies online at premiums 20
percent below those of CalSurance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We reduce our commission because we don't need a sales force
for this, and we're processing it on behalf of the carrier in a way
that's less costly,'' Martin said, noting that he can then extract
lower prices from the carriers. ``It's a sustainable competitive
advantage.''
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, because ePolicy works so closely with CalSurance,
the carriers it represents can avoid the stigma of selling directly
to consumers _ and risking the contempt of other agents.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Martin does not see much reason to fear a rebellion
among agents of his other company, CalSurance, which sells the same
products as ePolicy. ``As the size of an account gets larger and
more complex, people need the advice of a professional, and you
can't do that with a Web project,'' he said. ``The people who talk
about the Internet being the death of the insurance agent are the
same ones who talked about Y2K.''

 By ALEX KUCZYNSKI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Malcolm Gladwell is a 36-year-old social recluse (by
his own description) who has in the last four years written for The
New Yorker about subjects as various as how postwar American
history has been influenced by hair dye, why some people seem to
know everyone, how crime rates dropped in New York City and why the
Aaron Spelling series ``Melrose Place'' was so popular with viewers
in their 30s (they were probably in a state of arrested
adolescence).
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, Gladwell published his first book, ``The
Tipping Point: How Little Things Can Make a Big Difference''
(Little, Brown), a study of how fads become fads. The 279-page book
_ for which Gladwell was paid an advance of $1.5 million, or about
$5,376 a page _ draws from Gladwell's expertise as a science
reporter, his interest in pop anthropology and his affinity for
technology.
</P>
<P>
   And true to his reputation as a technology oriented, forward
thinking kind of guy, Gladwell is the only staff writer at The New
Yorker who maintains a personal and fully stocked Web site,
complete with all his articles for The New Yorker archived and
indexed. (He owns the rights to his articles; The New Yorker does
not.) The site, Gladwell.com, has received 85,000 hits so far this
month.
</P>
<P>
   But Gladwell.com is not a promotional device, Gladwell said. The
site has excerpts from ``The Tipping Point,'' but his book is not
available through the site. Gladwell said he started Gladwell.com
more out of a sense of literary civitas than marketing opportunism.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have run into some people who think it is arrogant to have
your own Web site,'' he said. ``But it's a pain to fax people your
articles all the time, which is the main reason I have the Web
site. My view is that it is not any different from publishing a
collection of your articles in book form. Certainly charging for
stuff that's already been published seems slightly more arrogant
than making it available on the Web site for free.''
</P>
<P>
   The greatest advantage of Gladwell.com, Gladwell said, is
response from visitors to the site, who e-mail their comments and
ideas to Gladwell, and also unwittingly offer themselves up as a
kind of human petri dish for Gladwell's study.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd be surprised at what you learn,'' Gladwell said. ``It's
not this selfless exercise. An incredible number of my ideas come
from incredibly random conversations I have. In fact, all of them
do. So the more random conversations the better, and these are all
small, random conversations.''
</P>
<P>
   On the Web site, he is able to note which articles are most
popular and which are least read _ a kind of free market survey.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can see which pieces intrigue people's imagination and
which pieces clearly are not moving anyone's imagination,''
Gladwell said. ``The least clicked-on is some wonky, really boring
piece I once wrote about innovation,'' he said. The most clicked-on
article, he said, is ``Six Degrees of Lois Weisberg,'' a 1999
article about a Chicago woman who for no readily discernible reason
has an enormous network of interconnected friends around the world.
(She is the mother of one of Gladwell's close friends, Jacob
Weisberg, a political correspondent for the online magazine Slate.)
</P>
<P>
   ``I have lots of connectors in my life,'' Gladwell said,
referring to his term for people who appear to know a lot of
people. ``But I am not a connector. I have a relatively small
circle of friends. I'm not social at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Gladwell has the asocial, solitary air of an only child, but he
has two brothers: one is a music teacher and the other, he said,
``works in processed chicken.'' Born in England and raised in
Canada, he was trained as a science writer and worked as a reporter
at The Washington Post until Tina Brown hired him at The New Yorker
in 1996. His father is English, and his mother is Jamaican _ he
said that she is related to Gen. Colin Powell _ and the issue of
race has informed Gladwell's writing. In The Washington Post in
1996, for example, he reviewed an issue of The New Yorker on race,
noting that his admiration for the issue had nothing to do with his
skin color, ``which is white,'' he wrote. Three years later, in an
article in The New Yorker about athletic ability and race, Gladwell
wrote of running for his high school track team and whether his
``Africanness'' intimidated any of his track colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   He said that when his parents met in college in England in the
1950s, race was an issue; his mother even wrote a book, ``Brown
Face, Big Master,'' about her experiences as a black woman in
Jamaica and England. But race is no longer a preoccupation for the
family, Gladwell said, and he no longer considers race a strong
theme in his writing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what I consider myself,'' Gladwell said. ``It's
too complex. There are too many ways to define yourself, and it's
not a way I have chosen to define myself anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   On his Web site, Gladwell has chosen one defining picture of
himself. In the photograph, he is 5 years old and is wearing a
bathrobe that looks like a sort of Roman toga and carrying the lid
of a garbage can.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's my shield,'' he said. ``I thought the idea of doing
battle with the world seemed appropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   Gladwell's book has not made a significant mark on best-seller
lists, a fact that Gladwell acknowledged left the door open for
irony.
</P>
<P>
   ``You leave yourself open for an incredible amount of
criticism,'' he said, ``when you write a book called `The Tipping
Point,' and it doesn't tip.''

SEX CRIMES DROP IN REVAMPED PORT AUTHORITY BUS STATION

<P>
   NEW YORK  &UR; _ &LR;  A shabbily dressed 12-year-old boy sits on a
plastic bag for hours in the bus departure area at Port Authority
bus station, nodding off to the piped-in music. A 14-year-old girl
stands starry-eyed outside the massive building on 41st Street,
marveling at the neon lights.
</P>
<P>
   These are the types of children that social workers at the Youth
Service Unit of the station label as in ``danger of exploitation.''
In other words, easy prey for a pimp or pedophile looking for a
victim among the runaways and delinquents who end up in the bus
station, fleeing abusive parents or just skipping school.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of kids come here and they want to trust whoever comes
along. Some kids are easy prey,'' says Rachel Forsyth, director of
crisis services at Covenant House, a nearby shelter for homeless
teens.
</P>
<P>
   In years past, the youngsters were in considerable danger. In
1995, for example, police had to deal with some 60 sex offenses
against children in the bus station, some from repeat offenders,
says Sgt. Bernard Poggioli, director of the Youth Services Unit.
</P>
<P>
   But all that has changed. Last year, the Youth Services Unit
helped 286 runaways _ and arrested just five sex offenders. ``Sex
crimes at Port Authority have gone down about 90 percent in the
past five years,'' Poggioli says. ``We're less overrun with
undesirable types. Now we can concentrate on the kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Poggioli credits the drastic drop in these types of crimes to
the efforts to revamp the bus station and clean up Times Square in
general. Over the past decade, neighborhood groups such as the
Times Square Business Improvement District and the Square's new
owners, including Disney Corp., have poured millions of dollars
into changing its image so that it attracts a more wholesome crowd.
Most of the peep shows and porno houses have been closed and
replaced with superstores and new theaters to bring in sightseers
and shoppers. Local businesses convinced the city to reopen the
Midtown Community Court to deal exclusively with arrests in the
area.
</P>
<P>
   ``The intention of the improvement of Times Square was to make
it safe again,'' says Brendan Sexton, president of the Times Square
Business Improvement District. ``It used to be regarded as an
entertainment district with cabaret, first-run movie houses and an
opera, but it became decrepit, abused and scary. Now we've returned
it to the people of New York.''
</P>
<P>
   For its part, Port Authority increased security, improved
lighting and tightened management at the bus station, measures that
helped usher in a 36 percent drop in crime, from 2,295 incidents in
1997 to 1,475 last year, according to Port Authority Spokesman Alan
Hicks. The drop is even greater from previous years, police say.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids were being pimped right out of the hotels around here,
even out of Covenant House,'' Poggioli said. (Covenant House
officials confirm that practice occurred.)
</P>
<P>
   People were using the pay phones to pimp children, telling a
child, for example, to talk to ``that man over there'' on the
phone, pointing to a client or pimp on another pay phone within
sight. It got so bad that about five years ago, Port Authority
police mounted a sting operation, equipping children with wires and
setting up video cameras to catch pimps in the act of recruiting.
</P>
<P>
   Bell Atlantic has since installed phones that do not accept
incoming calls. The station has also changed the technology on its
emergency doors so that they stay locked until an emergency arises.
Before this, homeless people and drug addicts have been living in
the stairwells and pedophiles would lure children into them for
sexual acts. ``You wouldn't believe some of the stuff that went on
here,'' Poggioli says. ``One girl told us she conceived her child
in the stairwell and gave birth to it there.''
</P>
<P>
   Youth Services also stepped up preventive measures. Plainclothes
police officers approach unaccompanied children and ask them for
identification and a bus ticket to show their destination. If the
child is with an adult, the adult must prove he is the parent or
guardian.
</P>
<P>
   If the officer finds the situation suspicious, he brings the
child to a social worker in the back office, who arranges for the
child to be sent home or put in a shelter. The adult may be charged
with solicitation or contributing to the delinquency of a minor.
</P>
<P>
   Certain situations set off alarm bells for officers. ``If you
saw a 12-year-old girl making out with a 38-year-old man, wouldn't
it raise your suspicions?'' asks Edwin Rodriguez, one of the three
police officers assigned to the Youth Services Unit.
</P>
<P>
   An adult who is spotted several times in the bus loading area
without a ticket is also questioned, Poggioli says. ``If the guy
shows up three, four times without getting on a bus, we know he's
probably got no legitimate reason to be there.''
</P>
<P>
   The perpetrators of sex crimes at the bus station don't fit a
narrow profile. Movie stars, priests and drug addicts are equally
represented. One man from New Jersey was paying children $40 for a
sexual act and $150 if they recruited another child, Poggioli said.
</P>
<P>
   But now that Times Square has gotten rid of most of its drug
addicts and prostitutes, it's easier to spot sexual predators among
the crowds at the bus station, police say.
</P>
<P>
   ``Years ago, there were so many undesirables in the area, one
more didn't matter,'' says Poggioli. ``But if you see a person in
here, walking around a talking to kids, they stand out like sore
thumbs. Most of our perps have either died, moved someplace else or
they're locked up.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Poggioli cautions, such crimes haven't gone away _ just
underground.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, child molesters are soliciting underage sex
through Internet chat groups, away from the eyes of the police.
</P>
<P>
   Except when the kids arrange to meet the molester at the bus
station. In those cases, says Poggioli, ``usually, we get to them
first.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ There was a time, not too long ago, when you were a
fine pet owner as long as you fed your pet table scraps or chow,
took it to the vet when necessary, and maybe bought a latex toy for
it to chew on.
</P>
<P>
   Today, you would border on negligence.
</P>
<P>
   The pet owner of today, according to a growing number of
health-conscious animal lovers, should provide organic food,
nutritional supplements, interactive toys and videos, and holistic
remedies such as acupuncture, massage and aromatherapy. Over the
past 15 years or so, an entire industry has sprung up to supply
organic nutrition and holistic care to pets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Supermarket pet food is full of crap,'' says Norma Otero, the
manager at Whiskers Holistic Pet Care, a 13-year-old store in the
East Village. ``Would you want to eat road kill and factory
byproducts? Why would you give that to your pet? Even a human can
eat my food.'' Whiskers sells organic, all-natural pet foods. The
list of ingredients on any package of food reads like a regular
grocery list: chicken, corn, carrots ... There are no chemical
ingredients ending in ``-ide'' or ``-ate,'' which appear frequently
on most of the lists on most processed pet foods.
</P>
<P>
   Feeding a pet those processed foods all the time ``is like
giving your kid Trix versus Grape Nuts or Cheerios,'' says Amy
Shapiro, owner of two natural pet stores, the eight-year-old
Barking Zoo in Chelsea and the newly opened Another Barking Zoo in
Tribeca.
</P>
<P>
   But advocates for natural pets disagree about premium brands
such as Iams and Hill's Science Diet. Barking Zoos carry them, but
Whiskers does not, because they are processed.
</P>
<P>
   ``They do OK with that food,'' says Dr. Roger Valentine, a Los
Angeles veterinarian who specializes in cats. ``But when people
switch to those premium brands after having their cat on organic
food, the cats get dandruff and loose stools and hairballs and
things like that.'' But Valentine says there is not enough data to
say that cats on organic food are actually living longer.
</P>
<P>
   Lara Strazdin, manager of public relations for Iams Co., isn't
persuaded, either. ``We have not seen any studies that show organic
foods are better than non-organic,'' she says. ``If we did see
that, then honestly, we would switch.'' Iams is processed, but it
considers itself all-natural, because it has no artificial
preservatives, no color or flavor enhancers, and no salt or sugar.
Officials at Hill's Pet Nutrition, maker of Science Diet, did not
return calls seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   But these days, the conscientious pet owner has to consider much
more than food.
</P>
<P>
   Owners also have an array of pet vitamins and food supplements
to choose from, which aid digestion, improve the health of skin and
fur, repel pests and prevent urinary, kidney and liver problems.
There are special foods for pets with injuries, diabetes, allergies
or weak immune systems, and heart, kidney or gastrointestinal
problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been tremendous growth in the industry in the last
10-15 years,'' says Shapiro. ``So many people are inventing new
products and gadgets. More people are finding that the pet market
is a viable marketplace.''
</P>
<P>
   In part, the success of this market is braced by the strong
economy. More Americans than ever can afford extras for their pets.
In addition, people have grown more knowledgeable and open to
healthy living and alternative medicine in general. But the biggest
boon to the pet industry may be the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Net has done wonders,'' Shapiro says. As people have gone
online to research their own health and alternative medicines in
particular, pet owners have also educated themselves about pet-care
options on hundreds of informational Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   Many pet stores now have online outlets, so for people who don't
live near a Whiskers or a Barking Zoo, natural pet supplies are
just several clicks away. But while the Internet has helped build
awareness and a customer base for natural pet supplies, some store
owners see a downside. Shapiro says she appreciates the added
business from her online customers, but worries that independent
pet stores are getting squeezed out by big online outlets such as
pets.com and petopia.com.
</P>
<P>
   The local stores have one important advantage. Pets and owners
can visit them on their walks. Inside, people can see how certain
products go over with their pets before buying. Aside from the
myriad food choices, there are organic bones and treats as an
alternative to rawhide, which Otero says is difficult to digest and
contains bleach and glue. There is a cat litter, World's Best, made
from 100 percent kernel corn, which is recommended because it is
flushable and the cat will digest it easily if it licks the litter
off its paws afterward. There are books and videos on alternative
pet therapies, such as acupuncture, Chinese and Western herbology,
massage, aromatherapy, color therapy and homeopathy.
</P>
<P>
   So how much will it cost you to become a natural pet owner? A
lot. A seven-pound bag of World's Best cat litter costs more than
twice as much as the more mainstream Fresh Step at the Barking
Zoos. A 13-ounce can of organic dog food costs up to $3.99 at
Whiskers, while a same-sized can of Friskies' Alpo costs 69 cents
at RiteAid.
</P>
<P>
   In the long run, ``It may be more expensive, but your pet is
healthier and happier, and you'll spend less at the vet,'' says
Shapiro, who owns a greyhound.
</P>
<P>
   Customers agree. ``It's a big expense,'' admits Noel Canfield,
who has shopped for her seven cats at Whiskers ever since it
opened. She used to buy processed cat food, but after she lost a
cat to cancer, she started studying what was in the food and
switched to organic. ``It's been worth it because no one's been
really sick in my cat family,'' she said. ``It boosts their immune
system. I'm a nurse, and I feel like I'm being a good parent, if
you will.'' In addition, she says, organic food looks and smells
better.
</P>
<P>
   After all, money spent on pets is really spent on owners. People
see pets as benefits to their own health. Recent studies say pets
lower stress and blood pressure. Some hospitals are even using
pet-facilitated therapies.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are valuing animals more than ever, and want to take
care of them,'' says Canfield. ``I want them to be around as long
as possible.''

OPERA GETS HIP, APPEALS TO YOUNGER FANS

<P>
   NEW YORK _ On prime-time TV, beer-drinking young men sing opera
over pints of Guinness. Flip the channel, and a Perdue ad features
an opera soundtrack while a baking chicken rotates on a skewer.
</P>
<P>
   On Broadway, the cast of the musical version of ``Aida''
performs song lyrics by pop icon Elton John. New York City
club-goers dance to pulsing house music in a recently opened club
named Aria, where the restrooms are labeled ``sopranos'' and
``tenors'' and the over-sized paintings and lush decor are
reminiscent of an opera house.
</P>
<P>
   The once-stodgy opera is showing up in some unusual places,
inundating audiences that are anything but the traditional
opera-going fans. And the trend is catching on. Opera ticket sales
are up, especially among young adults, and advertising firms say
their operatic commercials are selling products so successfully
that they're making more.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Bowen, director of business development for Merkley,
Newman and Harty, a SoHo advertising firm, recently finished
producing a commercial for the National Thoroughbred Racing
Association. It features horses running past the finish line as an
opera soundtrack accents the cheers and heartbreak of the fans. The
campaign is geared toward men 25-55, even though the median age for
opera goers is 44, and more women than men are fans, according to
the National Endowment for the Arts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Advertising is always looking for something to cut through the
clutter in both sight and sound,'' Bowen said. ``Opera is unusual
enough and still approachable, and it makes people look up. It's
the perfect counterpoint to real world action.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The opera is sheer spectacle and emotion,'' said Tom Gulick,
who in January initiated the Silicon Valley Initiative to market
opera to young professionals for the San Francisco Opera. ``It's
fascinating, entertaining, multimedia, and it gets you away from
work.''
</P>
<P>
   Opera companies across the country have groups that organize
events to draw in young professionals to the opera. The number of
18- to 24-year-olds attending opera performances in the U.S.
increased by 18 percent between 1982 and 1992, and a third of the
U.S. opera audience is under 35, according to the National
Endowment for the Arts.
</P>
<P>
   At the Michigan Opera Theatre in Detroit, the Young
Professionals throw opera theme parties where members can win
``weekend fun'' prize packages that include dinner, hotel,
transportation and, of course, a performance. At the San Francisco
Opera, the Bravo Club hosts postopera parties where members dance
till dawn. Many Bravo Club members heard about the Opera via its
Web site, which has generated $1.5 million in ticket sales, more
than 50 percent from first-time ticket buyers whose average age was
35.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying very hard to make opera the hip thing to try
out,'' said Elizabeth Connell, public relations director for the
San Francisco Opera. ``We all know fads come and go.''
</P>
<P>
   Today's wealthy 20- and 30-somethings enjoy the feeling of
luxury that a night at the opera offers, she said. ``It's a great
date,'' Connell said. ``It's fun to get in your party dress and
have a glass of Champagne during intermission.''
</P>
<P>
   Opera attendance has been rising steadily since 1982. The three
tenors, Placido Domingo, Jose Carreras and Luciano Pavarotti, have
brought opera to hundreds of thousands of fans through TV
performances and recordings of a ``lighter'' repertoire than
classic opera. Andrea Bocelli, an Italian opera sensation who has
had some pop music crossover hits, is touring North America this
spring. On April 5, he will perform at Atlanta's new Philips Arena.
The venue, designed with input from R.E.M.'s Mike Mills, has luxury
suites in one seating area, offering a unique ``opera house'' feel.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, MTV's Music Video Awards was presented at the Met.
The opening number for the live show featured opera music, while
the event's ad campaign used pop singer Britney Spears, 17, dressed
in a traditional ``Carmen'' costume.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Farley, a consultant for Ludgate Communications, saw the
modern opera ``Squonk'' for a friend's birthday and loved it. She
said she didn't realize until halfway through the performance that
it was an opera.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'll feel like you're in a music video through the whole
thing,'' she said. ``I've never liked the opera.''
</P>
<P>
   Today's audience likes highly visual events such as these, said
Eleanor Dyer, the opera specialist for the National Endowment of
the Arts. So she's not surprised that the opera is now growing in
popularity.
</P>
<P>
   ``The opera has music, design, production, a good story line and
visual effects,'' she said. ``It's a heightened emotional
awareness.''
</P>
<P>
   Opera houses have added subtitles in the last 15 years to
translate the words to the music, which are traditionally sung in
foreign languages. The words are either projected on a large screen
above the stage, or appear on individual screens on the back of
seats.
</P>
<P>
   ``The use of surtitles opened up the field of opera to a new
generation who didn't understand before,'' Dyer said. ``Even for
the people who understood the general story line but didn't speak
the language fluently, a whole new world of humor has opened up.''
</P>
<P>
   Raj Sundaram, 32, saw ``Madama Butterfly,'' his second opera
performance, at the Met while on vacation with his wife. A San
Francisco architect, Sundaram is part of the new generation opera
fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``The opera's intellectually stimulating and a great time,'' he
said. ``It might even be better than sticking beers down my
throat.''

   NEW YORK _ A handful of people peruse the shelves of the reading
room. Here is the gay magazine Out, featuring a beautiful man in a
tight Boy Scout uniform. Across the room is The Jewish Sentinel
with a story on the poor in Israel. The pros and cons of Jewish day
schools are fodder for the Journal of the Jewish Theological
Seminary. And Spin is highlighting the alternative rock group Rage
Against the Machine.
</P>
<P>
   This is the room that greets people entering Makor, a decidedly
different cultural center for Jewish young people. It's a place
where rabbis teach Yiddish classes on the third floor, while a
lively crowd enjoys a poetry slam over beer and wine downstairs.
From a restored townhouse on the Upper West Side, Makor offers a
blend of religion and culture with a hip twist.
</P>
<P>
   The product of focus groups and market research, Makor, which
means ``source'' in Hebrew, is designed to make Judaism more
comfortable for people who otherwise are not drawn to their
heritage. It is aimed at the estimated 100,000 New York Jews
between 22 and 35.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to reach people where they are culturally,'' said the
center's creative director, Rabbi David Gedzelman, a Conservative
Jew. ``We want to give opportunities for exploration, so younger
Jews can find who they are, what their talents are.''
</P>
<P>
   Gedzelman, backed by an $11 million philanthropic grant, opened
the center last September after researching the cultural likes and
dislikes of young Jews. He decided that entertainment and a social
atmosphere had to be part of any attempt to promote Jewish
education.
</P>
<P>
   For jazz fans, there are jazz nights with the hottest local
groups. If Yiddish celebratory music is more your taste, the
klezmer band shows may appeal. Weekly Sabbath dinners, with themes
like ``Judaism and Vegetarianism,'' complement Sunday guitar jams.
</P>
<P>
   ``To say it is unique is an understatement,'' said Rabbi Seth
Frisch of the Conservative Fifth Avenue synagogue. ``In Jewish
history, the greatest advances came when great religions freely
shared theological and cultural insights. There is a new synthesis,
a new art. What bad could possibly come of that?''
</P>
<P>
   On a recent Saturday night, a well-dressed crowd of 200 mingled
in Makor's sleek bar, drinking and dancing to a swing band called
Jet Set Six.
</P>
<P>
   Two women with straight, shoulder-length hair sat off to the
side at a table. They said Makor presented a welcome new social
opportunity for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not all places are respectable for Jewish girls to be at,''
said Stephanie Blanchard, 24, an editor at Soap Opera Weekly who
described herself as no longer an observant Jew. ``This is like a
multifaceted Y. It would be patronizing to assume that you can
gather Jews only by preaching to them. Everyone with a common
interest, to meet other young Jewish people, now has a place to
go.''
</P>
<P>
   Blanchard, in a long, dark dress, fits perfectly into Makor's
target demographic _ young Jews who need a new reason to return to
Jewish circles. The center's aim is that the patrons who are drawn
by the entertainment scene will eventually become interested in the
religious side of the center.
</P>
<P>
   Poetry slams are one of Makor's biggest attractions. Men wearing
yarmulkes join women in black tight dresses to hear poets read
about lower East Side prostitutes and life in Tel Aviv. Most work
presented at a recent slam did have a Jewish subtext. Andy Horwitz,
rotund and sporting a shaved head, read his comical ``Self-Hating
Jew'' and garnered almost perfect scores from the panel of judges
in the audience.
</P>
<P>
   David Lang, a Jewish poet competing in the slam, appreciated the
Jewishness of the place.
</P>
<P>
   ``I come more for the social aspects than religiosity,'' he
said. ``But I might come to the Jewish things. It is an amazing
space. I feel comfortable here.''
</P>
<P>
   Movie nights at Makor feature classics like ``Some Like It Hot''
and ``Five Easy Pieces'' and documentaries with such themes as the
origins of bebop. Gedzelman said he will include more
Jewish-oriented entertainment as time passes, following the
successful shows by Inasense, a psychedelic band of Orthodox Jews,
and the band Hasidic New Wave.
</P>
<P>
   So far, acceptance of Makor has cut across the often disparate
boundaries in Jewish culture. From modern Orthodox to Reform
practitioners, the center wins acclaim.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as the secular culture being used is `kosher,' '' said
Dani Davis, the program director in the youth department of the
National Council of Young Israel, a national coordinating agency
for Orthodox congregations, ``it is absurd to say you can't use it
to educate and bring back non-observant Jews.''
</P>
<P>
   Lest anyone complain that the club frowns on non-Jewish patrons,
Makor staff members emphatically insist that all are welcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not exclude anyone,'' said Makor's musical director,
Brice Rosenbloom. ``We try to focus on Jews but a mixed crowd will
make it feel more like a club.``
</P>
<P>
   So far, it's too soon to say if the Makor bar scene is yielding
devotees of Jewish practice. Gedzelman said he plans a survey on
that point. For now, Gedzelman is pleased that attendance stands at
up to 1,000 people a week. By the fall, he hopes to double that.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ In the 10 years David Taylor has been behind the
counter of Mann's Deli Restaurant in Harlem, he says he has never
been as busy as he has been lately. Ever since an Old Navy clothing
store opened in a sleek glass and steel mall near his soul-food
restaurant last month, Taylor said, business has picked up.
</P>
<P>
   The opening of a 275,000-square-foot mall and the arrival of
national chain stores such as Starbucks, Blockbuster Video and Rite
Aid on 125th Street, Harlem's main drag, are signs that the
neighborhood is on the upswing. Old Navy is the first clothing
store to open at the Harlem U.S.A. mall, but a Disney store, a
Chase Manhattan bank, an HMV Records store, a nine-screen multiplex
theater and a gym will soon follow. While some local merchants are
waiting for the entire mall to open, they say they are optimistic
about Harlem's economic future. Taylor said that he notices more
traffic on 125th Street and that the streets are safer because more
police officers are present.
</P>
<P>
   ``The construction workers come in here to dine, so do the
customers at Old Navy,'' said Taylor, 31. ``When the rest of the
mall opens, I expect our sales to increase by at least ten
percent.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, if people here can afford $3 cafe lattes, then it
couldn't be all that bad,'' said Donald Benson, 35, an assistant
manager at the Starbucks on the corner of 125th Street and Malcolm
X Boulevard.
</P>
<P>
   The coffee chain store is partly owned by Magic Johnson and its
interior features inspirational quotes on the wall along with a
photo of the basketball legend holding a cup of coffee. Since its
opening in Harlem last May, Benson said the response from locals
has been positive. ``We make an average of $1,700 per day and we're
thinking about expanding our store,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good news for everybody,'' said Benson. ``If Starbucks
can make it in a place like Harlem, then it can make it anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   On a recent afternoon at Starbucks, several foreign tourists
stopped by to get their caffeine fix and take a break from their
neighborhood excursion. Anna Jacobson, 29, a Swedish expatriate
living in Lower Manhattan, brought her mother, Christina Ahlin, 57,
to visit Harlem. It was Ahlin's first day in town, and she wanted
to see Harlem first. Jacobson, who has lived in New York for three
years, said that she frequently shops in Harlem.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stores are funky and the clothes are cheap,'' said
Jacobson. ``I get a good deal on sneakers.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the streets here,'' she added. ``It's livelier and
people are more in-your-face. Down in the East Village where I
live, people like to show off too much. In Harlem, everything is
more real.''
</P>
<P>
   Melodie Brown, 32, a Harlem resident, was also in the cafe
sipping on a tall cup of coffee, a bag of clothes from Old Navy and
a cage she bought at a pet store by her side. Brown has lived in
Harlem all her life and said that she is happy to see more
businesses coming in.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's more convenient for me to walk down to 125th Street than
take the subway to downtown just to buy some clothes,'' she said.
``I also think about spending money here to support the local
businesses or big stores that employ black people. You make a
conscious decision to spend money here and keep the cash flow in
the community.''
</P>
<P>
   For years, many stores on 125th Street were boarded up. The
mostly small businesses that were operating struggled in this
traditionally low-income neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   The retail development is a result of an economic ``empowerment
zone'' created in 1994 by Rep. Charles B. Rangel, a Democrat who
represents Harlem. It offers federal dollars as well as generous
tax breaks for businesses that invest in low-income areas.
According to Terry Lane, president of the Upper Manhattan
Empowerment Zone, $300 million in cash and $250 million in tax
breaks will be invested to attract investors to the area. Harlem
U.S.A. was built on a lot that had been empty for years.
</P>
<P>
   But some small businesses resent the newcomers, as the
improvement increases property values and pushing them out. Sung Il
Oh, 61, the owner of Juno Shoe store, says he is worried he'll have
to close his shop soon because the rent has more than doubled.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to pay $2,000 a month, now I'm paying $5,000 and it
could go up again next month,'' said Oh. ``This big jump doesn't
make sense to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Oh's shop is in the block between the Starbucks and Old Navy. He
has been in business for 15 years and said that since the rent
increase, business has been stagnant. ``I'm not ordering spring or
summer shoes because I might have to close next month, then what
will I do will all the unsold shoes? It'll be a loss, but now all I
have are winter boots and no one is buying them either.''
</P>
<P>
   Philip Bulgar, 35, a counterman at Manna's Deli, said, ``There
are some who tremendously benefit from the new economy, and some
that lose out big time.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet some small businesses say the change don't affect them.
Mahammad Tariq-Wasim, 27, a salesman at Jimmy Jazz, a clothing
store that sells urban street wear, says the Old Navy doesn't
threaten his business. Jimmy Jazz offers designer brands such as
Polo Ralph Lauren, FUBU and Sean John, the clothing label owned by
rapper Sean ``Puffy'' Combs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Young people follow trends closely and they tend to come here
to buy the hottest labels,'' Tariq-Wasim said. ``Old Navy has its
own brand, and there's a place for the store and its customers on
this street too.''
</P>
<P>
   Bulgar, who has lived in Harlem all his life, says it's a good
thing some stores are closing. ``Some places should close because
they're not helping Harlem improve its image,'' he said.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Groundbreaking vaccines of the 1950s nearly stamped
out the polio epidemic that ravaged childhoods and left many of its
victims on crutches. The names Salk and Sabin came to symbolize
triumph, the end of a national scare. Science moved on to other
deadly threats to the population.
</P>
<P>
   But to Benjamin Siragusa, his fight with polio, a disease
thought by most to be long gone, is far from over.
</P>
<P>
   Twelve years ago, more than three decades after what he thought
was his recovery, the unexpected effects of polio began taking a
toll on him. He developed what scientists and polio survivors call
post-polio syndrome, commonly known as PPS. It strikes polio
survivors anywhere from 10 to 40 years after recovery from an
initial attack of polio, according to the National Institute of
Neurological Disorders and Stroke, a division of the National
Institutes of Health. It is not a recurrence of the polio virus
itself, but a further weakening of muscles and deterioration of
nerves that were previously injured by the polio virus.
</P>
<P>
   Although hundreds of thousands of polio survivors now live with
PPS in the United States, finding a cure for PPS isn't a high
priority in the eyes of the government and the scientific
community, researchers say.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are more polio survivors than all Americans with
multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injuries and Parkinson's disease
combined,'' said Dr. Richard Bruno, a director of the Post-Polio
Institute at the Englewood Hospital and Medical Center in New
Jersey, who has been working with PPS patients for 17 years. ``But
Congress will not set aside one dollar.'' Over the next several
years, 100 percent of polio victims will have some symptom that is
attributable to PPS, said Bruno. Worldwide, he said, 15 to 20
million people are polio survivors.
</P>
<P>
   Siragusa, of Syracuse, N.Y., remembers his 50-year-old bout with
polio vividly. Paralyzed by the disease from the neck down at the
age of 4, Siragusa was sent from his home in Watertown, N.Y., to a
rehabilitation center in Ithaca for children with polio. There he
spent six months in a mechanical tube-like ventilator, or ``iron
lung.'' He can still hear the rushing, swooshing sound of the large
metal capsule _ like ``an eerie pulsing noise'' he said _ as it
pushed air in and out of his lungs.
</P>
<P>
   Even though polio left him with crutches and braces, Siragusa
went on to marry, move to Arizona and open an optical business.
</P>
<P>
   He thought his battle with polio was over.
</P>
<P>
   Then 16 years ago, while standing over a display case at work,
he suddenly fell to the floor. His right leg, his ``better leg'' he
calls it because it was less affected by the virus, just gave out
from under him.
</P>
<P>
   In the following weeks, he continued to fall. Soon walking
through large parking lots exhausted him. And he was tired all the
time. Very tired. He knew there was something dreadfully wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Frightened and confused, Siragusa visited a neurologist. ``The
doctor said he had good news and bad news,'' said Siragusa, who is
now 54 and lives in Liverpool, N.Y. ``The good news was that I
didn't have something that would kill me, like Lou Gehrig's
disease. The bad news was that I had something called post-polio
syndrome.'' He had never heard of post-polio syndrome before.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 300,000 polio survivors in the U.S. may be at risk
for PPS, but doctors are unable to establish a firm incidence rate,
the Neurological Institute said. Other researchers estimate the
number to be higher. There are currently 1.63 million living polio
victims in the United States, said Bruno of the Post-Polio
Institute, and at least 75 percent have PPS.
</P>
<P>
   Once Siragusa developed PPS, he said life went downhill fast. He
had to sign over his business to his partner and retire. Now, he
must take pain and anti-inflammatory medication _ 40 to 50 pills a
day. And, according to doctors and researchers, the most he can do
for his weakening body is rest.
</P>
<P>
   Bruno emphasized that polio survivors need to know they are not
lazy or crazy, and that PPS is a progressive neuromuscular disease.
``It's a diagnosis of exclusion,'' said Bruno. When diagnosing PPS,
physicians rule out other diseases, such as anemia and amyotrophic
lateral sclerosis, or Lou Gehrig's disease.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Mauro of Levittown, N.Y., first developed PPS in 1969, 16
years after recovering from polio. After recovering, Mauro rode a
two-wheeler, he said. He was also able to walk all over the campus
of Hofstra University, where he graduated in 1976 with a degree in
sociology.
</P>
<P>
   When Mauro first developed PPS in his early 20s, he initially
was told that his fatigue and shortness of breath was all in his
mind. One doctor gave him Valium. Another told him to take 20 types
of vitamins a day. ``I went through three shrinks, six doctors and
a lot of drugs,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Now 53, he must spend most of his time in a wheelchair and on a
respirator. Because he cannot sit in front of computer for long
periods of time, he lies on a yellow mat atop a butcher block table
with shortened legs whenever he writes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think every doctor going to medical school should be trained
in post-polio syndrome,'' said Mauro, who also began a newsletter
and Web site for disabled people who are single. Medical schools
must ``make doctors aware of the symptoms of PPS so they don't
misdiagnose it.''
</P>
<P>
   Like many other polio survivors, he feels forgotten. He pointed
out that the March of Dimes originally began to help children with
polio. Since the end of the epidemic, the organization changed its
focus to helping babies born with birth defects, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Too many people think polio is no longer in existence.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ In one loud chant, a sixth-grade tour group started
in on the list of planets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars ...'' Their guide at the American
Museum of Natural History's newly renovated Hayden Planetarium sang
along.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune ...'' The guide stopped. The
kids kept shouting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pluto!''
</P>
<P>
   Oops.
</P>
<P>
   The astonished youngsters craned their necks at the eight model
planets hanging from the ceiling. Pluto, what they thought was the
ninth, was not among them.
</P>
<P>
   In a move that raised more than a few astronomical eyebrows, the
planetarium has dropped Pluto from its regal planetary standing,
hewing to a debated view of the very definition of a planet. The
museum is siding with theorists who say that little Pluto is part
of the Kuiper Belt, a mass of big objects beyond Neptune, but not
one of the major planets.
</P>
<P>
   Museum officials say they made the change to reflect what they
see as the mainstream of astronomy and to generate interest in the
solar system. In fact, the museum disputes the categorization of
celestial objects into a list of planets, moons, asteroids and the
like. Instead the museum has separated the heavens into zones, each
containing a mixture of those objects. The decision has fueled a
convoluted _ and not always clearly stated _ debate among
astronomers.
</P>
<P>
   Virginia Trimble, a vice president of the International
Astronomical Union, takes a diplomatic stance as a representative
of an organization to which both sides subscribe. ``As far as we're
concerned it's a planet,'' Trimble said from her office at the
University of California at Irvine. ``But it's also part of the
Kuiper Belt objects.''
</P>
<P>
   That's where the quandary begins, said Michael A'Hearn, an
astronomy professor at the University of Maryland. When Clyde
Tombaugh, an Arizona astronomer, discovered Pluto in 1930, the new
object was classified as a planet.
</P>
<P>
   ``They called it a planet because they had nothing else to call
them,'' A'Hearn said.
</P>
<P>
   By 1992, astronomers discovered more trans-Neptunian objects _
masses beyond Neptune that orbited the sun. These chunks of rock
and ice were named the Kuiper Belt. Pluto fit into both categories.
</P>
<P>
   A'Hearn falls into the school of scientists who don't think this
debate is all that important: ``I have been amazed at how heavily
researchers have come down on one side or the other,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Astronomer Marc Buie, who has mapped Pluto, strongly believes
that being part of the Kuiper Belt does not exclude Pluto from
planethood, and the planetarium's position troubles him.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're playing a game here,'' he said from his office at the
Lowell Observatory in Arizona. ``I can't view it any other way.
Pluto, by definition, is a planet, and to say it isn't will confuse
people in the long run.''
</P>
<P>
   Traditionalists have used a simple definition of a planet: it is
an object that revolves around a sun, is large enough that its
gravity holds it in spherical shape, and is small enough so that
its core does not ignite a fusion reaction _ that would make it a
star.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to let physics tell us what's one kind of object and
what's another,'' Astronomer Alan Stern, director of the Southwest
Research Institute, recently told a National Public Radio audience.
``We simply want to look across the solar system and say, What
burns hydrogen? That's a star. What objects are large enough to be
round and yet do not burn hydrogen? We call those planets if they
orbit the star.''
</P>
<P>
   His point is not completely lost on Charles Liu, an
astrophysicist at the Rose Center for Earth and Space, where the
Hayden Planetarium resides. Liu agrees that Pluto satisfies the
common definition of a planet. But he and his colleagues would call
it a minor planet, better classified as part of the Kuiper Belt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where you're going to get arguments is from those who advocate
a certain definition of planets,'' Liu said. ``For them, it's
either an issue of the definition of the word `planet' _ a word
with no universally accepted definition _ or a matter of
nostalgia.''
</P>
<P>
   Liu's problem with Buie's criteria is that they are so
inclusive. Under them, at least four asteroids, numerous moons and
the spherical Ceres, also in the Kuiper Belt, would qualify as
planets, too.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of just squeezing Pluto in, Liu said, ``we asked how the
solar system presents itself to us.'' Instead of the traditional
emphasis on the ``list'' of nine planets, he said, it's better to
talk about the solar system as a whole. ``It has some small objects
that are interesting and large objects that are interesting,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Hayden's team emphasized five solar system zones. The first
contains the terrestrial planets _ Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars _
that have metallic cores and a rocky crust and orbit closest to the
sun. The next orbit zone is just beyond Mars and features a belt of
asteroids. The gas giants come next: Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and
Neptune. Fourth is the Kuiper Belt, including Pluto. Last comes the
collection of comets and debris called the Ort Cloud.
</P>
<P>
   Liu says Pluto just doesn't fit with the eight major planets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Under no circumstances have we demoted Pluto,'' Liu said.
``Just because we don't call it a major planet doesn't mean it's
not interesting. If we study it, it could really reveal a great
deal about how our solar system was formed.''

FUNERALS GO LIVE ON THE INTERNET

   NEW YORK _ It seems like everything these days is available
online: dating, grocery shopping. Now even the dead are going live.
Funeral home directors say more people are asking for Webcams at
services, so those who can't attend can watch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes people can't be there when they desperately need to
grieve,'' said Henry Rice, owner of Messinger's Mortuary in
Scottsdale, Ariz., who plugged in his funeral Webcam last October.
He said he has broadcasted at least five funerals over the Internet
so far.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people don't have family living in town or they are
older'' and have difficulty traveling, Rice said. ``It's a service
that will help get me more business. Soon, I think, Webcams will be
standard.''
</P>
<P>
   While there is no record of how many funeral homes broadcast
services online, at least four can be found easily on the Internet.
None charge extra for the service. A family that requests it must
provide a list of mourners who want to watch the service via the
funeral home's Web site. Each person is given a special access code
so no one else but those on the list can watch the funeral.
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien, Straaltman, Apfel Funeral Home in Kearney, Neb., which
has been videotaping funerals for five years, began offering
broadcasts of funerals last January.
</P>
<P>
   ``We realized that the Internet is the wave of the future,''
said Stephen O'Brien, owner of the business. ``It doesn't cost us
anything and so we don't charge for it. Just in the last month
we've broadcast two or three services.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien said most people who request the Web service have
relatives in other states. And while some might think there is
something peculiar about watching a funeral on a screen, he
disagreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you know how many people watched Princess Diana's
funeral?'' O'Brien said. ``Do you know how many people watched John
Kennedy's funeral? Why shouldn't Joe Average have the chance to
have his funeral broadcast?''
</P>
<P>
   A funeral home in the Bronx in New York City sees its Webcam as
a way of helping the government save money. Jim Alson, the owner of
the Bronxwood Funeral Home, said some of the relatives who request
the service do so because they are in prison.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had prisoners actually come to services in shackles and
handcuffs,'' he said. Flanked by prison guards, they have to be
kept separate from everyone else. ``With Web access,'' Alson said,
``they can avoid having their families see them in a prison uniform
and the state doesn't have to hire the guards.''
</P>
<P>
   Alson said about half of his clientele are Caribbean, so he gets
numerous requests for Web funerals from places like Jamaica.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not predicting it's going to be a runaway hit, but more
places will do it if it catches on,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Isaac Clark, owner of Grissom-Eastlake Funeral Home in Atlanta,
agreed. Though he does not offer the service, he said he would if
enough customers want it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have much of demand for that stuff because my clients
are mostly poor and can't afford computers,'' said Clark, who's
been a funeral director in Georgia for more than 20 years. ``But if
there's a demand and it impacts my business, you'd better believe
I'll do it.'' Kelly Smith of the Wisconsin-based National Funeral
Directors Association estimated that few of the 21,000 funeral
homes in the country have computers. ``The few funeral homes who
are online with Webcams have them because the owners are into
technology.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith, whose organization arranges seminars on e-commerce for
funeral directors, said that privacy is also an issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Funeral directors are extremely sensitive to the privacy of
families,'' Smith said. ``I think many will not be convinced the
Internet is a safe place to hold a private ceremony.'' Joseph
Lopez, a funeral director at Bryant Mortuary in San Francisco, said
the privacy issue is just one factor that makes him think twice
about Internet funerals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's ridiculous,'' Lopez said. ``How can you really
mourn for someone over a television screen? What's next, a drive-up
window?''
</P>
<P>
   But funeral Webcams do not seem to be going away anytime soon.
Fred Fergerson, the owner of Fergerson Funeral Home in Syracuse,
N.Y., has a Webcam rolling around the clock pointed at the chapel's
front stoop. That means anyone surfing the Internet can watch a
coffin taken out and placed inside a hearse headed for the
cemetery.
</P>
<P>
   ``The front yard of the chapel is just what you'd be seeing if
you were sitting on the curb, so it's open to the public,''
Fergerson said. He says people even come to the window where the
camera is and wave.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Fergerson has only had one family request Web access to
a funeral, but he had a problem with his computer the day of the
service.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to try it away from the chapel,'' he said. ``A
family wants me to set up at the grave site, so we'll see what
happens.''
</P>
<P>
   Four of the funeral homes that offer services via the Internet
ask family members to sign documents acknowledging that they
understand the businesses cannot guarantee success with the
broadcast. Families are also warned that the Internet is not a
secure medium.
</P>
<P>
   ``These services are not for the general public,'' Alson said.
``Our biggest fear would be if people learned how to bust through
our system and crash a funeral.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ John ``Indio'' Washington has seen it all, done it
all, and lived to tell the tale.
</P>
<P>
   The former New York City case manager, job developer, social
worker, arbitrator and mediator explains: ``I have a doctorate in
theology. And I have a Ph.D. in street-ology as well as sex-ology
and hip-ology. You name it, I claim it.''
</P>
<P>
   It's Indio's combination of experience and braggadocio that
makes him the longest-running editor of Street News, a tabloid that
bills itself as the ``world's oldest active homeless paper.''
</P>
<P>
   What started as an experiment in 1989 _ a newspaper about and
sold by the homeless _ has spawned a worldwide publishing
phenomenon. Bolstered by Web sites and a news service, over 100
``street newspapers'' fill a hole left by mainstream media on
homeless issues.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in the Times Square Brewery on 42nd Street, Indio, 61,
smokes Newport Menthol 100s and drinks beer among the noontime
tourists. Short and thin with a devilish smile, Indio (a name that
came to him while meditating) is covered in blue Street News
clothing: baseball cap, sweatshirt and sweatpants.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've helped over 10,000 people get back into the
mainstream,'' he says in a raspy voice. ``I know we have helped
people live another day.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Pops,'' who has been selling Street News on the subway and
around Times Square since 1989, knows very well what it's like to
live day to day. The Alabama-born vendor, homeless in the early
1990s, used to sell a hundred papers a day, but now sells between
20 and 30.
</P>
<P>
   ``Street News doesn't speak for the homeless,'' says the gray
bearded man with one-tooth smile, who now lives in an apartment run
by a social service agency. ``It lets the homeless speak to the
people. A lot of people don't want to hear about homeless people.
They don't want to see it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Street News concept is simple: homeless and poor people take
10 copies of each issue to sell. They keep whatever they sell them
for. They can then buy more copies for 60 cents each, and sell them
for the $1.60 cover price. About 50 vendors sell the paper, Indio
says, including 6 women.
</P>
<P>
   The latest 48-page issue covers topics like the mayor's homeless
policy, police brutality and rent control, and lists where to find
free food and clothing. Professors, students, advocates and the
formerly homeless also write columns, profiles and poems.
</P>
<P>
   Since Street News doesn't receive public funding, advertising
pays for most of the $4,000 printing and distribution costs. Indio,
who says he doesn't receive a salary for his work, has cut down to
an 8,000-copy run, from a high of 20,000.
</P>
<P>
   Born and raised in Harlem, Indio says he has several degrees,
including a Doctorate of Divinity from the Unity Universal Life
Church in Modesto, Calif. After serving over two years in prison
for drug possession and after a divorce in the mid-1980s, Indio
says he suffered a nervous breakdown, started smoking crack and
fell into homelessness.
</P>
<P>
   Indio started selling Street News in 1989, making $150 to $300 a
week. He later edited alongside Lee Stringer, who wrote ``Grand
Central Winter'' (Seven Stories Press, 1998) about homelessness.
Indio ascended to the editor's position in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Now he finds himself on a soapbox from which he doesn't plan to
step down.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things I'm not happy with is that the majority of
the main media do not have homeless people giving their opinion,''
he says, exhaling a cloud of smoke. ``In experience, you can't
touch us. So why don't you let us participate?''
</P>
<P>
   Timothy Harris, editor and founder of Real Change, a street
newspaper in Seattle, echoes Indio's sentiments.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a voice of the poor that doesn't exist otherwise,''
Harris says. ``The major media largely ignores the homeless. In the
'80s, homelessness was an issue, and now it's not.''
</P>
<P>
   Harris hopes to create the Associated Press of street
newspapers: the Street News Service. Expanding from the current
Homeless News Service, the Web-based repository should enable
papers to reprint articles for free when it launches in April on
Alternet, which distributes articles from alternative news sources
(www.alternet.org).
</P>
<P>
   As street papers blossom, the need for organization increases.
The International Network of Street Papers comprises of 21 papers
in Europe, Africa and Australia. And the North American Street News
Association (NASNA) represents over 45 street publications,
including Street News, Street Scene (Los Angeles), StreetWise
(Chicago), Hard Times (Richmond, Va.), Vox Populi (San Antonio,
Texas) and Our Voice (Edmonton, Alberta).
</P>
<P>
   NASNA's treasurer, Michael Stoops, compared street papers to
``Negro newspapers,'' which started covering black issues in 1827,
when Freedom's Journal was first published in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every minority and special interest group, like the homeless,
need their own media source,'' says Stoops, who also works for the
National Coalition for the Homeless.
</P>
<P>
   Stoops says that 25 percent of NASNA's papers have an online
presence, but doesn't believe that will hurt demand on the street.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if all of the papers were to go online, we don't think
there would be a drop in paper revenue,'' Stoops says. ``People
would still want a copy in the subway and the bus.''
</P>
<P>
   Indio believes NASNA ensures the future of street newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It brought tears to my eyes when I first went to a NASNA
meeting, because I saw that the idea will not be eliminated,'' he
says. ``I saw young teen-agers, all the way up to people older than
me, fighting for a just cause. So if anything happens to me or
Street News, the beat goes on.''

<P>
   There is a scene in the novel ``Devil in a Blue Dress'' that
peeps at the place where Walter Mosley's politics and art meet.
Easy Rawlins has been pressed into detective service by DeWitt
Albright, a mysterious, sinister man who lures Easy with enough
money to make the overdue mortgage payments on his beloved home.
Easy is a Negro and DeWitt is white in the Los Angeles of 1948.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't belong to anybody,'' Easy says to Albright's assertion
that he paid him and thus owns him.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all owe out something, Easy,'' Albright replies. ``When you
owe out then you're in debt and when you're in debt then you can't
be your own man. That's capitalism.''
</P>
<P>
   And so it is that capitalism is the theme of Mosley's first book
of nonfiction, a slim, eight-chapter essay called ``Workin' on the
Chain Gang: Shaking Off the Dead Hand of History'' (Library of
Contemporary Thought). The book, published earlier this year,
explores a range of issues, including race, culture and global
politics.
</P>
<P>
   The unifying thread is the moral and economic stranglehold of
capitalism, as seen through the prism of the black American
experience. His is a progressive rather than Marxist stance and
offers different ways of looking at some old problems, rather than
solutions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chain Gang'' begins with the idea that the millennium is an
artificial marker of human progress. Mosley looks at such defining
events as the enslavement of Africans in the New World, the
Holocaust and the detonation of the atomic bomb and contrasts
technological advances with our attitudes toward human life over
the years.
</P>
<P>
   He argues that although race is still a major problem in America
and technology has far outpaced moral growth, the greatest
malignancy is the juggernaut of capitalism.
</P>
<P>
   ``What black people have experienced as a group for centuries
many whites now experience as solitary and alienated individuals,''
Mosley writes. ``In their various groups white Americans might feel
that they belong, that there is a group spirit that looks out for
them. But individually they suffer the barbs of bureaucratic
indifference and the vicissitudes of corporate whims like everyone
else.''
</P>
<P>
   Publishers Weekly called the book ``an ardent manifesto'' and a
``provocative declaration of intellectual and political
independence.'' Kirkus Reviews crowned Mosley ``a significant
African-American thinker.''
</P>
<P>
   The final chapter of ``Chain Gang'' begins with Malcolm X's
line, ``You have been bamboozled,'' from a speech about American
society that he made at a Harlem rally.
</P>
<P>
   ``And he was right,'' Mosley writes. ``Black people had been
fooled and lied to and broken over the promise of freedom. But the
truth is that all Americans have been fooled and broken.
</P>
<P>
   ``Democracy and capitalism make strange bedfellows,'' the essay
continues. ``In this odd brew freedom becomes a commodity. A price
is put upon our only asset, our labor.''
</P>
<P>
   Mosley, who is famous for his five Easy Rawlins mysteries, said
he wrote the book to foment and prolong a dialogue about issues
dear to his heart. He has always been political, he said, and a
nonfiction book on a serious subject was another way to resist the
artistic pigeonholing he loathes.
</P>
<P>
   Mosley said that he initially chose to write about race in the
21st century but that as he chewed on his thoughts the book turned
into something more complex. That should not surprise anyone who
understands his fiction, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm one of the only people in America writing now about black
male heroes _ that in itself is a political act, to see and cast
black men in America in a positive role,'' Mosley said over lunch
at a Greenwich Village restaurant where he frequently eats. At 48,
he is loquacious, easygoing, discernibly smart.
</P>
<P>
   ``The other thing is, I write about very real social
situations,'' Mosley said. ``When I write about Easy Rawlins and he
goes out to the desert and a guy turns a gun on him, Easy doesn't
understand it isn't necessarily about race but because the guy
thinks he is going to rob him. But race informs how the guy looks
at him, too, and how Easy responds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Socrates Fortlow is completely political,'' he said of another
recurring protagonist. ``He seeks redemption. He wants to form
bonds and hope in the black community.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Mosley said, ``I'm no more political than
Mark Twain or Charles Dickens or Herman Melville.''
</P>
<P>
   Mosley, a Los Angeles native who lives in Greenwich Village, is
the author of 11 books. ``Devil in a Blue Dress'' (1990), his
first, created an astonished gasp of pleasure in the literary world
and opened the door for other black mystery writers. It didn't hurt
that President Clinton called him his favorite writer.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Since Easy showed up, Mosley's work has been translated into 20
languages and crossed over into movies. In 1995 ``Devil in a Blue
Dress'' became a film starring Denzel Washington. In 1998 Laurence
Fishburne starred as Socrates Fortlow in ``Always Outnumbered,
Always Outgunned'' on HBO. A one-hour television series based on
the Easy Rawlins character is in the discussion stages with ABC.
</P>
<P>
   Mosley made his debut recently in The New Yorker with a short
story about a young man on Wall Street. His first play, about three
dysfunctional relationships, will be produced in Hartford in
September. He is also working on a series of science fiction
stories set in the New York of 2040, and HBO wants another
screenplay based on the latest Socrates novel.
</P>
<P>
   Characters like Socrates Fortlow, a 60-ish convicted rapist and
murderer living a hardscrabble life in a Los Angeles slum, are
imbued with dignity and insight. They seem to reflect Mosley's
delight in subversion, in turning the expected into the unexpected.
</P>
<P>
   He is, after all, the son of a Jewish mother and
African-American father who married and made their home in Los
Angles when such couples were considered eccentric at best. His
parents stayed together until his father died seven years ago. They
were crippled by the obvious inequities of being themselves in that
time and place, he said, but they loved each other and loved him
enough that he finally reached a place emotionally where he could
be himself.
</P>
<P>
   Mosley left behind a job as a computer programmer after the
beginnings of a novel floated into his head. It became ``Devil in a
Blue Dress.'' That was only a decade ago. Like a lot of people, he
said, he took a long time to grow up and discover his real
affinities and talents.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel myself as a real, everyday kind of American guy,''
Mosley said when asked whether his fiction fans might question his
moral or intellectual authority to tackle ``Chain Gang.'' ``I can't
tell you what to do. I can't answer the problem. I'm just somebody
who thinks about it, and I came to the conclusion that our moral
and technological potential is severely limited by how much we've
bought into capitalism.''
</P>
<P>
   What happens, he said, is that people do not see common
suffering brought about by economic constraints but focus on their
own victimization. And because blacks have historically been
marginalized and particularized and many social ills have been
presented as ``minority issues,'' the white skinhead and the
struggling black mother fail to realize that their HMO or their
boss is giving them both the short end of the stick.
</P>
<P>
   Mosley said he placed his hope for political and social change
on a younger generation that seems willing to make the leap to put
black Americans in the center of the American drama.

PRESENTATION OF NEWS BECOMES AN ISSUE IN NEW MEDIA PARTNERSHIPS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JIM RUTENBERG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   At 6:30 p.m. on Tuesday, Ron Insana, co-anchor of CNBC's
``Business Center,'' began his broadcast with an exclusive report,
presented breathlessly: eBay and Yahoo were in discussions about a
possible merger.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's The Wall Street Journal's Steve Frank with what could
be a very significant development in the Internet sector,'' Insana
told his audience in at least 290,000 households as he introduced
Frank, who works as part of the cable station's news gathering
alliance with his paper.
</P>
<P>
   Frank's report made clear that no deal was imminent and that the
talks could still fall apart. But the report of a possible merger
between the two Internet behemoths sent reporters around the world
pursuing the CNBC-Wall Street Journal story _ which promptly
appeared on the CNBC Web site and the leading business news wires _
and helped send eBay shares on a short-lived $20 rally in
after-hours trading.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, essentially the same news report appeared in The
Journal, but as a small, five-paragraph article in the inside
pages. What changed in the short time between Frank's report on
CNBC and The Wall Street Journal's deadline? Several hours' more
reporting.
</P>
<P>
   After a team of Journal reporters, including Frank, made a
flurry of phone calls, the Journal editors decided that the facts
did not warrant a bigger display.
</P>
<P>
   The different treatment underscores the different demands of the
two kinds of media, and what could happen to a newspaper's
information when it is conveyed in the real-time world of
electronic journalism, especially in the environment of business
news, where minutes count and the need to highlight breaking
reports is critical. The difference is often not so much in actual
language as in the symbolic quality of the prominence of display.
</P>
<P>
   That inherent difference in approach is likely to become more
visible as newspapers, including The New York Times, increasingly
link up with television and the World Wide Web to extend their
brands. Tribune Co. made it clear last week that a cornerstone of
its strategy in buying Times Mirror Co. would be to use its print
journalists for the news reports of its television and radio
stations and its Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   The Times, in an experiment, is producing a 15-minute weekday
political program on the Web with ABC and a limited number of
segments for ``20/20'' and ``Good Morning America.'' The two news
organizations will not collaborate on breaking news.
</P>
<P>
   The CNBC report last Tuesday was not unusual. The competition
for business news, especially on cable television and the Web, has
put an extra premium on being fast and first.
</P>
<P>
   The Wall Street Journal's managing editor, Paul E. Steiger, said
he saw nothing wrong in the different treatments of the Yahoo-eBay
talks. He said the information had been presented differently in
large part because of when the ``Business Center'' program was
broadcast in the news cycle.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reporter who picked up the conversation between eBay and
Yahoo had a good piece of news,'' Steiger said. ``And so Steve
Frank, that reporter, mentioned it to the producers at CNBC, and in
their news environment it looked great, so they pumped it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Meantime,'' he said, ``you start reporting it for the paper's
news cycle. By the time we ran everything down, it turned out that
in terms of what was hard, it hadn't gone that much beyond''
speculation on an eBay-Yahoo deal that ran in an earlier column in
The Journal. So, Steiger said, ``this is what it was worth in the
paper.''
</P>
<P>
   Steiger said he did not see any difference between the way CNBC
reported the news and the way reporters for The Journal have
traditionally written dispatches on the 103-year-old Dow Jones wire
service.
</P>
<P>
   But John V. Pavlik, executive director of Columbia University's
Center for New Media, at the Graduate School of Journalism, said
that while such a comparison was valid in some respects, there was
also an important difference: The public sees the cable channel.
The news service is used primarily by other journalists.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, more Web sites are making wire reports quickly
available to the public.
</P>
<P>
   Pavlik said that the increasing number of business news outlets
on television and the Web were creating enormous pressure to break
news and claim it as your own.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have even an inkling of a story,'' he said, ``there
is incredible pressure to go with it because if you don't, there's
a high likelihood that somebody else will go with it and scoop
you.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is not far from what happened at CNBC on Tuesday evening.
</P>
<P>
   Under a 2-year-old licensing agreement between The Wall Street
Journal and CNBC, CNBC pays the newspaper a licensing fee and gives
it a share of its advertising revenue in return for using its
newsroom resources. The Journal's parent company, Dow Jones, and
NBC, a unit of General Electric, are 50-50 partners in CNBC's
operations in Europe and Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides benefit. For one thing, The Journal has given CNBC
additional credibility with traditional investors who were weaned
on the newspaper. Also, the network gets televised reports from
Journal staff members throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
   The Journal receives not only a fee but also national
promotional exposure among people it may otherwise not reach, in a
medium in which the parent Dow Jones has struggled to succeed.
</P>
<P>
   But the alliance raises the question of who is responsible for
Frank's work on television. He is one of two reporters from The
Wall Street Journal stationed permanently at CNBC's offices in Fort
Lee, N.J. Unlike other Journal reporters who show up on CNBC as
experts or with their own exclusive accounts, he takes his
direction from CNBC editors. There are two newspaper editors on
site who act as liaison between the newspaper and the cable
network, lining up print reporters for programs and keeping both
sides abreast of each other's activities. They may veto a CNBC
decision if they think their reporters are being dispatched
improperly, though Frank said this situation had not arisen.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, CNBC executives said, Frank heard rumblings about
talks between eBay and Yahoo earlier in the day. But he was not
able to confirm that until about 5 p.m. His CNBC bosses thought
that the news _ even if there was not much of it, just word that
the two sides had discussed a number of different scenarios _ was
important enough to warrant top-of-the-broadcast presentation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought there was enormous value in two of the best-known
names on the Internet, Yahoo and eBay, getting together,'' said
Kevin Magee, executive producer of ``Business Center,'' adding,
``It's the equivalent in the 1950s of Penney talking to Sears.''

   Frank reported one person as saying that there was a 50-50
chance of some form of ``deep partnership'' and a significantly
smaller chance of an acquisition of eBay by Yahoo. Magee said this
was important enough for prominent play in a hot economy in which
investors seem to thirst for every bit of information. With
information moving faster than ever, Magee said, it is his mission
to keep his viewers ahead of the curve whenever possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're a stockholder of either eBay or Yahoo,'' he
continued, ``you wanted to know that news, which is why we wanted
to give it to you. Whether it held the same importance or not 12
hours later doesn't take away from the importance of the scoop at
the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Pavlik said that was typical in the current news environment.
``Maybe at that moment, something might have seemed like a big
deal,'' he said. ``But in Internet time, even a few hours later it
can seem marginally interesting and not terribly important.''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday night. the CNBC report seemed less compelling after a
few hours. When Frank broadcast his exclusive report, The Journal's
newsroom was alerted. West Coast technology reporters were joined
by Frank in working on the story for the Wednesday paper.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the time the evening deadline rolled around,'' Steiger
said, ``it became clear the conversations were still pretty
preliminary.''
</P>
<P>
   CNBC's initial report created a ripple effect throughout
competing news media _ reaching the Reuters, Bloomberg and
Associated Press wires and financial Web sites like CBS
MarketWatch, SV.com and TheStreet.com, in which The New York Times
is an investor. The Times and The Street.com. operate a joint
newsroom that contributes both to TheStreet.com and to The Times'
Web site. Though The Times' Web site editors decided not to carry
the CNBC report, an automatic feed of breaking news from Reuters,
attributing the information to CNBC, inserted the report onto the
Times site just the same.
</P>
<P>
   In after-hours trading, eBay's stock ran up as high as $239 from
its $218.9375 close in the regular session. Yahoo rose to $171.1252
from $168.75, before returning to the lower price.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times reported the talks on Thursday in its Market
Place column, but called a merger or a sale unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday morning, Frank appeared on CNBC's ``Squawkbox'' to
talk more about his report, stressing the tentative nature of the
talks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some other news organizations have perhaps been suggesting
that there is a merger closer here,'' he said. ``What we said
yesterday is there have been partnership talks between these two
companies. The likelihood on the Yahoo talks is only about 50-50
that any form of marketing alliance comes out of them, and a
significantly smaller likelihood even than that, that it would
result in an outright acquisition of eBay by Yahoo _ although that
possibility had not been ruled out. That's what we reported.''

`INVESTIGATIVE REPORTS': A SNAPSHOT OF THE DOWNSIDE OF YOUTH
SPORTS
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   The pressure on youngsters, some of them very young, to excel in
sports is a staple of journalistic exposes. And to judge by Monday
night's ``Investigative Reports,'' it is more manic than ever.
Fueled by parents, coaches, schools and the children's own visions
of glory, sports are taking up ever more time and passion,
sometimes with consequences that bode ill for health and family
relations.
</P>
<P>
   You can't tell from the examples deplored on ``Playing to
Extremes'' how widespread such cases are, and there is little
mention here of the influence of television and sponsors in keeping
enthusiasm at a high pitch. Instead, the hour goes into the impact
on a few families that seem to have been altogether carried away by
visions of glory.
</P>
<P>
   They include the family of 13-year-old Jimmy Gardner, a star
soccer player who warms up for three hours every weekday and is out
two nights a week and on weekends on what is known as ``a travel
team.'' On the weekend covered here, that means a six-hour ride to
the playing field. His father, an organizer of the travel team,
reports, ``We travel every weekend for soccer, that's our life.''
</P>
<P>
   The regimen can have unanticipated effects. A doctor who
specializes in sports injuries of very young children tells us of
an 11-year-old who complained of knee pain. It turned out that what
with soccer, hockey and tennis, he was subjecting his limbs to
heavy duty for four to five hours a day. He is a prospect for
needing a joint replacement at a very young age.
</P>
<P>
   A family's cost, in dollars and cents, can also be high, for
travel, equipment, clinics, uniforms and so forth. And Jimmy's
father tells of the emotional cost. Referring to the
parent-instigated fistfights he has seen on the sidelines, he says
that the competitive spirit ``probably transfers over to the way we
handle our kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Behind some of the obsession with sports, the program notes, are
hopes that it may lead to a college scholarship. The family of
young Ally Absher, a potential basketball star at a North Carolina
school, is laying out thousands of dollars a year on her career.
Her coach acknowledges: ``I'm not one of these people that believes
we're just here to have fun. That's not why we're here.'' Ally
says, ``I want to go to a big college where you get seen on TV.''
Unfortunately for Absher and for the program, on the night the
camera is covering, her team loses a tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Milton Lyles, a maintenance worker at a Florida public school,
is spending much of the family savings on his two sons, talented
hockey players. His plan is for them to get into a classy prep
school that will lead to a scholarship. That means constant
attendance at competitions where they can show their stuff. ``He
forces me a lot of times when I don't want to go,'' one son says.
``He's pushing us too hard.''
</P>
<P>
   The cautionary statistic cited here is that 70 percent of
youngsters ``burn out'' by the age of 13 and that fewer than 1
percent qualify for any sort of college scholarship.

   Remember the browser war?
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the early years of the World Wide Web, there was a
ferocious battle between Netscape Communications, developer of the
first commercial Internet browser, and Microsoft as the companies
introduced a rapid series of improved products.
</P>
<P>
   By November 1998, Netscape was on the ropes, and it agreed to be
acquired by America Online. And since then, Netscape has hardly
been heard from, except when it testified in the government's
antitrust case that Microsoft's tactics were unfair.
</P>
<P>
   Now, a year after America Online completed the acquisition, the
company is getting ready to roll out the first major new Netscape
release since the 4.0 browser was introduced in August 1997. (The
new version, scheduled to have a preview in April, will be called
Netscape 6.0 _ skipping past the long-delayed 5.0 version like an
unlucky 13th floor, and challenging Microsoft, which introduced
Internet Explorer 5.0 in March 1999.)
</P>
<P>
   But even as Netscape touts a series of features and
technological improvements in the new browser, just as it has in
years past, the entire field of the battle has changed under
America Online.
</P>
<P>
   As an independent company, Netscape's strategy was to use the
browser to build a base of users that would help sell the server
software that corporations use to create Web sites. In contrast,
America Online, which has farmed out Netscape's server business to
a joint venture run by Sun Microsystems called iPlanet, sees the
browser as the key to a series of interactive consumer services.
</P>
<P>
   So it is no surprise that many of the new features of the
browser tie to America Online's strengths.
</P>
<P>
   A window of the new browser can display America Online buddy
lists and send instant messages to them. The mail feature will let
users read corporate and personal e-mail in one place. And the
browser is filled with buttons and features that drive users to
America Online's shopping area and the advertising-supported areas
of an expanded Netcenter Internet portal.
</P>
<P>
   ``For us, the key to the browser is the integration of consumer
services,'' said Bob Pittman, America Online's president. ``If you
want to build a corporate data network, Microsoft may have the
widgets you need.''
</P>
<P>
   What is more, America Online has found an unexpected dividend
from one of Netscape's last and most controversial decisions: to
make its browser ``open source,'' like the Linux operating system.
That means publishing all the key Netscape components, on a Web
site called Mozilla.org, so independent programmers can improve on
them and use them in their own products.
</P>
<P>
   Now that America Online has agreed to buy Time Warner, it plans
to use the modular nature of the browser to build versions of it
for major Time Warner brands. That means a CNN browser, for
example, would have the look of the CNN Web site and perhaps
features like updated headlines and video feeds. Money magazine's
Money.com might include stock symbols. And a site for teen-agers
might have links to the WB network and AOL chat rooms.
</P>
<P>
   After saying little about Netscape over the last year, America
Online is now talking up its benefits largely to combat the
impression in Silicon Valley, reported in a number of published
accounts, that Netscape is in disarray and a shell of its former
self.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, nearly all of Netscape's top management and a big chunk
of its talented engineering staff have left the company. Of 2,600
employees right before the merger, 400 were laid off immediately,
and another 760 have left the company over the last year. More than
500 people have been hired, including Jim Martin, a publishing
executive brought in to run Netcenter.
</P>
<P>
   America Online executives said this rate of turnover was to be
expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went in with our eyes totally open,'' said Barry M.
Schuler, president of America Online's interactive services unit,
who oversees Netscape. ``This was a turnaround situation. We really
did keep all but a handful of the people we wanted to keep.''
</P>
<P>
   But even if America Online is able to rebuild Netscape in its
own image, it remains an open question whether it will earn enough
to be worth the effort _ not to mention the $4.5 billion in stock
that America Online exchanged for Netscape.
</P>
<P>
   Jamie Kiggen, the well-regarded Internet analyst at Donaldson
Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette and normally a big fan of America Online, has
called the acquisition of Netscape tragic and too risky for the
potential reward.
</P>
<P>
   But Michael Kelly, America Online's chief financial officer,
said the Netscape investment was well on its way to paying off. Sun
has guaranteed $1.3 billion in payments from the iPlanet alliance
over three years, although America Online is obliged to devote
1,200 employees to the effort.
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   The Netcenter portal turns a small profit, in large part because
it can use the huge technical and sales infrastructure of America
Online. Even before the big increase in traffic that America Online
hopes for from Netscape 6.0, Netcenter has more than held its own
against the competing portal sites.
</P>
<P>
   Among portal sites, Netscape.com had 22.8 million visitors in
January _ up 26 percent in a year, according to Media Metrix, a
ratings company. It was behind Yahoo.com, Microsoft's msn.com, and
America Online's aol.com, but it was ahead of Disney's Go.com,
Lycos.com, and Excite.com, all of which have flat or lower user
ratings from a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, much of Netscape's traffic is people looking to
download the browser and related software. But thanks to marketing
savvy from America Online, Netcenter users are now staying longer
and looking at double the pages they did a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Taken together, iPlanet and Netcenter, Kelley said, earn more
than enough to cover the costs of the browser development.
</P>
<P>
   And America Online executives say there are a number of benefits
to the Netscape deal that are impossible to quantify.
</P>
<P>
   For one, 350 engineers from the browser and Netcenter groups
have formed a new unit called AOL Products charged with developing
advanced technology that can be used by all of America Online's
units. The group wrote much of the software that powers the
shopping channels on America Online's main service, CompuServe,
Netscape and AOL.com. After the Time Warner acquisition, this group
will gain more importance as it develops technologies to be used in
the much broader array of Internet services.
</P>
<P>
   Netscape also provides a base of operations amid Silicon Valley,
both in location and culture, into which America Online's
acquisitions can be assimilated. For example, When.com, a company
that made calendar software, was folded into AOL Products to
develop the popular calendar America Online introduced late last
year.
</P>
<P>
   This group, in fact, has suffered much less attrition than
either Netcenter or iPlanet.
</P>
<P>
   ``For technology guys, the most important thing is to see their
work get used,'' said John Paul, head of AOL Products, and one of
the few Netscape veterans in a senior role with America Online.
``If you're at a start-up, no one will ever see your cool things.
Here we can put them in front of tens of millions of people.''
</P>
<P>
   And while America Online will not make money by selling the
browser software itself, it will use the components it has
developed in upcoming versions of its other products including
CompuServe ICQ and AOL Instant messenger. Indeed, America Online
executives expect that it will most likely switch its core online
service from Microsoft Internet Explorer to Netscape once the
antitrust trial is over.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought it would be a big problem if there was only one
browser in the world, not only for AOL but for the entire
industry,'' Schuler said. ``What price can you put on keeping the
standards that run the Internet open and free?''

SPORTS COLUMN: THE ONLY LOSERS ARE THE ATHLETES 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By WILLIAM C. RHODEN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   His team had been ousted from the National Collegiate Athletic
Association tournament. Mike Jarvis was making his way back to the
St. John's locker room.
</P>
<P>
   This was a slow, solemn walk late Saturday night _ slower, more
solemn than Jarvis probably realized. His wife, Connie, was on his
right, a university priest was on Jarvis' left. The sound of their
footsteps echoed down a vacant hallway.
</P>
<P>
   Jarvis suddenly stopped and laughed: ``I feel like I'm taking a
walk to the electric chair.'' Just as he reached the St. John's
locker room, Jarvis feigned terror and acted as if he were
resisting imaginary guards attempting to force him in the room:
``I'm not going,'' he said, his voice reverberating through the
arena. ``What did James Cagney say: `I didn't do it.'''
</P>
<P>
   Now laughter echoed through the hallway and softened the
disappointment of the moment. The coach had made his point:
Basketball provides a livelihood, but this was not life and death.
</P>
<P>
   St. John's enjoyed a nice, wild run. An undersized team that
passed well and overachieved met a mature, tournament-tested
Gonzaga team with a 6-foot-11-inch center who exploited St. John's
weakness in the middle.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of teams never get this far,'' Jarvis said. ``Still, in
order to grow, we have to have some of the same intangibles: the
feistiness the resiliency the aggressiveness,'' he said.
``Hopefully, we'll have that with more talent and a lot more depth
and size.''
</P>
<P>
   There are very few losers in the NCAA's showcase event. The
coaches are usually well compensated, the schools in the tournament
get a slice of the action. Each member school shares in the
television revenue
</P>
<P>
   There are markers everywhere of the NCAA's prosperity. Four
years ago, the Kansas City Star obtained a report showing that
Division I men's sports had ended up $156.4 million in the black
for that year. The University of Wisconsin reported $29,174,699
revenue in 1996; UCLA $13,492,587, St. John's $4,542,592 and
Gonzaga a modest $420,556. That was four years ago. The figures are
only going higher. Last year, the NCAA signed a $6 billion, 11-year
contract with CBS for television rights to the men's basketball
tournament.
</P>
<P>
   The only losers are the athletes who happen to catch the eye and
wrath of NCAA investigators, tipped off to players picking up what
effectively amounts to crumbs from a bountiful table. The players,
with prodding from their coaches, are beginning to pay attention
</P>
<P>
   Matt Santangelo, who helped eliminate St. John's from the
tournament on Saturday with a 26-point performance, supported
Barkley throughout the week and became a strong advocate for
reforming a flawed system.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year it seems there's been a lot more _ I don't know if
kids are being worse or if there's more attention given to it _ it
just seems like this year there's a lot of examples of NCAA
infractions,'' Santangelo said.
</P>
<P>
   He looked at NCAA merchandise as we went back and forth from his
hotel to practice facilities. The mugs, the jerseys with his number
on them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are blessed and we are very fortunate to have our
scholarships because I wouldn't be in college if it wasn't for a
scholarship,'' said Santangelo, the youngest of nine children. His
father worked as an inventory manager at a foundry for 49 years.
``Still, it's all relative. If we were making $25,000 for the
school and they were spending $20,000 of it on tuition, where is my
place to complain? But in the scheme of things, we're making
millions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what needs to change but as an intelligent,
educated person, I see my checkbook says zero, zero, zero. And
there's a lot of money going somewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Erick Barkley was one of several players the NCAA singled out in
investigations that focused more on events that transpired prior to
their college enrollment than after it. Investigators from the
association looked into the case of Barkley's swapping cars with a
family friend, questions about the source of Barkley's tuition for
prep school, asked about the administration of his SAT test and
whether there had been improper contact with agents or with
representatives of agents.
</P>
<P>
   Now with the Red Storm season completed, the university will
stop and confront the hounds that have been on the trail for so
long.
</P>
<P>
   Barkley is expected to announce any day now that he is putting
his name into the National Basketball Association draft.
</P>
<P>
   He repeatedly has said how much he loves college life, college
basketball.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can play another year, I love college basketball; it's much
different from the NBA,'' he said. ``There's more competition, guys
aren't worried about the paycheck at whatever time of the month.''
</P>
<P>
   Does that mean he's leaning toward staying? Barkley smiled,
sheepishly, sighed and shook his head as if to say he didn't want
to go there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't answer that,'' he said. ``That's a whole different
topic. That's a whole different story, man.''
</P>
<P>
   Barkley told a post-game news conference: ``Life goes on. Right
now I'm just looking forward to doing my schoolwork.''
</P>
<P>
   Late Saturday night, Jarvis stood in the nearly empty St. John's
locker room, still stinging from the loss and thinking about the
future. Last month he said he would wait until the season ended to
renew his battle with the NCAA. For the moment, though, his
priority is Barkley.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want for him to go home, I want him to mean it when he says
he's going to be a student,'' Jarvis said. ``I want him to spend
some quality time with his mother and with whomever his spiritual
adviser is, and really go deep and deep and deep into his soul and
try to find out what is the best thing that he should do for the
right reasons and then do it.''

PATENTS: PORTABLE COMPUTER-BRAIN; VERSATILE SHOES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Va., Ark.)  (lb) 
 By SABRA CHARTRAND   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you could take the central processor out of your computer and
slip it in your pocket, you might have the ultimate in portability:
a lightweight, digital brain, full of memory, storage and
processing power, that could be carried everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   But in practice, all you would really have are dead chips and a
tricky reinstallation problem _ unless a new patent belonging to
Xybernaut Corp. becomes reality. Then all you would need to bring
the processor to life would be electricity and a few pieces of
hardware, like a monitor.
</P>
<P>
   Xybernaut says those other pieces could be anywhere, any size,
any configuration. You would simply slip the processor into place
and connect it to external hardware and your computer would be with
you once again.
</P>
<P>
   The concept is similar to that of laptop computers that function
with desktop docking stations, but in this case the portable unit
is simply the brain of the computer.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the inventors have not built even a prototype. But they
predict that one day people will carry their computer core around
and dock it with keyboards and monitors, televisions, cell phones
and other types of electronic systems to turn them into functioning
computers.
</P>
<P>
   ``As an analogy, General Motors makes a V-6 engine that gets
inserted into different types of cars,'' said Michael Jenkins, vice
president and chief technology officer of Xybernaut in Fairfax, Va.
``The core computer is kind of like the engine inserted into a car,
and the enclosure is the car body or model type the engine is put
into. The core computer is a computing engine that has everything
necessary to operate except a monitor and power source.''
</P>
<P>
   Xybernaut already holds several patents for wearable computers,
and Jenkins said he hopes the first portable core will be available
within two years. The patent covers a computer's ``mobile core unit
and an enclosure capable of enclosing and cooperating with the core
unit.'' Although Jenkins said his company had not settled on a
processing standard, the patent says the invention ``has all of the
components of a general purpose computer.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the core would cost less than $1,000 and come with 128
megabytes of RAM and two gigabytes of storage (though he
acknowledges that those specifications could change quickly).
</P>
<P>
   It would be smaller than current hand-held electronic
organizers, with a connection port on one side to link it with
hardware like a monitor, keyboard, mouse, serial or parallel ports,
disk drive, speakers or printer. Otherwise the core would be sealed
to prevent tampering.
</P>
<P>
   It would be useful only after it is inserted into what Jenkins
calls an enclosure.
</P>
<P>
   ``The enclosure carries all things intended to interface with
the outside world,'' he explained. ``You can have an enclosure like
a desktop. Effectively it's a shell. You plug the core into it and
it operates the way a desktop would operate if it had a
processor.''
</P>
<P>
   So a day in the life of a future Xybernaut core owner might go
something like this: He would pop his computer core into his laptop
shell to work at home in the morning. As he commuted to work later,
he could transfer the core to the dashboard of his car and dictate
e-mail or receive directions from navigation software. If he rides
the bus, he could attach the core to his cell phone and turn it
into a computer. Then, once in the office, he would insert the core
into his desktop shell.
</P>
<P>
   ``The difference is, I may have a 21-inch monitor at the office,
a 15-inch monitor at home and a 6-inch monitor in the dash of my
car,'' Jenkins said. ``But it doesn't matter. We can start building
enclosures specific to the applications or functions you want to
achieve. You can now start to carry around your computing
environment and have things just the way you like to see things
operate.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I'm a fan of Windows NT, then I can have a core with
Windows NT,'' he explained, ``regardless of the device I plug it
into, regardless of where I am.''
</P>
<P>
   Jenkins imagines that a Xybernaut core owner who travels on
business might be able to plug the core into an electronic piece of
furniture _ a digital end table, say.
</P>
<P>
   ``It tells the hotel what room temperature I like,'' he said,
``and tells the hotel my schedule of meetings so the hotel can be
proactive and ask if I want directions. This pops up on the TV
screen. It knows I like Chinese food, so it gives me the names of
Chinese restaurants in the area and rates them. It could manage all
the things you're interested in but don't have the time or
inclination to do yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   Jenkins acknowledged that a great deal of compatible hardware
would have to be produced (like those end tables). In the meantime,
he said, Xybernaut is discussing licensing arrangements with makers
of desktop and laptop computers. He and his co-inventor, John
Moynahan, received patent 6,029,183.

<P>
   Devising Shoes With Two-in-One Soles
</P>
<P>
   Shoes are not subject to fashion whim alone, but can often be
made more practical, or at least more fun.
</P>
<P>
   Donald Duncan, of Texarkana, Ark., has won a patent for a
reversible shoe sole. Duncan believes that sometimes a person needs
two kinds of shoes, and an easy way to accommodate that need is
with a two-in-one sole.
</P>
<P>
   In his patent, he describes a sport sandal with a hard rubber
sole on one side for general wear, and a slip-resistant covering on
the other side for wet-weather wear (or for wading in a river or
stream). The sole is asymmetrical, so it can be flipped over and
transferred to the opposite foot when the wearer wants to change
treads.
</P>
<P>
   The sandal straps, which are attached between the two layers of
soles, would simply be flipped or pivoted around to cover the foot
over the new insole. With athletic shoes or other types of shoes,
Duncan envisions that the shoe will be structured so it can be
turned inside out. Duncan won patent 6,035,554.
</P>
<P>
   Patents may be viewed on the Web at www.uspto.gov or may be
ordered through the mail, by patent number, for $3 from the Patent
and Trademark Office, Washington, DC 20231.

`PETER JENNINGS REPORTING': A LOVELY LAND WHERE HATRED IS
ENTHRONED 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   As President Clinton begins his trip to South Asia, Peter
Jennings sounds the alarm of a possible nuclear war between India
and Pakistan. ``The Dark Horizon _ India, Pakistan and the Bomb''
focuses on the spectacularly beautiful but politically treacherous
Himalayan province of Kashmir, a center of conflict for the
half-century since the partition of Hindu India and Muslim
Pakistan. Three wars have already been fought between these
neighbors, and Jennings reports that a fourth threatens.
</P>
<P>
   The hour offers a quick reprise of a history of mutual hatred
that nothing seems able to quell. As one of the many officials,
journalists and historians interviewed here observes, voices on
both sides seem far more passionate about past grievances than
about any current efforts for peace.
</P>
<P>
   India is by far the military superior, but it is Pakistan that
seems to Jennings and others to be the main source of instability.
It is an economic and political basket case, with a record of
corruption and military rule and in recent years the ascendance of
militant Muslims who aspire to a takeover like that of the
fundamentalist Taliban in Afghanistan. Critics of the United States
do not fail to remind viewers that during the Cold War the CIA
joined Pakistan in training and supplying Muslim fighters in
Afghanistan against the Soviet Union; it proved to be a breeding
ground for terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   Religious fervor is firing up both sides; Jennings finds that
Indians and Pakistanis alike rejoice over their nations' nuclear
capacities and cheer every gesture toward war. Militant Muslims see
a hope for ``finishing the Hindus''; India's minister of defense
proclaims, ``India can beat Pakistan anytime, anywhere.'' In an
area where 1 million people have been killed in wars over the
years, such posturing can be lethal.
</P>
<P>
   For both countries, as Jennings reports, Kashmir represents a
symbol of national identity. Given the enduring hatred and the
shaky intelligence gathering on both sides, Washington is worried
about a disastrous miscalculation; if either country should resort
to nuclear weapons, nuclear retaliation is guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
   In a note that accompanied the tape of ``The Dark Horizon,''
Jennings expressed the hope that with television's coverage of
international affairs so wanting, reviewers would find the program
``timely as well as warranted.'' Agreed.

OLD-LINE LAW FIRM LINKS UP TO THE NEW ECONOMY

<P>
   OLD-LINE LAW FIRM LINKS UP TO THE NEW ECONOMY &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Anyone doubting the increasingly mainstream status of Internet
start-ups need hear only two words: Bob Dole.
</P>
<P>
   The former senator and 1996 Republican presidential nominee
offered the opening remarks last Thursday evening at the coming-out
party in Washington for EqualFooting.com, a dot-com that plans to
create an online marketplace where small businesses would buy
industrial supplies, like plumbing equipment and hydraulic systems,
from national distributors.
</P>
<P>
   What has any of this to do with Dole?
</P>
<P>
   He holds the title of special counsel at the powerhouse
Washington law firm of Verner, Liipfert, Bernhard, McPherson &AMP;
Hand. The firm represents EqualFooting.com and is making e-commerce
a new focus. Last Thursday's party followed the firm's announcement
earlier in the day that it was starting an Internet ventures group.
</P>
<P>
   In the 10 minutes or so that he spoke, Dole praised EqualFooting
and promoted the law firm's efforts to be part of the digital
economy.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the law firm's courtship of dot-coms demonstrates how
little distance is left between the high-tech world, once staunchly
unwilling to cozy up to Capitol Hill, and the inside-the-beltway
elite, formerly dismissive of the Internet's role in the economy.
</P>
<P>
   Marla P. Grossman, former minority counsel to the Senate
Judiciary Committee and now director of Verner Liipfert's Internet
group, contends that her firm can wield its influence in Washington
to help Internet interests ``use the resources of Capitol Hill.''
</P>
<P>
   Technology companies ``are realizing increasingly that
Washington, D.C.'s influence really extends across the nation and
its influence has a direct and significant impact on their bottom
line,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But while the old-style, old-economy law firm may know Capitol
Hill, it may have to come up to speed itself to be a player in the
Internet world.
</P>
<P>
   Grossman cited as one of the firm's dot-com accomplishments the
fact that it helped Angie Kim, the president of EqualFooting.com,
land a speaking engagement at an e-commerce conference at Saginaw
Valley State University in Michigan. But just how much influence
the law firm can exert may depend on whether it can reach beyond
the heartland in Saginaw Valley to the heart of Silicon Valley.

<P>
   SPORTS ILLUSTRATED SWIMSUIT STILL A LIMITED EDITION
</P>
<P>
   It was one of those serendipitous meetings that most
entrepreneurs only dream about.
</P>
<P>
   Exhibiting his wares at the International Fashion Boutique Show
in Manhattan last May, Keith Merl, an importer of hand-woven
Guatemalan cotton and other Central and South American textiles,
received a visit from an editor for Sports Illustrated.
</P>
<P>
   She was particularly interested in one of his hats, and
commissioned Merl to make a bathing suit from the same fabric. Thus
did Merl's swimsuit come to adorn a model featured in the
magazine's 2000 swimsuit edition, which hit newsracks last month.
</P>
<P>
   Merl's business may never be the same. (Or maybe it will; more
on that in a moment.) In the last month, his Web site,
www.artesaniainc.com, has received nearly 12,000 hits; most of
these were from people interested in the bathing suit, many of whom
reached his site through a link on www.sportsillustrated.com. So
far, though, Merl hasn't found a manufacturer or online retailer to
produce and sell the suits.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know what volume to expect,'' Merl said. ``Anyway,
the rest of the business was going so well, I said I wasn't going
to get into the bathing suit business.''
</P>
<P>
   The rest of his business involves selling South American
textiles wholesale to Japanese companies; owning a retail store
called Artesania, in the Willowbrook Mall in Wayne, N.J.; and
selling clothing through the Sundance Catalog. The mall store is
doing particularly well, he said, and he is considering licensing
the Artesania brand.
</P>
<P>
   Whether Merl will ever get into the swimsuit business is still
up in the air. Eventually, he said, he does hope to have the
wherewithal to manufacture and sell the suits. But he does not seem
to have the 24/7/365 urgency that marks the budding e-commerce
executive. Last week, clicking the ``Swimsuit'' link on his Web
site produced the message ``HTTP/1.1 404 Object Not Found.'' Merl,
meanwhile, was off to Europe on vacation. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   A PRODUCT GOOD ENOUGH FOR GOVERNMENT WORK
</P>
<P>
   It is not often that a business will promote its products'
performance as being on a par with an activity of the federal
government. But Royal Consumer Business Products is betting that
such a connection will strike a chord with security-conscious
consumers. The company is promoting its new line of low-cost paper
shredders as enabling consumers to ``Shred Like the Feds.''
</P>
<P>
   The lower priced of the two new lines is called the FBI series.
The four FBI. models, ranging from $29.99 to $99.99, offer
consumers a relatively high level of security, a determination
based on the smallness of the shreds. By such reckoning, the CIA
line _ three models ranging from $49.99 to $200 _ is more secure,
mincing paper into morsels as small as confetti.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to project that our product was a security
product,'' said Todd Althoff, head of marketing for Royal, which is
based in Bridgewater, N.J., and is a direct descendant of the
original Royal typewriter company founded in 1904. He said a
trademark search turned up a lot of products named after the FBI
and CIA, but no shredders.
</P>
<P>
   Both product lines are aimed primarily at families looking to
shred household documents, such as bills and financial records.
</P>
<P>
   In the 14 years since Royal was acquired by Olivetti SpA, the
company has gone through a significant transformation, as has the
typewriter industry itself. Today, in addition to home shredders,
Royal sells electronic organizers and a low-cost personal digital
assistant called the Royal da Vinci that competes with the Palm
Pilot.
</P>
<P>
   But for Royal, the biggest opportunity may be in home shredders.
Last year alone, the company sold more than two million shredders
to households, and the pace is continuing this year, Althoff said.
Consumers are realizing how vulnerable they are to invasions of
privacy, he said, particularly since passage of legislation a few
years ago that makes one's trash public property once it leaves the
house.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any garbage you put on your curb is in the free domain,
legally,'' he said. ``That includes your financial records, tax
returns, even pre-approved credit cards applications.'' --LAURIE J.

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Windswept heavy snow will spread Monday from the mountains of
southern Wyoming and eastern Utah into northern Arizona and
Colorado as a storm center strengthens over the Southwest. Snow
accumulations over a foot will be common by early Tuesday including
some areas near metropolitan Denver. Additional snow will fall in
the central Rockies Tuesday as the storm stalls. Farther west,
strong winds with frequent gusts over 35 mph near mountain passes
will buffet much of Nevada and California.
</P>
<P>
   Rain will be locally heavy ahead of a front from the eastern
Ohio Valley to the interior Carolinas. Lighter showers will occur
in the Great Lakes states. The damp weather will move a little to
the east Monday as high pressure remains steadfast over the
Northeast. New England will be mainly sunny but onshore winds will
cause patchy clouds from the central Appalachians to the Middle
Atlantic Coast.
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: SLOW STORMS
</P>
<P>
   The season of slow storms has begun. For the next two months,
the jet stream will vacillate, retreating north as warmer air
arrives from the tropics, or surging south as the last chilly air
masses empty from the Arctic. Like a flooded river leaves behind
pools of standing water as it recedes into its banks, the jet
stream often leaves behind stagnant pools of cold air when it
retreats north. These high-level cold pools favor the development
of storms. During the next few days, a sluggish storm will bring
heavy snow to the Rockies. &QL;

 &HT;    Tech coaching search could turn to Tubby
 &HT;    By Terence Moore
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nashville, TN _ The plot thickens in the search for Bobby
Cremins' successor at Georgia Tech, and the final chapter is
evolving into a doozy. Maybe, just maybe, the Yellow Jackets will
make the cow jump over the moon by hiring a former Bulldog who is a
current Wildcat.
</P>
<P>
   Tubby Smith to Tech?
</P>
<P>
   Oooooh.
</P>
<P>
   Could happen. In fact, if you believe the inside buzz (not to be
confused with Tech mascot Buzz) around the South Regional, the
Jackets already have asked Smith to become their new basketball
coach, with a wink and a nod from the man himself.
</P>
<P>
   This is for sure: If the buzz involving Smith and Tech isn't
true, Tech athletics director Dave Braine should change that in a
hurry. Like now. Smith has plenty of time to talk to Braine, since
Syracuse eliminated Kentucky on Saturday in the second round of the
Midwest Regional.
</P>
<P>
   The best part of Cremins' 19 seasons at Tech ranged from the
start to the middle. Since then, the Jackets have missed the NCAA
Tournament six of the last seven years, which means just an average
Smith year at Tech would be huge. That's because an average Smith
year is great.
</P>
<P>
   In case you're wondering, it would make sense for Smith to skip
a fourth year inside the pressure cooker that is coaching Kentucky
basketball to enjoy the friendly confines of Alexander Memorial
Coliseum. In fact, if you're Smith, and you hear from Braine about
returning to the Peach State for the first time since your two
impressive seasons at Georgia during the mid-1990s, you flee.
</P>
<P>
   You sprint. You realize that Delta is ready when you are on the
way out of Lexington.
</P>
<P>
   Smith shouldn't have left the state of Georgia in the first
place. Along the way to becoming at least the Vince Dooley of
Bulldog hoops, he spent the first of his two seasons going to the
Sweet 16. That was in addition to Smith's two trips to the Sweet 16
with Tulsa. After Smith won 24 games in his second year at Georgia
along the way to the NCAA Tournament, it was off to Kentucky. He
spent his debut with the Wildcats doing the worst thing possible.
He won the national championship.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Smith's Kentucky teams have been super, but not
superb, and that stinks for the demanding Wildcat fans.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, Smith created an ongoing furor in the commonwealth when
he decided to use his son, Saul, as Kentucky's point guard. And you
just know the whining among Wildcat fans is heading for even higher
decibels after a near loss to St. Bonaventure on Thursday at the
Midwest Regional before that definite loss to Syracuse.
</P>
<P>
   What all of this means is that you can ignore the smoke screen
around here that is filling the Gaylord Entertainment Center,
before Miami dribbles today against Ohio State. Miami athletics
director Paul Dee said Friday night that he gave permission three
weeks ago to his pal Braine to interview Miami coach Leonard
Hamilton.
</P>
<P>
   Although Hamilton is a wonderful coach, taking the Hurricanes to
three consecutive trips to the NCAA Tournament for the first time
in their history, he is no Smith. Neither is Seton Hall's Tommy
Amaker or Dayton's Oliver Purnell, nor any of the others falsely
rumored to be on Tech's short list.
</P>
<P>
   That's why those at Tech have to get Tubby if they can get
Tubby. And, according to the buzz, they can get Tubby.

<TEXT>
<P>
   PRAGUE, Czech Republic _ The discovery in downtown Prague of the
remnants of a medieval Jewish cemetery has turned into a political
and moral quandary for the Czech government and an embarrassment
for the small Czech Jewish minority.
</P>
<P>
   This week, the Czech government will decide how best to
acknowledge the needs of modernity while respecting the dead, and
thus how to dampen the furor that has turned what began as a
construction project for an insurance company into a confusing,
hurtful and emotional battle between the Czechs and a large number
of Jews around the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has come down to a question of economics versus
reconciliation,'' said Rabbi Marc Schneier, president of the North
American Boards of Rabbis, who has tried, along with the U.S.
Embassy here, to mediate the dispute. ``But I think reconciliation
will win out.''
</P>
<P>
   If not, he warned sadly, ``the situation could become
explosive,'' with worldwide demonstrations by Jews against the
Czech government. That would be a pity, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Czechs are willing partners, they're not the enemy,''
Schneier went on. ``The problem is that there has been a lot of
misinformation, and the Prague Jewish community and some elements
of the international Jewish community are not on the same page
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Rabbi Abraham Ginsberg, the London-based director of the
Committee for the Preservation of Jewish Cemeteries in Europe, is
more suspicious of the Czechs and of the insurance company. Still,
he says, ``I really don't know how it got so messy. We're pretty
confused, too. In 12 years, we've never had such a case.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Czech insurance company, Ceska Pojistovna, started work
on a new building on Vladislavova Street downtown, its biggest
concern was preserving the 19th-century facade of its old
headquarters and digging the underground parking garage for its
employees that the city of Prague mandated for new construction.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1997, as digging proceeded, some bones were discovered,
the first indication that a medieval Jewish cemetery, one of the
oldest found in Europe, still existed under the site. The cemetery
is believed to have been started in the 13th century, outside the
city's ancient walls, and probably served as the central burial
site for all Bohemia's Jews.
</P>
<P>
   As Prague expanded in the 15th century, King Vladislav Jagiello,
who had no great love for the Jews and for whom Vladislavova Street
is named, ordered the cemetery removed in 1478, and tombstones were
used for the construction of new houses. The first layer of the
cemetery, an area believed now to cover 8.4 acres (3.4 hectares),
or two city blocks, was thus desecrated. But archaeologists say
that at least another two levels of graves remain.
</P>
<P>
   The insurance company site covers only about 5 percent of the
ancient cemetery. A fence encircles the muddy area where bones were
found, a few yards below the current street.
</P>
<P>
   The company feels trapped, says Ludek Kozusko, head of the
company's construction department, which stopped work voluntarily
10 months ago, when the Ministry of Culture became involved.
``We've been waiting for 10 months,'' he said. ``So now we are
stuck just because we behaved decently.''
</P>
<P>
   After discussions with the chief rabbi of Prague, Karol Sidon,
and the government, the company worked out a deal last November _
or so it thought. By Jewish law and tradition, remains should not
be disturbed. So the idea _ similar to the treatment of an ancient
cemetery discovered in Hamburg, Ginsberg said _ was to slice out
the earth containing the remains, lower the entire section further
into the earth, seal it with concrete, then build over it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't crazy about the solution,'' said Sidon, a former
dissident who is close to President Vaclav Havel. And Sidon soon
came under pressure from rabbis abroad, who believe that the graves
should not be disturbed at all.
</P>
<P>
   The Czech Jewish community, with only some 1,500 active members
now, was isolated from foreign organizations until 1989 and the
fall of Communism, the rabbi said. ``I don't want to get us in that
position again,'' he said. At the same time, he said, without
foreign pressure even the more sensitive post-Communist state might
not have acted.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   So he got in touch with the chief Ashkenazic rabbi of Israel,
Yisrael Meir Lau, who sent his own expert, Rabbi Mendel Eckstein.
The result was a ruling that the graves already uncovered should be
left undisturbed in perpetuity, causing Sidon to pull out of the
deal.
</P>
<P>
   The company was inundated with angry letters and e-mails _
Schneier calls it ``a smear campaign'' _ accusing it of
anti-Semitism. Most of the angry letters presume, wrongly, that the
cemetery in question is the famous 15th-century Old Jewish Cemetery
in the former Jewish quarter, a haunting graveyard that has become
one of Prague's tourist landmarks.
</P>
<P>
   Then another delicate issue erupted. Archaeologists called in
after the original digging had removed some 130 remains in 1997 and
1998 for testing. Placed in coffins, they had been put in an
existing Jewish cemetery, but Lau and other foreign rabbis insisted
that they be reburied in their original spot.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Embassy helped to arrange a reburial ceremony on Feb.
24, and at least 100 people showed up. The company said there was a
safety risk and refused entry to the site. ``It turned into a
demonstration,'' said Ginsberg, who was there. ``We sat on the
ground and said prayers and lamentations and people started to
cry.''
</P>
<P>
   Sidon, uncomfortable, said: ``It's important to rebury the
bones. But it should have been done with the agreement of the
company. I mean, we don't really need people jumping in the air and
throwing themselves on the ground.''
</P>
<P>
   But the event underlined the increasing stakes. With a noted
liberal as its president, the Czech government _ a member of NATO,
in line to join the European Union and mindful of the isolation of
neighboring Austria since the right-wing party of Joerg Haider
entered government there last month _ is not eager to have the
confrontation worsen.
</P>
<P>
   The 130 remains have been put in a mausoleum, but Ginsberg said
that new demonstrations would be planned if the remains were not
reburied immediately at their original site.
</P>
<P>
   The beleaguered culture minister, Pavel Dostal, has finally come
up with proposals to be made at a Cabinet meeting this week. All
would declare the entire cemetery a cultural monument and ban new
construction, officials say. As for the company's site, the first
proposal would accept Lau's proscription, halting any further
building there and compensating the company for costs that could,
Kozusko says, reach $17 million.
</P>
<P>
   The second proposal would be the November compromise, involving
the sinking of the cemetery and its sealing. The third, which no
one takes seriously, would remove the remains and rebury them
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   A fourth idea, officials say, is to leave the area of the graves
undisturbed, but to build over it, possibly creating an enclosed
memorial space. It is also possible that the city will simply let
the company have an exception and build without a garage.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, however, Schneier fears it is too late for a
cultural compromise. He believes the government, to end the issue,
will choose the first option and compensate the company, perhaps
with contributions from Jews abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Sidon thinks there is plenty of blame to go around, and that
both his government and foreign Jews should be more sensitive to
each other's past.
</P>
<P>
   As for the insurance company, Vaclav Balek, a spokesman, says:
``We just want a decision.''

   DAILY WEATHER
</P>
<P>
   Attention graphic editors:
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times News Service has an expanded weather package
starting today. The package, consisting of a weather map as a
graphics file and a text file to accompany the map, is available to
graphics clients of the News Service.
</P>
<P>
   The new map grows to 4 columns in width (52 picas), from 3, and
is 6 inches deep; the old was 4 inches deep. This new size permits
the insertion of cloud cover information, previously a separate
map, and the addition of many new cities.
</P>
<P>
   The map is available both in color and in black and white.
Because the map is much more detailed, we have devised an entirely
new palette of colors to make it easier to read the added
information.
</P>
<P>
   A sample of the new map is available at Wieck, Newscom,
Presslink and AP's GraphicsNet.
</P>
<P>
   Some papers using the old map may need extra time to make the
transition to a 4-column format. We will, for a limited time,
produce a 3-col version of the new map, but with only some of the
new map's additional cities.
</P>
<P>
   0320 COLOR WEATHER -- 3 x 4 1/4 -- National forecast map in

CHRETIEN DISMISSES FEARS OF RIGHTWARD TREND 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By JAMES BROOKE    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ When reporters needled Prime Minister Jean Chretien a
few days ago about unfavorable poll results, suggesting that he
should step aside, Canada's leader turned on them like a
lumberjack, saying: ``Listen to me _ I am the boss.''
</P>
<P>
   Chretien opened the convention of his Liberal Party in Ottawa
this weekend declaring his rock solid intentions to run for a third
term in elections expected for May 2001.
</P>
<P>
   But some Liberals fear that Canada is tiring of Chretien, 66, a
populist who entered politics in 1963 just before John F. Kennedy
was assassinated.
</P>
<P>
   While Chretien has led Canada since 1993, the Liberals only won
38 percent of the popular vote in the last election, in 1997. The
party won a narrow majority of the seats in the Parliament, largely
because the right split, delivering almost all of Ontario's 103
seats to the Liberals.
</P>
<P>
   But now many Liberals fear that Canada is shifting rightward,
joining a trend that has marked American and British politics in
recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Within the Liberals, the center-right trend is lead by Paul
Martin, the country's 61-year-old finance minister, an advocate of
tax cuts. Polls published last week in Toronto newspapers, The Star
and The Globe and Mail, indicated that most Canadians would like
the prime minister to step aside in favor of his younger,
pro-business finance minister, who has a more modern image.
</P>
<P>
   With the Martin faction increasingly restless in Ontario, the
nation's economic and electoral powerhouse, a dozen Liberal members
of Parliament loyal to the finance minister secretly met with his
advisers recently in a Toronto airport hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Fighting the challenge from the younger politician, Chretien was
recently photographed skiing in Quebec. Going into his party
convention, the last before next year's elections, he told
reporters: ``I am in good health and I will continue. I will see
you in the buses and the aircraft during the electoral campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   At a party caucus, which Martin chose to skip, Chretien warned
Liberal members of Parliament Wednesday night: ``I will not be
pushed through the door.''
</P>
<P>
   At the party conference, as Young Liberals supporting Chretien
chanted ``Four more years, four more years,'' he did not mention
tax cuts. Instead, he positioned his party as champions of the
poor, saying that ``the press, which is controlled by the big
financial interests,'' criticizes Liberals ``because we have
programs to help the poor.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Canadian Liberals often run from the left and then
govern from the right, some analysts predict that if Chretien runs
next year, a new conservative coalition would make inroads into
Ontario, home province for one-third of the members of the House of
Commons.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Paul Martin could become the leader any time soon, all
kinds of Ontario right-wing voters would stay with the Liberals,''
said Desmond Morton, a historian who directs McGill University's
Institute for the Study of Canada.
</P>
<P>
   To overcome a regional split among conservatives, the Reform
Party, based in the West, is trying to reinvent itself as a
national party, the Canadian Reform Conservative Alliance. In a
party convention next June, conservatives are expected to choose
between Preston Manning, 57, the the party's leader, and Stockwell
Day, 49, the treasurer of Alberta, an advocate of a flat income
tax.
</P>
<P>
   In his keynote speech Sunday night, Chretien directed much of
his fire at Day, lampooning a provincial flat tax that is to go
into effect next January in Alberta as ``the dream of millionaires
and the nightmare of average Canadians.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We will not let them erode medicare through creeping
privatization,'' Chretien said, in reference to Alberta's proposal
to allow overnight stays in private clinics. Referring to
conservatives' opposition to a federal revenue sharing system
designed to provide roughly equal services across Canada, he said:
``We will not let them scale down support for poorer regions of the
country.''
</P>
<P>
   Chretien urged Canadians to look at the conservative religious
belief that he contends is hidden behind Day's public image. ''We
don't want a party that is very much in the hands of the religious
right,'' Chretien told 2,500 Liberals Sunday night. Referring to
Day's opposition to abortion, he added: ``We do not want a party
that threatens a woman's right to choose.''
</P>
<P>
   Liberal strategists believe that when the campaign begins they
will be aided by opinion polls that routinely give the Chretien
government approval ratings around 65 percent.
</P>
<P>
   What is in their favor, they say, is the best economic
performance since the 1960s. Canada's unemployment rate has dropped
to 7.6 percent, its growth rate has increased to about 4 percent,
inflation is around 2 percent, and a deep budget deficit has been
turned into a surplus.
</P>
<P>
   On the national unity front, the issue of Quebec separatism is
in hibernation. Last week, the House of Commons passed a ``Clarity
Bill'' designed to set clear rules for any future referendum on
secession.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Marzolini, whose firm conducts polls for the Liberals,
struck an upbeat note, telling convention delegates, ``Our
opponents are currently at their weakest point in history.''

   BANGLADESH-U.S. (Dhaka, Bangladesh) _ Three decades after
Bangladesh's difficult birth after a war of independence against
Pakistan, it remains one of the world's poorest nations. A million
villagers each year lose their homes to fickle rivers that engulf
their land. Democracy suffers prolonged malfunctions, in part
because the two women who run the main political parties hate each
other down to the bone. And yet, in most ways Bangladesh now is
decidedly in less of a mess, with the poverty rate drifting down
and economic growth rates inching up. Indeed, many here fear that
President Clinton is coming not just to shake hands but to pick
pockets. It seems that Bangladesh may be sitting on a small fortune

MARCH MADNESS ON AUSTIN'S MUSIC FRONT 
</HEADLINE>
   By NEVA CHONIN  
 c.2000, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas &LR;   &LR; _ Austin was hit by two storms this weekend: One
involved high winds, spectacular flashes of lightning and rivers of
rain; the other offered high spending, occasional spectacular
flashes of talent and torrents of beer and tequila. Both have left
this cool little college town rumpled and nursing a happy hangover.
</P>
<P>
   Most will agree, though, that the latter outburst was more fun.
The 14th annual South by Southwest Music and Media Conference (SXSW
for short) swamped Austin with 7,000 schmoozing industry insiders
and music fans who watched some 900 bands, ranging from hometown
hero Rob Schneider to Japanese pop sensation Puffy, go wild on
stages throughout the city from Wednesday through Saturday nights.
It was a street party and club extravaganza par excellence _ but
then, it always is.
</P>
<P>
   What made this year's SXSW different from its earlier years was
a lack of industry hype: There was no trend du jour, no ``it'' band
claiming to embody the sound of the times.
</P>
<P>
   The lack of trending can be read several ways. On the optimistic
side, it's an encouraging statement on the survival of independent
music in a time when the word ``indie'' has been reduced to a
historical footnote. The effect of being unfashionable was mostly
positive. Freed from the pressure that comes with trying to be an
overnight success _ the hope still persists, but hope is not
expectation _ bands were free to enjoy themselves, play to fans and
future fans, and rib the chattering journalists, A&AMP;R reps and
publicists invariably clustered to the rear of the club.
</P>
<P>
   Ideally, this could signal a return to the festival's heyday as
an extended meet-and-greet for industry outsiders. Some of the
weekend's best showcases were presented by smaller labels such as
the Bay Area's Man's Ruin and Lookout! Records, which hosted packed
lineups at the gritty but cool Emo's.
</P>
<P>
   More realistically, the lack of a defining sound or group could
be symptomatic of a calcified music industry's lack of direction;
for the first time in decades, no one is hazarding any guesses on
where music is headed in a post-everything age.
</P>
<P>
   If there was a buzz at SXSW, it was a philosophical one: Yes, it
is possible to survive and even flourish in the midst of a musical
depression. Patti Smith's Thursday performance at Waterloo Park _
her first Austin show in 20 years _ proved that she hasn't lost her
inspired edge after decades in the business. Steve Earle overcame
terrible sound and chilly temperatures to turn in a fine
performance at the outdoor Stubbs, and Cypress Hill, cashing in on
the rap-rock sound it probably helped inspire, debuted its new rock
incarnation to enthusiastic response.
</P>
<P>
   The Meat Puppets re-emerged for two shows with founder Curt
Kirkwood fronting a new lineup sans his legally and chemically
troubled brother, Cris. The veteran Mekons and their various
offshoots _ the Waco Brothers, Sally Timms' solo gigs _ gave fun,
fascinating testament to creative endurance, and the
indie-turned-major-turned-indie-again Guided by Voices attracted an
overflow crowd to a party thrown by Revolver Magazine, a new
publication bravely venturing into a shaky print market.
</P>
<P>
   There was plenty of newer talent to choose from, too. Texas' own
at the drive in sent MC5 and garage rock fans into a tailspin with
its frenetic live show, which featured group members literally
bouncing off the walls; Creeper Lagoon and Elliott Smith (playing
with a full band that included Quasi's Sam Coomes) were templates
of melodic grit. Songwriter Neko Case was moody and enchanting,
whether commanding her own stage or guesting with the Mekons on
theirs.
</P>
<P>
   If any act drew consensus raves it was Shelby Lynne, who was as
stunning in concert as she is on her gorgeous debut CD. Her two
Saturday performances _ one at an evening showcase, the other at an
afternoon party hosted by Interview magazine _ gave full play to
her elastic phrasing and pitch-perfect merger of blues-diva vocals
with country twang.
</P>
<P>
   There were the usual number of celebrity sightings over the
weekend, including Metallica's Lars Ulrich, who registered at the
Four Seasons under the name Sam Spade, and Neil Young, who turned
up in the audience at Jimmy Dale Gilmore's performance at the
Broken Spoke. Janeane Garofalo was spotted getting down to
Nashville Pussy at the Revolver party.
</P>
<P>
   It's too early to say whether this year's hype-free SXSW was an
anomaly, a musical pit stop, the beginning of an end or the end to
a beginning. Considering the chaotic state of the music industry,
it could well be an amalgam of all four. One thing's for sure, and
this is really all the justification the festival needs: It was
about 900 bands more inspirational than the new 'N Sync album.

 MANY BLAME LONGTIME PARTY LEADER FOR NATIONALIST DEFEAT IN TAIWAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (With TAIWAN-CHINA, TAIWAN-ASSESS, TAIWAN-RIOTS) 
 (rk) 
 By ERIK ECKHOLM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAIPEI, Taiwan _ ``He betrayed Taiwan!'' ``He's a traitor who
sold out the Nationalist Party! ``He's a monster, lower than a
dog!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Step Down Lee! Step Down Lee!''
</P>
<P>
   The venom of the crowds here Sunday was directed at a man who
was long called ``Mr. Democracy'' _ the man who opened the clubby,
all-powerful Nationalist Party to the native Taiwanese majority,
the man who engineered Taiwan's first direct elections for
president and who bravely asserted the island's separate identity
against a hostile Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   That man, Lee Teng-hui, Taiwan's first elected president and the
chairman for the last dozen years of the Nationalists, who arrived
in the 1940s from mainland China, has been obsessed with his own
mission, once even comparing himself to Moses.
</P>
<P>
   Lee's achievements cannot be erased and are acknowledged by most
Taiwanese. Yet Sunday he had to be escorted from his party
headquarters under the cover of water cannons and riot police and
his political base appeared to be eroding fast, creating dangerous
political uncertainty for Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   And if the thousands who openly vented their rage in the last
day were only a tiny share of the people, many of their criticisms
_ that he had become autocratic, ever more mired in political
corruption and reckless to the point of incompetence _ seemed to be
widely shared.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the complaints were rooted in recent events, especially
the Nationalists' election disaster on Saturday, while others
reflect festering ethnic and political resentments going back to
the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's now disliked by all kinds of people for different
reasons,'' said Lu Ya-li, a political scientist at National Taiwan
University.
</P>
<P>
   Virtually all of the people blowing air horns and screaming
epithets outside Lee's residence and party offices, or milling
edgily at the headquarters of their new hero, James Soong, the
Nationalist who has now turned independent, were lifelong
Nationalists themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The immediate cause of their emotional eruption was the
devastating defeat of Lien Chan, the Nationalists' own candidate
for president in Saturday's elections, alongside the near-victory
by Soong _ a former Nationalist icon elbowed aside by Lee, who thus
sowed the seeds for Saturday's defeat.
</P>
<P>
   Many Nationalist supporters distrust the opposition leader Chen
Shui-bian, who won on Saturday with 39 percent of the vote. But it
was Lee's responsibility for the bitter split among the
Nationalists that was the main complaint Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   To some outraged rank-and-file party members, the defeat
reflected inexcusable and selfish blunders by Lee and his failure
to democratize the party's own methods of candidate selection. With
a primary or other open process, many say, Soong would have been
the sole party candidate, and would have won handily.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the protesters in the streets said they believed much
worse: that Lee had intentionally schemed to get the
independence-leaning Chen elected, even if it meant the
near-destruction of their cherished Nationalist Party.
</P>
<P>
   Soong was once Lee's right-hand man at the party helm. He also
had helped Lee consolidate his power in the late 1980s: a
``mainlander'' himself, he helped persuade fellow skeptics among
those who fled China in 1949, when Chiang Kai-shek abandoned
Communist-dominated China for Taiwan, that they could accept Lee, a
Taiwan native with the island's distinctive rustic accent, as the
new national leader.
</P>
<P>
   Soong enjoyed strong support from the mainlanders, who with
their offspring make up less than 15 percent of Taiwan's population
of 22 million. Many of Sunday's demonstrators were mainlanders.
</P>
<P>
   Some of them, it was clear from their remarks, have long
resented what they considered Lee's takeover of the Nationalists.
What many saw as his increasingly dictatorial and unstable behavior
over the last four years, exemplified by his surprise announcement
of a ``state-to-state relationship'' with the mainland that caused
a crisis in relations with China last summer, only fed their
rancor.
</P>
<P>
   And now what many see _ with no real proof _ as his machinations
to further a secret pro-independence agenda is the last straw, an
unforgivable act of betrayal.
</P>
<P>
   A more tangible and serious charge against Lee is that after
helping to bring free elections to Taiwan he failed to confront the
next hurdle to democracy, the island's notoriously sleazy politics.
</P>
<P>
   Many experts say that while open vote-buying by the Nationalists
may be declining, improper links between politics and business and
even organized crime have if anything grown more prevalent as Lee
sought to preserve the Nationalist Party's power in local and
national elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``He took a short-term view, always doing what was needed to win
the next election,'' said Shelley Rigger, the author of ``Politics
in Taiwan'' (Routledge, 1999) and a political scientist at Davidson
College in North Carolina, in an interview. ``The price is that the
party has gotten deeper and deeper into the world of dirty money.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the downside to the Lee legacy,'' Rigger said. ``He
chose to go for the lazy win instead of the bold reforms.''

COMEDIAN AIRS HIS OWN FAMILY'S DIRTY LAUNDRY ON `TITUS' 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds.: Check local listings for time and channel.)  
 By JOHN CARMAN  
 c.2000, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   One casting note. Margot Kidder has signed to play an
eco-terrorist cannibal queen in the syndicated series ``Amazon.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark your calendars, and I mean now. It's a three-episode story
arc beginning April 22. Wonder if they know that's Earth Day?
</P>
<P>
   To business. This is the TV season of the chatterbox, and
stand-up comic Christopher Titus comes out with some heavy gab at
the top of his new, autobiographical Fox show, ``Titus,'' which
premieres Monday.
</P>
<P>
   (Back to Kidder. I'm just thinking, is there any chance she'll
talk while she eats?)
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, Titus, a lanky man with choppy blond hair, comes into a
sparsely furnished room and clicks on a bare lightbulb overhead.
The camera pulls in tight. He begins talking to us.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Los Angeles Times states 63 percent of American families
are now considered dysfunctional,'' he says. ``That means we're the
majority. We're normal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the people that had the mom, dad, sister, little white
picket fence _ those people are the freaks. Normal people'' _ seems
he forgot what he said just a moment ago _ ''terrify me, because
they haven't had enough problems in their lives to know how to
handle problems when they come up.''
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that the gist of the story that follows, and all the
stories in the three episodes Fox sent for preview, involve Titus'
not knowing how to handle problems when they come up.
</P>
<P>
   Such as the possibility that his father (played by Stacy Keach)
might be dead behind his bedroom door. See, it's been several days
since Dad emerged for a beer. Christopher, his dimwit brother Dave
(Zack Ward) and Christopher's girlfriend Erin (Cynthia Watros)
assume that he's dead.
</P>
<P>
   But no one has the nerve to open the door and check.
</P>
<P>
   So the dysfunctional part is genuine. Titus, in a recent
interview, said his real father has been married half a dozen
times.
</P>
<P>
   And, as in the show, his mother was institutionalized in a
mental asylum. Or, as Keach breaks the news to a much younger
Christopher in the show, ``Son, your mom is shacked up in the wacko
basket.''
</P>
<P>
   The show hops around. It's Titus addressing the audience. It's
Titus as a kid, enduring a beer-swilling father with a penchant for
macho carelessness. And it's Titus' present-day predicaments, many
revolving around Erin. She's based on Titus' real-life wife, Erin.
</P>
<P>
   If you can get past being chatted up by Titus, and the studio
audience laughter that seems to have been cranked up without mercy,
``Titus'' has its appeal.
</P>
<P>
   It's a brisk show with a young sensibility. Titus himself wears
surprisingly well once you get into the show, Keach is gruffly
imposing with a deft comic edge, and Watros unfailingly lights up
the place.
</P>
<P>
   The show is also, surely, about as far as network TV can stray
from the old ``Father Knows Best'' conventions without groans and
winces where there are supposed to be laughs.
</P>
<P>
   There's a sort of signal scene in which the childhood Titus is
beginning to extend a finger toward an electrical socket. His
mother, or possibly stepmom _ apparently we'll never see a full
facial shot of any of the elder Titus' wives _ moves to help. Dad
calls her back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, go on,'' he says to the boy.
</P>
<P>
   There's a crackling sound. The light in the room flickers.
</P>
<P>
   Dad: ``Bet you're not going to do that again, are you?''
</P>
<P>
   I can't say for sure where Titus' real-life experiences merge
into fiction on the show. But when he was asked in January about
his mother and stepmothers, he said this: ``My brother's mom, I
still talk to her. I talk to my second one. My third one, I haven't
heard from in a while. My sixth one, we talk on and off. But there
are times we have problems.''
</P>
<P>
   As for his real father, Titus said he demanded and got a new car
in exchange for being ridiculed on the show. A customized Ford
Expedition.

DEEP FEELING THAT TAIWAN IS CHINA'S IS PUT TO TEST 
</HEADLINE>
  (jw) 
 By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ Mulling over the shocking fact that Taiwan had chosen
the independence party, if not independence, in Saturday's
presidential election, a common response of many Chinese in Beijing
on Sunday was the nervous question: Do you think there will be war?
</P>
<P>
   Many shook their heads at the possibility. Although Beijing's
leaders have been silent about the victory of Chen Shui-bian, every
educated Beijinger now seems to know the details from satellite TV
and the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The idea that Taiwan will inevitably reunite with the mainland
is probably the most emotional, deeply held belief of ordinary
Chinese, from college students to retired factory workers. Last
week, Prime Minister Zhu Rongji said 1.25 billion Chinese would be
willing to ``spill blood'' to prevent its independence.
</P>
<P>
   But Chen's upset victory forced many Chinese to reflect for the
first time on the depth of their conviction, pitting their abstract
belief that the return of Taiwan is manifest destiny, against their
personal self-interest, since war would mean renewed hardship in a
country that has only recently improved its living standards.
</P>
<P>
   Late Saturday night the Chinese government issued its only
reaction to the victory, a brief, moderate statement, which said in
part, ``We will listen to the words and observe the actions of
Taiwan's new leader, and wait and see in which direction he takes
cross-strait relations.''
</P>
<P>
   A government poll released last week showed that 95 percent of
Chinese approved using military force if Taiwan sought
independence. But Sunday, the emotions behind that figure were
complex and contradictory. Although most Chinese will say they care
deeply about Taiwan, many are personally ambivalent about fighting
for the cause, even if they think a fight is inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   ``We strongly believe that Taiwan should return to the
motherland; after Hong Kong and Macao, it is the only one left,''
said a 20-year-old English major at People's University, who gave
her name as Xuan. ``But we don't support the use of force. That
wouldn't be good for anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Xuan, like many other young Chinese, has seen living standards
rise significantly in the last decade and has seen society change,
as China has opened its doors to Western culture and business. The
growing young elite watch NBA games, invest in stocks, travel
abroad.
</P>
<P>
   And the young elite know that a war with Taiwan, which would
almost certainly draw in the United States, would mean a return to
a more austere and isolationist life.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard for non-Chinese to understand the depths of the
Chinese devotion to Taiwan, which is born partly of decades of
Communist Party propaganda and partly of the humiliations of
China's history, when Westerners carved up China for their economic
advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``China was divided when it was weak, and now that it is getting
strong again, people's nationalist feeling rises and they feel
strongly it is time to reunite the country,'' said Zhang Yunling,
the head of South Asian Studies at the Chinese Academy of Social
Sciences.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, there is a strong conviction here that countries
naturally strive to keep every inch of land, no matter how remote
or at what cost. Chinese officials are wont to ask American
reporters how Americans would respond if Alaska or Hawaii tried to
secede. They seem disbelieving when the question is answered with
an indifferent shrug.
</P>
<P>
   And for many Chinese today, that deep emotional attachment still
governs their views.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ordinary people just want to get on with their lives, and
whether Taiwan becomes independent has no effect on them,'' said
Wang Wei, a store manager, who said he watched Taiwan's election
returns on a Hong Kong television station with some army friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``But,'' he added, ``if Taiwan does take steps toward
independence, we'll surely just have to give them a beating.''
</P>
<P>
   Others were less quick to the draw and hoped that their
government _ most known for its unyielding behavior _ would make
compromises.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think both sides will have to make adjustments to their
policies,'' said a 22-year-old physics major at Beijing University,
who refused to give his name. ``After all, Taiwan is democratic
now, and the people have exercised their own right to choose a
president.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, he too ``accepted that war was inevitable'' if Taiwan
declared independence, saying he personally could not bear the
thought of China's being divided forever. He added:
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea of unity is very important to the Chinese people, and
we treasure the idea. These ideas have sunken deeply into people's
minds, and we just accept them and wouldn't think of changing
them.''

A MESMERIZING `MOON' 
</HEADLINE>
   By STEVEN WINN  
 c.2000, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK &LR;   &LR; _ Everyone who loves great acting here had the
Broadway revival of ``A Moon for the Misbegotten'' penciled in to
their spring calendars long before it opened Sunday at the Walter
Kerr Theatre. The chief lure was Cherry Jones, the sublime star of
``The Heiress'' a few seasons back, who is playing the sensual and
beneficent Josie Hogan in Eugene O'Neill's late comic tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   Jones gives a carefully crafted and admirable performance as a
big-boned country girl in love with an alcoholic Broadway actor.
But the great acting in the show _ the heart-shattering,
spontaneous glory of this ``Moon'' _ comes from the two male leads,
Roy Dotrice and especially Gabriel Byrne.
</P>
<P>
   Plunging through the bourbon fumes and flirtatious charms of
James Tyrone Jr., Byrne reveals the acrid self-loathing and raw,
unreachable pain of the character closely based on the playwright's
doomed older brother. The climax comes in a mighty third-act
monologue of guilt and glimmering redemption that could stand alone
like a great aria.
</P>
<P>
   Byrne, the noted Irish film actor (``Miller's Crossing,'' ``End
of Days''), has a droll sense of playfulness in his early scenes
with Josie and her father, Phil.
</P>
<P>
   Dotrice is a perfect scoundrel as this tenant pig farmer, a
conniving scamp with an opportunist's flinty eye and a clockwork
sense of comic timing. He's as eager to dismiss his own son as ``a
pious lump'' as he is to taunt a snooty oil man neighbor (Tuck
Milligan) who makes the mistake of appearing at the Hogan shack
with a riding crop to register a complaint.
</P>
<P>
   ``Moon'' turns on a series of tricks and ill-conceived schemes.
Phil has designs on the Tyrone family money, and he'd like to get
his daughter in bed with his landlord James to blackmail him out of
some. Josie, who dodges and weaves around her own romantic resume,
is willing to see what happens when she gets James alone in the
moonlight.
</P>
<P>
   James gets into the spirit with his own gambit, pretending that
he's agreed to sell the Hogan farm to the oil man Harder. Further
feints and double-crosses complicate matters and, when the air
clears, finally convince Josie of James' goodness.
</P>
<P>
   But ``Moon,'' written as a kind of spiritual epilogue to the
Tyrone family chronicle of ``Long Day's Journey Into Night,''
doesn't rise or fall on plot. Like a lot of O'Neill's work, it
drifts toward deep, endlessly rolling waters that seem to set the
characters afloat in a vast darkness of the soul.
</P>
<P>
   That's what happens when James staggers back to the Hogan farm,
2 1/2 hours late and already well lubricated for his moonlit
rendezvous with Josie. Maddened by more bourbon to the point of
nearly raping her, he's driven at last to tell the story of his
mother's death. It all spills out of him like water freed from a
damn: her deathbed disappointment in his drinking, the awful train
trip home from California with her corpse and the whore he
entertained in another car.
</P>
<P>
   Cradled in Josie's arms, his body pooled there in exhaustion and
relief as he confesses his sins to her, Byrne carries the audience
along with James to the bottom. It's an astonishing, soul-scouring
feat.
</P>
<P>
   When he blinks his eyes open after a dreamless sleep, he seems
lighter, almost buoyant. Even his hangover is a blessing _ the
``heebie-jeebies'' are gone. But Byrne makes us see that this new,
unburdened James is also mortally fragile. Picking his way offstage
at the end, it's clear, he will never find his way back again.
</P>
<P>
   Josie is the agent and witness of it all. Jones plays her with a
blend of blunt physicality and soft-spoken tact. She swaggers
around in ungainly boots, thumping her body against the beaten
clapboard of Eugene Lee's set, hands on hips, her much-admired
breasts thrust out.
</P>
<P>
   Jones does a lot with her legs, which fall wide open when she
sits, shins bared. She's her father's trailer-trash equal when it
comes to tormenting Harder. Her voice, meanwhile, is touched with
wistful sweetness. Her neatly trimmed hair shines.
</P>
<P>
   Director Daniel Sullivan treats her like an improbable thing of
beauty. He blocks some key scenes with Josie's backside to the
audience and frames parts of her body now and then in the shack's
windows.
</P>
<P>
   It's all very skillfully worked out, but Jones' Josie never
comes together as a rounded character. The component parts shift in
and out of view _ the vigor and vulnerability, the surges of love
and wary misgivings _ without creating a bigger picture.
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan, the veteran Broadway director of Wendy Wasserstein,
Herb Gardner and others, is more at home with the play's comic
scenes. Dotrice's devilish glitter fades to pale self-negation. The
fourth act stutters.
</P>
<P>
   Byrne's performance gives this ``Moon'' its glowing center.
Audiences may come to see Jones. They'll come away with Byrne's
James Tyrone Jr. burned into their memories.

   Here are Anne Stephenson's capsule reviews of new books:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``TRUE NORTH'' &QL; 
 &UR; By Kimberly Kafka (Dutton, $23.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The protagonist of Kafka's first novel is Bailey Lockhart, a
35-year-old woman who has fled a troubled past to find solace as a
medic and bush pilot in the remote wilderness of Alaska. She lives
alone in a cabin 80 miles upriver from the nearest community, a
Native village with which she stays in touch by radio. The book
opens when she agrees to fly two tourists _ they claim to be
looking for a ``wilderness adventure'' but are really searching
illegally for Alaskan gold _ from Anchorage to a deserted lodge
five miles upriver from her camp. Add to this the romantic
attentions of Kash, a Native leader and realistic man who is trying
to look after the interests of his people, as well as the despair
and animosity felt toward Whites by many residents in the village,
and you have a pretty interesting look at major issues in Alaska
today. The plot lags a bit during the characters' seemingly endless
travels up and down the river, but Kash is appealing, Bailey is
strong and utterly capable, and their wilderness lives make for
good reading. Kafka, who is a wilderness emergency medical
technician, lives in Alaska and Wisconsin. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``THE PENGUIN BOOK OF IRISH FICTION'' &QL; 
 &UR; Edited by Colm Toibin (Viking, $40) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Toibin begins this anthology with a challenge: ``If you want to
read about the vagaries of the human heart,'' he says, ``or the
fleeting nature of love or time, read Goethe's lyrics; but if you
want to know about the unreliable nature of narrative in a time of
landlords, read Maria Edgeworth. If you want to know how love can
lead to marriage, read Jane Austen; but if you want to delve into
the secret and dark unconscious of an embattled ruling class, read
Bram Stoker, Charles Maturin and Joseph Sheridan Le Fanu.'' Such is
Irish fiction, a territory in which, to paraphrase Maria Edgeworth,
reality is too strong, passion too violent, the world too feverish
to look upon without the disguising balm of language. Toibin has
assembled fiction from the time of Jonathan Swift to that of Emma
Donoghue, who was born a mere 31 years ago. Included are broad
selections from James Joyce, as well as excerpts from Roddy Doyle's
``The Snapper,'' Edna O'Brien's ``The Country Girls,'' Oscar
Wilde's ``The Picture of Dorian Gray,'' John Banville's ``The Book
of Evidence,'' Iris Murdoch's ``The Red and the Green'' and many
others.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``A CONSPIRACY OF PAPER'' &QL; 
 &UR; By David Liss (Random House, $25) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Benjamin Weaver is a man who performs work of a ``delicate
nature'' on behalf of rich and illustrious men, clients who are
driven to insult him but whose barbs Weaver shrugs off ``as a bear
tosses off the dogs sent to bait it in Hockley-in-the-Hole.''
Weaver is the consummate outsider: He is a former boxer who now
works as a private investigator, of sorts; a brainy, brawling
thug-for-hire. He is also a Jew, which distances him further from
the men he serves. More important, he is the tremendously appealing
narrator of this first novel, one of the best to come along in
years. Set in 18th-century London, ;6[[{L}iracy'' takes Weaver into
a complex case that begins when he learns that the seemingly
accidental death of his father, a stock-jobber to whom Weaver had
not spoken in 10 years, was really a murder. Weaver's work becomes
personal tfH_b &UR; 7dB

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Making the Internet a tax-free zone seemed the right idea in
Congress 14 months ago. The Senate voted 96-2 for a three-year
moratorium on any new taxes on electronic commerce, and the House
agreed by voice vote. Congress also created a national advisory
commission whose members, congressional Republicans expected, would
recommend a permanent ban on taxing Internet sales.
</P>
<P>
   Things are not turning out that way. As the commission begins
its final meeting Monday in Dallas, it will almost certainly fail
to reach a consensus about what national policy to recommend.
</P>
<P>
   To the surprise of the anti-tax forces who thought they had
control of the commission, two-thirds of the 19 commissioners have
come out in favor of a level playing field, meaning that if an item
is subject to sales tax it should be taxed whether the item is sold
at a store, on the telephone, by mail order or over the Internet.
And these 14 commissioners, six from business and eight from
government at various levels, also agree that as a prelude to this,
sales taxes should be radically streamlined to make it efficient
and easy to administer.
</P>
<P>
   But despite this agreement on principles, there appears to be
virtually no prospect that the 14 commissioners will get together
to recommend applying sales taxes to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   In a conference call on Thursday with Gov. James Gilmore 3rd of
Virginia, the commission's chairman and a staunch foe of taxes, the
six business representatives on the commission were persuaded to
agree to a plan whose practical effect would be to delay any sales
taxes on Internet transactions until at least 2006. And if that
happens, all sides agree, the anti-tax policy wins by default
because so much commerce will have moved to the Internet by then
that imposing sales taxes would be a political impossibility.
</P>
<P>
   Maintaining the status quo means that a growing volume of sales
on the Internet will be untaxed, creating a competitive advantage
for some businesses. According to Gov. Mike Leavitt of Utah, a
Republican member of the commission who favors applying sales taxes
without regard to how goods are sold, the status quo would also
mean a declining tax base to finance police, fire departments,
schools and other basic services provided by state and local
governments.
</P>
<P>
   If sales tax receipts fall, Leavitt said, those states with
income taxes will have to raise rates. And local governments will
have to raise property taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Outside of the six business members of the commission,
representing America Online, AT&AMP;T, Gateway, MCI WorldCom, Charles
Schwab and Time Warner, there is wide support in the business
community for a level playing field for sales taxes. Business
groups including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the hastily
formed E-Fairness Coalition, whose 1.4 million member companies
employ one of every five American workers, and individual companies
like Wal-Mart Stores and Circuit City, argue emphatically that
sales taxes must not be tied to how products are sold.
</P>
<P>
   Many of these businesses now sell over the Internet. But those
that operate nationally must collect taxes on Internet sales in
every state in which they have a traditional store. By contrast,
under current rules an e-commerce company like Amazon.com, which
has its operations in the state of Washington, is not required to
collect sales taxes in states where it has no physical presence.
</P>
<P>
   Steven M. Case, chief executive of America Online, which has a
seat on the commission, favors a level playing field. ``It is wrong
for the Internet to be a tax haven,'' Case said during a meeting
with reporters and editors in New York recently. ``But it's equally
wrong for catalog sales to be a tax haven.''
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, every major organization of state and local
officials also opposes exempting purchases over the Internet from
sales taxes, the largest single source of revenue for these
governments.
</P>
<P>
   But the commission's business members and eight of its
government representatives differ on how the transition to taxing
Internet sales should be made. The business members sought ironclad
assurances that the sales tax system would be simplified first and
only then would goods sold over the Internet, by telephone and by
mail order be subject to taxes. The government representatives
wanted a 13-month plan to write new rules to simplify the sales tax
system, followed by quick congressional action to authorize
taxation of sales that cross state lines.
</P>
<P>
   A proposal to resolve the differences between the two sides was
worked out in recent weeks between David Pottruck, president and
co-chief executive of Charles Schwab, and Utah's Leavitt.
</P>
<P>
   During a protracted conference call on Thursday, Pottruck tried
to sell this plan to the other five business members of the
commission. ``I was trying to get a little bit more of a moderate
position'' on how to make the transition to taxing Internet sales
work, Pottruck said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   But the commissioners could not agree, so they called Gilmore to
advise him of their discussions. According to four people who
listened to all or part of the conversation, Gilmore said that
while he agreed with the need to simplify sales taxes, he did not
believe that position led inevitably to taxation of Internet sales.
And Gilmore said he would not support any plan favoring any tax
expansion.
</P>
<P>
   The governor then offered his own proposal, which called for
streamlined sales taxes, but put off until 2006 any further action
on applying sales taxes to Internet sales. Gilmore ``did a
masterful job'' of steering the business members away from joining
forces with Leavitt's camp, Pottruck said.
</P>
<P>
   If Gilmore delivers the five anti-tax votes Tuesday to join a
proposal by the six business members to streamline existing sales
taxes and defer their application to the Internet, a new issue will
arise. The law that created the advisory commission requires a
two-thirds vote to make policy recommendations. That means 13 votes
on the 19-member commission, not the 11 votes Gilmore has lined up.
But Gilmore plans to ignore that requirement, his aides said. He
will release an opinion from the commission's general counsel
saying it can sidestep that rule by issuing a report rather than
making a formal recommendation.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Letters urging the commission to do just that were issued Friday
by Sen. Trent Lott of Mississippi, the Senate Republican leader,
and Rep. Dick Armey of Texas, the House Republican leader, who said
that a simple majority was sufficient so long as the majority
position would make the Internet tax free, the policy they had
favored from the start.
</P>
<P>
   This high-level involvement shows how Internet taxes are
becoming an important political issue. Gov. George W. Bush of
Texas, the presumptive Republican presidential candidate, supports
the current three-year moratorium on Internet sales taxes, and
Gilmore is considered a potential running mate on the Republican
ticket.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore, in contrast, says he favors a level
playing field for retailers regardless of how they sell their
goods. Grover Norquist, an anti-tax member of the commission who as
president of Americans for Tax Reform has been the Republicans'
chief strategist on tax issues in the past decade, said he was
advising the Bush campaign to refer to Internet sales taxes as
``the Al Gore tax.''
</P>
<P>
   Leavitt said exempting the Internet and other remote sales from
taxation would create a situation that neither governments or
business could tolerate. If Internet sales remain untaxed, he said,
he expects business executives and business owners will ``besiege
Capitol Hill with one phrase on their lips _ level playing field.''

   Here are Anne Stephenson's capsule reviews of new books:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``TRUE NORTH'' &QL; 
 &UR; By Kimberly Kafka (Dutton, $23.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The protagonist of Kafka's first novel is Bailey Lockhart, a
35-year-old woman who has fled a troubled past to find solace as a
medic and bush pilot in the remote wilderness of Alaska. She lives
alone in a cabin 80 miles upriver from the nearest community, a
Native village with which she stays in touch by radio. The book
opens when she agrees to fly two tourists _ they claim to be
looking for a ``wilderness adventure'' but are really searching
illegally for Alaskan gold _ from Anchorage to a deserted lodge
five miles upriver from her camp. Add to this the romantic
attentions of Kash, a Native leader and realistic man who is trying
to look after the interests of his people, as well as the despair
and animosity felt toward Whites by many residents in the village,
and you have a pretty interesting look at major issues in Alaska
today. The plot lags a bit during the characters' seemingly endless
travels up and down the river, but Kash is appealing, Bailey is
strong and utterly capable, and their wilderness lives make for
good reading. Kafka, who is a wilderness emergency medical
technician, lives in Alaska and Wisconsin. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``THE PENGUIN BOOK OF IRISH FICTION'' &QL; 
 &UR; Edited by Colm Toibin (Viking, $40) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Toibin begins this anthology with a challenge: ``If you want to
read about the vagaries of the human heart,'' he says, ``or the
fleeting nature of love or time, read Goethe's lyrics; but if you
want to know about the unreliable nature of narrative in a time of
landlords, read Maria Edgeworth. If you want to know how love can
lead to marriage, read Jane Austen; but if you want to delve into
the secret and dark unconscious of an embattled ruling class, read
Bram Stoker, Charles Maturin and Joseph Sheridan Le Fanu.'' Such is
Irish fiction, a territory in which, to paraphrase Maria Edgeworth,
reality is too strong, passion too violent, the world too feverish
to look upon without the disguising balm of language. Toibin has
assembled fiction from the time of Jonathan Swift to that of Emma
Donoghue, who was born a mere 31 years ago. Included are broad
selections from James Joyce, as well as excerpts from Roddy Doyle's
``The Snapper,'' Edna O'Brien's ``The Country Girls,'' Oscar
Wilde's ``The Picture of Dorian Gray,'' John Banville's ``The Book
of Evidence,'' Iris Murdoch's ``The Red and the Green'' and many
others.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``A CONSPIRACY OF PAPER'' &QL; 
 &UR; By David Liss (Random House, $25) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Benjamin Weaver is a man who performs work of a ``delicate
nature'' on behalf of rich and illustrious men, clients who are
driven to insult him but whose barbs Weaver shrugs off ``as a bear
tosses off the dogs sent to bait it in Hockley-in-the-Hole.''
Weaver is the consummate outsider: He is a former boxer who now
works as a private investigator, of sorts; a brainy, brawling
thug-for-hire. He is also a Jew, which distances him further from
the men he serves. More important, he is the tremendously appealing
narrator of this first novel, one of the best to come along in
years. Set in 18th-century London, ``Conspiracy'' takes Weaver into
a complex case that begins when he learns that the seemingly
accidental death of his father, a stock-jobber to whom Weaver had
not spoken in 10 years, was really a murder. Weaver's work becomes
personal then, and he throws himself into an investigation that
goes deep into the world of British finance and into the dark
territory of the city's criminal elite. It's great entertainment,
which Liss serves up with intelligence, historical accuracy and
rip-roaring ambition. Enjoy.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``JANE GOODALL: 40 YEARS AT GOMBE'' &QL; 
 &UR; (ST&AMP;C, $29.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   We had a conversation recently with a man of a certain age, who
told us that the consensus among men of his generation is that Jane
Goodall was, as he put it, ``a babe.'' We confess we had never
heard that word applied to Goodall (and we imagine that she would
be amused to know of it), but we were reminded of the sentiment as
we looked at the early photographs in this book. They are personal
memories for so many people, these images of a barefoot, slender
young woman in shorts, long hair tied back, her attention given
over wholly to the intelligent animals that she would study all her
life. Her first article on the chimpanzees of the Gombe Stream Game
Reserve in Tanzania appeared in ``National Geographic''in 1963, and
it was not long before everyone knew who Goodall was. Today, she is
66 and travels constantly on a public relations mission to preserve
and enhance the lives of the creatures she came to love. This book
is a reminder of what a great combination youth, daring and
commitment can be. And he's right: She was something to see.  &QL;

BOB BLACKMAN, AN INNOVATIVE COLLEGE FOOTBALL COACH, DIES AT 81 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By WILLIAM N. WALLACE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bob Blackman, an innovative football coach at Dartmouth,
Illinois and Cornell in a career that spanned 34 seasons, died
Friday at a hospital in Burlingame, Calif. Blackman, who lived in
Hilton Head, S.C., was 81.
</P>
<P>
   Blackman's wife, Katharine, said he was hospitalized while they
were on vacation in Singapore and was found to have a bacterial
infection and anemia. While they were flying home last Thursday,
his condition worsened, and he was transferred to a hospital after
their flight landed in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Coaching 16 seasons at Dartmouth, Blackman led his teams to
seven of the first 15 championships in formal Ivy League play, and
his squads went undefeated and untied in 1962, 1965 and 1970.
</P>
<P>
   It was his recruiting zeal that caught the attention of the
eight-team Ivy League. ``Bob taught the Ivies how to recruit
nationally when there were no numbers limitations,'' Seaver Peters,
a former Dartmouth athletic director, once said. ``He had a
national network.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Blackman's 1970 Dartmouth team, which held six of nine opponents
scoreless, concluded with a rare-for-the-Ivies top-20 ranking
(14th) in the two national polls and won the Lambert Trophy as the
best team in the East.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Penn State Coach Joe Paterno, partly in jest, challenged this
award and suggested a postseason game between his team _ a
perennial national power _ and Dartmouth. ``If we were allowed to
play a postseason game, I'd prefer to play a team with a better
record,'' Blackman replied. Penn State's was 7-3. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After that season, it was on to Illinois for Blackman, whose
goal was to build championship teams to represent the Big Ten in
the Rose Bowl game, which was a shrine of sorts for Blackman.
</P>
<P>
   He was an alumnus of the University of Southern California, also
a native of Long Beach, and he had played in the Rose Bowl in a
high school championship game. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When an 18-year-old USC freshman football player, Blackman was
stricken with polio in his right side and given little chance to
walk again. But he regained his health, and a year later was
playing football again, limping through the drills. The head coach,
Howard Jones, kindly made him an assistant freshman coach, and the
vocational die was cast.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Blackman, who was left with mild polio limitations, disliked any
handicap classification. He made a point of showing up _ with skis
_ at the Dartmouth ski area during Winter Carnival weekends.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He served in the Navy during World War II and began college
coaching at Pasadena City College in 1949, taking his teams to
national junior college championships in 1951 and 1952. They played
home games in the Rose Bowl. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Next he went to Denver University for two seasons, taking the
Pioneers to their first Skyline Conference title in 34 years. Along
the way he was tinkering the something he called the V-formation, a
forerunner of the wishbone offense, and with original, intricate
defenses. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Dartmouth sought a new coach and persuaded Paul Brown, coach and
founder of the Cleveland Browns of the National Football League, to
review candidates. Brown's son, Mike, was the Dartmouth varsity
quarterback.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Red Rolfe, the former New York Yankees' third baseman and a
Dartmouth alumnus, was the athletic director,'' Mike Brown
recalled. ``He sent game films of the three leading candidates, and
my father and his staff recommended Bob Blackman.''
</P>
<P>
   Blackman's record at Dartmouth was 104 victories, 37 defeats and
three ties.
</P>
<P>
   As Blackman's first Dartmouth quarterback, in 1955, Mike Brown
tied the college record for scoring touchdowns with 10. ``All of
them were scored on quarterback sneaks,'' Brown remembered. ``Bob
made sure my accomplishment was a big part of that year's highlight
film. The film was shown at a Dartmouth alumni gathering in my
hometown, Cleveland, and by the time the last quarterback sneak
came up, the audience was giggling. I was embarrassed.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Attention to the smallest details, quarterback sneaks or
whatever, were a part of the Blackman scheme, which included use of
early computers in accounting for opponents' offensive tendencies. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``He knew exactly what he wanted each player to do on every
play,'' Brown said. ``And he could coach every position.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One of Blackman's most memorable players was Jake Crouthamel, a
running back from 1957 to 1959, who succeeded him as head coach in
1971 and is currently director of athletics at Syracuse University.
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At Illinois, there were no invitations to the Rose Bowl and
disillusion set in. His teams' results over six seasons were modest
_ 29 victories, 36 losses and one tie. So Blackman returned to the
Ivies, going to Cornell, coaching his teams there to 23 victories,
37 defeats and a tie, with his best finish second place in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the less than overwhelming success his second time
around in the Ivies, Blackman once remarked: ``I like the Ivy
League _ the only conference where the coaches are paid more than
the players.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his wife, Blackman is survived by a daughter,
Julie, of Hilton Head, and two granddaughters.

POPE'S VISIT TO MIDEAST SEEN AS SPIRITUAL, POLITICAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES M. SENNOTT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AMMAN, Jordan _ When Pope John Paul II arrives here Monday he
begins what the Vatican insists is a deeply personal and spiritual
pilgrimage, and not a political journey.
</P>
<P>
   But this is the Middle East, and he is the pope.
</P>
<P>
   So nearly everything about the 79-year-old pontiff's visit to
Israel and the Palestinian territories _ a path strewn with
land-mine issues such as the future of Jerusalem, Palestinian
independence, and the haunting history of the Holocaust _ is seen
here as political.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next six days, John Paul will follow in the footsteps
of Jesus and revisit the roots of his faith _ a trip that took five
years of intense diplomatic and logistical preparations and which
celebrates this Jubilee Year dedicated to the 2,000th anniversary
of the birth of Jesus.
</P>
<P>
   It marks the first time a pope has visited Israel since Pope
Paul VI in 1964. In the interim, two Arab-Israeli wars were fought,
the Palestinian uprising exploded, the Persian Gulf War engulfed
the region and then cleared the way for a peace process that has
become tortuously bogged down.
</P>
<P>
   And in all that time, John Paul becomes the first pope ever to
visit Israel since the Holy See recognized the state of Israel in
1994.
</P>
<P>
   John Paul has said he sees the journey as the crowning of a
21-year reign that has taken him to more than 90 countries. His has
been a papacy of breathtaking change, from his role in the
political demise of the Soviet Union beginning in his native Poland
in the early 1980s; to this month's sweeping apology for sins of
Catholics from the brutality of the Crusades to the injustice of
anti-Semitism.
</P>
<P>
   The pope is scheduled to ascend Mount Nebo, where Moses died
after leading the Israelites out of Egyptian captivity before they
crossed over the Jordan and into the Promised Land. It is one more
step in what he calls the path of Abraham, the patriarch that binds
together Jews, Christians, and Muslims in their belief in one God.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday the pope plans to celebrate Mass in an Amman stadium for
the small minority of Roman Catholics in this overwhelmingly Muslim
kingdom. Then he will go to the banks of the River Jordan, where
Jesus was baptized by John.
</P>
<P>
   From Jordan, the pontiff will travel to Bethlehem, where Jesus
was born, to Nazareth, where he grew up, to the Galilee, where he
centered his ministry, and to Jerusalem, where he was crucified.
</P>
<P>
   The pope's very presence in Jerusalem is seen as politically
charged, since both Israelis and Palestinians claim the Holy City
as their capital.
</P>
<P>
   Israel says that Jerusalem is its eternal and indivisible
capital. The Palestinians say that East Jerusalem and the Old City,
which were captured by Israel in the 1967 Six Day War from Jordan,
should be the capital of their future state.
</P>
<P>
   The Vatican _ and most of the governments of the world including
the United States _ say that the future of Jerusalem should be
determined at the final peace talks between Israelis and
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   But both sides seem to be angling to use the pope's visit to
legitimize their claims as he arrives at a critical time just
months before the final peace talks are set to begin.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Michael McGarry, rector of Tantour, a theological
institute established by the Vatican in Jerusalem, said: ``One way
to think of this trip is visually. What will be the defining image?
The pope holding a Palestinian child at a refugee camp? The pope
praying at the Western Wall? The pope visiting Yad Vashem?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think in the end it will be all of these images, and the
political sides will choose whichever image they want to focus
on,'' McGarry said. ``But I think for the pope, this trip is a
spiritual pilgrimage. That is the image he comes here with.''
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, John Paul will visit Yad Vashem, the Israeli
Holocaust memorial, and Deheishe Refugee Camp, one of the many
where the estimated 3.5 million Palestinian refugees ended up after
being displaced by the Arab-Israeli wars of 1948 and 1967. He will
meet Ehud Barak, the Israeli prime minister, and Yasser Arafat, the
Palestinian Authority president.
</P>
<P>
   But even this carefully balanced itinerary could touch off
controversy.
</P>
<P>
   Rabbi David Rosen, a key figure in the dialogue between the
Vatican and Israel who has met with the pontiff on a dozen
occassions in recent years, has praised his relentless effort to
bridge the gulf between Catholics and Jews. But he said the Vatican
must be careful not to make it appear that the Yad Vashem visit is
being balanced against the Palestinian refugee camp visit.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he does this he will stumble into one of the most
dangerously emotional pitfalls in the Middle East. The two historic
occurrences are simply not comparable,'' said Rosen, who is the
director of the Anti-Defamation League in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   ``To even set up an itinerary that suggests that the loss of 6
million Jews in the Holocaust could be compared to the Palestinian
refugee problem, as serious and real an issue as that is, is
something that would strike a very sensitive nerve in Israel,''
Rosen said.
</P>
<P>
   John Paul visits one week after a historic act of contrition by
the church. The pope issued a sweeping apology for sins of
Catholics, from atrocities of the Crusades and the Inquisition, to
brutal acts against Jews in which Catholics participated.
</P>
<P>
   Many Israelis and Jews worldwide have welcomed this, but many
also took notice that the Pope did not specifically mention the
Holocaust in his March 12 ``Day of Pardon'' Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Some extremists in Israel are vowing to protest the pope's
visit, and Sunday, swastikas were painted on the helipad where the
pope is to arrive in Tel Aviv and fake blood was spattered on
welcome signs.
</P>
<P>
   David Kimche, president of the Israel Council on Foreign
Relations and a former ambassador-at-large for Israel, said: ``What
was not said in Rome left a bitter aftertaste . . . I hope that
what was not said in Rome will be said in Jerusalem. If not, the
bitter aftertaste will remain.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Israelis are not the only ones waiting for words of
repentence.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Naim Ateek, an Anglican priest and Palestinian
theologian, said Palestinians are hoping that the pope will use his
moral authority to encourage Israel ``to apologize for the
oppression of Palestinians.'' He hopes that the visit to the
refugee camp will enlighten the world to the right of return of
Palestinian refugees, another particularly thorny issue to be
resolved at the negotiating table.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pope will come here for a short time, but we are going to
live here for a long time,'' said Ateek, a powerful voice in the
Christian minority of the predominantly Muslim Palestinian
population.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need a strong statement from the pope that will make it
clear that the people who are oppressed and who live under
occupation are the Palestinians,'' Ateek said. ``If the pope does
not do it, some of us are going to be embarassed.''
</P>
<P>
   Christians _ half of them Eastern Orthodox, a third Roman
Catholic, and the rest various denominations of Orthodoxy and
Protestantism _ are less than 2 percent of the total population in
Israel, the West Bank, and Gaza. In Jordan, the Christians
represent about 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The Arab Christians' diminishing presence in the Middle East is
another sensitive issue that the pope will face in his trip, and
many Christian leaders are hoping that he will address their plight
as a minority caught between a powerful Jewish state that sees them
as Palestinian and a surging Palestinian Muslim population that
often overlooks their concerns as a Christian minority. The result
is that Christians are emigrating at a high rate to the United
States, Canada, Australia, and Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   Bernard Sabella, a professor at Bethlehem University and
director of the International Christian Committee, who has
documented the diminishing Christian presence in the Holy Land,
said, ``The pope's presence is very important to Christians
regardless of denomination. He doesn't need to say anything
directly to us, or anything directly political. All he needs to do
is show how important the Christian presence is in the Holy Land.''
</P>
<P>
   Marcel DuBois, professor at Hebrew University and the winner of
the Israel Prize for decades of scholarship to promote
understanding between Jews and Christians, said, ``The Pope is
coming back to the sources of his faith, and he does this as a
prilgrim. I think all of the attention on the political issues
misses the point, the personal holiness of John Paul II. This is
genuine. And this is the reason he is here despite the way everyone
will interpret it.''

ROBERT L. ``BOB'' BLACKMAN, 81; LONGTIME DARTMOUTH COACH 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Robert L. ``Bob'' Blackman, who coached Dartmouth College to
undefeated seasons in 1962 and 1965 and devised innovative plays _
including one that helped put the Tennessee Titans into the Super
Bowl this year _ died Friday. He was 81.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Blackman died after contracting an unknown disease while
touring Singapore and Malaysia, his wife, Kay, said. He was deemed
well enough to return to his home in Hilton Head, S.C., but he fell
ill again during the flight, she said.
</P>
<P>
   After the plane made an emergency landing in San Francisco, Mr.
Blackman was taken to Peninsula Medical Center in Burlingame,
Calif., where he died of complications.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Blackman also coached at the University of Illinois and
Cornell University, but he made his mark at Dartmouth and was
inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   He began his coaching career as a student at the University of
Southern California after his own promising career was derailed
when he contracted polio during his freshman year. Unable to
abandon the sport, Mr. Blackman became a student assistant to the
coaching staff at USC.
</P>
<P>
   After graduation, he coached several naval base teams during
World War II. He coached Monrovia High School in California after
the war before taking a position at Pasadena City College, where
his 1951 team won the National Junior College championship.
</P>
<P>
   Then, after two years at Denver University, Mr. Blackman
succeeded Tuss McLaughry at Dartmouth in 1955.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a revelation to me,'' retired Boston Globe columnist
and former Darmouth sports information director Ernie Roberts said
Saturday from his home in Hobe Sound, Fla. ``He was an innovator in
what seemed to be mundane things, such as the way the team came out
of the dressing room and broke up into groups, with every group at
a particular part of the field, like The Rockettes. Everything was
organized. He didn't leave anything to chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Blackman was remembered as an imaginative coach, with many
people pointing to the final play in this season's NFL playoff
match between the Buffalo Bills and the Titans: a kickoff return
that ended with a cross-field lateral that led to the winning
touchdown. Mr. Blackman has been credited as the originator of the
play, which he once used to beat Harvard.
</P>
<P>
   In 16 seasons, Dartmouth garnered seven Ivy League titles and
tied for three more. Mr. Blackman's 1970 team, his last at
Dartmouth, is considered among the best in school history,
compiling a 9-0 record while outscoring opponents by a 311-42
margin. That season also included six shutouts. The team received
the Lambert Trophy as the best college football team in the East
that year, beating out Penn State.
</P>
<P>
   When he retired from Dartmouth, Mr. Blackman left as the
winningest coach in school history with a record of 104-37-3. Years
later, he was made an honorary member of Dartmouth's Class of 1941,
the year Mr. Blackman graduated from USC.
</P>
<P>
   In retirement, Mr. Blackman was affiliated with the East-West
Shrine Game.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his wife, Mr. Blackman leaves his daughter,
Julie, of Hilton Head, S.C. Funeral arrangements were incomplete.

   Insurers Tread Carefully With Web

   Insurance companies have acknowledged the Internet's potential
for simplifying the byzantine process of finding insurance quotes
and applying for coverage, but they also note the downsides:
Consumers, they say, cannot use the Web to speak with real people

risk an insurrection among the insurance agents who have been their

RIOTS ROCK TAIPEI DAY AFTER NATIONALISTS ARE OUSTED FROM POWER 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By MARK LANDLER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAIPEI, Taiwan _ A day after Taiwan's Nationalist Party was
swept from power after more than 50 years, the fury of the losers
erupted Sunday night, forcing President Lee Teng-hui to barricade
himself inside his party headquarters as thousands of disaffected
supporters battled with the police for hours.
</P>
<P>
   While the worst riots in a decade raged outside the building _
sealed like a fortress with cordons of riot policemen and powerful
water cannons _ Lee bowed somewhat to the intense anger, and agreed
to step down as party chairman in September, a year earlier than
planned. Three senior party leaders submitted their resignations,
but in the turmoil, Lee refused to accept them.
</P>
<P>
   The unraveling of the Nationalist Party after its candidate
finished last in a bitter three-way presidential race poses huge
potential dangers for Taiwan at a time of delicate transition.
</P>
<P>
   The country's newly elected president, the opposition leader
Chen Shui-bian, is viewed with deep suspicion by China for his past
advocacy of Taiwanese independence. So far, Beijing has had no
official reaction to his election, but Washington is so concerned
that senior administration men have been dispatched to China to
keep tensions from escalating.
</P>
<P>
   After a half-century of iron rule, the Nationalists are being
replaced by Chen and his Democratic Progressive Party, which with
the legislature still under Nationalist control, will preside over
a divided government.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, James Soong, the former Nationalist who ran as an
independent and finished a close second in Saturday's election,
announced the formation of a new party, in effective splitting the
Nationalist movement.
</P>
<P>
   If Lee is forced out as the Nationalists' chairman, it is
unclear how effectively he could govern Taiwan until May 20, when
Chen is inaugurated.
</P>
<P>
   Chen sought to cool tempers, saying: ``With the end of the
election, fervor should also become a thing of the past. We hope
everyone will calm down so things can slowly return to normal.''
</P>
<P>
   But as the magnitude of their defeat became clear to the
Nationalists, the tensions long simmering in their ranks exploded
into the streets of this normally tranquil capital.
</P>
<P>
   Protesters, the vast majority of them supporters of Soong, cried
``Lee Teng-hui is a traitor!'' and pelted the Nationalists'
headquarters with eggs and stones. They set upon the arriving cars
of Nationalist officials, smashing windshields. One adviser to Lee
was dragged out of his car and beaten; another fled in a panic.
</P>
<P>
   ``The KMT is very weak now,'' said Lee Ching-ping, who attended
Sunday's emergency meeting of the Kuomintang, as the Nationalists
are known in Taiwan. ``The question is: Who will be the next leader
of the party?''
</P>
<P>
   For the party, Lee's departure would leave a major vacuum. The
charismatic, 79-year-old president has utterly dominated the
Nationalists for more than decade, since he succeeded Chiang
Ching-kuo in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   But Lee's leadership has been more divisive than is commonly
thought in the outside world, where he is viewed as the man who
brought democracy to Taiwan. In recent years, the party has become
split between native-born Taiwanese _ like Lee _ who favor taking a
strong line toward China, and mainland-born people _ like Soong _
who favor a more conciliatory approach.
</P>
<P>
   Lee ignited a firestorm in July when he announced that Taiwan
and China could negotiate reunification only on a ``special
state-to-state'' basis. China, which views Taiwan as a renegade
province, denounced Lee for taking the first steps toward Taiwan
independence.
</P>
<P>
   The party split was aggravated when Lee clashed with Soong, a
Nationalist heavyweight who had become one of the country's most
popular politicians as the provincial governor of Taiwan. After Lee
picked the more reserved Lien Chan instead of Soong to be his
designated successor, Soong declared that he would run as an
independent and was expelled from the party.
</P>
<P>
   The feud between Lee and Soong was so bitter that supporters of
Soong believe that the president would have done anything to defeat
his candidacy _ even if it meant throwing the election to the
opposition's candidate, Chen. Although Lee campaigned on behalf of
the Nationalist candidate, Lien, his support was perceived as less
than passionate.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Chen's past support for Taiwan independence is seen by
many as closer to Lee's position than either Soong's or Lien's.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Chen drew 39 percent of the vote, while Soong won 36
percent and Lien 23 percent. Some political analysts said Lien's
weakness played to Chen's advantage. And that, to the protesters,
was proof that Lee had orchestrated his own party's defeat.
</P>
<P>
   ``This party has a 100-year history, and he sold it out in a
single election,'' said Jerry Ho, 31, a businessman. ``His strategy
was to pull down Lien's vote, so Chen would win the election.''
</P>
<P>
   Ho said he believed that 95 percent of the protesters accepted
the result of the election and the legitimacy of the new president.
But he said the demonstrators wanted to hold Lee accountable for
his role.
</P>
<P>
   Another demonstrator who gave his name as Chen said Lee was ``a
traitor.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not enough for him to step down in a few months,'' said
Chen, as he clutched one of the hundreds of air horns that were
being sounded in a deafening cacophony of rage. ``We want him to
resign immediately.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Soong sought to channel the anger of his
supporters. He announced that he would create a new political party
to challenge the primacy of the Nationalists. The party, which does
not yet have a name, would be similar to the Nationalists in
ideology, he said, but would be cleaner, breaking with the
corruption that long characterized Nationalist rule.
</P>
<P>
   ``The KMT has gone against the wishes of the people and against
the democratic process,'' Soong said, as hundreds of cheering
supporters mobbed the streets outside his campaign headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Mindful of the mayhem across town, Soong urged his supporters to
be ``calm and rational'' and avoid ``bloodshed.''
</P>
<P>
   Soong left the door open to a possible reconciliation with the
Nationalists, saying he would pursue talks with other parties. It
was not clear whether he could bridge the gap with his former
colleagues, though some officials of the Nationalist Party are
reportedly eager to see Soong return.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   It was clear Sunday that Lee was losing support, even among
Nationalist officials who had not defected to Soong's camp. Sunday
night, Ma Ying-jeou, the popular mayor of Taipei, tried to calm the
demonstrators by telling them that he would pass on to Lee their
demand for his resignation.
</P>
<P>
   Ma, who is one of Nationalists' rising stars, earlier faxed in
his resignation from the party's standing committee. Lien, humbled
by his poor showing in the election, also submitted his resignation
as deputy chairman of the party. But neither Lien and Ma were able
to attend the emergency party meeting because the building's
entrance was blocked by dozens of howling protesters.
</P>
<P>
   Those people who got close wound up being attacked. Witnesses
said Hsu Li-teh, a top adviser to Lee, was pulled out of his car
and beaten. Wang Jyng-ping, the speaker of the legislature, fled
from the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Lee managed to get into the building. But after the meeting,
protesters trapped him inside for several hours by crowding around
the exits. He finally escaped after 5:30 p.m. when a phalanx of
riot policemen and a water-cannon truck cleared a path for his
motorcade.
</P>
<P>
   Lee did not issue a statement. And political analysts cautioned
that the president was not likely to give up his position without a
fight. But on the day that Taiwan opened a new chapter in its
political history, he increasingly seemed like a relic _ and the
party he heads bankrupt.
</P>
<P>
   ``We used to think of the Kuomintang as this huge, powerful
party,'' said James D. Seymour, a senior research scholar at the
East Asian Institute of Columbia University. ``But we found out
this weekend that the emperor has no clothes.''

   DHAKA, Bangladesh _ The wretched squatter colony known as the
Kawran Bazaar Bustee straddles Dhaka's main railroad line, the
relentless iron wheels of the trains rolling within feet of the
flimsy hovels of scrap metal and thatch.
</P>
<P>
   The slum's only open space is the narrow lane between the two
tracks, so working parents often think it wise to tie up their
small children rather than to let them wander. Three months ago,
Hanufa, age 3, was slow to heed the dangerous chugging of an
oncoming engine. Her head wounds have since healed but her right
hand was torn off at the wrist.
</P>
<P>
   Asiya Khatun is the girl's grandmother. She has lived beside the
trains for 20 years, making her home in a filthy lean-to barely a
yard square. A small crowd huddled near her on a recent day as she
assessed her life. ``We have nothing, and we are nobodies,'' she
concluded, with the others nodding in agreement as if they had just
heard a concise rendering of perfect truth.
</P>
<P>
   About a third of Dhaka's 9 million people live in some of the
world's most miserable slums, grafting themselves to empty patches
of precious land. The Kawran colony is unusual in that it is not
only near a busy railway but also within 200 yards of a five-star
hotel, the place where Bill Clinton and the U.S. entourage will
freshen up when they arrive here on Monday. He will be the first
American president to visit Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
   Except for televised images of its reiterating and incomparable
floods, this nation _ the eighth-most-populous on the planet _ does
not often come to the United States' attention. It is perhaps best
known as the pet cause of George Harrison, the former Beatle, who
in 1971 had a hit song with the unusually sober rock lyric:
``Bangladesh, Bangladesh/Where so many people are dying fast/And it
sure looks like a mess/I've never seen so much distress.''
</P>
<P>
   That lament accompanied the country's difficult birth after a
war of independence against Pakistan. Three decades later,
Bangladesh remains one of the world's poorest nations. The per
capita income is $289. A million villagers each year lose their
homes to fickle rivers that engulf their land. Democracy suffers
prolonged malfunctions, in part because the two women who run the
main political parties hate each other down to the bone.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in most ways Bangladesh is now decidedly in less of a mess,
with the poverty rate drifting down and economic growth rates
inching up. Indeed, many here fear that Clinton is coming not just
to shake hands but to make money. It seems that Bangladesh is
sitting on a small fortune in natural gas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're calling this the Persian Gulf East,'' said Forrest E.
Cookson, an American economic consultant who has been involved in a
study of the potential profits from the gas.
</P>
<P>
   That is hyperbole, but initial exploration by foreign oil
companies does show that Bangladesh may have not only enough gas
for its own needs but a sizable surplus as well. The amount of the
abundance is uncertain, however, and that poses a problem. Big
corporations are willing to bore more wells, but in turn they want
guarantees that they can maximize profits by selling any oversupply
to gas-needy India, the colossus next door.
</P>
<P>
   Bangladeshi leaders are wary of such deals. Their own experts
guess the gas reserves to be modest. And if a glut does exist, they
argue that it should be used at home, converted into fertilizer or
electricity rather than sold to a neighbor thought to be
overbearing. The U.S. government, it is presumed, sides with its
oil giants.
</P>
<P>
   ``Colonial exploitation is a fact of our lives,'' said Serajul
Islam Choudhury, an English professor and well-known social
commentator. ``People here think America is the new East India
Company. Mr. Clinton is the company's big man.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials quietly insist otherwise, saying Clinton is
simply making a day trip here while in the neighborhood, in advance
of five days in India and a short pause in Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   But the apprehensions are understandable. A recipient of $1.5
billion a year in international aid, disaster-prone Bangladesh is
used to being treated as a beggar and not courted for its purse.
</P>
<P>
   Mother Nature has exhibited the full arc of her mood swings in
this country. On one hand, Bangladesh possesses the world's largest
delta landscape, with bountiful rivers that crisscross in long
braids. The earth is continually enriched by alluvial silt. The
greenery is lush. Farmers manage to feed 128 million people _
almost half the population of the United States _ packed into a
country slightly smaller than Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   But the water knows no master and is often a deadly conduit.
Bacteria in ponds have been prolific killers. In response, the
government and UNICEF and other aid groups convinced villagers to
sink tube wells to tap the underground aquifer. But that drinking
water now turns out to be tainted with dangerous levels of arsenic.
Millions of people are slowly poisoning themselves sip by sip, and
the authorities do not know what to do.
</P>
<P>
   In the long, wet summers, snow-melt from the Himalayas and
monsoon rains hit the rivers with such force that they alter the
contours of the channels, and then the Darwinian laws of real
estate take effect. Where the poor once had homes, there is now
river. And where there was once river, there is now virgin land,
inevitably gobbled up by the rich.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look out there,'' said Abdul Ahad, a bony, bare-chested man
covered from the waist down in a skirtlike wrap called a lungi. He
was pointing into the brown calm of the Jamuna River at a spot
about a quarter-mile offshore. ``Four years ago that's where my
home was, mine and 200 others and a school too. The river ate
them.''
</P>
<P>
   His village is Jafarganj, a place with houses of thatched walls
and cement floors, about 60 miles west of Dhaka. Each summer, the
vagabond river swallows more of the village, although the size and
timing of the bites are hard to predict. Some people who think they
are safe for another year suddenly see their homes licked away by
the current.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who wants to live with such uncertainty?'' asked Rowshan Ara,
a woman with three young children at her side. ``But we cling to
what we have for as long as we can.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Victims of the rivers take refuge with relatives or settle along
the fringe of the dirt roads. Or they go to Dhaka, the capital,
living in slums like the Kawran Bazaar Bustee, some of them
clinging to deeds for land that has been submerged for generations.
</P>
<P>
   Shirin, who uses only one name, says she was brought to Kawran
when she was 6 months old. She is unsure of her own age, but her
two daughters are 2{ and 1. She lifted a blue plastic curtain to
display a tiny cave of a home with walls of blankets and burlap.
Flies were doing their primitive dance above a husk of coconut.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can sometimes get work as a maid,'' she said. ``But when I
am gone, I worry about my children. My cousin is here, but she is
busy.''
</P>
<P>
   There is a fish market near the slum, and the odor of the
rotting catch is powerful. For income, people sometimes buy a few
fish, cut them up and try to sell the pieces for a profit. Others
pull rickshaws, earning about $1 a day.

<P>
   Between the train tracks, mothers cook over fires fueled with
wood chips. Children play games of carom. There is water to fetch,
but it is expensive at 4 cents a pitcher. The privacy of an
outhouse costs about the same.
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 23, there was a police attack on the squatter colony,
part of the government's occasional effort at slum clearance. ``I
asked them where they expected me to go,'' said Beauty, an old
woman with a squint that made her eyes look like two brown
peepholes. ``They told me to go back to my village, but I am from
Lakshmipur and everything there was taken by the river. The only
thing left are small islands of sand. What should I do, eat the
sand?''
</P>
<P>
   Life is a day-to-day struggle, yet many in Bangladesh are
escaping poverty. The nation has become known for its plenitude of
nongovernmental organizations, many made rich by foreign donors,
which are credited with impressive gains in health care, population
control and the empowerment of women. They have helped peasants buy
income-producing farm animals.
</P>
<P>
   The government itself has made sincere efforts, though most
analysts say political leaders are easily distracted by
self-interest. ``You can say this is the kind of nice Islamic
country that America likes _ doesn't host terrorists, doesn't force
women to wear veils _ but the political parties are corrupt Tammany
Hall patronage machines,'' a Western diplomat said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The purpose of the parties is to make sure their businessmen
get the contracts and the loans _ and to make life impossible for
the political opposition.''
</P>
<P>
   The Awami League and the Bangladesh Nationalist Party have
little in the way of policy disagreements, yet they steadfastly
attack each other with profanity, street violence, general strikes
and boycotts of Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   ``This country is accomplishing many things, and the future has
such promise, but this is despite the politicians and not because
of them,'' said Muhammad Yunus, the managing director of the
Grameen Bank. ``Our politicians are stuck with their own history
and are always settling scores.''
</P>
<P>
   The leader of the Awami League is the current prime minister,
Sheik Hasina, daughter of the nation's first elected leader, Sheik
Mujibur Rahman. He was gunned down in his home by a handful of
renegade army officers in 1975 along with his wife, brother, three
sons, two daughters-in-law, a grandson and several other close
relatives.
</P>
<P>
   The leader of the Nationalists is Khaleda Zia, the widow of Gen.
Ziaur Rahman, a military dictator who praised and rewarded the
confessed killers of Hasina's father. The dictator was assassinated
by army officers in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   After 16 years of military rule, democracy returned to
Bangladesh in 1991. The Nationalists won that year's election, but
Khaleda Zia's ability to govern was limited when the Awami League
took to the streets in a prolonged campaign of agitation.
</P>
<P>
   Hasina became prime minister in 1996 and now faces the same
tactics. The Nationalists and several smaller parties are
boycotting Parliament. General strikes are enforced by thugs who
pull people from their autos as they try to get to work.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the politics of tit-for-tat, the country be damned,''
said Mahfuz Anam, editor of the English-language newspaper, the
Daily Star.
</P>
<P>
   Zia, 54, takes issue with such remarks, refusing to share any
blame for the country's troubled governance. She is not a taciturn
woman. Asked about the state of democracy in Bangladesh, she
replied with a 67-minute filibuster against her opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Later, she admitted to hating Hasina, but stressed that this
deep loathing was nothing personal. She disagreed with those who
suggest that the welfare of the impoverished nation suffers because
of a private feud.
</P>
<P>
   ``My differences with Hasina are all political,'' she said,
sitting before a huge portrait of her late husband. But then she
thought a while longer, and anger rose in her throat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went to her daughter's wedding when I was prime minister,
and I was not properly received,'' she said bitterly, waving her
index finger. ``She did not even come and sit with me.''
</P>
<P>
   Hasina, 53, likewise disclaimed the notion of a private grudge.
``Why should I hate her?'' she said, sitting in an office decorated
with paintings of her father. Her government has successfully
prosecuted many of her father's killers. She has renamed an
extraordinary number of public structures in her family's memory.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no personal clash or enmity with Khaleda,'' the prime
minister repeated, sloughing aside the very suggestion. ``I am the
daughter of the father of the nation. Who can match that? When my
father was head of the country, her husband was just a major.''

PROTESTS INTENSIFY AS BELGRADE SILENCES ANOTHER TV STATION
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   PODGORICA, Yugoslavia _ Thousands of people took to the streets
in Serbia over the weekend to protest the continued crackdown by
Yugoslav authorities on local television stations, and another
station was taken off the air.
</P>
<P>
   At least 5,000 people marched in the town of Kraljevo in central
Serbia on Saturday and Sunday after the government dismantled the
television station's transmitter outside the town, cutting off
800,000 viewers from the programs of locally run Radio Television
Kraljevo.
</P>
<P>
   Several hundred protesters also gathered in the town of Pirot
Sunday night, for the fourth night, after the government closed the
local television station earlier in the week. Hundreds of
demonstrators have turned out recently in at least two other towns
as well, local media reports said.
</P>
<P>
   RTV Kraljevo was the seventh local television station to be
taken off the air in the last two weeks in Serbia. Independent
journalists and opposition politicians say it is an attempt by
authorities to try to stifle independent news with local elections
coming up, and they vowed to fight the closings and to find ways to
keep broadcasting.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is important to find other means to continue
broadcasting,'' said Veran Matic, leader of the Association of
Independent Electronic Media and chief editor of radio station
B2-92, based in Belgrade, the Yugoslav capital. ``It is vital not
to give in, but to fight.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that, ``It is hard work, and even dangerous, but it is
surprising how resilient and persistent the Serbian media has
been.''
</P>
<P>
   His own radio station has been the frequent object of government
attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Matic said the latest crackdown on the news media appeared to
follow a pattern of government pressure in recent years as it felt
increasingly vulnerable to internal instability. In 1997, 78 news
media organizations were closed in a sweeping crackdown. Last year,
during the NATO bombing campaign against Yugoslavia, 15
organizations were banned, although all of those are back up and
running.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition to the government of the Yugoslav president,
Slobodan Milosevic, controls about 20 municipal authorities in
Serbia and so has control of local television and radio stations.
As the government gears up to fight for power in municipal
elections this year, it appears to be trying to remove sources of
local criticism.
</P>
<P>
   The moves to close the stations have often taken place virtually
in secret, with government officials and technicians dismantling
and removing transmitters and equipment at night without warning,
as they did in Kraljevo.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials have justified the closings, nevertheless,
saying that the television stations do not have necessary licenses
to broadcast, or that they owe dues to the government. Broadcasters
answer that they apply for licenses, but that the government rarely
responds.

LAKERS CONTINUE TO MEET CHALLENGES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Before tipoff Sunday, Los Angeles Lakers coach Phil
Jackson was musing about just aiming for a split of a tough
two-game set against the New York Knicks and Miami Heat.
</P>
<P>
   And after taking down the Knicks? ``Well, you get one, you might
as well get two. It would be nice,'' Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   For the Lakers, it would also be a simple matter of continuing a
couple of remarkable trends: They also are 24-3 against the Eastern
Conference, 12-2 on the road. Even more impressive, the Lakers are
18-1 this season on the second night of back-to-back sets, with 12
victories in a row on the second night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully it's not a jinx,'' Derek Fisher said. ``But I think
for our basketball team, the more we have to think about, whether
we're tired or whether we're fatigued physically, I think it
sharpens us up mentally. We don't take as many chances, we're a
little smarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like in Friday's game against Detroit, we played better than
we did against Washington, even though it was a loss, because I
think mentally we think about - OK, we got in late, this is the
second night of a back-to-back, so Kobe (Bryant)'s not jumping as
high, Shaq (O'Neal)'s not jumping as high, but we have to think a
little more and be a little smarter. And we end up playing
better.''
</P>
<P>
   This could be the toughest back-to-back of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``The challenges keep coming,'' Fisher said, ``and we've
accepted them and taken them head-on so far. Hopefully we can do
that again (tonight).''
</P>
<P>
   And as for that two-game split Jackson mentioned? ``Phil's
always underestimating us,'' Bryant said. ``He always does that.
Every time he does that, we prove him wrong, he just laughs.''
</P>
<P>
   Defensive: After two games of struggling through foul trouble,
Bryant was able to hold down Latrell Sprewell and pick up only two
fouls in the process. Bryant says Seattle's Gary Payton has
provided the best advice: stay aggressive, and the officials will
back off.
</P>
<P>
   ``There might be some truth,'' said Jackson, ``that there's a
level of acceptance, what's tolerated or not tolerated of how
people play individual defense. Kobe's yet to reach that area where
he gets the liberty. But he's learning, and the big thing is he's
learning not to have that `you-screwed-up' kind of (expression) on
his face, which gets the referees back in an irritated point. He's
able to accept it and move on and understand it. I think that's
growth for him.''

 &HT;    'Other' Burton gets win
 &HT;    By Michael Carvell
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DARLINGTON, S.C. _ Ward Burton finally escaped the shadows of
his younger brother in the NASCAR Winston Cup Series on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Burton took the checkered flag in the Mall.com 400 to snap Jeff
Burton's two-race winning streak at Darlington Raceway. Dale
Jarrett finished second, followed by Cracker Barrel 500 winner Dale
Earnhardt in third.
</P>
<P>
   For Ward Burton, 38, it was the second Winston Cup victory in
his seven seasons on the circuit. The first was in October 1995 at
Rockingham.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's easy to get down on yourself,'' he said. ``But we tried
not to pay attention to the (winless streak) and just be
consistent. If we kept being consistent, it would happen. This time
it did.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Burton, 32, drove to victory six times last year, including
a sweep of the Darlington events. Ironically, Ward Burton was a
runner-up in a trio of races last season _ all in which his sibling
turned out to be the winner.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was long for us, but great for Ward ... it has been a long
time coming,'' said Jeff Burton, who finished fifth on Sunday.
``When two family members can win a race in the Winston Cup Series,
that means a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Ward Burton was congratulated in the garage area by his brother,
who won at Las Vegas two weeks ago. The winner admitted feelings of
relief about finally beating his younger brother to the checkered
flag.
</P>
<P>
   ``It feels darn good,'' Ward Burton said. ``But more so, it
feels good to beat the other guys. Jeff (has) one of the cars we
have to beat each and every week, and we know that going to the
track. But we (also) beat Bobby Labonte, Dale Jarrett and Mark
Martin _ some of the best in the business at this track.''
</P>
<P>
   Tommy Baldwin Jr., crew chief of the winning No. 22 Pontiac, was
Ray Evernham's hand-picked choice to be his successor as crew chief
for Jeff Gordon last year. Baldwin turned it down because he felt
there was plenty of long-range potential with Burton at Bill Davis
Racing.
</P>
<P>
   On the final pit-stop sequence, Baldwin made a gutsy call that
widened the gap between Burton and Jarrett. Baldwin instructed his
driver to pit on lap 252, but Jarrett surprisingly chose not to
follow the leader into pit road.
</P>
<P>
   Jarrett motored in on the next lap, but Burton had already
gained precious seconds on the 1999 Winston Cup champion. Burton
was never threatened again over the final 40 laps.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew he was going in ...because he threw up his hand,''
Jarrett said. ``(But) I had already committed. I started to follow
him in, but I thought that usually if you're following somebody in,
you get slowed down too much. I thought by going one more lap I
might be able (to) make up some time.''

POWERFUL ISRAELI RABBI STEPS UP ATTACKS OVER PAROCHIAL SCHOOLS 
</HEADLINE>
  (jw) 
 By DEBORAH SONTAG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ When Rabbi Ovadia Yosef talks, a good chunk of
Israel listens, watching satellite broadcasts of his commanding
weekly sermons on screens set up throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday night, Yosef, who is the spiritual leader of the
powerful political party Shas, issued a blistering,
hellfire-and-brimstone attack on the leftist education minister,
Yossi Sarid. From a synagogue in Jerusalem's Bukharan Quarter,
Yosef called him Satan, said he should be ``extirpated from the
earth,'' and asked God to obliterate his name.
</P>
<P>
   Yosef compared Sarid to Haman, the ancient enemy of the Jews
whose defeat is celebrated in this week's Purim holiday. He led
congregants in a chant of: ``Accursed is Haman. Accursed is
Sarid.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Just as he showed us in killing Haman and the vengeance done
to Haman, so will vengeance be done to Sarid,'' the rabbi said.
</P>
<P>
   After excerpts were broadcast on radio and television Sunday,
many Israelis were stunned _ and chilled _ by the vehemence of the
attack by a spiritual leader whose words carry so much power.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Elyakim Rubenstein is likely to ask police to
start a criminal investigation of Yosef, possibly on charges of
incitement, of insulting a public servant, or of making threats,
according to radio and television reports.
</P>
<P>
   Yosef is usually considered untouchable because he holds such a
substantial part of the Israeli religious population in his sway.
As the spiritual leader of Shas, he is a leader of the traditional
and ultra-Orthodox population of Middle Eastern descent, many of
them poor and working class.
</P>
<P>
   Shas and Sarid have been warring since Prime Minister Ehud Barak
got them to sit together in his broad-based and increasingly
unstable coalition. Shas leaders think that Sarid is unfairly
attacking the parochial school system that is their political base
because, they say, of his disdain for religion.
</P>
<P>
   Shas officials said that Yosef was particularly angered last
week when he learned that Sarid was pressing for the closing of
three more schools. Thirty-five have already been shut and 48 are
supposed to be closed under a reorganization of the indebted school
system that is part of an agreement between the party and the
Education Ministry.
</P>
<P>
   Barak, who believes that Shas is a key ally in his peacemaking
efforts, released a carefully worded statement of ``regret over the
severe remarks,'' especially as made by ``a spiritual leader whom
hundreds of thousands of people listen to attentively.''
</P>
<P>
   For many here, the words brought back uncomfortable memories of
the harsh words aimed at Yitzhak Rabin, the prime minister
assassinated in 1995, by religious leaders. Many here believe that
escalating verbal violence incited real violence, and that Rabin's
murderer, a Jewish extremist, was affected by that climate.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Just two years ago, the NBA was a very hot sports attraction on
network television, the ratings for its playoff finals at times
eclipsing those for baseball's World Series.
</P>
<P>
   But that was the last season for Michael Jordan, the
transcendent sports star of the 1990s, and two years after his last
game the NBA has seen its popularity on network television plummet,
to the despair of its network partner, NBC.
</P>
<P>
   After spending $1.75 billion on rights for four NBA seasons
starting last season _ more than double the previous amount _ NBC
is now suffering through a terrible NBA year, particularly in prime
time, with audiences down by 20 percent. That has been enough to
send NBC's weekly prime-time ratings into a tailspin. One week ago,
on a Sunday night, NBC recorded the lowest rating for any night in
a television season in the network's history.
</P>
<P>
   Now both the league and the network are talking about sharply
cutting back the number of prime-time games next season.
</P>
<P>
   What happened?
</P>
<P>
   Jordan's exit from the court is generally the main reason cited.
But NBA and NBC executives and advertisers mentioned an array of
factors, including the overexposure of NBA games on cable and local
stations; the emergence of Tiger Woods as the sports star most like
Jordan in appealing to casual sports fans, and, more fundamentally,
the growing tendency of young players to curtail, or even forego, a
career in college basketball.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed the quick movement of college players _ making it
difficult to build widely popular stars for a national audience _
is a marketing problem being blamed for what seems to be the
decline in interest. The regular-season ratings for college
basketball on CBS, the network most associated with the collegiate
sport, hit an all-time low this season, 1.9 (about 2 million
homes), although the NCAA tournament, now in progress, has been
generating ratings about on par with last season.
</P>
<P>
   But with the college game not able to establish stars through
four years of steady television appearances, both levels of the
sport have been affected, said David Stern, the NBA commissioner.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question at all that this is a factor,'' he said.
``There's a building process to exposure for these star players.''
</P>
<P>
   For years the NBA thrived on the regular arrival of pre-marketed
players, said Dick Ebersol, the president of NBC Sports. Jordan,
Magic Johnson and Larry Bird all catapulted to stardom in exciting
final games in the heavily viewed NCAA tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Now, in Jordan's wake, the NBA is increasingly faced with the
task of marketing new stars, many of whom either attended only a
year or two of college, like Allen Iverson of the Philadelphia
76ers and Vince Carter of the Toronto Raptors, or did not go to
college at all, like Kobe Bryant of the Los Angeles Lakers and
Kevin Garnett of the Minnesota Timberwolves.
</P>
<P>
   Both Stern and Ebersol repeatedly called the current season a
``transition year,'' meant to build up the host of new NBA stars
they believe are about to emerge from under Jordan's long shadow.
But the declaration reflects at least as much a hope as a
prediction. Stern said the league recognized that ``We have to get
people exposed to this next generation of stars.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our strong preference would be to have a Tim Duncan and a
Grant Hill come into our league after four years in college,''
Stern said, citing two stars who finished their four years of
eligibility in college. ``But that isn't going to be the case as a
matter of law.'' Young players have established through legal
precedent that they have the right to seek a pro career without
regard to their college status.
</P>
<P>
   The NBA has not even approached the popularity of the collegiate
tournament for its feature games on NBC Sunday nights this season.
The games hit a low a week ago when a total of only about 4.5
million people tuned in from 7 to 9 p.m. on Sunday March 12 to see
games between the Knicks and San Antonio, the teams that squared
off in last year's playoff finals, and _ in other parts of the
country _ Seattle against Toronto, the latter featuring Carter, who
has become the league's latest hope to replace Jordan as a
high-flying scoring talent.
</P>
<P>
   For the season, NBC is averaging only about 5.9 million fans for
its regular season prime-time games, down from 7.4 million last
season. The contrast that may be most jarring to the league is what
is happening to viewing for wrestling, which, on the UPN network,
is averaging more than 7 million viewers in prime time this season.
Even on cable, on the USA Network, wrestling is averaging about 7
million viewers every Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   But Stern said it was not fair to use wrestling as a comparison.
``It's just an entertainment phenomenon,'' he said. ``It's like
`Dawson's Creek' or ``Buffy the Vampire Slayer.'''
</P>
<P>
   The ratings falloff has serious economic implications for NBC
because the audiences are clearly not approaching the expectations
of its advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   Normally advertisers buy time on network programs with a
guarantee of certain audience figures. NBC does not give a formal
guarantee to its NBA advertisers, but there is an understanding
that if the network falls short of expectations it will offer what
are known as ``make good'' advertisements _ free commercials.
</P>
<P>
   Ebersol expressed confidence that enough time can be found in
the normal breaks of games to accommodate the make goods. But
whatever ad time the network gives away free is at least a missed
opportunity. The advertising marketplace is so strong right now
that NBC could sell that time at high prices to new advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Igiel, president of broadcast for Media Edge, a division of
the Young &AMP; Rubicam advertising agency, among several other
executives, pointed to the sheer number of NBA games that an
average television viewer can see every week as one reason the
weekend games have little special appeal. Turner Broadcasting's
cable channels have as many as four games a week, and local
channels like MSG in New York carry a home team's other games.
``There are so many games and so many teams,'' Igiel said. ``The
NBA is all over the place.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The sheer number of teams also means that the star players do
not play as often in every city. The most widely cited geographical
problem facing the league involves the newly designated heir to
Jordan, Vince Carter. NBC has been realigning its schedule to
include his games. He paid off that endorsement by scoring 51
points in his first nationally televised game.
</P>
<P>
   Still, his next game was included in the pair that set a new low
for NBC in prime time (even though he scored 34 points in that
one.) One problem cited is the team Carter plays for, the Toronto
Raptors, a team many casual sports fans probably still do not know
is in the NBA. It is also in a city whose local ratings do not even
count. Canadian cities do not factor in U.S. ratings.
</P>
<P>
   ``David Stern needs to make some move to get Carter to Chicago
or New York,'' said Donnie Deutsch, chairman of Deutsch Inc., which
represents such clients as Foot Locker. ``The rest of the league
needs him in a big media market.''
</P>
<P>
   Stern scoffed at that suggestion, saying a city's size is no
impediment to a star emerging. ``A few years ago, Orlando became a
huge team for us,'' he said. ``I just don't buy for a minute that
Vince Carter has to be in a major market.''
</P>
<P>
   What the league needs, both he and Ebersol argued, is simply
more time to get fans entranced with talents like Carter and
Bryant.
</P>
<P>
   Ebersol argued that in a world where every sport now competes
not only with other sports but also with the Internet and endless
other diversions, ``it is more important than ever to have stars.''
He compared it to a production job from early in his career, NBC's
``Saturday Night Live,'' which has risen and waned on the strength
of the stars in its cast. But television, in general, is producing
few big stars, because of the fragmentation of the audience.
</P>
<P>
   From a practical point of view, Ebersol said, the 17 games NBC
has in prime time this year are simply too many. But that is partly
a result of the huge 133 percent increase NBC paid for the rights
two years ago. It was forced to put on more games to try to
generate additional advertising revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Stern said that with all the games that are being aired, the NBA
``is actually being seen by more eyeballs.'' But he said, ``Every
time we do a new television deal we take a look at it. It may be an
interesting time now to take a look at this one.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that in the long term, the NBA will maintain its value
because in a world of so many options for consumers, big sports
events will still be must-see choices that audiences will plan
ahead for. ``We are live, so we are among the last appointment
viewing on television.''
</P>
<P>
   But for the short term, NBC has few answers for its problems
Sunday nights. As one longtime NBC executive put it, ``Right now,
Sunday night is a train wreck.''

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Just two years ago, the NBA was a very hot sports attraction on
network television, the ratings for its playoff finals at times
eclipsing those for baseball's World Series.
</P>
<P>
   But that was the last season for Michael Jordan, the
transcendent sports star of the 1990s, and two years after his last
game the NBA has seen its popularity on network television plummet,
to the despair of its network partner, NBC.
</P>
<P>
   After spending $1.75 billion on rights for four NBA seasons
starting last season _ more than double the previous amount _ NBC
is now suffering through a terrible NBA year, particularly in prime
time, with audiences down by 20 percent. That has been enough to
send NBC's weekly prime-time ratings into a tailspin. One week ago,
on a Sunday night, NBC recorded the lowest rating for any night in
a television season in the network's history.
</P>
<P>
   Now both the league and the network are talking about sharply
cutting back the number of prime-time games next season.
</P>
<P>
   What happened?
</P>
<P>
   Jordan's exit from the court is generally the main reason cited.
But NBA and NBC executives and advertisers mentioned an array of
factors, including the overexposure of NBA games on cable and local
stations; the emergence of Tiger Woods as the sports star most like
Jordan in appealing to casual sports fans, and, more fundamentally,
the growing tendency of young players to curtail, or even forego, a
career in college basketball.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed the quick movement of college players _ making it
difficult to build widely popular stars for a national audience _
is a marketing problem being blamed for what seems to be the
decline in interest. The regular-season ratings for college
basketball on CBS, the network most associated with the collegiate
sport, hit an all-time low this season, 1.9 (about 2 million
homes), although the NCAA tournament, now in progress, has been
generating ratings about on par with last season.
</P>
<P>
   But with the college game not able to establish stars through
four years of steady television appearances, both levels of the
sport have been affected, said David Stern, the NBA commissioner.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question at all that this is a factor,'' he said.
``There's a building process to exposure for these star players.''
</P>
<P>
   For years the NBA thrived on the regular arrival of pre-marketed
players, said Dick Ebersol, the president of NBC Sports. Jordan,
Magic Johnson and Larry Bird all catapulted to stardom in exciting
final games in the heavily viewed NCAA tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Now, in Jordan's wake, the NBA is increasingly faced with the
task of marketing new stars, many of whom either attended only a
year or two of college, like Allen Iverson of the Philadelphia
76ers and Vince Carter of the Toronto Raptors, or did not go to
college at all, like Kobe Bryant of the Los Angeles Lakers and
Kevin Garnett of the Minnesota Timberwolves.
</P>
<P>
   Both Stern and Ebersol repeatedly called the current season a
``transition year,'' meant to build up the host of new NBA stars
they believe are about to emerge from under Jordan's long shadow.
But the declaration reflects at least as much a hope as a
prediction. Stern said the league recognized that ``We have to get
people exposed to this next generation of stars.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our strong preference would be to have a Tim Duncan and a
Grant Hill come into our league after four years in college,''
Stern said, citing two stars who finished their four years of
eligibility in college. ``But that isn't going to be the case as a
matter of law.'' Young players have established through legal
precedent that they have the right to seek a pro career without
regard to their college status.
</P>
<P>
   The NBA has not even approached the popularity of the collegiate
tournament for its feature games on NBC Sunday nights this season.
The games hit a low a week ago when a total of only about 4.5
million people tuned in from 7 to 9 p.m. on Sunday March 12 to see
games between the Knicks and San Antonio, the teams that squared
off in last year's playoff finals, and _ in other parts of the
country _ Seattle against Toronto, the latter featuring Carter, who
has become the league's latest hope to replace Jordan as a
high-flying scoring talent.
</P>
<P>
   For the season, NBC is averaging only about 5.9 million fans for
its regular season prime-time games, down from 7.4 million last
season. The contrast that may be most jarring to the league is what
is happening to viewing for wrestling, which, on the UPN network,
is averaging more than 7 million viewers in prime time this season.
Even on cable, on the USA Network, wrestling is averaging about 7
million viewers every Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   But Stern said it was not fair to use wrestling as a comparison.
``It's just an entertainment phenomenon,'' he said. ``It's like
`Dawson's Creek' or ``Buffy the Vampire Slayer.'''
</P>
<P>
   The ratings falloff has serious economic implications for NBC
because the audiences are clearly not approaching the expectations
of its advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   Normally advertisers buy time on network programs with a
guarantee of certain audience figures. NBC does not give a formal
guarantee to its NBA advertisers, but there is an understanding
that if the network falls short of expectations it will offer what
are known as ``make good'' advertisements _ free commercials.
</P>
<P>
   Ebersol expressed confidence that enough time can be found in
the normal breaks of games to accommodate the make goods. But
whatever ad time the network gives away free is at least a missed
opportunity. The advertising marketplace is so strong right now
that NBC could sell that time at high prices to new advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Igiel, president of broadcast for Media Edge, a division of
the Young &AMP; Rubicam advertising agency, among several other
executives, pointed to the sheer number of NBA games that an
average television viewer can see every week as one reason the
weekend games have little special appeal. Turner Broadcasting's
cable channels have as many as four games a week, and local
channels like MSG in New York carry a home team's other games.
``There are so many games and so many teams,'' Igiel said. ``The
NBA is all over the place.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The sheer number of teams also means that the star players do
not play as often in every city. The most widely cited geographical
problem facing the league involves the newly designated heir to
Jordan, Vince Carter. NBC has been realigning its schedule to
include his games. He paid off that endorsement by scoring 51
points in his first nationally televised game.
</P>
<P>
   Still, his next game was included in the pair that set a new low
for NBC in prime time (even though he scored 34 points in that
one.) One problem cited is the team Carter plays for, the Toronto
Raptors, a team many casual sports fans probably still do not know
is in the NBA. It is also in a city whose local ratings do not even
count. Canadian cities do not factor in U.S. ratings.
</P>
<P>
   ``David Stern needs to make some move to get Carter to Chicago
or New York,'' said Donnie Deutsch, chairman of Deutsch Inc., which
represents such clients as Foot Locker. ``The rest of the league
needs him in a big media market.''
</P>
<P>
   Stern scoffed at that suggestion, saying a city's size is no
impediment to a star emerging. ``A few years ago, Orlando became a
huge team for us,'' he said. ``I just don't buy for a minute that
Vince Carter has to be in a major market.''
</P>
<P>
   What the league needs, both he and Ebersol argued, is simply
more time to get fans entranced with talents like Carter and
Bryant.
</P>
<P>
   Ebersol argued that in a world where every sport now competes
not only with other sports but also with the Internet and endless
other diversions, ``it is more important than ever to have stars.''
He compared it to a production job from early in his career, NBC's
``Saturday Night Live,'' which has risen and waned on the strength

SPORTS COLUMN: TY SHINE'S GAME EXCEEDS HIS DREAM 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By GEORGE VECSEY    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUFFALO, N.Y. _ Caught between the past and the future, Ty Shine
will always have Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   He will always have the game in which he came off the bench
shooting because ``that's who I am, I'm a firing kind of player.''
</P>
<P>
   For two years he has been the backup at Seton Hall, starting
mainly when Shaheen Holloway was injured. Next year the school is
bringing in Andre Barrett from Rice High in New York, perhaps the
top point-guard prospect in the country.
</P>
<P>
   In these post-Marbury-Iverson days, point guards do not enroll
in college for the luxury of being apprentices. There were even
rumors that Shine had mused about transferring, something he denied
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't think too much about that,'' Shine said. ``Coach is
trying to build something here. You need kids like that.''
</P>
<P>
   He was being the good soldier in a moment when he could have
gloated or bargained or whined. Perhaps he is destined to always be
an interim point guard, but Sunday Ty Shine produced one of the
epic victories of the new Tommy Amaker regime, or any other epoch
at the New Jersey school.
</P>
<P>
   In the time it took for Holloway to fall awkwardly and sprain
his left ankle eight minutes into the game, Ty Shine went from
backup to the only recourse. He pumped in 26 points in 37 minutes,
including the consummate 3-pointer that put Seton Hall ahead to
stay in a 67-65 overtime victory over Temple in the second round of
the national tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say that good things come to people who wait,'' he said.
``Today is a perfect example.''
</P>
<P>
   Shine said he kept his spirits up through constant telephone
contact with his grandmother, Julia Shine, and his mother, Barbara
Shine, back home in Augusta, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   ``My grandmother tells me to be patient,'' he said Sunday.
``She's old. She knows a lot. People say I'm a mama's boy because I
call my mother every day, sometimes two or three times at night,
when she comes home from work. Telephone cards. Lots of telephone
cards.''
</P>
<P>
   In a gloomy winter of a fatal dormitory fire on the campus in
South Orange, N.J., Shine tried to stay positive. He had played 521
minutes in 30 games, had a decent 7.1 scoring average, but he had
never started.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough,'' Shine admitted. ``I wait my turn. I had to deal
with it.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he is grateful because there were players at the local
park in Augusta ``who never got their chance for whatever reason.''
Instead, he played a senior season in Cincinnati, put in another
year in prep school and came to Seton Hall because ``I wanted to go
to a school that was down, that was trying to get back to where it
used to be.''
</P>
<P>
   He started eight times last season, a bit longer than Holloway
might have liked, but eventually Holloway was back handling the
ball, and Shine was spending more than half the game on the bench.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's an outstanding player,'' said Amaker, the suave Dukie who
seems a trifle out of place in his current ex-urban New Jersey
milieu.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody who has seen him knows that,'' Amaker said about
Shine. ``They go against each other in practice, and competition
makes people better.''
</P>
<P>
   In his state of magnanimity, Shine agreed with that Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We talk trash,'' Shine said. ``I have confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, Shine was on the bench when Holloway was carried toward
the locker room.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was getting ready to come in,'' Shine said. ``I'm used to
it. I gave a boost last year and I tried to give a lift today. We
were kind of down, and firing was the best thing I could do.''
</P>
<P>
   He made his first three shots from 3-point range, and brought
Seton Hall back into the game. Then, when the adrenaline might have
been expected to wear off, he kept firing. He started to look a
little rubbery in overtime, but when Greg Morton set a perfect pick
he popped in a 3-pointer that put Seton Hall ahead, 66-65. And when
it was over, Shine did not have much reserve.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was crying when I went over to talk on television,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a big Kenny Anderson fan when I was a kid,'' he said,
referring to the pro star who passed through Georgia Tech in a
hurry. ``I couldn't picture myself in these kinds of games. I've
never had a game like this.''
</P>
<P>
   His raw delight was in contrast to Holloway's sense of
entitlement when he ran from coast to coast for the winning drive
against Oregon Friday afternoon. Holloway has reason to think he
should be performing derring-do every game. Shine just wanted more
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   With Holloway leaving here in a wheelchair, his playing career
at Seton Hall may be over. Next season the rookie will arrive with
high expectations. Ty Shine had no way of telling what will happen
this week in Syracuse, or next season, but he will always have
Buffalo, and the day he came out firing.  &QL;

SPORTS COLUMN: THE LAKER SHOW AND ITS SURREAL IMAGERY 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By MIKE WISE    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ John Salley lent his wit and wile to one of Phil
Jackson's championship Chicago teams four years ago. The veteran
center was around for the basketball, but Salley most remembers the
spectacle, the feeling that wherever Michael and the Bulls went,
the world stopped and pointed its Nikon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just from a circus-atmosphere standpoint, you can already see
that with these guys,'' he said Sunday as Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe
Bryant laced up their hightops in a room adjacent to the visitor's
locker room at Madison Square Garden. ``In one sense, we're the
Lakers. In another sense, we're the show.''
</P>
<P>
   Salley spoke several minutes before he went out to be
interviewed by Roshumba, the model who works for VH1.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care if Phil plays me one minute,'' Salley said with
his arm around Roshumba and a big smile on his face. ``The coach
can bench me, send me home, cut me. It doesn't matter. I'm a happy
man right now.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Laker Show indeed came to the Garden Sunday, its eclectic
media and fan base trailing a few steps behind, taking in the most
surreal atmosphere surrounding an NBA game in New York this season.
</P>
<P>
   Snoop Doggy Dog in purple and gold. Willie Nelson and Penny
Marshall courtside. Rap, country or Laverne, the Lakers somehow
appease everyone across the kitsch landscape.
</P>
<P>
   In related news, poor-shooting Patrick Ewing and the Knicks fell
to a Western Conference juggernaut, 92-85. But Sunday had less to
do with hoops than it did with the arrival of America's post-Jordan
team, Shaq and the popular collection of entertainers increasingly
followed around the country as if they were rock stars, Jordan, or
both.
</P>
<P>
   There was basketball at the Garden. O'Neal pulverized the
Knicks. He left the backboard support shaking for nearly 20 seconds
after he threw down an alley-oop pass from Brian Shaw with less
than a minute left.
</P>
<P>
   Forty-three points. Ten rebounds. Two pretty assists to Bryant
along the baseline for reverse layups, over-the-shoulder flips like
Kareem used to throw to Magic when he was double-teamed.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant's play was erratic and uneven, but at times he was as
frighteningly good as O'Neal. He treated the Knicks like traffic
cones at the end of the third quarter, zigzagging through the lane
until he hit a hanging layup from the right side at the buzzer _ a
demoralizing shot that pushed LA's lead to 11.
</P>
<P>
   It became clear why O'Neal recently began calling himself and
Bryant, ``The Combo.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I jab them and he drops them,'' Bryant said. ``It's a nice
little nickname he came up with on the back of the bus. I like it.
It fits.''
</P>
<P>
   You look at the Lakers and then you look around the NBA, and
it's almost unfair. Glen Rice, a player who could average 25 points
for half the league's teams, took only 10 shots and made three.
Derek Fisher could start at point guard in more than 20 NBA cities.
Rick Fox and Robert Horry, two of the game's better role players,
also come off the bench.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes when they find their rhythm, Shaq, Kobe and friends
remind you of the crew that shows up late to the YMCA, determined
not to wait for another game. They erase your five from the sign-up
sheet and replace it with talent so superior, you end up playing
with a bunch of dentists in dingy headbands, watching a playground
dream team hold court all afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant even acknowledged that invincible feeling, that on some
nights no one can stay with the Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The game becomes very easy, very simple _ especially when
we're hitting our shots and we know that we're on,'' he said.
``Once we get a rhythm, you can kind of see them adjust to it.
That's when you know you've got them on a string. You can play them
all game long.''
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks tried their hand as antagonists, but weren't very
successful. Before the game, Jeff Van Gundy was asked about
Jackson's penchant for giving players on his teams books as
personalized gifts.
</P>
<P>
   He took a few less-than-subtle shots at Jackson, the all-knowing
one, whom Dave Checketts met with last season when the Knicks
appeared lottery-bound.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he had ever given a player a book, Van Gundy said: ``I
may have, but I haven't publicized it. To get to this level, every
coach is intelligent. Some choose not to let you know about it.''
</P>
<P>
   He later added: ``Like with Phil, he got his start with the best
player in Chicago. He went from maverick to genius. If you start
with the Clippers or something like that, suddenly it's `You can't
coach.'''
</P>
<P>
   Their running feud is amusing, but you wonder if it's not time
for Van Gundy to devote less time to his outward disdain for
Jackson. He's got other pressing concerns to worry about, like how
the Knicks became a warm-up act for Shaq.
</P>
<P>
   In a way, nothing changes. Nearly two years after he stepped
away from the game, Jackson comes to the Garden with the best team
and the best player in the NBA. And wins. Van Gundy and the Knicks
are vanquished. Again.
</P>
<P>
   And John Salley, smiling with his arm around Roshumba, is still
enjoying the spectacle. &QL;

J. RUSSELL KING, TIMES EDITOR, DIES AT 45 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Okla., Fla., N.Y., Pa., Mo.)  (jw) 
 By ROBERT D. McFADDEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ J. Russell King, a deputy news editor of The New York
Times who sharpened the prose of reporters, the precision of
headlines and the meaning of news for readers with a learned,
subtle and anonymous hand, died on Saturday night at St.
Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center. He was 45 and lived in Manhattan
and Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was AIDS-related pneumonia, his family said.
</P>
<P>
   A lanky, wry, restless Oklahoma redhead called Rusty, a graduate
of Haverford College who tried law school and taught high school
for a year before becoming a journalist, King worked briefly at The
Wichita Eagle and The Miami Herald before joining The Times in 1982
as a copy editor.
</P>
<P>
   But his talents for language, broad knowledge of politics and
world and national affairs, and other journalistic skills soon
carried him onto the news desk, a small team of editors who oversee
the preparation of the newspaper's front page and serve as a final
quality checkpoint between the newsroom departments and the reader.
</P>
<P>
   For the last decade, King and his group, working behind the
scenes, helped backstop the work of reporters and editors by
refining the content and style of the day's major articles and
headlines. His mission was to detect and correct inaccuracies,
redundancies, slips in fairness and imprecise, inelegant or
offensive language.
</P>
<P>
   One example of his measured editorial judgment was his memo from
1992 on whether offensive names for minority groups should be
printed. It read in part:
</P>
<P>
   ``Since the targets of prejudice were using the taboo term
themselves, where was the harm?
</P>

   ``Well, the harm is that frequent use of offensive words, no
matter who is saying the words or where, cannot help suggesting
that the offense is slight. Every time we print such a word,
particularly in a lighthearted or humorous context, we risk letting
people think that it is acceptable to use it ourselves. And of
course we are further concerned with littering the paper with what
amounts to obscenity _ it simply lowers the tone of The Times.''
</P>
<P>
   Often, especially on weekends, it was King who laid out Page 1
in consultation with the paper's top editors.

<P>
   James Russell King was born in Tulsa, Okla., on Nov. 3, 1954. He
grew up in Ardmore, Okla., and was valedictorian of his high school
class in 1972. He earned a bachelor's degree in American studies
from Haverford College in Pennsylvania in 1976 and spent the next
few years in search of a profession.
</P>
<P>
   He taught writing for a year at Ardmore High, attended Columbia
University Law School for a year, and, from 1978 to 1980, studied
at the University of Missouri School of Journalism while working as
a faculty instructor and as an editor and reporter for The Columbia
Missourian.
</P>
<P>
   After a summer with The Wichita Eagle in Kansas and two years
with The Miami Herald, King joined The Times in 1982 as a copy
editor on the national desk. Seven years later, he moved to the
news desk as an assistant editor. He was named a deputy news editor
in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   He was an active member of the National Lesbian and Gay
Journalists Association, was a mentor for many new Times staff
members and _ among the small crew who worked into the early hours
_ began an annual tradition of wearing formal dress to work on New
Year's Eve.
</P>
<P>
   King is survived by his mother, Mary Ann Jones King of Ardmore,
and two sisters, Melinda Ann ``Kit'' King of Dallas and Leslie
High-Smith of San Marcos, Texas. A brother, Philip, died last
September.

ON THE ISLANDS OR MAINLAND, KAMEHAMEHA PORK IS FIT FOR A HAWAIIAN
KING

<P>
   ``Are we there yet?''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Capt. George Vancouver never uttered those exact words
while cruising the waters now known as Puget Sound. But he was not
the kind of passenger you would want sitting in the back seat on a
long trip.
</P>
<P>
   You might say Vancouver groused his way through the Northwest
waters. In the ship logs he complained about the unending forests.
He was bored by the majestic peaks.
</P>
<P>
   Where did he think he'd been sent by the British navy, to
inspect the topless wahines along Sugar Beach on the coast of Maui?
</P>
<P>
   That was the root of Vancouver's despair. He had visited the
Hawaiian Islands. And after that happy trip, Puget Sound just
didn't measure up.
</P>
<P>
   He wasn't looking for the Emerald City. George was ready to buy
a time-share condo in Kihei.
</P>
<P>
   In February 1791, Vancouver made his second visit to Hawaii and
moored off Sugar Beach, where a totem pole now marks the site of
his landing.
</P>
<P>
   Waiting on Maui was his old buddy from a previous voyage, King
Kamehameha.
</P>
<P>
   If George Vancouver was a party animal, that aspect of his
personality escaped most historians. He seemed to charge his
batteries watching Kamehameha have a good time.
</P>
<P>
   At the welcome feast, the Hawaiian king reportedly ate two large
fish, an extra large bowl of poi, a small pig and an entire baked
dog. He consumed this meal unaided, and despite the fact he was
missing most of his front teeth.
</P>
<P>
   A meal like that today _ sans pooch _ could cost a visitor from
Seattle as much as $90. So it pays to bring your teeth.
</P>
<P>
   Each winter more and more rain-streaked Puget Sounders
rediscover Maui, where topless and bottomless wahines from Akron
now cavort about eight miles south of Sugar Beach.
</P>
<P>
   Newcomers are apparently welcome at the nude beach. But out of
deference to the memory of George Vancouver, it might be nice if
you kept on your royal navy officer's hat. If you are a real sport,
you might also volunteer to organize the welcoming feast with an
entree like:
</P>
<P>
   Kamehameha Pork
</P>
<P>
   1 3-pound pork loin roast
</P>
<P>
   1 large clove garlic, cut in slivers
</P>
<P>
   Salt, pepper
</P>
<P>
   One-half teaspoon dried thyme, crumbled
</P>
<P>
   1 cup dry red wine
</P>
<P>
   5 tablespoons soft bread crumbs
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons Dijon mustard
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons chopped parsley
</P>
<P>
   With a thin-bladed kitchen knife or pirate's dirk, make several
deep insertions in the roast. Shove a slice of garlic in each.
Plunk the roast in a baking pan and rub with salt and pepper.
</P>
<P>
   Mix the thyme with the wine, pour over the roast and let it sit
for 1 to 2 hours at room temperature.
</P>
<P>
   Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Tent a sheet of aluminum foil over
the roast and shove the pan (including the marinade liquid) into
the oven. Let roast for 50 minutes. While it is cooking, mix
together the bread crumbs, mustard and chopped parsley.
</P>
<P>
   Remove roast from oven. Discard the foil. Baste with the pan
juices, adding more red wine to the pan if needed.
</P>
<P>
   Spread the mustard mixture over the top and sides of the roast
and return to oven for 40 minutes or until the thermometer reads
170 to 180 degrees. Let meat rest out of the oven a couple of
minutes, then carve into thick slices.
</P>
<P>
   Don't have a cow if the roast is pink inside. Pork is safe to
eat once it exceeds the temperature of 137 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   This roast should serve six or more along with this side dish
from a wahine named Winnifred.
</P>
<P>
   Win's Green Rice
</P>
<P>
   1 cup rice
</P>
<P>
   4 cups water
</P>
<P>
   2 cups milk
</P>
<P>
   One-third cup melted butter
</P>
<P>
   2 cups chopped American cheese
</P>
<P>
   4 beaten eggs
</P>
<P>
   1 small onion, ground or shredded
</P>
<P>
   One-quarter teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   Dash of pepper
</P>
<P>
   1 clove garlic, mashed
</P>
<P>
   One-eighth teaspoon curry powder
</P>
<P>
   2 cups minced fresh parsley
</P>
<P>
   Mix everything together in a casserole and bake in a 350-degree
oven for 1 hour. This serves four but is easily doubled or tripled.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to make the rice your main dish, it's great with
creamed shrimp spooned over the top.
</P>
<P>
   After his feast with Vancouver, Kamehameha entertained the crowd
by staging a mock battle. He rolled and tumbled to avoid weapons
thrown at him and caught the spears in his bare hands.
</P>
<P>
   After your feast on Maui's notorious beach, a game of intramural
volleyball might be in order.

CLINTON ARRIVES IN INDIA HOPING TO REPAIR RELATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  (jw) 
 By JANE PERLEZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW DELHI, India _ President Clinton, accompanied by his
daughter, Chelsea, but not by Hillary Rodham Clinton, arrived to a
low-key welcome here Sunday night for a state visit that the
administration hopes will set the foundation for a new relationship
with India.
</P>
<P>
   Before getting down to business here, however, Clinton is to pay
a one-day visit to Bangladesh, the first by an American president
to that country. Security concerns apparently led to an unusual
last-minute change in plans for the Monday itinerary.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after the president arrived here, the White House
announced that because of ``concerns raised by the Secret Service''
he would not make a planned visit to the Bangladeshi village of
Joypura.
</P>
<P>
   Officials declined to elaborate on the statement beyond saying
that for security reasons, the trip to the village 20 miles
northwest of Bangladesh's capital, Dhaka, had been canceled.
Bangladesh does not have a recent history of violent incidents.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was to have taken the presidential helicopter to the
village, spending about 90 minutes there in a primary school for
girls and meeting with women who have successfully started small
businesses with loans from the Grameen Bank. The bank, which was
founded in Bangladesh, has been seen as a world model for that type
of tiny economic development loan. Clinton will meet with some of
the women and children from the village at the American Embassy in
Dhaka.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is the first American president to visit India in 22
years. The last visit _ by President Jimmy Carter, who made some
unflattering remarks about the government before an open microphone
_ did not go so smoothly.
</P>
<P>
   This time, and with those memories faded, each side appears
determined to make a good impression.
</P>
<P>
   Chaotic and congested New Delhi was being scrubbed and scoured
Sunday, with curbs freshly whitewashed and new red gravel laid on
sidewalks. Bright lilies and dahlias were being hastily arranged at
the gates of the memorial to Mahatma Gandhi, where Clinton will pay
homage.
</P>
<P>
   On the edge of the Raj Path, the majestic boulevard that is the
fulcrum of the imperial British design of official New Delhi, a
worker on his knees tried to patch a rut with a trowel, a bit of
sand and gravel and a plastic bottle of dirty water. Not far away,
a cow pulled an ancient lawn mower as a man pushed it, trying to
cut down the lush green grass to a smooth carpet.
</P>
<P>
   In public, Clinton and the Indian leaders are set to proclaim a
friendship based on shared values of democracy and economic
interests, a case the president will probably make most
passionately in an address to the Indian parliament.
</P>
<P>
   In private, Clinton will attempt to walk the delicate line of
letting the Indians know that the United States strongly
disapproves of their nuclear weapons but without appearing to scold
his hosts, who are sensitive to what can be perceived as big
brother hectoring them.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians got a taste of what was on Clinton's mind when he
said at a nuclear nonproliferation conference in Washington last
week: ``There are those in the region who hope we will simply
accept its nuclear status quo and move on. I will not do that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has pressed India to sign the
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, and Clinton will stress this again
with Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee, Clinton aides said.
Indian officials say that the United States is hardly persuasive in
demanding that India adhere to a treaty that the U.S. Senate failed
to ratify last fall.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton will also try, his aides say, to make headway with the
Indians on Kashmir but without playing a mediating role, which the
Indians reject. The president recently called South Asia ``the most
dangerous place'' on earth, a conclusion drawn from the dispute
over Kashmir between India and Pakistan, two hostile neighbors with
nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton will urge the government to consider a dialogue with
Pakistan, and on Saturday he will give a similar message to the
military government in Pakistan during his brief stopover there. At
the moment, relations between the two countries are so sour that
there is no official dialogue and scant contact between citizens,
Clinton administration officials have said.
</P>
<P>
   Much easier for Clinton will be his acknowledgment of the Indian
high-tech industry and the contributions it has made to the
American computer world.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton will also make note of the efforts by the Indian
government to reform the economy, which has been choked by high
tariffs and state-run management. The United States sees
considerable prospects for American business in India. In the
coming years, $250 billion will be spent in India on
power-generating equipment and $100 billion on telecommunications,
said a former American ambassador to India, Frank Wisner.
</P>
<P>
   ``The visit is a terrific opportunity for the United States to
root itself in the region, to get some traction on the issues to
create a privileged position for us as we go forward,'' said
Wisner, who is now in private industry.
</P>
<P>
   In a newspaper column welcoming Clinton, Uday Bhaskar, the
deputy director of the Institute of Defense Studies and Analyses in
New Delhi, was more cautious. He wrote in the Sunday Times of India
on Sunday that India and the United States were moving ``a bit
gingerly, like two porcupines trying to be friends.''
</P>
<P>
   Expectations should not be too high, Bhaskar said. But if all
goes well, he added, ``the Clinton visit and the entourage that
accompanies him will be able to realize the potential between
natural but currently wary allies.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ A recent newspaper cartoon illustrated the anxiety
here that something will befall Pope John Paul II on his six-day
pilgrimage to the Holy Land, which begins on Tuesday. The cartoon
shows Prime Minister Ehud Barak of Israel encouraging the pope to
step out onto a bridge that extends into the Sea of Galilee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before we cross, let us pray,'' the pope says, hesitant.
</P>
<P>
   The image recalls a disaster that Israelis cannot forget _ when
a temporary bridge built for athletes in an international meet in
1997 collapsed, leaving four dead and scores injured. And last
week, when a stiff wind caused structural damage on the stage where
the pope will preside over a huge outdoor Mass, it sent a shudder
through many Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   ``The collapse of a pillar even before anyone has stepped foot
on the stage is a sign from heaven that your appeal to the Jewish
people for forgiveness may have been premature,'' Yoel Marcus wrote
to the pope in a tongue-in-cheek column on Friday in the newspaper
Haaretz.
</P>
<P>
   While the religious and political dimensions of the pope's
six-day trip here are large, the logistical and security
preparations by both Israel and the Palestinian Authority are
unprecedented. The visit also requires an unparalleled cooperation
between the two governments, which so far, despite the minor
sniping of Jerusalem officials on both sides, has gone very
smoothly.
</P>
<P>
   A key concern of security officials was allayed last week when
the Palestinian police, acting on a tip from the Israelis, captured
two Islamic fundamentalist terror suspects with 88 pounds of
explosives. Having fled an Israeli raid on their hideout, during
which several of their colleagues were killed, they were considered
an at-large risk for an imminent attack.
</P>
<P>
   Security officials have not received specific threats against
the pope himself, although a tiny group of Jewish extremists is
aggressively antagonistic to his visit, the first state visit here
by a pope.
</P>
<P>
   Sometime late Saturday night, Jewish extremists vandalized the
helipad that has been specially built for the pope on Mount Scopus.
They ruined welcome signs, spray-painted ``Pope Out'' in English on
the pavement, and sketched a graphic equation between the Christian
cross and a swastika. ``Where were you during the Holocaust?'' they
wrote in Hebrew. Israeli police suspect the extreme right-wing Kach
group.
</P>
<P>
   The general potential for violence in the area is what concerns
security officials, who note that the pope's trip touches on all
the most sensitive issues here, from the Holocaust to the
sovereignty of Jerusalem to the right of return of Palestinian
refugees.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a real threat because of the security situation in
Israel,'' a senior security officer said. ``And the basic
assumption is that the pope is a target.''
</P>
<P>
   In Israel, 18,000 police officers, 4,000 soldiers and 250 Shin
Bet agents will be engaged in the security and logistical operation
during the visit. ``It is probably the largest, most complicated
and most sophisticated operation of VIP protection we've ever
done,'' said Brig. Gen. David Tsur of the Israeli police.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli security officials will turn over the pope to
Palestinian security when he lands at the heliport in Bethlehem on
Wednesday for his day in the Palestinian Authority's territory.
``We have very good cooperation with the PA, and they will take
full responsibility there,'' Tsur said. ``We have trained with them
for this. We did it with Yeltsin. It's no big deal.''
</P>
<P>
   The crowds themselves will also be a phenomenon. Some 60,000
pilgrims from 71 countries are flying into Tel Aviv, 45,000 of them
on special charters, making it the single biggest week in Israeli
tourism history.
</P>
<P>
   The tourism authorities are projecting revenues of $50 million,
much of it benefiting El Al, the airline, and two charter airlines.
About 300 extra flights will land in Israel during a five-day
period that began Saturday, and 800 buses have been chartered.
</P>
<P>
   El Al is offering items duty-free to pilgrims, including
telephone calling cards containing a bubble of water from the
Jordan River, olive-wood miniatures and ``Biblical perfumes.''
</P>
<P>
   As many as 2,000 foreign journalists are expected this week,
including the television anchors for CBS, NBC and ABC. As a media
event, it is likely to outstrip the groundbreaking visit of
President Anwar el-Sadat of Egypt to the Israeli Parliament in
1977.
</P>
<P>
   The pope will stay at the papal ambassador's residence near
Mount Scopus in East Jerusalem and travel around the country in an
Israeli army Blackhawk helicopter. His ``popemobile'' arrived last
week, but an army dune buggy was customized as a substitute for his
trip into the Old City, whose alleylike streets are too narrow for
the pope's usual vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   In the Old City, the Via Dolorosa got a million-dollar,
privately financed facelift for the occasion, and newly arrived
pilgrims are already crowding the winding cobblestone path that
tradition says Jesus took to his crucifixion. Juan Romero, 26, of
Salamanca, Spain, took the uphill trek Sunday, bearing a rented
cross. He stopped at every station of the cross and then emerged
from the Church of the Holy Sepulcher to treat himself to a falafel
in pita with extra tahina sauce.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can only go so far in replicating Jesus' experience,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The densely packed, often garbage-strewn Old City is looking
almost spiffy as Jerusalem prepares for the pope.
</P>
<P>
   In the Bethlehem area, the Dehaisheh refugee camp is strung with
welcome banners. But the refugees decided not to freshen up the
dingy place, which would alter its depressing reality. One sign
apologizes to the pope that no street will be named after him in
the camp. ``We do not intend to stay here,'' said the residents of
52 years.
</P>
<P>
   Various officials offered various explanations of what took
place at the stage last weekend, from the loosening of a few cables
to the collapse of a canopy to the cracking of a critical beam that
crashed down on the stage several feet from where the pope is
supposed to stand.
</P>
<P>
   But Israeli newspaper editorialists were quick to cringe. ``All
we ask is that there not be a disaster,'' one wrote.

U.S. SCRAMBLES TO RESCUE ITS CHINA POLICY 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By DAVID E. SANGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For more than a decade, Washington has urged Taiwan
to let true democracy flower, knowing that it could eventually lead
to the defeat of the Nationalist Party by pro-independence forces
and put the island, and even perhaps the United States, on a
collision course with mainland China.
</P>
<P>
   But when the moment arrived at the weekend, administration
officials conceded, the timing was singularly inopportune.
</P>
<P>
   The victory of Chen Shui-bian, the opposition leader who until
recently was an open advocate of Taiwan's independence from China,
sent White House and State Department officials scrambling Sunday
to prevent an escalation of tensions.
</P>
<P>
   And it may well change the calculus for the administration's
biggest foreign policy push in Congress this year, getting China
into the World Trade Organization, a deal that is ultimately more
about security and China's role in the world than about regulating
trade.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two weeks ago we were focused on the domestic debate here,
over the WTO and arms sales to Taiwan,'' a senior administration
official said. ``But the landscape has completely changed. And now
our primary focus is to manage the cross-strait relations _ and to
keep everyone from doing something stupid.''
</P>
<P>
   The State Department's top official for Asia, Stanley Roth, and
the U.S. delegate to the United Nations, Richard Holbrooke, are in
Beijing now. Their plan, administration officials said Sunday, is
to urge President Jiang Zemin to say little in public and reach out
to Chen, rather than give in to hard-liners pressing to make good
on China's recent threats.
</P>
<P>
   Their visit will be immediately followed by the arrival of
President Clinton's national security adviser, Sandy Berger, on
completion of Clinton's trip to India and Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the White House searched on Sunday for someone
to send to Taiwan with a similar message to Chen about the need to
steer clear of statements likely to incite Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   The most likely choice, officials said, is former Rep. Lee
Hamilton, a longtime China hand who now runs the Woodrow Wilson
International Center for Scholars. Under the bizarre diplomatic
rules of Washington's ``one China'' policy, no senior U.S. official
can officially visit or consult with the island's leaders _ even as
the United States gives Taiwan defensive weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Even if an immediate crisis is averted, the ouster of the
Nationalists greatly complicates Clinton's effort to give order to
a messy relationship with the United States.
</P>
<P>
   With only 10 months left in office, he wants to persuade
Congress to give China permanent trading rights and a voice in the
World Trade Organization. Earlier this month, Clinton argued
passionately that the vote marks the United States' best chance to
change China _ through the Internet and the opening of its market _
and to loosen communist control.
</P>
<P>
   But if Jiang and his prime minister, Zhu Rongji, decide in
coming weeks that Taiwan's new challenge mandates a response,
administration officials say, the economic opening to Beijing may
be doomed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our hope is that Beijing will maintain the stance that it took
immediately after the election on Saturday, a moderate tone,'' said
Charlene Barshefsky, the U.S. trade representative, who is at the
center of the WTO debate. But if that tone changes, she said,
``there's no telling where this could go.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The administration is already under pressure from conservatives
to sell far more arms to Taiwan, to counter Beijing's growing
missile threat to the island. Last month, the House voted
overwhelmingly to approve the Taiwan Security Enhancement Act,
which would establish direct military communications between
Washington and Taipei and expand U.S. training of Taiwan's military
officers.
</P>
<P>
   The administration considers the legislation so provocative to
Beijing that Berger referred to it recently as ``the Taiwan
Insecurity Act'' and has recommended that it be vetoed.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans, led by Rep. Tom DeLay of Texas, the majority whip,
chose it as the first major bill for the year precisely because it
would challenge China. And if tensions escalate in coming weeks, it
may be appended to the World Trade Organization legislation _
leaving Clinton with the agonizing choice of letting his major
overture to China die, or outraging Beijing by linking its economic
role in the world with support for an island that it considers, now
more than ever, a renegade province.
</P>
<P>
   The long-term U.S. concern is that the suddenly chaotic
political landscape in Taipei could put the United States into the
middle of a dangerous crossfire.
</P>
<P>
   Washington has been committed to Taiwan's defense since the Cold
War. In 1996, Clinton sent two carrier groups to the end of the
strait in response to China's firing several missiles into waters
near Taiwan before elections that year.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Zhu warned that any move toward independence _ or
even foot-dragging in talks about unification _ could prompt China
to ``spill blood.''
</P>
<P>
   The American response is to leave China with the impression that
the United States would intervene if China made a military move.
But that threat is of diminishing value. The Chinese know the U.S.
political landscape well _ and Clinton's aides, in private moments,
wonder aloud whether Americans would risk war with the world's most
populous nation over the fate of Taiwan.

   HOUSTON _ Most Saturday nights, Marge Vinzant and her sister,
Mitriel, don't care about going to a movie, dining at a fancy
restaurant or checking out the singles scene.
</P>
<P>
   Instead they can be found at a front-row table at a southwest
Houston karaoke bar, where they patiently wait their turn to stand
in front of an audience and sing for applause.
</P>
<P>
   Occasionally men on the prowl stop by their table and try their
best come-on lines. The women slough them off.
</P>
<P>
   ``Been there, done that,'' says Marge.
</P>
<P>
   They direct their attention to the stage and applaud
enthusiastically when any singer hits a high note. When their
moment arrives _ it happens only a couple of times on a busy night
_ they work hard to pick a song that will move the crowd to get up
and dance.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes me feel good. It calms me down,'' says Marge, a
banker by day. ``I like to sing in front of people.''
</P>
<P>
   Amateur singers live for the few moments when they get to belt
out a favorite tune onstage. Their devotion is a primary reason why
karaoke _ like cockroaches and ozone _ just won't die.
</P>
<P>
   More than a decade after this singing art form swept through the
United States, karaoke is the subject of a new Gwyneth Paltrow
movie, ``Duets,'' and remains a staple in most cities.
</P>
<P>
   Even pop superstars are taking part.
</P>
<P>
   People magazine reports that Whitney Houston and Bobby Brown
recently stopped by a West Hollywood, Calif., karaoke bar. When
Houston belted out her monster hit ``I Will Always Love You,''
patrons called friends on their cell phones to let them listen in.
</P>
<P>
   Not only adults get into it. A popular show on MTV, ``Say What
Karaoke?,'' is a raucous karaoke competition in which contestants
sing the latest songs in flamboyant costumes selected from a nearby
room.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sort of a communal fun vibe,'' says Tony DiSanto, MTV
vice president of production, who helped create the show. ``There's
a little bit of rock star in all of us.''
</P>
<P>
   No matter the venue, karaoke works this way: A would-be singer
sifts through a thick book of song titles, chooses the one to sing,
writes it down on a piece of paper and gives it to the host, better
known as the KJ.
</P>
<P>
   When his name or table number is called, he goes onstage, grabs
a microphone and sings, accompanied by background music and aided
by lyrics flashed on a video monitor.
</P>
<P>
   The craze began nearly 20 years ago in Japan _ ``karaoke'' is a
Japanese word that translates loosely as ``empty orchestra'' _ when
a pub owner improvised with recordings because a popular
entertainer was unable to perform. Customers sang along, and soon
karaoke was spreading around the world.
</P>
<P>
   By the early 1990s, karaoke was ``huge'' in Houston clubs, says
Oskar Torre, owner of Overtime Productions and the Karaoke Host,
which provides DJs for parties and rents out equipment. In the
mid-1990s, however, many clubs began dropping the entertainment
because it seemed out of date.
</P>
<P>
   But a funny thing happened, Torre says: Karaoke went from
``commercial to consumers.'' Torre began to get calls from people
wanting to rent equipment for weddings, bar mitzvahs and other
family functions.
</P>
<P>
   Now karaoke has become so popular again that Torre is opening a
recording studio in his Houston-area offices next month so fans who
are looking to improve their singing can bring in a song and record
it digitally on a CD with karaoke-style background music.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nine out of 10 people dream about a singing career,'' he says.
``This gives them a perfect opportunity to unleash those
inhibitions.''
</P>
<P>
   The reason for karaoke's renewed popularity is simple, Torre
says: We all like to sing. We've sung in the school choir. Or at
church. While driving in our cars. Or, if we're really shy, in the
shower.
</P>
<P>
   At a karaoke bar, ``these people can go from being nobodies to
Thursday-night somebodies,'' he says, pointing out that many bars
have karaoke sing-alongs on Thursdays to get an early start on the
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The ``heart of karaoke'' is on display, Torre says, when novices
summon the courage to sing for the first time. ``Two or three
idiots get up, and they can't carry a tune, but they're having a
great time,'' he says. ``That is the chemistry you look for.''
</P>
<P>
   Lynda Escalante remembers the first time she got up to sing
karaoke.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got applause, and that was a real rush,'' she says. ``A lot
of people secretly want to be a star without the pressure and just
have fun. Singing is good for the soul. If you're having a lousy
day, it just makes it better.''
</P>
<P>
   About five years ago, she started Laser Karaoke by Lynda after
renting a karaoke machine and buying it ``as a toy for the house''
because she liked it so much. Now she rents out equipment and hosts
karaoke nights.
</P>
<P>
   When she's not working, she and her husband like to hang out
with friends at a sports bar in the north Houston, which has
karaoke sing-alongs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people make the circuit; they try to see who else is out
there,'' she says. ``Others like a little bit of singles action.
But most people have a favorite spot.''
</P>
<P>
   Louis Morales, a gymnastics teacher, got interested in karaoke
about five years ago because it helped relieve his depression after
a divorce. He met his fiancee, Tina Allen, at a karaoke bar. Both
sing regularly in public.
</P>
<P>
   ``We call it `hooked on phonics,''' says Allen, a nurse who's
hoping for a singing career.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first time I opened my mouth (to sing), I had friends,''
Morales says. ``It's a nice, friendly way to meet people. It's like
one big melting pot. It brings together everyone with music.''
</P>
<P>
   Another regular, Pam Holter, got interested in karaoke after she
split up with her husband and went to a nearby bar to get away from
her troubles. It offered karaoke, and although it took her nine
months to get up in front of an audience, she was hooked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you get a microphone in your hand, it's a natural high,''
says Holter, who's an accountant. ``You don't need drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   Now she has a circle of karaoke friends who care about her, and
she's having the time of her life, she says.
</P>
<P>
   Morales differentiates several levels of karaoke singers:
serious singers who care more about a good selection of songs and a
high-quality sound system than about a bar's location; party groups
that drink a lot and sing to have a good time; and ``event'' crowds
that participate on special occasions at a hotel or auditorium.
</P>
<P>
   When Jessica Pizzitola turned 30 recently, she reserved a
private room at Spotlight Karaoke _ one of the few Houston spots
that offer nonstop karoke every night _ for a party with her
friends. But before the evening was over, she came out to the main
stage. With a cigarette in one hand and a microphone in the other,
a tiara on her head and a pink boa over her shoulders, she gave a
soulful rendition of the Gloria Gaynor classic ``I Will Survive.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think so many people have this little desire to be a star,''
says Pizzitola, a Houston native who now lives in Austin, where she
is a personal assistant to a film director. ``Even though some
people think it's cheesy, it gives you that moment where you can be
a star _ even if it's only for a second.''
</P>
<P>
   Joel Trostle, a research chemist who had a good time with the
Rolling Stones song ``Satisfaction,'' says the hardest part about
singing karaoke is working up the courage to go onstage.
</P>
<P>
   ``You confront your fears singing in front of strangers,'' he
says. ``But once you do it, you're so relieved. You think, `I made
it, and the gong didn't ring.'''
</P>
<P>
   The allure can become addictive.
</P>
<P>
   When Casey Dippel was 18, he stood up in a now-defunct club and
sang the UB40 song ``Kingston Town.''
</P>
<P>
   The crowd roared.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly nine years later, Dippel is a regular on the karaoke
scene. Besides singing at Houston clubs several times a week, he
checks out karaoke bars when he goes on vacation.
</P>
<P>
   He has sung in such places as Atlanta, San Francisco, Phoenix
and Orlando, Fla. He says people have asked him whether he's a
professional singer. Some have followed him to his car.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can go in any karaoke bar in the world and get respect,''
says Dippel, a 26-year-old assistant superintendent for a gas and
air compressor company who models his singing style on Ricky Martin
and George Michael. ``That's a good feeling.''

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Rep. Thomas M. Davis III does not want an asterisk
next to his name in some political almanac with a footnote reading,
``Bungled Republican control of the House.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a tough job he has, chairman of the National Republican
Congressional Committee, especially with all those House Democrats
dreaming up decorating schemes for the suites they hope to fill in
the next Congress, and going on about gun control and health care
all the time. The last man who held the job, Rep. John Linder of
Georgia, was replaced after Republicans lost five seats in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one advantage I would give them right now, it isn't
financial because we've outraised them and we will continue to
outraise them,'' Davis, who represents suburban northern Virginia
and is in charge of the Republicans' election strategy, said about
the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's that under Gephardt they have the eye of the tiger,'' he
said, referring to the minority leader, Rep. Richard Gephardt of
Missouri. ``They have shown amazing discipline, and they are very
focused.''
</P>
<P>
   So Davis has made it his mission to badger his Republican
colleagues to raise more money, bushels of it, and to force them to
visualize life in a House controlled by Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are sitting there measuring drapes to your office,''
Davis tells his Republican friends, some of whom have reacted less
than graciously to his pestering. ``And that bill you got through
this year, next year you will be lucky to be a co-sponsor.''
</P>
<P>
   He takes a similarly menacing approach with business leaders.
Many of them have been donating to Democrats as well as
Republicans. ``They may not get everything they want out of this
Congress,'' Davis said, ``but I tell you what, they are on defense
the next Congress if Democrats take control.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year was a tough one for Davis and House Republicans. They
were way down in the polls, carrying $3 million of campaign debt
and spending money like it was there to burn.
</P>
<P>
   There was one big payoff, though, and it came in Davis' home
state. Virginia Republicans captured the statehouse, which meant
they would control the redistricting process in 2002. Soon after,
one Democrat incumbent in the House decided to defect. Another
decided to retire. This gave Republicans a slight chance to regain
seats in November, and a much-needed psychological boost.
</P>
<P>
   Davis, 51, is a Republican who is hard to pin down. A lawyer and
a former board chairman of Fairfax County, an area of prosperous
suburbs near Washington, he is a moderate who supports gun control
and free trade, and who takes a middle stance on the abortion
issue. (The government should not intrude, nor should it pay for
the procedure, Davis believes.) He meets with gay groups and labor
officials. He is a Christian Scientist among Baptists and
Methodists. He is also a lawmaker who actually embraces the term
``politician,'' a word that causes most Republicans to recoil.
</P>
<P>
   His moderation did not sit well with conservative Republicans
who sought to block his selection as campaign chairman. ``I got
some pretty vicious faxes and e-mails about me, about `Don't let
this guy get the keys,''' Davis said. ``But I won pretty
comfortably.''
</P>
<P>
   That is because Davis has spent his lifetime preparing for the
job, or so it seems. ``He takes it seriously,'' said Rep. James P.
Moran, a Virginia Democrat and a friend. ``Michael Jordan used to
say of Charles Barkley, `He will never be as great as I am because
he doesn't live basketball.' Tom Davis lives politics.''
</P>
<P>
   The one thing everyone who knows Davis immediately says about
him is that he is a walking political almanac.
</P>
<P>
   Ask him who won some obscure House race in some little-known
patch of Kansas or Maine or Florida, way back in 1982, and he will
recite the name, then drop in the margin of victory, just to show
off. It is a parlor trick he is hoping will pay off when he
formulates the strategy for keeping control of the House. A net
gain of only six seats for the Democrats would tip the balance away
from the Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas M. Davis III was born in Minot, N.D., to Nebraska-bred
parents in 1949. The family moved to Arlington, Va., when he was a
boy, and it was there, hollering distance from the nation's
capital, that Davis became obsessed with politics.
</P>
<P>
   By seventh grade, Davis could name all of the nation's 400-plus
House members and the 100 senators. A year later, a neighbor told
him about the Capitol Page School, where students attend morning
classes, then spend their afternoons working as pages in the
Capitol. He lobbied for admission and persuaded the two Nebraska
senators to sponsor him. He became the president of his class.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people wanted to be something ambitious,'' he said, from
his home in a relatively modest section of Fairfax County. ``I just
like politics.''
</P>
<P>
   No ambition? In politics? ``Not anymore,'' he said. ``There's no
money in it.'' But isn't there money in it after you leave
politics? ``I guess, if you don't embarrass yourself,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   At Amherst College in the late 1960s, the hippie heyday, Davis
was an oddity: a teetotaler (his father was an alcoholic) and the
chairman of the Young Republicans. It was at Amherst that he struck
up a lifelong friendship with David Eisenhower, the former
president's grandson and Richard Nixon's son-in-law. When
Eisenhower was living at the White House, after his marriage to
Julie Nixon, he would set up whiffleball games on the White House
tennis court. Davis' first date with his wife, Peggy, an
obstetrician, was during a whiffleball game. They now have three
children.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his own political lineage, Eisenhower said he found
himself relying on Davis to make sense of the politics swirling
around him. ``I would shuttle between the White House and Davis
back at Amherst,'' Eisenhower said, ``and he was in their league,
at that age.''
</P>
<P>
   Of today's politics, Davis said that it did not take an Einstein
to decipher the Democratic strategy for winning back the House.
``They are all about trying to blow up the Congress,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But they are very disciplined over there. I just think our
guys have to understand that.''

MALONE MUSCLES THE JAZZ PAST THE NETS 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By CHRIS BROUSSARD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ The man who is arguably the best power
forward in basketball history wheeled in the paint and began
throwing around his muscle. His immense shoulders were smashing
Keith Van Horn in the chest. His thigh-sized biceps were smacking
him in the ribs. And 16,103 fans and a team of defenders were
hoping against the inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   But Karl Malone has been at this for 15 years, crushing the
dreams of opponents with his strength, skill and experience. So
naturally his move, which was culminated with a half-hook layup
that fell softly through the net, was good, breaking a tie score
with 1 minute 49 seconds to play and drawing a foul on the helpless
Van Horn as well.
</P>
<P>
   Malone made the ensuing free throw for the last of his game-high
32 points, and the wise, old Utah Jazz, with some timely shooting
from the reserve point guard Howard Eisley, held on to hand the
Nets their first loss in five games, 92-88, before a deflated crowd
at Continental Arena.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the kind of game a veteran team guts out because you
don't allow yourself to think tired,'' Malone said. ``There's no
panic in this team. We finish with a flurry. This was a big game
for us. The Nets are still playing for the playoffs. So it's not
like the Nets early in the season, where it didn't mean anything to
them. Every game means something to them.''
</P>
<P>
   The Nets, who were led by Stephon Marbury's 23 points and 12
assists, treated the game appropriately and played solidly enough
to beat a lesser team with perhaps a lesser star. But the
6-foot-9-inch, 259-pound Malone, his bodybuilder's physique defying
his 36 years, gripped the game and would not let go, scoring 24
points in the second half, including 11 in the fourth quarter,
before fouling out for the first time since Nov. 5, 1995, with 48.3
seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   ``Karl is probably one of the best power forwards to play the
game and he really took the team on his shoulders,'' Nets coach Don
Casey said. ``I don't know how you stop Malone. We've been studying
tapes for the last 10 years.''
</P>
<P>
   There certainly is no shame in losing to the Jazz, who finished
a five-game trip with four victories to improve to 44-21. If it
were not for the indomitable Los Angeles Lakers, the Jazz would be
the league's hottest team, having won 10 of its last 11 games and
17 of its last 20.
</P>
<P>
   But each defeat cuts deeply into the Nets' postseason hopes, and
Sunday's kicked off a week in which the Nets (28-37) face four
playoff teams. They visit Toronto on Tuesday and Charlotte on
Wednesday before hosting Minnesota on Friday. Like Sunday, they
could play well each time out and lose.
</P>
<P>
   The Nets, who fell in similar fashion to the Jazz, 106-101, on
Feb. 28, were teased by victory throughout Sunday's contest. After
falling behind by 22-11, late in the first quarter, they put
together a terrific 21-2 run to move ahead by 32-24 five minutes
into the second.
</P>
<P>
   John Stockton, Utah's future Hall of Fame point guard, was on
the bench for most of the Nets' spurt due to foul trouble, and
Eisley did not appear to be headed for the co-starring role with
Malone. But with Stockton (5 points, 10 assists, 1-for-7 shooting)
and Jeff Hornacek (4 points, 1-for-6) struggling
uncharacteristically, Eisley and Bryon Russell filled the void,
scoring 15 points apiece.
</P>
<P>
   Eisley scored 9 in the second quarter to help the Jazz fight
back for a 45-45 tie at halftime, and behind Malone's dominance,
Utah entered the fourth with a 69-66 lead. With two of their
recently ballyhooed reserves, Johnny Newman and Lucious Harris,
draining 3-pointers, the Nets moved ahead by 78-74 with 6:59
remaining, but an offensive funk followed, giving the Jazz the
sliver of opportunity it needed.
</P>
<P>
   The Nets failed to score on seven straight possessions, missing
six shots and committing one turnover, to fall behind by 82-78 with
less than 3 minutes left. Van Horn, who missed seven of his first
eight shots and had just 4 points entering the final period,
finally asserted himself, scoring 6 straight points to pull them
within 85-84.
</P>
<P>
   But Eisley sank a 15-footer with 57 seconds on the clock to
increase the cushion to 3 points. Twenty-nine seconds later, after
Van Horn (14 points, 9 rebounds) had drawn the sixth foul on Malone
and hit two free throws, Eisley again foiled the Nets, throwing in
a 19-footer over Marbury. With just 28 seconds left, the Nets began
sending Utah to the foul line, where the Jazz made 3-of-4 shots to
keep the hosts at bay.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have guys on that team that are not just role players,''
said Kerry Kittles, who finished with 14 points. ``They have guys
who can actually do great things. When you're shutting down guys
like Hornacek and you're making it hard for them, and a guy like
Eisley comes off the bench with a solid 15 points, that's tough to
overcome. A lot of times, that's the biggest difference in the
game.''
</P>
<P>
   That, and arguably the greatest power forward ever.

NORTH CAROLINA SHOWS IT BELONGS BY UPSETTING STANFORD 
</HEADLINE>

 By THOMAS GEORGE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BIRMINGHAM, Ala. _ Stanford chose to toss 22 of its 58 shots
from behind the 3-point arc. North Carolina decided to fly at the
Cardinal on nearly every one of those shots, to clip the Cardinal's
wings and roll forward to the Sweet 16.
</P>
<P>
   Eighth-seeded North Carolina mesmerized the South Region's
top-seeded team, beating the Cardinal by 60-53 on Sunday in a game
of persistent Carolina defense, opportunistic Carolina offense and
a blueprint Carolina finish. North Carolina (19-13) will play
fourth-seeded Tennessee next in Austin, Texas. The crowd in the
Birmingham-Jefferson Civic Center watched the Tar Heels earn their
17th Sweet 16 appearance in the last 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not your average school and this is not your average
team, regardless of what happened in the regular season,'' said
Carolina forward Jason Capel, who scored 8 points, but, more
importantly, limited Stanford's leading scorer, Casey Jacobsen, to
5 points on horrible 2-of-12 floor shooting. ``Our coach has taken
a beating, more than the players, and that's a shame because he can
only do so much. Our team was figured dead in the first round
against Missouri. Well, I don't think so.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Guthridge, the Tar Heels' coach, beamed with pride over
this bunch. It followed last year's group that was booted from the
first round of the tournament by Weber State.
</P>
<P>
   ``We worked hard against Stanford, we deserved it,'' Guthridge
said. ``Our defense of their 3s was very good.''
</P>
<P>
   It was better than that.
</P>
<P>
   Stanford made only 6 of its 22 3-point shots (27.3 percent). Its
starters converted only 14 of 50 overall shots. Jumper, jumper,
jumper, jumper. Few Stanford drives to the basket resulted in eight
free-throw attempts for the game. Carolina won the battle in the
paint by 26-20 and 7-foot center Brendan Haywood led the way with
12 points and 8 rebounds. Stanford had not scored fewer than 64
points in any game this season and in 14 games had scored at least
80.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted us to make a statement,'' Haywood said. ``We wanted
to show people, the ones who counted us out a long time ago, that
they don't know basketball as well as they think. This is big for
us.''
</P>
<P>
   Stanford made 10 of 29 shots in each half and shot 34.5 percent
for the game. It won in rebounds, 38-32, but did little converting
on second chances with its 14 offensive rebounds. The Cardinal
looked dizzy. It led by 27-20 with 2:17 left before halftime and
then allowed eight straight Tar Heels points. That gave North
Carolina a 28-27 halftime lead. And then North Carolina scored the
first 6 points of the second half.
</P>
<P>
   Cardinal guard David Mosely (17 points) kept his team alive with
early sharp shooting, but as the game progressed, he faded. Forward
Ryan Mendez entered off the bench to proved a lift on 4 of 4
shooting (including two 3-pointers) for 12 points. But without
Jacobsen scoring and with forward Mark Madsen (2 of 7 for 5 points)
and center Jarron Collins (3 of 10 for 8 points) struggling in
general, Stanford was doomed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got some looks but didn't make them,'' said Mike
Montgomery, Stanford's coach. ``They gave us some problems. They
forced us to do some things we don't like.''
</P>
<P>
   Capel on Jacobsen was the genesis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I watched a lot of film on him and saw he liked to come off
screens and shoot,'' Capel said. ``I wanted to be physical, make
him go to one side and force him to put the ball on the floor. He
doesn't like to do that and he wasn't as effective because of it.
You know, it only takes one shot to get a shooter going. He made
one on me when I slacked off but I wasn't going to let that happen
again. Wherever he was at, I was going to be.''
</P>
<P>
   There are several reasons why Stanford was seeded No. 1. Despite
its awful shooting, its complex struggles, it fought back to lead
47-45 with 8:03 to play. Three minutes passed before either team
scored another basket.
</P>
<P>
   Then it was Carolina freshman guard Joseph Forte who finished
the Cardinal.
</P>
<P>
   Forte made a layup and then sank consecutive 3-point shots to
give Carolina a lead it would not relinquish. Forte scored 11
points in the final five minutes, showing the flash and dazzle that
made him the Atlantic Coast Conference rookie of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coach told me to stop shooting like I was scared,'' said
Forte, who finished with 17 points. ``He said let it go and I
started to do that. At this stage, you can't be nervous or you go
home.''
</P>
<P>
   That is where Stanford (27-4) is headed.
</P>
<P>
   But Carolina rolls forward.
</P>
<P>
   ``To tell you the truth, I don't know what happened to make
people on our team come to their senses,'' said Ed Cota, the senior
Carolina guard who led all players with 10 assists. ``We had a
rough year, especially early, but that's over now. We're playing
more team basketball. We get to play for another day.'' &QL;

RED SOX UPSET BY A 5-HOUR ROUNDTRIP FOR A LATE POSTPONEMENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. _ The game, as exhibitions go, could have
been the highlight of the spring: Pedro Martinez pitching for
Boston, Mike Mussina for Baltimore, sellout crowd, Orioles fans
watching on television back home. The game, however, was not
played. It fell victim to a fiasco that had the Orioles angry with
the Fort Lauderdale Stadium grounds crew and the Red Sox furious,
albeit quietly, with the Orioles. An unnecessary five-hour
round-trip bus ride can produce that kind of reaction.
</P>
<P>
   The source of the problem and reason for the lost pitching
matchup and lucrative gate was the grounds crew's failure to cover
the infield with the tarpaulin on Saturday after the Orioles had
played the Minnesota Twins.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was told they didn't put it on because we took batting
practice after the game,'' Orioles Manager Mike Hargrove said. ``I
said that has nothing to do with it. Then they said, well, they
didn't call for rain. I said you have to think of a better one than
that because I watched the weather report.''
</P>
<P>
   Hargrove made a few other comments, he said, but added: ``I
don't know how, in a printable way, to tell you what I said. I
reverted to a very short vocabulary.''
</P>
<P>
   A chance of rain, indeed, was in the weather forecast Saturday,
and with the field left uncovered, rain fell through much of the
night. If that precipitation was not enough, rain fell torrentially
after 8 a.m. Sunday, adding to the lake in right field and the
quagmire that was formerly the infield.
</P>
<P>
   With more rain in the forecast, which the grounds crew by now
had apparently heard, the workers belatedly put the tarp on the
infield, completing that chore just before 10 o'clock.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox had planned to leave their spring training complex
across the state in Fort Myers at 8. They delayed their departure,
though, until getting a go-ahead from the Orioles. An Orioles
official called them at 10.
</P>
<P>
   ``They called and told us to come,'' Red Sox Manager Jimy
Williams said. ``They didn't tell us the tarp wasn't on all
night.''
</P>
<P>
   The grounds crew had told the Orioles that once the weather
permitted and the tarp was removed from the field, it could get the
field ready for a game in an hour and a half or two hours. The
Orioles presumably told the Red Sox to come because they believed
they would be able to play, however late they would have to begin.
Teams do not easily forgo sellout crowds and television revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, who studiously avoids controversy or inflammatory
comment, declined to say what he really thought of riding a bus two
and a half hours each way for nothing. The game was called off five
minutes before the Red Sox reached the stadium. But Williams left
little question about how he felt about the Orioles at that moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year,'' Williams said, sitting for a few minutes in the
visiting clubhouse, ``the Orioles went to Cuba for a game. We had a
game scheduled with them that day. They never even sent a team. We
had to get another game. This year we had games scheduled for last
weekend in St. Petersburg and Fort Myers, and then we added games
in the Dominican Republic. But we still played the other games,
too. We honored our contract.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of the uncertainty of the weather, the Red Sox did not
bring Martinez. He stayed in Fort Myers to pitch in a minor league
game instead. The players who did make the trip got back on the bus
for the return two-and-a-half-hour trip across Alligator Alley.
After they left, more rain fell. This time the tarp covered the
infield, protecting it for the Orioles' scheduled day off Monday. &QL;

SUPREME COURT TERM'S CLOSING PHASE TO BE INTENSE
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Mass., Calif., Ariz., Texas, Va., N.J., Neb.)   (jw) 
 By LINDA GREENHOUSE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With more than three months to go in its term, the
Supreme Court on Monday will enter a concentrated period of unusual
intensity and potential import. The justices, back from a brief
recess, will begin six weeks of hearing arguments in one
blockbuster case after another, a series of high-profile appeals
that appear drawn from today's headlines and that have already
marked the term as a likely landmark.
</P>
<P>
   These questions suggest the scope of what awaits the justices
among the two dozen cases they will hear between now and the last
week in April, the final building blocks of the 1999-2000 term:
</P>
<P>
   Does public prayer before a high school football game violate
the separation of church and state?
</P>
<P>
   Are the Miranda warnings still required before the police can
interrogate a suspect in custody, or has Congress effectively
overruled the 34-year-old Miranda decision?
</P>
<P>
   Can states put into effect their own views of foreign policy by
withholding state business from companies that trade with
disfavored regimes.
</P>
<P>
   Can states, and by extension Congress, criminalize the surgical
procedure that abortion opponents call ``partial-birth abortion''?
</P>
<P>
   Do the Boy Scouts have a constitutional right to exclude gay
youths and men from leadership roles?
</P>
<P>
   These cases and more _ on the legal threshold for winning an
employment discrimination case, on constitutional standards for
enhanced sentencing under hate crime laws, on congressional
authority to make arson a federal crime, on whether political
parties can be required to open their primaries to voting by
nonmembers _ are all due for decision by the end of June, the
court's goal for resolving all argued cases and finishing its term.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just an amazing term, with no major area of
constitutional law that doesn't have the potential for major
change,'' Erwin Chemerinsky, a law professor at the University of
Southern California, said in an interview. Noting the high-profile
nature of the court's docket, he continued: ``I wonder whether the
magnitude of this term, the prominence of these cases, will have
the effect of making the court more salient as an election issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Given that some major cases that were argued three, four or even
five months ago remain undecided as this new round of arguments
begins, the prospect of an orderly, on-time conclusion to the term
strikes many people who follow the court as wishful thinking.
</P>
<P>
   Among the earlier cases that are still undecided are those on
the Food and Drug Administration's authority to regulate tobacco
products and on the constitutionality of the Violence Against Women
Act, as well as a major church-state conflict over federal
financing for computer equipment in religious schools.
</P>
<P>
   The justices have all but complete control over which cases to
accept but relatively little control over the timing, generally
considering new appeals in the order in which they were filed. So
the unusual concentration of high-profile cases for the March and
April arguments simply reflects the fact that most of them reached
the justices' desks during the fall.
</P>
<P>
   What follows is a detailed look at some of the cases the
justices will hear in the coming weeks.
</P>
<P>
   CONGRESSIONAL AUTHORITY
</P>
<P>
   Pursuing its inquiry into the limits of congressional law-making
authority _ thought to be virtually limitless before the court
reversed course five years ago _ the court will hear a challenge on
Tuesday to a federal prosecution for burning down a private
residence. The question in Jones vs. U.S., No. 99-5739, is whether
Congress intended the federal arson law to apply to a private home
and, if so, whether Congress had authority to do so under its power
to regulate interstate commerce.
</P>
<P>
   FOREIGN POLICY
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Massachusetts will defend its so-called Burma law,
which in effect prohibits state agencies from doing business with
companies that do business in Myanmar, formerly Burma. Dozens of
state and local governments once aimed similar economic weapons
against South Africa's apartheid regime. Those went unchallenged,
but the federal appeals court in Boston, ruling in Natsios vs.
National Foreign Trade Council, No. 99-474, found the Burma law to
be an impermissible state intrusion into the federal government's
foreign affairs power.
</P>
<P>
   FOOTBALL TEAM PRAYER
</P>
<P>
   The court will hear a Texas school district's appeal of a ruling
that barred the practice, highly popular in the state, of
student-led prayers at public high school football games. The March
29 argument in the case, Santa Fe Independent School District vs.
Doe, No. 99-62, is likely to focus on whether the students' prayer
is truly private speech, and therefore presumably constitutional,
as the district and state maintain, or whether the circumstances of
the student's selection and performance make the event a form of
public worship that the Supreme Court's precedents forbid.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   MIRANDA
</P>
<P>
   In 1968, two years after the court's ruling in Miranda vs.
Arizona, Congress tried to blunt the decision by reverting to the
``voluntariness'' test for the admissibility of confessions in
federal prosecutions, with the court-specified warnings
unnecessary.
</P>
<P>
   Seven Republican and Democratic administrations refused to apply
the law, known as Section 3501, while conservative law enforcement
groups tried to bring it to the lower courts' attention. Finally
last year, the federal appeals court in Richmond, Va., ruled that
Congress was free to overturn Miranda and that it had, in effect,
done so. The Supreme Court's conservative bloc has been notably
lacking in deference to Congress, so one interesting question for
the April 19 argument in Dickerson vs. U.S., No. 99-5525, is what
stance the conservative justices who have criticized Miranda will
now take.
</P>
<P>
   ABORTION
</P>
<P>
   A federal appeals court ruled last year that the phrase
``partial-birth abortion'' as used in a 1997 Nebraska law
criminalizing the procedure ``has no fixed medical or legal
content'' and was so ill-defined as to be potentially applicable to
common techniques used for abortions early in pregnancy. That
placed an ``undue burden'' on a woman's exercise of her
constitutional right to abortion, the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals held.
</P>
<P>
   As the Supreme Court's first abortion case since 1992, Stenberg
vs. Carhart, No. 99-830, carries obvious political and emotional
freight. One question for the April 25 argument is whether the
justices will confine themselves to examining the deficiency the
appeals court identified, or whether they want to make a broader
statement about the constitutional status of abortion.
</P>
<P>
   BOY SCOUTS
</P>
<P>
   Although the effort of a gay Eagle Scout, James Dale, to regain
his place in a New Jersey troop has positioned Boy Scouts of
America vs. Dale, No. 99-699, as a gay rights case, the court may
well not see it that way. The question for the April 26 argument is
whether the Boy Scouts have a right, under the First Amendment's
protection for freedom of association, to define its own
``expressive character'' by excluding gay members.
</P>
<P>
   In its most recent relevant precedent, the court ruled
unanimously that the Boston St. Patrick's Day parade could not be
required to include a group marching under a gay-rights banner. But
in ruling for Dale, the New Jersey Supreme Court noted that he was
not carrying a banner but simply wanted to remain a member.

SPRING TRAINING A CULTURE SHOCK FOR LAMB
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEARWATER, Fla. _ Mike Lamb has been playing baseball almost
all his life and what happens on the field hasn't changed all that
much in his first major-league camp.
</P>
<P>
   It's what happens off the field that he has found overwhelming
as he tries to win a job as the Rangers' third baseman.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been tough,'' Lamb said yesterday before the Rangers' 5-4
loss to the Philadelphia Phillies. ``It's something new. In spring
training, I've never had to fight for a position in the minor
leagues. That's something new for me. But it's not like I've been
overmatched and it's not like I don't think I can hit, even though
my average is not what I wanted it to be. I'm not discouraged.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't explain it; it's just different than anything I've
ever done. A ton of people asking you for your autograph, wanting
to take your picture. Reporters asking you questions, radio, TV .
.. people saying one day, `you're going to be there,' the next week
saying, `what's happening, what's going on?' For someone going
through it the first time, it's a cultural shock.''
</P>
<P>
   Lamb was the Rangers' Minor League Player of the Year last
season, hitting .324 with 21 home runs and 100 runs batted in. When
the Rangers failed to re-sign Todd Zeile in the off-season, it
appeared Lamb would be the Rangers' starting third baseman on
Opening Day.
</P>
<P>
   But then Triple-A third baseman Tom Evans showed up in Port
Charlotte doing his best Mike Schmidt impersonation, hitting four
home runs in the first eight games. Suddenly Lamb no longer was a
sure thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even older players can get overwhelmed by it,'' Rangers
manager Johnny Oates said. ``It's all part of the learning process.
It's different here than Double-A and Triple-A. But Mike Lamb is
going to be fine. He's going to hit and he's going to find a place
to play in the big leagues real soon.''
</P>
<P>
   It's just that it's hard to tell when.
</P>
<P>
   Lamb walked in his one pinch-hit appearance yesterday and is
batting .242. Evans, who has cooled off, went 0-for-3 but is still
hitting .400. There are two weeks left in camp and the Rangers'
intense third base competition continues.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll know more in two weeks,'' Oates said.
</P>
<P>
   Lamb understands that. He said he never came to spring training
with the belief that he would automatically be the Rangers'
starting third baseman.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew I was going to have to earn it,'' Lamb said. ``It's not
a given just because Tommy isn't on the 40-man roster. If he needs
to be in Arlington on Opening Day, he'll be there. They'll make the
move. I saw him down in Triple-A and I respect the fact that he's
been around. He's a good ballplayer.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the Rangers said was we're going to give you the
opportunity, that's all I can ask for.''
</P>
<P>
   Lamb admitted it's hard not to think ahead or keep from
wondering what's going to happen at the end of spring training. He
also admitted he was pressing a little bit at the start of spring
after Evans got off to a great start.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard when you see Tommy doing well and you're trying to
match it,'' Lamb said. ``You can sit there and say, I'm not going
to hit a million home runs, so I just have to stay within myself.
But it's harder to do it than to just say it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not scared of not winning the job. If I have to go to
Triple-A, it doesn't mean life is over. It just gives me more time
to be better prepared if I get called up or for next year. It's
still an opportunity to play baseball at a high level. Triple-A is
quality baseball, it's not a slam in the face if I've got to go
there.''
</P>
<P>
   But Lamb made one thing clear, ``I'm not saying I want to go to
Triple-A. I'm going to do everything I can to make this team.'' /

SEGUI HAPPY WHEREEVER HE PLAYS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEARWATER, Fla. _ David Segui made one thing perfectly clear
upon joining the Rangers yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   He has no problem being the Rangers' designated hitter even if
he would rather be playing first base.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ideally I'd rather play first base,'' Segui said. ``But I'm
not the manager; I don't make out the lineup. I've never once
complained about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Segui was acquired from the Toronto Blue Jays on Thursday in a
three-way trade that sent Lee Stevens to the Montreal Expos. He is
expected to be the Rangers' designated hitter while Rafael Palmeiro
returns to first base.
</P>
<P>
   But manager Johnny Oates continues to insist both will play in
the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``How much, I don't know,'' Oates said. ``I can't be wrong with
either one of them at first base. As we go along in the season,
we'll see what develops. We'll figure out each day what's best for
the team ... and that's what they want.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Segui, ``Johnny doesn't have to explain anything to me.
Whatever he wants, I'll do. I'm not going to complain that I need
to play first base more or DH less. I'm here to win, not to
complain.''
</P>
<P>
   Segui has been a first baseman for most of his career but the
Toronto Blue Jays used him as a designated hitter last year after
acquiring him on July 28 from the Seattle Mariners.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's boring as hell when you're used to playing in the
field,'' Segui said. ``It's an adjustment at first. It's a totally
different mindset. I'm a little high-strung and I had to control
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Segui played for Oates for three years while they were with the
Baltimore Orioles. Third base coach Jerry Narron and general
manager Doug Melvin were also there and Segui said, ``They're all
people I respect. It's nice to be in a situation where you're
comfortable.''
Oates on realignment
</P>
<P>
   Johnny Oates has seen newspaper reports suggesting Major League
Baseball's next realignment will put the Rangers in a six-team
Central Division. But his preference would be for baseball to have
six five-team divisions, even if it means an inter-league game
every night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like symmetry,'' Oates said. ``At least you get the same
number of teams to beat out as everybody else.''
Injury report
</P>
<P>
   The latest on the Rangers' injured pitchers:
</P>
<P>
   Justin Thompson (left shoulder surgery) threw batting practice
for 10 minutes yesterday without problems. He limited his
repertoire to fastballs and changeups and did not throw a curve.
</P>
<P>
   John Wetteland (strained groin) came through Friday's throwing
session without any day-after soreness. He is expected to throw off
a mound again today and batting practice tomorrow. Manager Johnny
Oates said he'll sit down with Wetteland after that and formulate a
plan.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Venafro (strained ligament in left middle finger) threw
yesterday for 10 minutes without tape on the finger. Venafro
reported some initial pain but said it went away after two or three
pitches.
</P>
<P>
   Esteban Loaiza, scratched from his previous start because of
tightness in his elbow, threw for 12 minutes in the bullpen and
said he felt normal. He'll start tomorrow against the Tampa Bay
Devil Rays.
Briefly
</P>
<P>
   Catcher Bill Haselman was hit in the right knee with a pitch in
the second inning and had to leave the game. He is day-to-day.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Helling allowed three runs in five innings against the
Phillies yesterday, leaving Rangers starters with a 3.19 earned-run
average in spring training. The Rangers staff has a 4.89 ERA.

SETON HALL'S BACKUP POINT GUARD UPSETS TEMPLE 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By JOE LAPOINTE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUFFALO, N.Y. _ During the palpitating pressure of overtime,
Shaheen Holloway's face was temporarily clear of tears. He rose
from his wheelchair, balanced his weight on his one healthy foot
and stood to cheer his Seton Hall teammates who were trying to beat
Temple without him Sunday in their second-round game of East
Regional.
</P>
<P>
   The Pirates were the underdogs even when they had their
co-captain and star guard, and they played most of day without him
because he left early with a badly sprained left ankle. They
trailed twice in overtime. But they got what they needed when Ty
Shine _ Holloway's replacement _ hit yet another 3-point field goal
from the top of the key to bring his game total to 26. That gave
Seton Hall a 1-point lead with 18.9 seconds to play.
</P>
<P>
   Then came a Temple turnover, a Temple foul and two free throws
by the freshman Greg Morton, who had missed two others in the
previous minute. Holloway, his chair parked at the end of the
bench, caught Morton's eye and encouraged him by demonstrating the
shooting motion. Morton made one of two. The lead was 2 points.
With the final seconds ticking away and the screams of the fans
filling the air, Temple's Lynn Greer launched a desperate long shot
that banked off the back of the rim and triggered two celebrations
of a 67-65 Seton Hall victory.
</P>
<P>
   While Pirates players rushed together on the floor, Holloway
raised his arms in exultation before being engulfed by team
personnel, including the Rev. Frank McNulty, one of the team
chaplains. ``He was crying,'' McNulty said. Holloway had his
reasons. ``I was afraid this was going to be my last college
game,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It still could be for him, but not for his team. The Pirates
will meet Oklahoma State Friday in the regional semifinals in
Syracuse, the Cowboys having defeated Pepperdine, 75-67, in
Sunday's first game.
</P>
<P>
   Holloway, who was hurt when he stepped on a Temple player's
sneaker while making a layup on a fast break with about 12 minutes
left in the first half, has no broken bone but a severe sprain, the
team announced. After returning from the X-ray room of a nearby
hospital, he was wheeled to the bench, his ankle wrapped, raised
and covered by ice, with 12:40 left in the game. He wiped tears
from his cheeks and fans tried to console him by chanting his name.
</P>
<P>
   Holloway's status for next weekend is, at best, questionable. In
the previous game, a 72-71 victory over Oregon, Holloway had scored
the winning basket on a floor-length drive in overtime. Of the 48
games so far in this tournament, Seton Hall has played two of the
most exciting.
</P>
<P>
   This time, the hero was Shine, the sophomore not content with
his backup, who played 37 minutes and made 9 of 15 field-goal
attempts, including 7 of 11 from 3-point range over the matchup
zone defense of the Owls. Shine brought the ball upcourt, ordered
teammates into position and fulfilled the mission of a morning
prayer session. During that pre-breakfast meeting, McNulty spoke to
some of the players about courage. After the game, Shine approached
the priest and said: ``That thing on courage helped me.''
</P>
<P>
   They needed that and much more and they got it from several
sources. Rimas Kaukenas, gritty as usual, scored 18 points and
crashed to the floor several times. Darius Lane scored 16 points
and grabbed 14 rebounds. Lane had four assists and Shine had five.
Although Temple got 27 points from Mark Archer, the Owls got only 6
assists from Pepe Sanchez, their star guard, who fouled out in the
final minute of regulation time. The Owls, seeded No. 2 in this
region, ended their season at 27-6 while the 10th seeded Pirates
rose to 22-9.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel very empty,'' Sanchez said. ``We weren't ready enough
to handle all the pressure. We're not a great team. We're a good
team. We have what we deserve.''
</P>
<P>
   The Seton Hall people feel the same way. The players and coaches
are cautious about trivializing tragedy, but all are aware of the
mood lingering on campus from the dormitory fire that killed three
freshmen in January. Tommy Amaker, the coach, said ``Our whole
school drew closer'' after the fire and that the basketball team is
helping to raise spirits even as mourning continues.
</P>
<P>
   The exhilaration of this weekend is being felt in groups and by
individuals. Kaukenas, one of the more eloquent of the Pirates,
said: ``At the end of the game, we had a timeout and I told
everyone that we had to win because we owe it to Shaheen. He really
helped us get into this position. For us to come out of this with a
win, it is very exciting, probably the most exciting thing to
happen in my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Many moments suggested a different result. The Owls led by 14-3
in the fifth minute and the Pirates were turning over the ball.
Samuel Dalembert, their big freshman center, triggered a brief
surge when two blocked shots led to 5 quick points on fast breaks.
But the last two also brought Holloway's injury. ``I didn't want it
to end like this,'' said Holloway, a senior.
</P>
<P>
   Even with Shine making shots, Dalembert took his fourth foul in
the second minute of the second half. He went to the bench and this
weakened Seton Hall's defensive presence. But Shine, Lane and
Kaukenas combined to make 15 of 30 attempts from 3-point range. The
Temple lead never exceeded 5 points. Dalembert returned and made a
layup a minute later to give the Pirates the lead. At the
regulation buzzer, Kevin Wilkins missed a jumper that would have
won the game for Seton Hall.
</P>
<P>
   They would have to wait another five minutes, but victory would
be theirs. Shine, who wears the numeral ``0'' on his shirt _ the
one that looks like a basketball hoop _ had bided his time as
Holloway's understudy. After he had career bests in minutes played
and points scored Sunday, he still had enough energy to rush to the
sideline after the final buzzer to answer the cheers of the fans by
placing his right hand to his forehead and giving them a snappy
salute.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good things come to those who wait,'' he said.

NRA STANDS BY CRITICISM OF PRESIDENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By MARC LACEY    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In the face of criticism from political friends and
foes alike, the National Rifle Association refused on Sunday to
back off the supercharged rhetoric of the group's executive vice
president, Wayne R. LaPierre Jr., who last week labeled President
Clinton as an accessory to murder for not enforcing the nation's
gun laws.
</P>
<P>
   LaPierre did decline to repeat the inflammatory line that the
president has blood on his hands, but he nonetheless stood by his
remarks in a series of television appearances on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I used some strong language,'' LaPierre said on NBC's
``Meet the Press.'' ``But I did it to center the issue on the fact
that this administration, over the last seven years, has dropped
federal enforcement of existing federal gun laws against the bad
guys by 50 percent. And that's why I used the language, to center
the debate.''
</P>
<P>
   Within the NRA itself, LaPierre's tough talk won accolades from
some hardliners who have regarded him as too moderate in his
defense of gun owners' rights. Turning up the heat on Clinton, NRA
officials say, has also resulted in an increase in the
organization's membership.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he said what he did I thought, `It's about time someone
says it like it is,''' said David Edgar, who builds swimming pools
in Houston and keeps guns for self-defense. Edgar logged onto his
computer and joined the NRA last week after hearing LaPierre
lambaste the president for allowing a certain level of violence in
the country for political gain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm tired of people beating around the bush,'' said Edgar, who
described himself as a vehement gun proponent. ``There are so many
gun laws and every time the president opens up his mouth about
another one, people like me go out and stock up on guns.''
</P>
<P>
   But in the political world, NRA allies were clearly
uncomfortable with LaPierre's words.
</P>
<P>
   ``I probably wouldn't have said that,'' said Rep. Tom DeLay of
Texas, the House majority whip and an NRA ally.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the Republican presidential
candidate, also has urged the NRA to engage in more civil
discourse. Five years ago, Bush's father, former President Bush,
resigned from the gun organization after LaPierre signed a
fund-raising letter that referred to federal agents as ``jackbooted
government thugs,'' a comment for which he later apologized.
</P>
<P>
   The NRA suffered a setback on Friday when Smith &AMP; Wesson, the
nation's largest handgun manufacturer, broke ranks with the other
companies and struck a deal to end government lawsuits. The
organization is also battling the White House over gun control
legislation caught in a logjam on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   In an appearance Sunday on ABC's ``This Week,'' Charlton Heston,
the president of the NRA, called LaPierre's language ``extreme
rhetoric.''
</P>
<P>
   But Heston stuck by LaPierre's intent. And the two NRA leaders
blamed the administration on Sunday for the shooting death of a
sheriff's deputy, Ricky Kinchen, in Atlanta last week. Jamil
Abdullah Al-Amin, a leader of the Black Panthers in the 1960s who
was known then as H. Rap Brown, is wanted in connection with the
incident.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this administration had done their job properly, that Rap
would still be in prison and Deputy Kinchen would be alive,''
Heston said.
</P>
<P>
   The White House spokesman, Joe Lockhart, who was with the
president in New Delhi, said on ``Meet the Press'' that such talk
was ``really sick rhetoric, and it should be repudiated by anyone
who hears it.''
</P>
<P>
   But it appeals to some activists within the NRA who want no part
of even the compromise legislation that the gun lobby has supported
on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen a gun law that reduces crime,'' said Neal Fox,
an NRA board member who considers LaPierre too moderate. ``There
are a lot of unconstitutional laws out there that don't have any
reason to be enforced.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox said the NRA has been accused of far more deaths than
LaPierre is putting on the White House. ``We're baby killers, and
we're responsible for Columbine and even the Oklahoma City
bombing,'' said Fox. ``To hear our critics, all evil can be traced
to the NRA.''
</P>
<P>
   LaPierre joined the NRA in 1977 after working as a legislative
aide to a Democratic assemblyman in Virginia. He has risen through
the ranks, survived criticism about his management style and
financial stewardship, and seen the organization through many
crises.
</P>
<P>
   But within the NRA, he must always watch his back. Some members
complain that he is not a real gun lover and that he is more
comfortable in a suit and tie than in camouflage. Others say he is
overly concerned with courting politicians.
</P>
<P>
   LaPierre's anti-Clinton remarks illustrate the delicate line he
must walk. He alienated some political supporters and aggravated
the White House but may have helped the organization boost its
hard-core base.
</P>
<P>
   ``The money doesn't come in when you don't talk tough,'' said
Dudley Brown, executive director of Rocky Mountain Gun Owners,
which considers the NRA too moderate. ``Also, you can't raise money
if members are mad at you. You get them on your side by talking
tough.''

 McCAIN RETURNS TO AN UNEASY SENATE  
(sw) 
 By ALISON MITCHELL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ John McCain returns to the Senate on Monday with a
national following but facing a peculiar challenge: how to use his
new prominence to propel forward his signature issue of campaign
finance overhaul at a moment when everyone in politics is posing as
a reformer.
</P>
<P>
   The question will be placed front and center barely hours after
Senate Republicans face the ticklish etiquette of how to welcome
back a colleague who often ran against them and forced their chosen
candidate, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, to eat up the $70 million
that was supposed to go a long way to ensuring his ultimate
victory.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Mitch McConnell, the Kentucky Republican who has been
McCain's chief antagonist on changing the campaign finance law, is
opening hearings on the issue on Wednesday. And Sen. Chuck Hagel,
the Nebraska Republican who is one of McCain's closest friends in
the Senate, has entered the debate with his own rival measure,
which McCain's allies call deeply flawed.
</P>
<P>
   The renewed interest in campaign finance might look like good
news for the advocates of change. ``If anyone had said a year ago
that campaign finance reform would be a central theme of the
primaries and the general election, I don't think anybody would
have believed that person,'' said Sen. Russell D. Feingold, the
Wisconsin Democrat who co-sponsors McCain's bill to ban large
unregulated contributions to political parties.
</P>
<P>
   But McConnell insists that McCain's defeat showed that
Republicans, at least, widely oppose his efforts to cut down on
money in politics. And Bush, for all of his criticism of Vice
President Al Gore's fund-raising efforts, shows no signs of
embracing a bill that he criticized sharply in his debates with
McCain.
</P>
<P>
   So the seeming proliferation of reformers could serve less to
propel forward legislation than to take the edge off the issue by
providing election-year cover for candidates who want some of
McCain's sheen. ``I've never seen so many reformers in my life,''
said Fred Wertheimer, the president of Democracy 21, a group
advocating tighter campaign finance laws. ``The danger here is
clear _ people trying to co-op the campaign finance reform issue
and pass off fake reforms as real.''
</P>
<P>
   The question is how McCain will respond. The senator's aides
have made clear that McCain will maintain a national presence to
promote his ideas, establishing a political action committee to pay
his expenses for a national speaking tour and to stump for
like-minded Republican candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Whether McCain will ever endorse Bush is still an open question.
The senator is planning to confer with his former campaign staff on
an array of topics in meetings on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   But almost immediately he must decide on legislative tactics _
whether and how much to compromise.
</P>
<P>
   Originally McCain and Feingold had proposed legislation that
banned the donations to political parties known as soft money and
reined in the ability of outside groups to run issue advocacy
advertisements, which are really thinly disguised efforts designed
to promote or attack a candidate. The bill won a majority of the
Senate but not the 60 votes needed to overcome a Republican
filibuster.
</P>
<P>
   With many Republicans and conservative groups calling the
provisions on issue advertisements an assault on constitutional
guarantees of free speech, the two men last fall stripped their
bill down to just the banning of soft money in hopes of picking up
more votes. They planned to then try to win the necessary 60 votes
on the floor by accepting amendments.
</P>
<P>
   The House last year passed the companion bill for
McCain-Feingold, sponsored by Reps. Christopher Shays, R-Conn., and
Martin T. Meehan, D-Mass. But in the Senate, McCain and Feingold
made no headway when Democrats forced votes on the more
comprehensive original bill and the Republican leadership then took
the issue from the floor as deadlocked.
</P>
<P>
   Now Republicans look as if they may be prepared to coalesce
around Hagel's bill, which has several Democratic sponsors. ``From
my point of view it has big deficiencies,'' McConnell said but
added, ``at least it's a different kind of bipartisan vehicle.''
</P>
<P>
   The bill would limit soft money donations to national political
parties, allowing individuals, unions and corporations to
contribute a maximum of $120,000 per election cycle. At the same
time it would triple the current $1,000 limit on individual
contributions to federal candidates, which has not changed in the
quarter century since it was enacted.
</P>
<P>
   The proponents of the McCain-Feingold legislation argue that
rather than limiting money in politics, Hagel's approach would
actually allow more money to pour into politics because the limits
on soft money are so porous. Hagel would not stop federal
candidates or officials from raising soft money for state political
parties, so his cap on such donations could well prove meaningless
beyond shifting where the fund-raising takes place.
</P>
<P>
   While Hagel says that many states have strict limits on
fund-raising, Feingold says, ``It's not real reform.''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Mark Buse, a senior aide to McCain, said he ``genuinely
appreciates the effort that Senator Hagel is making'' but that he
``cannot support the Hagel bill as currently written.''
</P>
<P>
   As McCain sorts out how to move forward on campaign finance
legislation, his Senate colleagues have been wondering how to
handle him. Just a month ago, several Republicans say, Sen. Trent
Lott of Mississippi, the majority leader, was wondering whether a
long primary fight meant that McCain should be replaced as chairman
of the Senate Commerce Committee to keep the committee moving.
</P>
<P>
   John Czwartacki, Lott's spokesman, adamantly denied that such an
idea was ever considered. Another senior Republican official who
declined to be identified said Lott's second in command, Sen. Don
Nickles of Oklahoma, calmed the waters by suggesting that Senate
Republicans just wait and let the presidential race play out
further.
</P>
<P>
   In the past week, however, eager to patch up rifts in their
party and keep in their fold the legions of independents McCain
attracted, his colleagues debated ways to celebrate McCain, perhaps
with a cocktail reception, or a cake or a standing ovation. No
matter that on the campaign trail McCain often held up projects for
Lott's state as examples of pork or that he proclaimed his victory
in New Hampshire as a triumph over the ``machine'' of Sen. Judd
Gregg, R-N.H. Or that he used similar language against Sen. John W.
Warner of Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   But the Republican celebrations were vetoed by McCain's aides
and supporters, and he is now expected to get a more sedate welcome
back at the Republicans' weekly lunchtime caucus on Tuesday. ``The
last thing any of us want is some kind of hypocritical and
duplicitous kind of activity,'' said Hagel, who was one of McCain's
national campaign chairmen. ``John has differences with some of our
colleagues and they have differences with him.''

WHITE HOUSE E-MAIL FEUD GROWS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By MARC LACEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Rep. Dan Burton, R-Ind., said Sunday that he would
subpoena President Clinton's chief counsel to appear before a
congressional committee this week to explain a computer glitch that
might have kept e-mail messages received by hundreds of White House
officials out of the hands of congressional and other
investigators.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the White House counsel, Beth Nolan, acknowledged in
a letter to Burton, the chairman of the House Government Reform and
Oversight Committee, that a series of problems prevented some of
the e-mail messages received by administration officials from being
searched in 1998 when the White House was responding to various
subpoenas.
</P>
<P>
   But Nolan said it would cost as much as $3 million and take as
long as two years to fix the problem, which she said was caused by
unintentional human error. She added that she did not know the
number of unrecorded e-mail messages sent from outside the White
House or the relevance of their contents.
</P>
<P>
   Nolan also disclosed a previously unknown glitch on the computer
server in the office of Vice President Al Gore. ``We are still in
the process of determining the scope and time period involved,''
she said. Burton said he would pursue that matter at a hearing on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Computer specialists who helped set up the White House computer
system have said that administration officials were slow to fix the
problem. Several contractors employed at the White House also said
that a White House supervisor threatened them with the prospect of
criminal prosecution if they disclosed the problem to anyone.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest glitch was caused, officials say, when a technician
mistakenly labeled an e-mail server as ``MAIL2'' instead of
``Mail2,'' causing the computer to misread the label. A
typographical error in another line of computer code also prevented
certain e-mail messages from being recorded.

WHITE HOUSE SEEKS TO CURB USE OF RITALIN, PROZAC, OTHER SUCH DRUGS
BY CHILDREN 
</HEADLINE>
   (Exclusive)  
(mk) 
 By ROBERT PEAR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The White House will announce a major effort on
Monday to reverse a sharp increase in the number of preschool
children using Ritalin, Prozac and other powerful psychiatric
drugs, administration officials said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the initiative, they said, the government will inform
parents and teachers about the risks of such drugs, the Food and
Drug Administration will develop new drug labels, the National
Institutes of Health will begin a huge nationwide study of Ritalin
use in children under the age of 6, and the White House will hold a
conference this fall on the diagnosis and treatment of mental
illness in very young children.
</P>
<P>
   Hillary Rodham Clinton and federal health officials plan to meet
on Monday with parents, psychiatrists, pediatricians,
psychologists, nurses and social workers to discuss the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Then the administration plans to issue a statement declaring
that ``the use of medication is not generally the first option for
a preschool child with a psychiatric disorder.''
</P>
<P>
   In a study last month in the Journal of the American Medical
Association, researchers reported that there had apparently been a
sharp increase in the number of preschoolers taking psychotropic
drugs, particularly stimulants like Ritalin and antidepressants
like Prozac.
</P>
<P>
   The study caused concern among parents and medical experts
alike, and the administration is now trying to address that
concern.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Dr. Steven E. Hyman, director of the National
Institute of Mental Health, said, ``As a rule of thumb, doctors,
psychologists and social workers should attempt to modify the
behavior of a child and deal with family crises before drugs are
prescribed.''
</P>
<P>
   The government has prepared a new guide for parents on the
treatment of young children with mental disorders. ``When
medication is used, it should not be the only strategy,'' but
should be part of an overall treatment plan, the guide says.
Parents and doctors may want to consider behavioral therapy for the
child, family therapy and other techniques to help manage the
child's symptoms, the document says.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said the initiative was inspired mainly
by Hillary Rodham Clinton, who they said wanted to announce some
immediate steps after seeing the immense public concern about the
use of powerful pills to treat toddlers with emotional and
behavioral disorders.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is running for the U.S. Senate in New York, but White
House officials said it would be cynical to believe that her
motives were only political. They noted that for years she has been
interested in children's issues, including the testing and labeling
of drugs for children. Health officials and medical experts said
the government's concern was well founded.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything Mrs. Clinton does is related to her campaign, but
this initiative has substance too,'' a federal health official
said. ``We want doctors and parents to think about these issues.''
</P>
<P>
   In an editorial in the Journal of the American Medical
Association last month, Dr. Joseph T. Coyle, chairman of the
psychiatry department at Harvard Medical School, said that children
with behavioral disorders were ``increasingly subjected to quick
and inexpensive pharmacologic fixes,'' even though ``there is no
empirical evidence to support psychotropic drug treatment in very
young children.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Ritalin carries a warning that says, ``Ritalin should
not be used in children under 6 years, since safety and efficacy in
this age group have not been established.''
</P>
<P>
   Hyman said that the National Institute of Mental Health would
spend $6 million in the next five years to study whether Ritalin
was safe and effective in treating preschoolers with the impulsive,
aggressive behavior traits known as attention deficit hyperactivity
disorder _ the most commonly diagnosed psychiatric disorder in
children.
</P>
<P>
   In the study, Hyman said, hundreds of girls and boys at research
centers around the country will receive Ritalin, behavior therapy
or some combination of the two.
</P>
<P>
   Hyman said that the problem was not simply that children were
being overmedicated, but that they were not being appropriately
evaluated and treated. ``In some communities,'' he said, ``too few
children are receiving medications, just as in other communities,
too many are getting medications.''
</P>
<P>
   Government scientists said that they recognized that drug
therapy could sometimes provide relief to young children. ``If a
kid is engaged in aggressive behavior, self-mutilation, head
banging, and is otherwise uncontrollable, you should try
medication,'' Hyman said.
</P>
<P>
   Certain drugs are widely prescribed for young children even
though they have not been studied, approved or labeled for such
use. The FDA does not regulate the practice of medicine; after a
drug is approved for one purpose, doctors often prescribe it for
other purposes.
</P>
<P>
   The White House said, for example, that some medications used to
treat depression and anxiety disorders in children, like Paxil,
Prozac and Wellbutrin, were not labeled for pediatric use.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the White House said, Zoloft has been approved to
treat obsessive-compulsive disorder in children 6 and older, while
Luvox has been approved for the same condition in children 8 and
older. But both drugs are used in younger children.
</P>
<P>
   Drug labels often do not specify the proper doses for children.
The White House said that the food and drug agency would soon
specify how drug companies should conduct the research needed to
develop ``pediatric dosage information'' that can be included on
the labels of Ritalin, clonidine and other drugs used to treat
hyperactivity and other attention deficit disorders in young
children.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Jane E. Henney, the commissioner of food and drugs, said
that in the last year her agency had sent letters to seven
companies asking them to study the effects of antidepressants in
young people 7 to 18 years old. The government, she said, is
analyzing ways in which research on younger children can be
scientifically and ethically conducted.
</P>
<P>
   Hyman said: ``Lots of mood disorders and anxiety disorders begin
in childhood. But the younger a child is, the more difficult it is
to make a diagnosis of mental disorder with certainty. It is quite
difficult to diagnose attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in
children under 6 because they are usually not articulate, their
brains and behavior are changing rapidly, and they are very
reactive to their environment.''

WITH RULING NEAR, CIGARETTE MAKERS LOBBYING FOR HELP 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   Cigarette makers, faced with the prospect that a Miami jury may
soon hand out the largest punitive damage award ever, have taken
unprecedented steps in recent weeks to protect themselves from
bankruptcy by persuading tobacco states to pass bills that shield
industry assets.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, a defendant in a civil lawsuit must post cash or a
bond in the full amount of a jury award, plus interest, to avoid
enforcement of that judgment while the defendant appeals. But at
the behest of tobacco producers, legislatures in four states _
Georgia, Kentucky, Virginia and North Carolina _ have recently
passed or are being urged to take up bills that limit the financial
requirements a defendant must meet during the appeal process.
</P>
<P>
   The new measures are not specific to the tobacco industry, but
both cigarette makers and state officials acknowledge that the
industry is behind the legislative push. The effort comes as the
Miami jury, which is hearing a class-action case brought on behalf
of all Florida smokers, nears a critical decision on punitive
damages.
</P>
<P>
   Tobacco company analysts anticipate that the panel may award
record punitive damages against the industry of tens of billions or
even hundreds of billions of dollars _ sums that could bankrupt
most, if not all, cigarette companies if they are required to post
an appeal bond.
</P>
<P>
   Cigarette makers are expected to argue against a bond. But
should they fail, the new measures _ which, depending on the state,
put a limit of $25 million to $100 million on a bond that has to be
posted while punitive damages are appealed _ are intended to buy
the companies time while they fight the Florida verdict.
</P>
<P>
   The largest punitive damages ever awarded appear to be the $5
billion awarded by a jury in Anchorage, Alaska, in 1994 against
Exxon Corp. in connection with the Exxon Valdez oil spill. The
company is still appealing that decision.
</P>
<P>
   Stanley Rosenblatt, a lawyer in Miami who represents smokers in
the Florida case, told a court there last year that he would seek
$100 billion in punitive damages, said Martin Feldman, a tobacco
industry analyst with Salomon Smith Barney who attended that
hearing. Feldman and others said they believed that the tobacco
industry as a group could put up $10 billion to $20 billion while
it appealed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are in totally uncharted water,'' Feldman said.
</P>
<P>
   The bulk of the tobacco industry's operations are in the four
states that have passed or are considering the new measures.
Several legal experts said they believed such laws were
unconstitutional because they were designed to frustrate the
actions of courts in other states. However, such legislation would
still help the companies gain time, because a drawn-out legal fight
would precede any final court decision on the laws.
</P>
<P>
   Tobacco companies have agreed to pay $246 billion over the next
two decades to settle lawsuits brought by state attorneys general
to recover costs spent treating smoking-related ills. But the type
of class-action case under way in Florida is not covered by that
settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Christine Gregoire, the Washington state attorney general, said
producers told regulators late last year that damages in the
Florida case could pose a bankruptcy threat. As a result, she said,
state officials expected this week to hire an expert to represent
them as creditors in the event of a bankruptcy filing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't anticipate any need for them to file bankruptcy, but
we are going to be ready if they do,'' Gregoire said.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Robert P. Kaye of the Florida Circuit Court, who is
presiding over the Miami case, has barred tobacco company officials
and Rosenblatt, the plaintiffs' lawyer, from speaking about the
proceeding. But without commenting on that action, officials of
several tobacco companies said they believed the new measures were
needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to maintain our ability to adequately appeal judgments
without going into bankruptcy first,'' said Tommy Payne, a
spokesman for R.J. Reynolds Tobacco in Winston-Salem, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   Last year the Miami jury found that the United States' biggest
cigarette makers had hidden information about the potential dangers
of their products. That same jury is expected to start
deliberations as early as this week on whether the illnesses of
three plaintiffs selected as representative of class members were
caused by smoking.
</P>
<P>
   Should the jury decide that any one of those people was sickened
by smoking, it will then be asked to award punitive damages on
behalf of the entire class. While that figure is unknown,
Rosenblatt has estimated that 300,000 or more people in the state
might qualify as members of the class action, which is known as the
Engle case.
</P>
<P>
   The timing of the punitive damages is significant because it
would come before compensatory damages are awarded to the entire
class. But given last year's findings against the tobacco
producers, many analysts and observers of the case expect the panel
to award a record figure.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is anyone's best guess,'' said Bonnie Herzog, an analyst
with Credit Suisse First Boston. ``It could range in the hundreds
of billions. The industry would argue for a much lower number.''
</P>
<P>
   Under Florida law, a defendant who appeals must post 115 percent
of an award once a judge enters that verdict, a process that takes
about 30 days. Cigarette manufacturers are expected to argue for
any award to be stayed while they exhaust their appeals. They are
also expected to argue that compensatory damages to all class
members should first be determined, a process that could take
years, before a punitive judgment is entered.
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear what action Rosenblatt might take, because a
large award could push most, if not all, cigarette makers into
bankruptcy, an action that would freeze all litigation against
them.
</P>
<P>
   Most cigarette makers have said they believe that any award in
the Florida case can be overturned on appeal, because many courts
have dismissed other class-action suits against them. It is the
prospect of keeping their businesses intact during that appeal that
is behind the push for the new laws.

 UNDATED: new laws.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   This month, Gov. James Gilmore of Virginia signed a bill that
would place a $25 million limit on a bond during the appeal of
punitive damages. Lila Young, a spokesman for Gilmore, said that
lobbyists for Philip Morris U.S.A., which has its tobacco
headquarters in Richmond, Va., had urged Gilmore to back the bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``The success of the tobacco corporations has a tremendous
impact on the vitality of our state,'' said Young, who added that
large punitive damages in the Florida case could ``cause disaster
to our economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Peggy Roberts, a spokeswoman for Philip Morris, declined to
comment. But in a recent filing with the Securities and Exchange
Commission, Philip Morris, the nation's biggest cigarette maker,
said that ``in a worst-case scenario, it is possible that a
judgment for punitive damages could be entered in an amount not
capable of being bonded.''
</P>
<P>
   Before signing the bill, Gilmore added an ``emergency'' clause
making it retroactive to Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
   In Georgia, a bill similar to the new Virginia law has passed
both houses of the state legislature, and Gov. Roy Barnes is
expected to sign it soon. In Kentucky a bill placing a limit of
$100 million on an appeal bond has passed the state Senate. The
state's House judiciary committee is expected to begin action on it
this week.
</P>
<P>
   Each tobacco company is pushing bills in states where it has
major operations. For example, Brown &AMP; Williamson, which has
headquarters in Louisville, Ky., and a major cigarette plant in
Macon, Ga., has been promoting bills in those states, said Mark
Smith, a company spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   In North Carolina, the principal proponents of the legislation
are R.J. Reynolds and Lorillard Tobacco, which along with Liggett
Group have headquarters there. Because the state legislature does
not meet until May, both R.J. Reynolds and Lorillard have been
calling for an emergency session to consider an appeal bond limit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Essentially, we are not seeking anything different than what
our neighboring states have enacted,'' said Martin Orlowsky, chief
executive of Lorillard, which is based in Greensboro.
</P>
<P>
   Tad Boggs, a spokesman for Gov. Jim Hunt, said that cigarette
makers had contacted Hunt and that ``they feel very strongly about
this.'' He said no decision had been made about an emergency
session of the legislature.
</P>
<P>
   John Coffee, a law professor at Columbia University, said he
believed the new laws would be overturned because they appear to
violate the ``full faith and credit'' clause of the U.S.
Constitution, which requires the authorities in one state to
enforce court judgments from another state.
</P>
<P>
   Keith Teel, a lawyer for Brown &AMP; Williamson, said that cigarette
makers, would if necessary argue that the Constitution does not
cover jury decisions in cases where a court has failed to protect
the legal rights of a defendant.
</P>
<P>
   Feldman, the financial analyst, said he expected the laws to be
overturned. ``This is about time buying,'' he said.

<P>
   KILLEEN, Texas _ Gathered deep inside the nation's largest
military base, a small group of government officials, special
investigators and private lawyers Sunday watched an unusual and
controversial simulation intended to help determine whether the FBI
has been truthful about its role in the fatal 1993 Branch Davidian
standoff.
</P>
<P>
   The exercise, which was ordered by a federal judge and carried
out at Fort Hood, was designed to examine unproven allegations that
FBI agents fired into the Branch Davidian's Mount Carmel compound
before it burned to the ground on April 19, 1993. In all, about 80
men, women and children died that day, including the leader of the
religious sect, David Koresh.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, the special infrared video taken of Sunday's
simulation was supposed to be released to the public. But Sunday
morning, U.S. District Judge Walter Smith, who is presiding over a
wrongful death lawsuit brought against the government by survivors
and descendants of the Branch Davidians, unexpectedly sealed the
videos, precluding any public viewing.
</P>
<P>
   FBI officials said agency experts who conducted a preliminary
review Sunday evening had said that the videos vindicated their
long-held position that they had never fired on April 19. Michael
Caddell, the lead lawyer for the plaintiffs in the wrongful death
lawsuit, is scheduled to hold a news conference Monday morning in
Houston after his experts have concluded reviewing the videos.
</P>
<P>
   The lack of public access creates the possibility that both
sides in the case will release conflicting opinions without any
public review of the videos. At a news conference held after the
simulation, both Caddell and one of the lead lawyers for the
government said they had not anticipated the judge's action.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the court's decision,'' said U.S. Attorney Mike
Bradford, one of the main lawyers for the government in the civil
case. ``I don't think either side really solicited it.'' For years,
controversy has surrounded aerial infrared videos taken by the FBI
on the day of the fire. The video shows unexplained ``flashes.''
Caddell and other government critics contend that the flashes are
from FBI agents' firing into the compound. The simulation Sunday
was designed to capture gunfire on a similar infrared video and
then determine if similar flashes result.
</P>
<P>
   The exercise began about 11 a.m. and lasted about three hours.
In addition to former Sen. John Danforth and Smith, the group of
about 20 observers included representatives from the Department of
Justice, the FBI, Texas Rangers and private lawyers representing
the plaintiffs. They watched a series of drills performed by six
postal inspectors and two Army soldiers dressed in uniforms similar
to those worn by FBI agents on the day of the fire.
</P>
<P>
   First, the eight participants fired different weapons from prone
and kneeling positions. Then, they slowly advanced to a prescribed
firing line, where they fired a series of single shots followed by
shorts bursts and long bursts of automatic gunfire. They repeated
the exercise four times as the FBI Nightstalker airplane and a
British Navy helicopter took turns filming from different
altitudes.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, an armored vehicle was driven beside a field
littered with debris like twisted aluminum, broken glass, pools of
water. Each aspect of the exercise _ the gunfire and the armored
vehicle _ was intended to test the conflicting theories about the
flashes. Caddell said he thought the staged gunfire would create
identical flashes on the FLIR tape put forth by the plaintiffs and
by the government. Caddell has contended that the flashes represent
gunfire while the government had said the flashes, or ``glints,''
were merely reflections from debris scattered around the Mount
Carmel compound.
</P>
<P>
   Caddell said secrecy and security were at a premium. The
observers were driven by bus for nearly an hour to a location
within Fort Hood. For security, he said, several military vehicles
were positioned nearby. Smith denied a motion by several news media
organizations, including The New York Times, to witness the test.
There had also been concerns that cold weather might force a
postponement or possibly skew Sunday's results. But the
temperatures eventually pushed above the agreed upon minimum of 65
degrees. On the day of the fire at Mount Carmel, temperatures
reached 85 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all pleased,'' Caddell said of the test. ``When you
think about coordinating weather, equipment and personnel, we're
all pleased that we got it done.''
</P>
<P>
   In December, Smith granted a plaintiff's motion to hold the
demonstration and ordered that Danforth's staff supervise the
exercise. Initially, government lawyers had fought against the
motion, contending that similar FLIR technology no longer existed.
But when Danforth's located such a camera in Britain, and when it
became clear that both the judge and Danforth favored the exercise,
the government reversed itself and consented.

</P>
<P>
   Regardless of the results of the exercise, the Waco controversy
seems likely to rage on, particularly for those who believe the
Davidians were innocent victims. Clive Doyle, a surviving Branch
Davidian not represented by Caddell, criticized Caddell for not
taking a hard enough line against the government. Doyle and other
survivors are represented by Ramsey Clark, the former U.S. attorney
general, while Caddell represents many descendants of those who
died in the fire. Judge Smith appointed Caddell as the lead lawyer
for the plaintiffs in the civil case.
</P>
<P>
   Doyle also said he had ``no confidence in the test because I
believe the test is being done to try to justify and prove the
government line rather than the plaintiffs.''
</P>
<P>
   Early Sunday morning, before the test, Caddell signaled his
likely approach to the civil trial when he told reporters that he
did not believe the deaths of the Branch Davidians resulted from an
overarching government conspiracy but rather from the improper
actions of supervisory agents at the scene.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that may disappoint some people,'' he said. ``But this
is not a big conspiracy, it's a small conspiracy. There were a
handful of people on April 19 who took matters into their own hands
and disobeyed the orders of the attorney general and the FBI
leadership. Those people have to be held accountable.''

In his forthcoming memoir, ``The Measure of a Man''
(HarperSanFrancisco; $26),  &UR; Sidney Poitier &LR;  describes
meeting &UR; Spencer Tracy &LR;  and  &UR; Katharine Hepburn &LR;  just before the
making of ``Guess Who's Coming to Dinner?''
</P>
<P>
   In the movie (set in San Francisco), Poitier plays the African
American fiance of Tracy and Hepburn's daughter; in 1968, it was
considered daring social commentary.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was taken to Miss Hepburn's house so she could check me
out,'' writes Poitier. ``When I arrived at her door and that door
opened, she looked at me and didn't say a word and didn't crack a
smile. But that was her M.O. ... I could tell that I was being
sized up every time I spoke, every response I made. I could imagine
a plus and a minus column, notations in her mind. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``The truth of the matter is that the formation of this business
relationship was almost a literal `pre-enactment' of the situation
in the film we were about to make. The black man was coming for
dinner, and we didn't usually do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Poitier knew that both Hepburn and Tracy were ``ordinary, decent
folks. And in fact they turned out to be that _ and a hell of a lot
more. But they were anxious early on, for good reason, and they
simply had to find out about me.''

<P>
   &QL; 
In his forthcoming memoir, ``The Measure of a Man''
(HarperSanFrancisco; $26),  &UR; Sidney Poitier &LR;  describes
meeting &UR; Spencer Tracy &LR;  and  &UR; Katharine Hepburn &LR;  just before the
making of ``Guess Who's Coming to Dinner?''
</P>
<P>
   In the movie (set in San Francisco), Poitier plays the African
American fiance of Tracy and Hepburn's daughter; in 1968, it was
considered daring social commentary.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was taken to Miss Hepburn's house so she could check me
out,'' writes Poitier. ``When I arrived at her door and that door
opened, she looked at me and didn't say a word and didn't crack a
smile. But that was her M.O. ... I could tell that I was being
sized up every time I spoke, every response I made. I could imagine
a plus and a minus column, notations in her mind. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``The truth of the matter is that the formation of this business
relationship was almost a literal `pre-enactment' of the situation
in the film we were about to make. The black man was coming for
dinner, and we didn't usually do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Poitier knew that both Hepburn and Tracy were ``ordinary, decent
folks. And in fact they turned out to be that _ and a hell of a lot
more. But they were anxious early on, for good reason, and they
simply had to find out about me.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   WILMINGTON, Del. _ On a tour of low-income housing here, Leon N.
Weiner, a prominent developer, turned to the senior senator from
Delaware, William Roth, and raised an increasingly familiar
question.
</P>
<P>
   ``People ask me, `Is Senator Roth, at his age, ready to make
another six-year commitment?''' said Weiner, who will turn 80 in
May. ``I'm a year older than you are, senator, and I wouldn't make
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Without missing a beat, Roth, seeking a sixth six-year term this
fall, shot back with a smile to his still active constituent:
``Knowing you, Leon, that's a lot of baloney.''
</P>
<P>
   As chairman of the powerful Senate Finance Committee, Roth would
be in a position to shepherd some of Capitol Hill's hottest
legislation this year, like a China trade bill, tax relief and
changes in health-care law.
</P>
<P>
   The longest-serving politician in Delaware history, Roth has
made a career of getting things done by working with Democrats,
like Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York, the panel's ranking
member.
</P>
<P>
   But at 78 (Roth turns 79 in July), facing a stiff re-election
fight from Delaware's popular outgoing Democratic governor, Thomas
Carper, Roth has become perhaps the Republicans' most vulnerable
Senate candidate in campaign 2000. Since last fall the polls have
been showing Carper, 53, with a 10-point lead.
</P>
<P>
   In this state of 750,000 people, which takes pride in its
moderate traditions and civil campaigns, voters seemed conflicted
over the choice between Roth's experience and influence and the
younger, more dynamic Carper.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm torn,'' said Weiner, a Democrat. ``Bill Roth is a sincere,
decent and honest guy. If he were a Democrat, I'd support the hell
out of him. But what really bothers me are some of his Republican
colleagues, like Jesse Helms and Phil Gramm.''
</P>
<P>
   Over a lunch of cream of crab soup and Caesar salad in Dover
while on a daylong swing through the state, Roth defended his
decision to run again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I can make a difference, both because of my seniority
and chairmanship,'' said Roth, a mild-mannered legislator who
revels in being low-key. ``This is the most exciting, challenging
time to serve. I can have a real, direct impact on those key
issues.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he was fit, despite a spill he took recently at a White
House meeting on China trade. ``My foot fell asleep.''
</P>
<P>
   Because the Republican party has term limits for Senate
chairmanships, he would have to give up the Finance Committee in
2002, undercutting his argument for seniority. Roth, a former
chairman of the less prestigious Governmental Affairs Committee,
could head another panel.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats have already been counting Roth's seat as theirs.
``Clout is the political argument of last resort,'' said James
Jordan, political director of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Yet from the banking hub of Wilmington to the farmlands of
southern Delaware, the issues facing the Finance Committee
resounded with residents here, underscoring Roth's pivotal role.
</P>
<P>
   When the Senate returns on Monday from a weeklong recess, it
will take up a popular bill that Roth supports that would allow
most Social Security recipients, for the first time, to earn as
much money as they wanted without sacrificing any retirement
benefits.
</P>
<P>
   After an awards ceremony at Beebe Medical Center in Lewes, Del.,
Peggy Paul, a 64-year-old technician, came up to the senator to
urge the measure's passage. ``I would have to cut back and I want
to continue working,'' said Paul, who would lose nearly $8,000 in
Social Security benefits under the current law when she turned 65.
</P>
<P>
   The committee has also planned to begin hearings soon on
legislation to grant China permanent normal trading relations, a
vital step for Beijing's entry into the World Trade Organization.
Proponents were hoping a strong vote by the panel would build
momentum for accord in the House, where the prospects were dimmer.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, lower Chinese tariffs would benefit
Delaware farmers as well as the banks and international chemical
companies in the state's northern reaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people don't understand it doesn't affect our
markets,'' Roth said. ``They already have access to our markets.
What it does is give us access to their markets. If we don't get
access, then we're handicapping ourselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be a major fiasco if we do not act on this,'' he
said. ``A vote on normal trading relations may not only be the most
important vote of the year but of the decade.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Answering critics of permanent trade status, Roth said opening
Chinese markets would also enhance democratic values there. ``The
more they trade, the more they tend to be guided by rule of law,''
Roth said. ``It's a gamble, but it's the best gamble we have
available.''
</P>
<P>
   Roth, perhaps best known for the Kemp-Roth tax cut of 1981 and
the tax-free savings accounts that bear his name, has been backing
an array of tax cuts, even though their public appeal seems to be
waning in the booming economy.
</P>
<P>
   The senator has backed Gov. George W. Bush's proposed tax cut of
$483 billion over five years starting in 2002. But House
Republicans were able to muster backing only for a smaller package,
and prospects in the Senate were unclear.
</P>
<P>
   ``Benefits are going to those who are paying the taxes, but a
lot of our proposals have been intended to help the working
people,'' Roth said.
</P>
<P>
   Which was why Republicans this year were slicing up last year's
big tax package into more targeted proposals. The Finance Committee
would soon be considering a Republican-sponsored bill that would
reduce taxes for married couples.
</P>
<P>
   Cutting taxes has not resonated with all Delaware voters.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Marcozzi, a 61-year-old delicatessen owner, said he liked
Roth's three decades of experience, but he wanted to hear from
``the other guy'' _ Carper _ because he was frustrated that
Republican tax cuts have been skewed toward the wealthy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether it's Democrats or Republicans, a little guy like me
pays a lot of taxes,'' said Marcozzi, a Republican. ``It seems the
poor can't pay and the very rich don't do their part.''
</P>
<P>
   Roth has also played an important role in forging coalitions on
health-care legislation. In June 1997 he presided over late-night
back-room negotiations that produced a bipartisan agreement to
create a new health insurance program for children in low-income
families. It was part of comprehensive budget legislation that the
Finance Committee approved by a vote of 20-0.
</P>
<P>
   And it has not gone unnoticed here that Roth supported an
increase last year in Medicare's minimum payments for Pap tests, to
$14.60 from $7.15 a test, ensuring greater access to health
screening for female patients.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Senator Roth was not the Finance Committee chairman, I
don't think we'd have gotten the Pap smear issue resolved,'' said
Dr. V. Raman Sukumar, chief of pathology at Beebe Medical Center,
and a registered independent. ``Just this one issue will make me
think of voting for him.''

BUSH NOT WIDELY KNOWN AS A REFORMER TEXAS  
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr. and JIM YARDLEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ With the long march to November under way, Gov.
George W. Bush is arguing that his record in Texas proves he is
best suited to bring reform to Washington. He has even coined a
campaign slogan: ``A Reformer With Results.''
</P>
<P>
   Without question, Bush has been a popular governor, yet he is
not widely viewed in Texas as a reformer. Unlike Sen. John McCain
of Arizona, who bucked his own party on issues like campaign
finance and tobacco legislation, Bush is not as confrontational,
nor is he usually identified with sweeping change. His record is
largely built on compromise and his ability to build coalitions
with conservative Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's boldest effort at reform _ his 1997 plan to overhaul the
state's outdated tax code _ failed badly. The governor won plaudits
for his courage but ultimately could not leverage the ``political
capital'' he has promised to use if elected president: He could not
win the support of enough lawmakers in his own party.
</P>
<P>
   On other issues, consumer advocates complain that he often
describes as ``reforms'' actions benefiting the powerful Texas
business interests that have supported him, rather than consumers.
On the campaign trail, for example, he has portrayed himself as a
leader in reforming health maintenance organizations, yet he
resisted two important pieces of patients' rights legislation. And
his claims about the consumer benefits of tort reform _ a package
of bills that sought to curb large jury awards in civil cases _ are
disputed.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's an incremental-change specialist,'' said Bruce Buchanan,
a political scientist at the University of Texas, ``sometimes in a
partisan way, like tort reform, which is a big business issue,
sometimes in a bipartisan way, such as small changes in
education.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, Bush has found success, particularly during his
first legislative session, on initiatives he describes as reforms,
like changes in tort laws, stricter welfare rules, a crackdown on
juvenile crime, and giving more local control to public school
districts. Those efforts won Bush praise from lawmakers in both
parties, but all were popular issues before he took office.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tort reform and all those things, we were already working on
them. It was smart politically for him to take advantage of that,''
said Pete Laney, the Democratic Texas House speaker and one of the
key legislative leaders who forged a bond with Bush early on. ``He
had all those things going on during his campaign, and that was
great politics for him to use those.''
</P>
<P>
   Laney added that `reform' means very different things to
different people. Some of the 1995 tort reforms, for example,
reversed changes made during the `reform' legislative sessions of
the early 1970s, he said. `Reform is pillage and plunder if you're
against it, and it's good government if you're for it,' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Bartlett, a Bush spokesman, said the governor played crucial
roles in the passage of reforms he campaigned on in 1994, as well
as later reform initiatives. Some, like tort reform, might have
died had Gov. Ann Richards, a Democrat, been re-elected, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is able to reach across party lines to bring people
together,'' Bartlett said, adding that reforms ``are the main
reason he almost got 70 percent of the vote for his re-election.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush declared tort reform an ``emergency'' when he took office
in 1995. Business groups had laid the groundwork for the
legislation but Bush's strong support was essential. And many of
these groups were among the governor's biggest campaign
contributors.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers passed seven bills, including a centerpiece measure
that reduced the punitive damages for which businesses and other
defendants might be liable if a jury determined they had committed
wrongdoing. At the same time, the bill raised the level of proof
plaintiffs must show to win such damages.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said the laws helped rid Texas of ``junk and frivolous''
lawsuits, but others say the changes shifted the judicial balance.
</P>
<P>
   Reggie James, director of the Southwest regional office of
Consumers Union, in Austin, said, ``While it was portrayed as a
fight between honest businesses and greedy trial lawyers, the fight
was really about businesses not wanting to be held accountable when
they harm consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush has credited tort reform with saving consumers and
businesses nearly $3 billion in insurance premiums, with the
biggest part coming from auto liability rates. But the mechanism
for those savings has come not from Bush's proposals but from a
provision introduced in 1995 by a Democratic legislator requiring
state officials to adjust rates ahead of time to account for the
effects of tort reform, like lower settlements for injury claims.
</P>
<P>
   And some former senior Texas insurance officials contend that
the $3 billion claim is false anyway, and that the biggest
beneficiaries of the new laws are insurers.
</P>
<P>
   ``How they can continue to claim $3 billion in tort reform
savings is baffling to me,'' said Birny Birnbaum, an Austin
consumer advocate who served as the Texas Department of Insurance's
chief economist during the administrations of both Richards and
Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Data from the state show that overall statewide premiums for
auto liability insurance stayed flat following tort reform, before
a slight dip in 1998. But insurers' profits soared because their
annual incurred losses were, on average, lowered by more than $600
million through 1998, the most recent year for which figures were
available. Five years ago, insurers incurred 70.1 cents in losses
for every dollar in premiums; in 1998, losses were 58.2 cents for
every dollar.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Montemayor, the current insurance commissioner and a Bush
appointee, said better driving habits and safer cars had played a
larger role than tort reform in raising insurance company profits.
But he acknowledged that insurers probably had received some
benefits from tort reform in 1996 and 1997, until rates were rolled
back more the next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were a little timid on the front end of this in terms of
the rate rollback because we really did not have a good feel for
the effects of tort reform,'' Montemayor said. But he added that
later ``we corrected that, and more than made up for that.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Two years after tort reform, Bush, arguing that the state taxing
system was unfair and outdated, brushed away concerns that he could
hurt himself politically and proposed the biggest restructuring in
more than three decades.
</P>
<P>
   Texas has property and sales taxes but no broad-based income
tax, and while corporations pay a form of business income tax,
partnerships do not. Bush contended that the state's booming
service-based economy was not paying its fair share, while
homeowners and industries with heavy capital spending paid too
much. He also wanted a more stable and reliable source of school
financing.
</P>
<P>
   His plan was to reduce property taxes, and pay for it mostly by
raising sales taxes and establishing a 1.25 percent tax on a
business' net income, depreciation and labor costs, minus its
capital expenditures, with the first $500,000 exempt.
</P>
<P>
   The plan drew fire from professional groups, including doctors
and lawyers, as well as retailers and other businesses with high
labor costs and low profit margins.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Among the expected winners were petrochemical companies, oil
refiners and other capital-intensive industries _ not a surprise,
perhaps, since Bush's new business tax tracked closely a proposal
offered to the governor by Charls Walker, a former Washington
lobbyist who ran a tax-advocacy organization financed mostly by
capital-intensive industries that favored the Bush plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was essentially a hidden sales tax,'' said Dick Lavine, a
senior analyst with the Center for Public Policy Priorities, a
nonprofit research group in Austin representing low-income
taxpayers. Overall, he said, the plan would take ``an already
regressive system and compound it.''
</P>
<P>
   And other, more powerful people were skeptical. The late
Democratic lieutenant governor, Bob Bullock, described the plan as
``dead on arrival.''
</P>
<P>
   State lawmakers junked the Bush proposal and assembled an
alternative the governor endorsed, but Bush was later unable to
persuade enough Senate Republicans to vote his way as legislators
tried to reconcile differences between the House and Senate
versions. Late in the session, Bush salvaged a $1 billion property
tax cut financed by the state's budget surplus. In 1999, Bush made
no effort to resurrect tax reform, instead seeking _ and getting _
more tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bush could have put his political capital on the line'' to get
the tax plan passed, said Bill White, the former chairman of the
Texas Democratic Party, noting that another governor might have
threatened to campaign against dissenting legislators or made a
broader appeal to the public. But he didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Bartlett, the Bush spokesman, said: ``When times are relatively
calm, it's difficult to persuade people to change. He understood
that going in, and he was ultimately proud of what we did
accomplish.''
</P>
<P>
   It is the tax cuts, not his failure at tax reform, that Bush
mentions on the campaign trail. He has also taken to boasting about
his role in reforming health care in Texas, a role that many in
Austin say is greatly exaggerated.
</P>
<P>
   One commercial for Bush says that while Congress deadlocked over
health care legislation, ``he passed a patients' bill of rights.''
But people involved in the process note that in 1995 Bush vetoed
the first Texas patient protection bill, and two years later he
considered vetoing the most groundbreaking HMO bill that Texas
lawmakers had debated.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he wants to say, `I reformed the tort system,' then that's
fair game,'' said James, the consumer advocate, ``but if he wants
to say he reformed health care, that's a different animal. The
reforms happened despite him, not because of him.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The 1995 patient protection bill included provisions requiring
annual report cards for health maintenance organizations and forced
HMOs to provide necessary emergency-room care. Today, Bush says he
vetoed the bill because of unfair exemptions it gave certain HMOs.
But in his veto proclamation he also mentioned other concerns:
``numerous new regulations on managed care organizations,''
including HMOs, and higher costs for employers.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, the governor instructed the insurance commissioner to
draft rules that covered much of what the bill did. Consumer groups
objected strongly to the veto, but they praised the commissioner's
rules. The issue resurfaced in 1997, when the legislature codified
those rules and passed an expanded patient-protection package.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest battle, though, was over a bill to make Texas the
first state to allow patients to sue for malpractice HMOs that deny
necessary medical care. Bush warned of a veto, and his resistance
brought his staff into conflict with one of his staunchest
Republican allies, Sen. David Sibley, the bill's sponsor.
</P>
<P>
   On the Senate floor, Sibley complained about the governor's
staff, saying, I can't make them happy no matter what I do, unless
I completely gut the bill.'' Sibley did not back away from that
comment in an interview, but he described Bush as a leader on
health care issues, saying he was supportive of the other
patient-protection measures passed in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Some other legislators involved have different recollections.
Patricia Gray, a Democratic House member who sponsored a bill
requiring HMOs to allow women direct access to their
obstetrician-gynecologist without having to first see a
gatekeeper'' physician _ a measure Bush has touted as a key HMO
reform _does not recall the governor, or his staff, providing any
help on the bill. I have no recollection of him being involved
whatsoever,'' Gray said.
</P>
<P>
   That bill's senate sponsor, Florence Shapiro, a Republican, said
Bush's office did weigh in while the bill was in a senate
committee, and that he was supportive.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, lawmakers overwhelmingly approved the right-to-sue
bill, and Bush, who might have faced an embarrassing override vote
had he vetoed the bill, allowed it to become law without his
signature. His spokesman, Bartlett, said Bush became more
comfortable with the bill after provisions were added reducing the
likelihood of a flood of new lawsuits, including a requirement that
disputes first be reviewed by an independent panel.
</P>
<P>
   Kim Ross, chief lobbyist for the Texas Medical Association,
described Bush's evolution on health care issues as a ``baptism by

   JERUSALEM _ A recent newspaper cartoon illustrates the anxiety
here that something will befall Pope John Paul II on his six-day
pilgrimage to the Holy Land, which begins on Tuesday. The cartoon
shows Prime Minister Ehud Barak of Israel encouraging the pope to
step out onto a bridge that extends into the Sea of Galilee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before we cross, let us pray,'' the pope says, hesitant.
</P>
<P>
   The image recalls a disaster that Israelis cannot forget _ when
a temporary bridge built for athletes in an international meet in
1997 collapsed, leaving four dead and scores injured. And last
week, when a stiff wind caused structural damage on the stage where
the pope will preside over a huge outdoor Mass, it sent a shudder
through many Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   ``The collapse of a pillar even before anyone has stepped foot
on the stage is a sign from heaven that your appeal to the Jewish
people for forgiveness may have been premature,'' Yoel Marcus wrote
to the pope in a tongue-in-cheek column on Friday in the newspaper
Haaretz.
</P>
<P>
   While the religious and political dimensions of the pope's
six-day trip here are large, the logistical and security
preparations by both Israel and the Palestinian Authority are
unprecedented. The visit also requires an unparalleled cooperation
between the two governments, which so far, despite the minor
sniping of Jerusalem officials on both sides, has gone smoothly.
</P>
<P>
   A key concern of security officials was allayed last week when
the Palestinian police, acting on a tip from the Israelis, captured
two Islamic fundamentalist terror suspects with 88 pounds of
explosives. Having fled an Israeli raid on their hideout, during
which several of their colleagues were killed, they were considered
an at-large risk for an imminent attack.
</P>
<P>
   Security officials have not received specific threats against
the pope himself, although a tiny group of Jewish extremists is
aggressively antagonistic to his visit, the first state visit here
by a pope.
</P>
<P>
   The general potential for violence in the area is what concerns
security officials, who note that the pope's trip touches on all
the most sensitive issues here, from the Holocaust to the
sovereignty of Jerusalem to the right of return of Palestinian
refugees.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a real threat because of the security situation in
Israel,'' a senior security officer said. ``And the basic
assumption is that the pope is a target.''

WOODS ADDS TO HIS MOMENTUM AND CONFIDENCE, AND EARNINGS 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By CLIFTON BROWN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ORLANDO, Fla. _ The story line was familiar, and so was the
outcome. Tiger Woods protects Sunday leads like a miser protecting
his money. Davis Love III must have felt like a rock climber,
trying to scale a mountain that kept getting steeper and steeper.
Love never made it to the top, falling once again to Woods, who has
dominated Love and dominated golf for more than a year.
</P>
<P>
   Add the Bay Hill Invitational to Woods' growing list of
victories. And with next month's Masters fast approaching, Woods is
marching toward Augusta with more momentum and confidence than
ever.
</P>
<P>
   Winning for the third time this year, and for the seventh time
on tour in his last 10 starts, Woods cruised to a four-stroke
victory over Love to win at Bay Hill, the tournament hosted by
another golf great, Arnold Palmer. Woods shot 70 Sunday to finish
18 under par for the tournament (269), comfortably ahead of Love
(14 under par), who shot 72, and Skip Kendall (13 under par), who
had an impressive final-round 67 to finish third.
</P>
<P>
   When Woods begins Sunday holding a lead, he almost always ends
his day holding a trophy. Sunday was the 13th consecutive time that
Woods has won a tour event when he has either held or shared the
lead after 54 holes. Woods does not just close tournaments, he
slams the door. And Sunday, the door slammed in Love's face.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes it that much more special to beat one of the top
players in the world,'' said Woods, who has won 18 times in 76
career starts on tour, almost once ever four times he has played.
</P>
<P>
   The $540,000 first-place check increased Woods' 2000 earnings to
more than $2.58 million. Starting the day with a two-stroke lead
over Love, Woods led the final round from start to finish,
dictating the day with his potent driving ability. Woods hit tee
shot after tee shot onto the fairway, keeping constant pressure on
Love to make birdies because Woods refused to make mistakes. Woods
only made two birdies, but he did not make any bogeys, taking the
conservative approach on a windy, overcast day when scoring was
difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Whenever Woods did miss a green, his brilliant short game took
over. Woods missed a combined 13 greens in regulation during
Saturday and Sunday, yet he never made a bogey. If he needed to
make a long putt for par, he made it. If he needed to get up and
down from a bunker, he did.
</P>
<P>
   Everything about Woods' game appears to be in prime condition _
his driving, his distance control, his short game and his putting.
In six starts this year, Woods has three victories and two seconds,
with his only non top-10 finish coming at the Nissan Open, when he
tied for 18th place. When Woods arrives at a tournament, opponents
no longer wonder if he will contend. They expect him to. And Love,
one of the game's longest hitters, had the humbling experience of
being easily out-driven by Woods.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's playing everybody's A game every week,'' said
Love, who lost to Woods at the Andersen Consulting Match Play
Championship last month. ``Mentally now, he's got the advantage. On
No. 4, he hit it 50 yards by me. It was just astounding. There's
very few guys that I get out there with and say I cannot keep up. I
don't ever expect to hit one by Tiger unless he pops it up.''
</P>
<P>
   Love ran into trouble early, when he bogeyed No. 2 and No. 3 to
fall four strokes behind. At No. 3, Love pulled his second shot
into the water, the kind of blunder he could not afford to make.
</P>
<P>
   Woods increased his lead to five strokes when he birdied No. 5,
and from there the outcome looked almost certain. Love did close to
within two strokes with birdies on No. 5, No. 10, and No. 11, but
Woods responded with a birdie at the par 5 No. 12, then Love
bogeyed No. 14 with a three-putt to fall four strokes behind with
five holes to play. Woods simply does not lose leads like that
often.
</P>
<P>
   One of the only things that went wrong for Woods Sunday is that
university he attended, Stanford, lost to Love's school, North
Carolina, in the National Collegiate Athletic Association men's
basketball tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least I can enjoy that,'' Love said.
</P>
<P>
   Next up for Woods is The Players Championship, which begins
Thursday in Ponte Vedra Beach, Fla. Woods will then take a week off
to prepare for the Masters (April 6-9), where he will obviously be
the favorite. Everything Woods has done this year has been directed
toward preparing for the Masters, the first of the year's four
majors. And at this point, Woods looks more than ready.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm heading in the right direction for Augusta,'' Woods said.
``Hopefully next week I'll have some signs that I'm actually
playing a little bit better.'' &QL;

THE KNICKS' TURNAROUND BECOMES A TALL TALE 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By SELENA ROBERTS    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ One at a time, the Knicks' big men would duck around
the back of Shaquille O'Neal only to disappear behind the Lakers'
perfect hide-and-seek prop. One at a time, they would plant a
forearm in O'Neal's waist and stick a body on his frame only to be
brushed off like lint from his lapel.
</P>
<P>
   Here was O'Neal, as ominous as a funnel cloud, and the Knicks
were trying to stop his force with a screen door. Here was Coach
Jeff Van Gundy's plan: He would send help once O'Neal began his
fe-fi-fo-fum moves through the paint, but he would not waste his
manpower, at the risk of leaving the other stars from Hollywood
open.
</P>
<P>
   For a while, the execution of this strategy had the Knicks giddy
with confidence. For a while, the celebrity-spiked crowd at Madison
Square Garden could imagine a bicoastal finals without shuddering.
</P>
<P>
   Then, Kobe Bryant snapped his fingers on their daydream. As he
started to zip around Latrell Sprewell on his way to
flashbulb-drenched dunks, after Bryant blew the tip of his index
finger like a gunslinger at one point, Phil Jackson could find more
comfort than ever over his career choice.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, Jackson's tandem topped whatever his coaching foil
from New York could come up with as a response. Sunday, Jackson's
new version of Michael Jordan and Scottie Pippen (O'Neal and
Bryant) took over the game in the second half and delivered a 92-85
puncture wound to the Knicks' egos. Next to O'Neal's 43 points,
Bryant added 17 of his 24 in the second half to take control of a
game the Knicks lost once the third quarter began.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an opportunity for us to make a statement and we fell
short,'' said Sprewell, who was helpless to defend against Bryant's
playground moves. ``Kobe made the big shots, got some big rebounds.
He came through for them. It was a frustrating day.''
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks could not unearth one of their big stars to counter.
With O'Neal running out to alter the high-arching shot of his
counterpart, Patrick Ewing finished 6 for 20 with 12 points. With
Bryant irritating Sprewell's rhythm, the Knicks high-energy forward
mustered only 13 points on a 5 for 13 day. With a listless second
half, Allan Houston managed only 20 points after scoring 13 in a
riveting first half.
</P>
<P>
   That is when the Knicks had a 44-43 lead. That is when they were
shutting down everyone but O'Neal. He had 24 points but the rest of
the Lakers were 7 for 26.
</P>
<P>
   ``He made everyone who guarded him look 6-feet tall,'' Sprewell
said. ``He is just a huge and dominant player to defend against.
But the thing about him is, he has a surprisingly soft touch. He
was hitting that jump hook, and made most of his free throws. With
the way he has been playing this year _ and he's probably the
m.v.p. right now _ we knew we had to stop everyone else.''
</P>
<P>
   Once the third quarter began, the Knicks' euphoria over that
potential was replaced by dismay. The Lakers went on a 13-5 run to
take a 7-point lead on the strength of free throws by Bryant and
O'Neal. By the end of the third quarter, the Lakers had a 69-58
lead after taking 13 fouls shots to the Knicks' 3 attempts.
</P>
<P>
   ``You saw the game,'' said Ewing, who did not go to the foul
line once on the day. ``They got the calls. We didn't. That's the
way it goes.''
</P>
<P>
   The way the third quarter ended was an omen. As Bryant spun
through the lane, he flipped up a wild driving layup from the seat
of his pants. And it fell right into the net as the third-quarter
buzzer went off.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of digging deep into their assertiveness training guide,
the Knicks continued to counter with jump shots even after O'Neal
picked up his fourth foul a minute into the fourth quarter. When
they did drive to the basket, it was not emphatic. Several times
during the day, Marcus Camby missed layups when a sure dunk seemed
like an option if not for his sore right knee.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to make any excuses,'' said Camby, who had eight
rebounds but was just 1 for 8 from the field. ``I know I'm not 100
percent but I should hit those shots. We just didn't play as well
as we're capable of this time. I know we can play better against
them than that. We had our chances.''
</P>
<P>
   Each one was botched, though. After the Knicks cut the Lakers'
13-point fourth-quarter lead to 8 with 4 minutes 39 seconds left,
Bryant made an awful pass that hit Sprewell right in the chest. He
fumbled the ball, let it slide off his hip and Bryant gobbled it
up. In one motion, Bryant slipped behind the 3-point arc and
unleashed a shot that fell perfectly at the shot-clock buzzer.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was typical of our day,'' Sprewell said. ``The ball was
right there for me and I should have had it. He turns around and
hits a 3-pointer. Just typical of the kind of day it was.''
</P>
<P>
   It was deflating. After winning four in a row, after putting
their season of lulls behind them, this was a chance to gain some
confidence. The Knicks played defense, holding the Lakers to 42.5
percent from the field, and grabbed the rebounding edge, 48-46, but
they could only afford to let O'Neal dominate his one-on-ones with
the helpless Kurt Thomas and slow-moving Ewing. Once Bryant shook
loose from Sprewell, the strategy collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   ``What O'Neal did was fine,'' Van Gundy said of O'Neal's 43
points. ``It was Bryant's 17 in the second half that hurt us. You
hold a team like that to 42 percent shooting and out-rebound them,
you did a good job defensively. Bryant allowed them to get
separation from us.'' &QL;

WOODEN CALLS WATSON'S PERFORMANCE `REMARKABLE'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ There is a new contender for the greatest
postseason performance in UCLA history. Earl Watson, meet Gail
Goodrich and Bill Walton.
</P>
<P>
   Just how does Watson's game against Maryland (17 points, a
school-record 16 assists, no turnovers) compare to the best the
Bruins have to offer?
</P>
<P>
   Was Watson as good as Gail Goodrich, who scored 42 points in the
1965 championship game victory over Michigan?
</P>
<P>
   Was he as good as Bill Walton, who made 21 of 22 shots and
scored 44 points in the 1973 championship game victory over Memphis
State?
</P>
<P>
   And what about Ed O'Bannon, who had 30 points and 17 rebounds in
the 1995 championship victory over Arkansas?
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, Watson's scoring can't compare. But it could be decades
before someone duplicates a 16-assists, no-turnover game.
</P>
<P>
   The man who knows best, former coach John Wooden, declined to
pick a winner.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a remarkable performance (by Watson),'' Wooden said.
``Itcompares to any of the fine individual performances in
tournament play.''
</P>
<P>
   Goodrich, Walton and O'Bannon won championships with their play.
Watson won a second-round game. That's not to diminish his
brilliance, but the stakes simply are not comparable.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, try telling the Bruins that. They were in awe of
Watson afterward.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen anything like what Earl did,'' forward Rico
Hines said. ``Baron (Davis) has done some amazing things, but Earl
was in a zone. He was in total command. He could do anything he
wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   More Watson: He doesn't have to look far for advice. Assistant
coach Michael Holton was the starting point guard on UCLA's 1980
team that lost to Louisville in the NCAA finals. Holton has
counseled Watson all season on making the transition from off-guard
- his position in 1998 and '99 - to point guard.
</P>
<P>
   Holton also made some points about playing the point in March
Madness.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't have to play differently in the tournament, but you
have to recognize the transition opportunities - when they're there
and when they aren't there,'' Holton said. ``In the tournament,
because of its single-elimination format, turnovers have much
greater significance. One swing of the momentum can put you behind.
I think Earl understands that.''
</P>
<P>
   If his day job doesn't work out: No doubt, the highlight of
UCLA's postseason banquet last week was a short speech from guard
Ray Young, who has shot poorly all season but won the best
defensive player award.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just spoke the truth,'' Young said, smiling. ``I told
everybody that the coaches fooled me into playing defense by
telling me it would help my offense. Well, next year, when I get my
offense on track, they can kiss this award goodbye.''
</P>
<P>
   And finally: Amazing how similar UCLA's season has been to North
Carolina's. They are two of the most successful programs in college
history. Both are talented teams that underachieved during the
regular season. Both head coaches were severely criticized. Both
teams found new life in the tournament. Both stunned higher-seeded
teams in the second round (UNC beat Stanford on Sunday). Both have
morphed into Final Four contenders.
</P>
<P>
   And finally II: Three weeks ago, who figured UCLA would be the
last Pacific-10 team standing?

   NEW YORK _
</P>
<P>
   Dear Diary:
</P>
<P>
   This is a tale of two cities.
</P>
<P>
   At the age of 3, I made my entry into Manhattan when my mother
moved back from California. I spent the next 15 years living in
poverty in a rooming house. This gave me the opportunity, as a
young impressionable lad, to explore Gotham on foot.
</P>
<P>
   One day en route to Central Park, when I was 10 years old, I saw
a large black limousine pulling up in front of a Park Avenue hotel.
The uniformed doorman threw open the door, saluted and welcomed a
distinguished-looking man in a dark suit carrying a briefcase. When
the door of the hotel closed, I was left marveling at what wonders
awaited this person who disappeared under a sparkling crystal
chandelier.
</P>
<P>
   Forty years later, I was in Paris on a business trip, and my
large black limousine pulled up in front of the Hotel Ritz. A
uniformed doorman saluted as he opened the car door.
</P>
<P>
   Clutching my briefcase, I noticed out of the corner of my eye a
small boy staring at me in much the same way I, as a young boy, had
stared outside the Manhattan hotel. I wanted to tell him that if he
wished to trade places, he should study hard, get degrees in
engineering, learn a foreign language and get involved in
international sales. But I didn't.

   Sharon Kolinsky was walking through a toy store with her
4-year-old granddaughter, Arielle Gordon, when they spotted a Woody
doll from ``Toy Story.'' According to the instructions, the doll
was supposed to talk or sing if his belt buckle was pushed. Arielle
pushed, to no avail. ``Maybe Woody is tired today,'' Kolinsky said.
Arielle flicked her eyelashes to indicate her scorn: ``Or maybe
batteries are sold separately,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   A doctor's name and specialty _ obstetrics and gynecology _ were
on a sign at the bottom of a street-level office window in Astoria.
Murray Hausknecht spotted another sign in the left corner of the
window: ``No deliveries in a.m.''

   Lawrence Kamisher, a volunteer in art therapy, entered the
hospital room of an elderly woman in a wheelchair who was reading a
John Updike novel. The two discussed the author, and the woman then
confided that she would turn 94 the next day.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's the best thing about being 94 years young?'' Kamisher
asked.
</P>
<P>
   She didn't hesitate a moment. ``No peer pressure,'' she replied.

   For 50th Street on the C or E line,
</P>
<P>
   Where the old Madison Square Garden proudly stood,

   Dear Diary:
</P>
<P>
   Sharing has long been an acceptable solution for two people
coming upon a cab from different directions.
</P>
<P>
   On a cold day earlier this year, the other party was Jerry
Stiller, the comedian who had an ongoing role on ``Seinfeld.'' He
gallantly offered to give up the cab. I discovered that we were
going in the same direction and suggested that he join me. But
because this is a time of star-crazed stalkers, I was suddenly
being scrutinized and he initially demurred.
</P>
<P>
   I quickly told him that some years ago I had interviewed Anne
Meara, his wife, for an article and promised not to lay a finger on
him. He got in.
</P>
<P>
   We were soon chatting like old friends about his wife's new
play, his son Ben Stiller's new movie and his own latest role on
the television program ``The King of Queens.'' We arrived at my
destination all too soon.
</P>
<P>
   This doesn't have a big punch line. It's just a magical New York
moment, one that could only happen in a city with charming
celebrities and a permanent shortage of cabs.

REPUBLICAN SENATE RIVALS DRAW BATTLE LINES, QUIETLY, IN NEW JERSEY
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By DAVID M. HALBFINGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. _ While the Democratic race for the Senate
narrowed months ago to a showdown between the comeback-craving
former governor, Jim Florio, and the multimillionaire Jon Corzine,
the Republican contest still looks more like a schoolyard scrum.
</P>
<P>
   No less than four candidates are aggressively seeking their
party's nomination in the June 6 primary. Not one of them is a
household name. And not one of them is doing much yet to change
that.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, as Corzine's television advertisements saturate the
airwaves and Florio's broadsides fill the newspapers, the jostling
among the Republicans for now is largely out of public view.
</P>
<P>
   William Gormley, a veteran lawmaker from the Atlantic City area,
is quietly wielding the accumulated leverage of two decades in the
state Senate to reap endorsements from influential leaders in North
Jersey, outside his base.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Franks, a four-term U.S. congressman from Union County
and two-time state Republican chairman, is trying to convert his
relationships with hundreds of low-level party officials into a
groundswell of support in a series of county conventions over the
next three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   James Treffinger, the Essex County executive, is hoping his
record of fiscal reform and of winning re-election in a
predominantly Democratic county will persuade party workers to give
him a chance.
</P>
<P>
   And Murray Sabrin, a onetime Libertarian whose positions on
social issues are far to the right of any of his opponents, is
spreading the word to the conservative faithful, hoping opponents
of abortion rights and gun control will turn out in June in record
numbers, giving him a plurality as the three moderates split the
vote.
</P>
<P>
   For all but Sabrin, who is running outside the party
establishment, the next few weeks will be critical in gaining
organizational support, as county Republican leaders and committees
decide upon their endorsements in the Senate race.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the state's 21 county committees give a preferential
ballot position to the Senate candidate they endorse, whether by
voting in a county convention or by fiat of the county chairman.
The party line plays an inestimable role in influencing the
Republican loyalists who vote in primaries, especially if turnout
is light, which appears likely since the Republican presidential
nomination is no longer in doubt.
</P>
<P>
   Who gets the line must be decided by April 13. Between now and
then, seven counties will hold conventions to decide their
endorsements, culminating on April 8 in Bergen, the most populous
county and home to about 10 percent of New Jersey's Republican
voters.
</P>
<P>
   Each candidate is pursuing a geographic strategy. Gormley and
Franks, who are considered the two leading contenders, are trying
to solidify their own home territories while cutting away at one
another's. Gormley, for example, already has the party line in
Atlantic and Cape May counties, and is all but assured of it in
Ocean, giving him a solid base from the Jersey Shore to the
Delaware Bay. He is also the favorite to get the line here in
Mercer County, where the county executive has endorsed him, and in
heavily Republican but sparsely populated Hunterdon County, just to
the north.
</P>
<P>
   Franks, whose congressional district spans parts of Union,
Essex, Middlesex and Somerset counties in the heart of the state,
has also made important inroads to the south: he has won the party
line in Burlington County, near Camden, and is a strong contender
in Cumberland, which borders Cape May, because of the support of
Rep. Frank LoBiondo, a longtime rival of Gormley's.
</P>
<P>
   Treffinger is assured of the party line only in Essex and
Passaic, and is a favorite to win it in Hudson County. But he is
hoping to carry Monmouth and Morris Counties, two heavily
Republican areas where no one will receive the party line.
</P>
<P>
   The three rivals have been making similar pitches. Each has
sought to depict himself as the most conservative on fiscal
matters. For example: Gormley boasts of voting to cut state taxes
37 times since 1990, Franks of helping to write the first balanced
federal budget in decades, and Treffinger of having never supported
a single county tax increase despite inheriting a $100 million
budget deficit.
</P>
<P>
   But they are also making personal appeals, and increasingly
attacking their opponents. Treffinger, who has made an early effort
to compensate for his poor name recognition by running radio
advertisements throughout the state, is promoting his biography as
an adopted child who was the first in his family to graduate from
high school. He is also criticizing Gormley for accepting casino
money, which is prohibited in state races.
</P>
<P>
   Gormley is recalling his vote to ban assault weapons, which
prompted the National Rifle Association to mount what he calls a
``vicious soft-money campaign'' to defeat him in his 1991
re-election effort. In doing so, Gormley, who portrays himself as
unwavering on matters of principle, is drawing a stark contrast to
Franks, who first voted against the weapons ban and later did not
vote either way on a bill to repeal it.
</P>
<P>
   Franks, for his part, is reminding loyal Republicans of his
streak of 11 electoral victories, and of his efforts to take
control of the Statehouse from the Democratic Party while he was
state Republican chairman. Between the lines in that outwardly
wholesome message are digs at both his rivals. Treffinger, for
example, is no lifelong Republican; he worked for Gary Hart's 1980
presidential campaign and left the Democratic Party only in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   Gormley, meanwhile, is vulnerable to attacks on his electoral
record and even his loyalty to the Republican Party. He finished
fourth in a gubernatorial run in 1989, nearly lost a primary for
his own seat in 1991, and was trounced by LoBiondo in a
congressional primary in 1994. In addition, Gormley was widely
criticized for having been cozy with Florio's Democratic
administration; Florio carried Gormley's home county in his losing
re-election campaign against Gov. Christie Whitman.

THORNTON SUSPENSION POSSIBLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JEFF CAPLAN AND JENNIFER FLOYD 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ The Stars might be without winger Scott Thornton when
their four-day layoff ends.
</P>
<P>
   Referees assessed Stars winger Scott Thornton with a five-minute
match penalty for his forearm to Sharks winger Marco Sturm's face
with 45.1 seconds remaining in yesterday's game. The NHL
automatically reviews all match penalties, and a suspension is
possible.
</P>
<P>
   Thornton said there was no intent to injure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't even know what kind of penalty I got until they
announced it, so we'll see,'' Thornton said. ``I just tried to hit
him, that's all. I didn't hit him with my stick or anything. I've
seen a lot more severe and taken a lot worse in games.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem began when Sturm first wrestled Thornton to the ice
and tossed him against the boards.
</P>
<P>
   ``He can go after me, but to get his stick up? That's a
different story,'' Sturm said. _ Jennifer Floyd
Sydor, Nolan clash
</P>
<P>
   Stars defenseman Darryl Sydor left the game with 13:13 remaining
after being checked from behind by Sharks captain Owen Nolan. Sydor
didn't return.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Hitchcock said Sydor had a hip pointer but would be fine in
a day or two. Sydor said he was hurt more on the slash before the
hit but still wasn't amused by Nolan.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's done it before,'' Sydor said. ``If I would've known it
was him, I would've gotten my elbows up.''
</P>
<P>
   Nolan, meanwhile, didn't seem too concerned.
</P>
<P>
   ``He does it every game, so this was no different,'' Nolan said.
_ Jeff Caplan
Injury update
</P>
<P>
   Two of Dallas' injured players skated yesterday, but only one is
likely to return in time for Friday's game against Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Stars center Guy Carbonneau (wrist) felt fine with his playing
cast, and Ken Hitchcock said he expects Carbonneau to practice with
the team tomorrow. Stars winger Blake Sloan, meanwhile, wasn't as
lucky.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sloan is not ready yet,'' Hitchcock said. ``His ankle is still
bothersome.'' _ Jennifer Floyd
Lukowich the winger scores
</P>
<P>
   Defenseman-turned-forward Brad Lukowich scored his third goal of
the season and first as a forward. Joe Nieuwendyk set up the goal,
Lukowich's first since Dec. 27. It snapped a 27-game scoreless
streak.
</P>
<P>
   When the red light when on, Lukowich raised him arms, looked up
and said, ``Thank you.'' He later said he was thanking his
teammates and Ken Hitchcock for putting him in the lineup.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe I should be on that line,'' Lukowich mused. ``Me, Hully
\RBrett Hull\S and Nieuwy really snap it around well out there.'' _
Jeff Caplan
Dominating penalty kill
</P>
<P>
   The Stars' league-leading penalty kill suffocated the Sharks on
all seven San Jose power plays, and Jaime Langenbrunner, who has
become an integral member of the penalty kill while filling in for
Blake Sloan and Guy Carbonneau, scored a short-handed goal to tie
the game 1-1 at the 11:26 mark of the first period.
</P>
<P>
   ``Killing with Mo \RMike Modano\S makes it a little easier. He's
a pretty good penalty killer,'' Langenbrunner said. _ Jeff Caplan
Pushor back in mix
</P>
<P>
   Defenseman Jaime Pushor returned to the lineup for the first
time in five games. He replaced Dave Manson, who was a healthy
scratch.
</P>
<P>
   Pushor played 10:27 on 13 shifts with one shot and one hit,
playing alongside defensive partner Sylvain Cote. Pushor has played
in only four of the past 12 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt Push was getting too far away from the group
emotionally,'' Hitchcock said. ``We have to keep him close.''
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock said he hopes to soon work in Joel Bouchard, the
defenseman the Stars claimed off waivers from Nashville before the
trading deadline. _ Jeff Caplan / nn

BELFOUR'S BACK, AND ALL IS WELL WITH STARS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GIL LeBRETON 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ In his first game on home ice after nine days of _ how
shall we put this? _ league-suggested ``quiet time,'' goaltender
and noted headlock-artist Eddie Belfour was greeted warmly
yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Was there ever any doubt he would be?
</P>
<P>
   After all, this was Reunion Arena, located as always on the
corner of Wrist-Slap Boulevard and Absolution Lane, where even Roy
Tarpley could count on receiving a clean slate.
</P>
<P>
   Belfour's ``incident'' on March 8 and subsequent charges of
misdemeanor assault and resisting arrest were viewed by most Stars
fans as:
</P>
<P>
   A. trumped-up charges;
</P>
<P>
   B. a much-needed, preplayoff rest for the Eagle;
</P>
<P>
   C. just another pothole on the road to the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't their necks that Eddie put in that alleged headlock.
So when the 17,001 at Reunion started chanting ``Ed-die! Ed-die!''
during yesterday's 5-3 victory against San Jose, the Stars' planets
all seemed back in harmony again.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've overcome adversity all year,'' defenseman Darryl Sydor
said. ``We're behind Eddie 100 percent, and he's on the road up,
which is good.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, I think the break was kind of good for Eddie, you
know?''
</P>
<P>
   Belfour had returned to the net on Saturday afternoon in
Chicago, stopping 26 of 28 shots and later complaining of rink
rust. He had missed five games.
</P>
<P>
   He made it clear that he wanted to get back between the pipes as
soon as possible, and coach Ken Hitchcock granted his wish, sending
Belfour out on back-to-back days for only the fourth time this
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think today I felt 100 percent better than I did
yesterday,'' Belfour reported. ``The idea now is to just take it
one game at a time.''
</P>
<P>
   Funny, but Hitchcock had used the same expression _ one day at a
time _ in describing what a sobering episode Belfour and the team
had just gone through. They were lucky. Phone calls at 5:30 in the
morning usually echo with some sort of tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   This is not to trivialize what the police claim was outrageous
behavior by Belfour on that morning two weeks ago. But as the warm
welcome yesterday at Reunion seemed to say, no one was hurt, let's
get on with this thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see a guy who, to me, shows a singular focus back there,''
Hitchcock said of his veteran goaltender. ``He's taking things one
day at a time now. What I see is a guy who's taking a methodical,
very mature approach to things.''
</P>
<P>
   Mature? Well, let's not be hasty. This is a guy, after all, who
had to be placed in leg irons in his cell two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't make any comments on that,'' Belfour announced,
``because of legal issues that are pending.''
</P>
<P>
   To judge Belfour in the meantime, Hitchcock said, you need to go
back to the beginning of this NHL season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a different Eddie all year,'' Hitch said. ``He's
been a looser guy, who's shown a sense of humor.
</P>
<P>
   ``He ran afoul _ and he's paid the price.''
</P>
<P>
   As Hitchcock has said since the March 8 incident, Belfour was
never going to have a problem blending back in with his teammates.
While the Stars were fighting through a plague of injuries _ among
others, losing Joe Nieuwendyk for 34 games, Jere Lehtinen for 56,
Derian Hatcher for 25 _ Belfour manned his position like a rock.
</P>
<P>
   He wasn't just the Stars' most valuable player. Belfour had been
playing like the league's MVP.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, he can forget the latter now. Even the NHL has a
conscience. Sometimes.
</P>
<P>
   But the prize is still very much again within reach, as
yesterday reminded. Two goals within 98 seconds in the first period
turned a usually stressful division contest into a yawner.
</P>
<P>
   Belfour himself was solid without being sharp. He allowed Owen
Nolan's shot from an oblique goal-line angle to slip between his
knee and the goal post for one San Jose score. A bad turnover by
Hatcher led to another. The third Sharks goal came during garbage
time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a little concerned about going back-to-back,'' Belfour
said. ``But I felt a little stronger today, better than I expected.
I guess all that hard work in the gym is paying off.''
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere out there, Belfour suggested, is the golden groove
that he lost when things turned ugly that morning and he was
suddenly serving a nine-day penance. But it'll come soon, he seemed
to say.
</P>
<P>
   Belfour himself had as good an epitaph as any of the whole
incident.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we have some great leadership in this room,'' he said,
motioning to his teammates, who seem poised for another Stanley Cup
run.
</P>
<P>
   Eddie Belfour is not an issue with this Stars team. Don't let
some out-of-town TV guy tell you otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   The break might even have done him good, you know?

<P>
   Cigarette makers, faced with the prospect that a Miami jury may
soon hand out the largest punitive damage award ever, have taken
unprecedented steps in recent weeks to protect themselves from
bankruptcy by persuading tobacco states to pass bills that shield
industry assets.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, a defendant in a civil lawsuit must post cash or a
bond in the full amount of a jury award, plus interest, to avoid
enforcement of that judgment while the defendant appeals. But at
the behest of tobacco producers, legislatures in four states _
Georgia, Kentucky, Virginia and North Carolina _ have recently
passed or are being urged to take up bills that limit the financial
requirements a defendant must meet during the appeal process.
</P>
<P>
   The new measures are not specific to the tobacco industry, but
both cigarette makers and state officials acknowledge that the
industry is behind the legislative push. The effort comes as the
Miami jury, which is hearing a class-action case brought on behalf
of all Florida smokers, nears a critical decision on punitive
damages.
</P>
<P>
   Tobacco company analysts anticipate that the panel may award
record punitive damages against the industry of tens of billions or
even hundreds of billions of dollars _ sums that could bankrupt
most, if not all, cigarette companies if they are required to post
an appeal bond.
</P>
<P>
   Cigarette makers are expected to argue against a bond. But
should they fail, the new measures _ which, depending on the state,
put a limit of $25 million to $100 million on a bond that has to be
posted while punitive damages are appealed _ are intended to buy
the companies time while they fight the Florida verdict.
</P>
<P>
   The largest punitive damages ever awarded appear to be the $5
billion awarded by a jury in Anchorage, Alaska, in 1994 against
Exxon Corp. in connection with the Exxon Valdez oil spill. The
company is still appealing that decision.
</P>
<P>
   Stanley Rosenblatt, a lawyer in Miami who represents smokers in
the Florida case, told a court there last year that he would seek
$100 billion in punitive damages, said Martin Feldman, a tobacco
industry analyst with Salomon Smith Barney who attended that
hearing. Feldman and others said they believed that the tobacco
industry as a group could put up $10 billion to $20 billion while
it appealed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are in totally uncharted water,'' Feldman said.
</P>
<P>
   The bulk of the tobacco industry's operations are in the four
states that have passed or are considering the new measures.
Several legal experts said they believed such laws were
unconstitutional because they were designed to frustrate the
actions of courts in other states. However, such legislation would
still help the companies gain time, because a drawn-out legal fight
would precede any final court decision on the laws.
</P>
<P>
   Tobacco companies have agreed to pay $246 billion over the next
two decades to settle lawsuits brought by state attorneys general
to recover costs spent treating smoking-related ills. But the type
of class-action case under way in Florida is not covered by that
settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Christine Gregoire, the Washington state attorney general, said
producers told regulators late last year that damages in the
Florida case could pose a bankruptcy threat. As a result, she said,
state officials expected this week to hire an expert to represent
them as creditors in the event of a bankruptcy filing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't anticipate any need for them to file bankruptcy, but
we are going to be ready if they do,'' Gregoire said.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Robert P. Kaye of the Florida Circuit Court, who is
presiding over the Miami case, has barred tobacco company officials
and Rosenblatt, the plaintiffs' lawyer, from speaking about the
proceeding. But without commenting on that action, officials of
several tobacco companies said they believed the new measures were
needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to maintain our ability to adequately appeal judgments
without going into bankruptcy first,'' said Tommy Payne, a
spokesman for R.J. Reynolds Tobacco in Winston-Salem, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   Last year the Miami jury found that the United States' biggest
cigarette makers had hidden information about the potential dangers
of their products. That same jury is expected to start
deliberations as early as this week on whether the illnesses of
three plaintiffs selected as representative of class members were
caused by smoking.
</P>
<P>
   Should the jury decide that any one of those people was sickened
by smoking, it will then be asked to award punitive damages on
behalf of the entire class. While that figure is unknown,
Rosenblatt has estimated that 300,000 or more people in the state
might qualify as members of the class action, which is known as the
Engle case.
</P>
<P>
   The timing of the punitive damages is significant because it
would come before compensatory damages are awarded to the entire
class. But given last year's findings against the tobacco
producers, many analysts and observers of the case expect the panel
to award a record figure.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is anyone's best guess,'' said Bonnie Herzog, an analyst
with Credit Suisse First Boston. ``It could range in the hundreds
of billions. The industry would argue for a much lower number.''
</P>
<P>
   Under Florida law, a defendant who appeals must post 115 percent
of an award once a judge enters that verdict, a process that takes
about 30 days. Cigarette manufacturers are expected to argue for
any award to be stayed while they exhaust their appeals. They are
also expected to argue that compensatory damages to all class
members should first be determined, a process that could take
years, before a punitive judgment is entered.
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear what action Rosenblatt might take, because a
large award could push most, if not all, cigarette makers into
bankruptcy, an action that would freeze all litigation against
them.
</P>
<P>
   Most cigarette makers have said they believe that any award in
the Florida case can be overturned on appeal, because many courts
have dismissed other class-action suits against them. It is the
prospect of keeping their businesses intact during that appeal that
is behind the push for the new laws.

</P>
<P>
   This month, Gov. James Gilmore of Virginia signed a bill that
would place a $25 million limit on a bond during the appeal of
punitive damages. Lila Young, a spokesman for Gilmore, said that
lobbyists for Philip Morris U.S.A., which has its tobacco
headquarters in Richmond, Va., had urged Gilmore to back the bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``The success of the tobacco corporations has a tremendous
impact on the vitality of our state,'' said Young, who added that
large punitive damages in the Florida case could ``cause disaster
to our economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Peggy Roberts, a spokeswoman for Philip Morris, declined to
comment. But in a recent filing with the Securities and Exchange
Commission, Philip Morris, the nation's biggest cigarette maker,
said that ``in a worst-case scenario, it is possible that a
judgment for punitive damages could be entered in an amount not
capable of being bonded.''
</P>
<P>
   Before signing the bill, Gilmore added an ``emergency'' clause
making it retroactive to Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
   In Georgia, a bill similar to the new Virginia law has passed
both houses of the state legislature, and Gov. Roy Barnes is
expected to sign it soon. In Kentucky a bill placing a limit of
$100 million on an appeal bond has passed the state Senate. The
state's House judiciary committee is expected to begin action on it
this week.

   Each tobacco company is pushing bills in states where it has
major operations. For example, Brown &AMP; Williamson, which has
headquarters in Louisville, Ky., and a major cigarette plant in
Macon, Ga., has been promoting bills in those states, said Mark
Smith, a company spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   In North Carolina, the principal proponents of the legislation
are R.J. Reynolds and Lorillard Tobacco, which along with Liggett
Group have headquarters there. Because the state legislature does
not meet until May, both R.J. Reynolds and Lorillard have been
calling for an emergency session to consider an appeal bond limit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Essentially, we are not seeking anything different than what
our neighboring states have enacted,'' said Martin Orlowsky, chief
executive of Lorillard, which is based in Greensboro.
</P>
<P>
   Tad Boggs, a spokesman for Gov. Jim Hunt, said that cigarette
makers had contacted Hunt and that ``they feel very strongly about
this.'' He said no decision had been made about an emergency
session of the legislature.
</P>
<P>
   John Coffee, a law professor at Columbia University, said he
believed the new laws would be overturned because they appear to
violate the ``full faith and credit'' clause of the U.S.
Constitution, which requires the authorities in one state to
enforce court judgments from another state.
</P>
<P>
   Keith Teel, a lawyer for Brown &AMP; Williamson, said that cigarette
makers, would if necessary argue that the Constitution does not
cover jury decisions in cases where a court has failed to protect
the legal rights of a defendant.
</P>
<P>
   Feldman, the financial analyst, said he expected the laws to be
overturned. ``This is about time buying,'' he said.

UNABLE TO PULL AWAY, TOP-SEEDED DUKE HOLDS ON 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. _ Sometimes the seeding does not matter.
</P>
<P>
   When Duke and Kansas, two of the most successful programs in the
modern game, met Sunday in the second round of the East Regional,
the action was fierce, no quarter given. Defense dominated. Every
shot, every movement was contested. Even the head coaches got into
a brief confrontation on the sideline.
</P>
<P>
   Not until Kansas guard Kirk Hinrich missed a 3-point attempt
with 7 seconds left, and Duke's Chris Carrawell corraled the
rebound, did the top-seeded Blue Devils secure a 69-64 victory.
</P>
<P>
   The victory allowed the 29-4 Blue Devils _ with Michigan State
in the Midwest the only No. 1 seeds remaining _ to advance to the
regional semifinals on Friday at Syracuse. Duke will face
fifth-seeded Florida, a 93-76 winner over Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just a high-caliber game from the get-go,'' said Mike
Krzyzewski, the Duke coach, seeking his ninth Final Four berth
since 1986. ``I've been in over 60 of them in the NCAA, and that
was a big-time game.''
</P>
<P>
   Duke scrambled to get back in the game after falling behind
early, and the score was 35-35 at halftime.
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Devils threatened to pull away several times in the
second half, and built a 59-50 lead with 6 minutes 14 seconds to go
on a pair of free throws by Shane Battier.
</P>
<P>
   Battier, a forward who played all 40 minutes, led both teams
with 21 points, 8 rebounds and 8 blocked shots, and drew praise
from Kansas coach Roy Williams as ``the most alert, the most aware
defensive player I can remember in college basketball.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite shooting only 36.2 percent, getting beaten on the
boards, 44-41, and committing 17 turnovers, eighth-seeded Kansas
responded to Duke's largest lead with 9 unanswered points. A
3-pointer by Jeff Boschee, a sophomore guard, tied the score at
59-59 with 3:31 left.
</P>
<P>
   Duke pushed its edge back to 4, only to see the Jayhawks score 5
straight, taking their last lead, 64-63, on a 3-point play by Nick
Bradford with 1:18 left.
</P>
<P>
   But Carlos Boozer, a freshman center who had 15 points, got the
last of his 13 rebounds on a follow shot to put Duke back in the
lead, 65-64, with 53.5 seconds remaining. Then, following a Kansas
timeout, he stole a Bradford pass, Carrawell was fouled and made a
pair of free throws to push the advantage to 3 points.
</P>
<P>
   Then came Hinrich's miss and two more free throws as Duke made
87.1 percent of its 31 attempts, and a narrow escape for the
nation's top-ranked team on a night it committed 23 turnovers and
made 37 percent of its shots.
</P>
<P>
   Duke's habit this season has been to jump on an opponent at the
outset of a game, then extend its control with the nation's most
prolific offense and a hard-nosed man-to-man defense.
</P>
<P>
   But Kansas swiped the script.
</P>
<P>
   The Jayhawks scored the game's first two baskets, then staggered
Duke with three consecutive 3-pointers by Hinrich, to build a 13-4
lead.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile the flustered Blue Devils missed eight of their first
10 shots and committed four turnovers. After Hinrich hit his third
bomb, Krzyzewski called timeout to calm his team.
</P>
<P>
   Duke's defensive intensity immediately picked up, resulting in a
dozen first-half turnovers by Kansas and four blocked shots for
Battier.
</P>
<P>
   But the Blue Devils could not convert another shot until Nate
James, the junior guard, hit a 3-pointer with 10 minutes 49 seconds
left in the half, cutting the deficit to 13-7.
</P>
<P>
   Duke pulled to 15-14 at the 8:36 mark on a 3-point play by
Carrawell, the senior forward who had 15 points. Kansas answered
with a basket by Ashante Johnson, and following one of Duke's 10
first-half turnovers a television timeout was called.
</P>
<P>
   Irked by an earlier call, Krzyzewski, already animatedly trying
to inspire his team, began arguing with official Terry Christman.
That spurred Williams to come to the Duke bench to join the
discussion. The Kansas coach's arrival precipitated a brief
exchange before the coaches were separated by officials.
</P>
<P>
   Duke took its first lead, 25-24, on an inside basket by Boozer
with 4:16 left in the half. But Kansas maintained narrow leads by
converting shots, collecting 13 of its 25 rebounds in the period on
offense.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, in his 12th year at Kansas, entered the game with the
best winning percentage among active coaches (80.2). But despite
visits to the Final Four in 1991 and 1993, he is often remembered
for twice being upset in the second round while holding a No. 1
seed _ in 1992 by nine seed Texas-El Paso and in 1998 by eight seed
Rhode Island.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday he came within a play or two of turning the tables as
Kansas ended its season 24-10.
</P>
<P>
   ``Down here, this team came through, this team grew up,''
Williams said, his voice breaking. ``I just wish we had more games
to play.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the opener Sunday, Florida employed a style that stressed
full-court pressure defense, open-court opportunities, and taking
the first available shot. That pace was not unfamiliar to Illinois,
an at-large entrant from the Big 10. But it proved fatal as Florida
controlled the action for the entire second half and easily won,
93-76.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought our style of play was very, very effective,'' said
Billy Donovan, the Florida coach. ``The game really started getting
going up and down the floor in the second half, and that's
certainly to our liking.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the second straight year Florida (26-7) advanced to the
Sweet 16. The fifth seed survived overtime to defeat No. 12 Butler,
69-68, in the opening round.
</P>
<P>
   Young, deep and talented, the Gators sometimes play with
abandon. But they are also capable of playing with intelligence and
precision, as they proved by closing the first half with a 19-6
rush, then holding Illinois at arm's length the rest of the way.
</P>
<P>
   During one stretch late in the game, Florida converted 18 of 19
free throws en route to 78 percent accuracy at the line.
</P>
<P>
   When they had an open look from the perimeter, the Gators made 9
of 18 3-pointers. Once the Southeastern Conference club established
that threat, and grew accustomed to the physical interior play of
Illinois' front court, it was equally effective inside.
</P>
<P>
   Four Gators, two guards and two frontcourt players, finished in
double figures. Mike Miller, a sophomore forward, paced his team
with 19 points and 9 rebounds.

PROFESSOR CALCULATES WHICH KILLERS SHOULD PAY THE ULTIMATE PRICE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By LYNDA RICHARDSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Over years of probing the criminal mind, Robert
Blecker, a professor at New York Law School, has become convinced
that death penalty laws fail to cull the most vicious killers from
the merely mundane murderers.
</P>
<P>
   So Blecker is creating a kind of catalog of ultimate evil,
outlining murders that he believes deserve the forfeiture of life.
</P>
<P>
   The professor, who is writing a book on capital punishment, has
learned that convicted murderers have their own moral calculus for
determining the worst among them. And he thinks the killers can
offer valuable lessons.
</P>
<P>
   In his book, the professor calls for a drastic reduction in the
number of murderers who are eligible for the death penalty, but as
a believer in retribution he urges the execution of a higher
percentage of the murderers who remain on death row.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the people I have met in prison I would spare,'' said
Blecker, 52, who describes himself as a libertarian. ``Some I would
kill. My goal is to determine which is which.''
</P>
<P>
   The professor's argument for refinement of death penalty laws
comes as the national debate over capital punishment intensifies.
Last month, Gov. George Ryan of Illinois, a Republican who favors
the death penalty, halted executions in his state after concluding
that 13 innocent people had almost been executed, in some cases
because of incompetent defense lawyers. In at least 12 states,
legislation to suspend executions has been introduced.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1986, Blecker has been studying the behavior of more than
100 murderers and other felons at Lorton Central Prison in
Virginia, which serves the District of Columbia. He said the
inmates at Lorton, ranging in age from 20 to 78, taught him that
the traditional categories used to determine which murderers should
be condemned to death are too broad and fail to capture
distinctions like the killer's feelings of remorse.
</P>
<P>
   The Lorton inmates served as his ``search engine,'' he said,
helping him to winnow the sort of murders that warrant the death
penalty.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the professor concluded that although killing a
witness is an aggravating circumstance that can elevate a murder to
a capital crime, not all witnesses are equal.
</P>
<P>
   A killer does not deserve to die, Blecker said, for murdering a
partner in crime after a bungled robbery if the accomplice
implicates him, or plans to, in order to receive a lighter
sentence. The professor said, however, that a killer should receive
the death penalty for murdering an innocent passer-by who happens
to see a robbery.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he selfishly eliminates an innocent witness by
rationalizing that `She's nothing but a snitch for telling on me,'
he is the worst of the worst, because the street code is, `Of
course she will tell,''' he said. ``She is doing her duty. It's on
him to engage in the robbery in such a way that he will not be
seen, either to mask down or do it with sufficient stealth to
protect his identity.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Blecker concluded, if a murderer was on drugs
at the time he committed the crime, a mitigating circumstance that
might reduce a capital offense, laws should be more precise about
the kind of drug and the killer's experience with it.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Blecker said, the inmates agreed that a murderer
who was taking heroin at the time deserved to die, because he would
feel detached but aware, making it easier to kill.
</P>
<P>
   But a murderer might have diminished responsibility while on a
drug popularly known as ``boat,'' short for ``love boat,'' which is
marijuana soaked in the psychedelic drug PCP. On that drug, the
killer could feel a potent combination of paranoia and omnipotence.
``Everybody is out to get you and nobody can stop you,'' Blecker
said.
</P>
<P>
   Blecker interviewed about 50 convicted murderers, 30 prisoners
convicted of attempted murder or assault with intent to kill, and
20 inmates imprisoned for drug crimes who said they had also killed
but had never been caught. No inmate was on death row at Lorton,
because the District of Columbia does not have the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can isolate those who are not like them, who are the
worst of the worst,'' Blecker said of the inmates. ``In large part,
those are killers with attitudes. We kill them not just because of
their act but because of the attitude with which they killed.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the death penalty was applied too broadly in the
category of felony murder, a killing committed in the course of a
felony like robbery, burglary or rape. Robbery itself, he said,
should not automatically elevate the crime to a capital offense.
</P>
<P>
   Blecker said he saw a double standard in the law: Robbery is
disproportionately committed by the poor and members of minorities,
and, if a murder occurs along with the robbery, a capital
prosecution can ensue. But he said that corporate killers, who
knowingly maintain workplaces that cause deaths, are not singled
out for capital cases.
</P>
<P>
   Blecker contends that the elimination of robbery from the felony
murder category would diminish concerns about racial discrimination
in death penalty cases because it would reduce the inherent bias in
such cases.
</P>
<P>
   He said the most heinous killers would receive the death penalty
anyway, because other aggravating factors, like torture, would be
present.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Blecker said, distinctions as to whether murder
victims resist should be made. He said a robber who intentionally
kills a victim who does not fight back deserves to die, but a
robber who kills his victim in a struggle after the victim reaches
for a gun should be spared.
</P>
<P>
   ``The victim has raised the stakes from property to life,''
Blecker said. ``The robber deserves punishment, like life
imprisonment, but he doesn't deserve to die.''

 &HT;    Seeds get swallowed
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. _The wildest 24 hours in the history of the
NCAA Tournament almost turned totally crazy Sunday afternoon when
Duke, the No. 1 seed in the East Regional, needed four free throws
in the final 29 seconds to beat eighth-seeded Kansas 69-64.
</P>
<P>
   Duke, which advances to Friday's East Regional semifinals to
play Florida, was one of the few highly-seeded teams to survive an
upset-filled second round on Saturday and Sunday. Two No. 1 seeds
(Arizona, Stanford), three No. 2s (Cincinnati, Temple St. John's),
and three No. 3s (Ohio State, Oklahoma, and Maryland) all failed to
advance to the Sweet 16. That tied an NCAA record for the fewest
top 16 seeds to advance to the regional semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   It is the first time since the NCAA Tournament field went to 64
teams in 1985 that only two No. 1 seeds advanced to the Sweet 16.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest shocker of the day was 10th-seeded Seton Hall, which
upset second-seeded Temple 67-65 in overtime in the East Regional
in Buffalo, N.Y. Close behind on the upset meter was North
Carolina, the No. 8 seed in the South, which knocked off top-seeded
Stanford 60-53 in Birmingham.
</P>
<P>
   The SEC, Big Ten, and Big East each placed three teams in the
Sweet 16. Here is a breakdown of this week's regional semifinals:
</P>
<P>
   East: The last time Duke met Florida in the NCAA Tournament was
at the 1994 Final Four in Charlotte. Duke won that game but lost to
Arkansas for the national championship. Florida beat Illinois 93-76
on Sunday in Winston-Salem to advance to the Sweet 16 for the
second consecutive year.
</P>
<P>
   In Friday's other game in Syracuse, Seton Hall will take on
third-seeded Oklahoma State, which knocked off Pepperdine 76-67 in
Buffalo, N.Y. If Seton Hall and Duke both win, Seton Hall coach
Tommy Amaker would meet his mentor, Mike Krzyzewski, for the
regional championship and a spot in the Final Four.
</P>
<P>
   South: After a disappointing season by North Carolina standards,
the Tar Heels were given no shot of getting to the Sweet 16. The
win by North Carolina (20-13) over Stanford not only kept the Tar
Heels alive in the tournament, but extended their streak of 20-win
season to 30. North Carolina will meet Tennessee (26-6), which
knocked off defending national champion Connecticut 65-51 on Sunday
in Birmingham.
</P>
<P>
   In Friday's other game in Austin, Tex., surprising Miami
(23-10), a 75-62 winner over Ohio State on Sunday in Nashville,
will take on Tulsa (31-4), which beat second-seeded Cincinnati
69-61.
</P>
<P>
   Midwest: Michigan State (28-7) joined Duke as the only other No.
1 seed to advance when the Spartans knocked off Utah 73-61 on
Saturday in Cleveland. The Spartans, who reached the Final Four
last season, must now take on fourth-seeded Syracuse (26-5) on
Thursday in Auburn Hills, Mich., about an 80-mile drive from the
Michigan State campus. At one point this season Syracuse was 19-0.
</P>
<P>
   In Thursday's other game at the Palace of Auburn Hills, UCLA
(21-11), the No. 6 seed, will take on second-seeded Iowa State
(31-4). UCLA put together the most impressive performance of the
tournament Saturday night when the Bruins destroyed third-seeded
Maryland 105-70 in Minneapolis. Iowa State, the Big 12 champion,
advanced by beating Auburn 79-60 on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   West: The West is by far the whackiest regional as the Nos. 4,
6, 8 and 10 seeds advanced to Thursday's semifinals in Albuquerque,
N.M.
</P>
<P>
   Gonazaga (26-8), the Cinderella team from 1999, found that the
slipper fits two years in a row. The champions of the West Coast
Conference knocked off second-seeded St. John's 82-76 on Saturday
to advance to its West semifinal game with Purdue (23-9). The
Boilermakers pulled off a mild upset on Saturday in Tuscon by
beating third-seeded Oklahoma 66-62.
</P>
<P>
   LSU (28-5) advanced to the Sweet 16 for the first time since
1987 by beating Texas 72-67 on Saturday in Salt Lake City. The
Tigers, the No. 4 seed, will take on eighth-seeded Wisconsin on
Friday. Wisconsin (20-13) shocked top-seeded Arizona 66-59 on
Friday.

GIULIANI STEPS UP HIS DEFENSE OF POLICE IN FATAL SHOOTING
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By ERIC LIPTON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Pressed to respond to charges that he is demonizing
the victim, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani on Sunday intensified his
criticism of Patrick Dorismond, the unarmed man killed on Thursday
by an undercover police officer, suggesting that his ``pattern of
behavior'' and his actions the night of the shooting had
contributed to his death.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor also confirmed that he had authorized the release of
Dorismond's arrest record immediately after the shooting, citing
the public's ``right to know.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People do act in conformity very often with their prior
behavior,'' Giuliani said Sunday during a television interview on
``Fox News Sunday.'' The news media ``would not want a picture
presented of an altar boy, when in fact, maybe it isn't an altar
boy, it's some other situation that may justify, more closely, what
the police officer did.''
</P>
<P>
   The mayor made the comments during the second day of a sprint
through five upstate New York cities, the most extensive weekend of
campaigning so far by Giuliani, the Republican candidate for the
U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign calendar had called for a weekend filled with
genial, vote-gathering events, from a volunteer fire department
supper in Waterville to baby cuddling and handshaking at St.
Patrick's Day parades in Syracuse and Buffalo. But in the Fox
interview, conducted while Giuliani was at a veterans breakfast in
Elmira Heights, and encounters with the news media on Saturday and
Sunday, the mayor was repeatedly drawn back to Thursday's shooting
of Dorismond, a 26-year-old security guard, after a brief struggle
outside the Wakamba Cocktail Lounge, on Eighth Avenue near 37th
Street.
</P>
<P>
   And at home in New York City, Giuliani's remarks about the case
drew immediate condemnations from some of his traditional critics,
like the Manhattan Borough President, C. Virginia Fields, and the
Rev. Al Sharpton.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani's comments on ``Fox News Sunday'' were his most
extensive to date about the shooting. The mayor said that he had
authorized Commissioner Howard Safir on Thursday to disclose
Dorismond's criminal record, which consisted of arrests, in 1987,
1993 and 1996, on charges of robbery, assault, attempted robbery
and criminal possession of a weapon.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you read the man's background _ arrested for robbery,
arrested for attempted robbery, arrested for assaulting someone in
a driving dispute, arrested for assaulting someone in a marijuana
dispute, with calls to his home for other disputes _ it is a pretty
bad record,'' Giuliani said Sunday in a news conference that
followed his appearance at the St. Patrick's Day Parade in Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani said it was not that relevant that Dorismond's only
convictions in the public record are for two disorderly conduct
charges, given that ``usually it is a plea down from a more serious
charge.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani also defended the police department and the officers
involved, largely adopting the version of events offered by the
police and a lawyer for Detective Anthony Vasquez, the 29-year-old
officer who fired the fatal shot. According to this version, as
Giuliani told it Sunday, Dorismond began attacking an undercover
officer who was trying to engage him in a drug sting as he was
standing outside the Wakamba bar about 12:30 a.m. Thursday waiting
for a cab.
</P>
<P>
   ``Police officer Vasquez came to the aid of the police officer
who was being beaten up,'' Giuliani said in the Fox interview.
Dorismond and Kevin Kaiser, who was with him, then ``rushed for his
weapon,'' Giuliani said, referring to Vasquez, ``and that's how the
shooting took place.'' Kaiser has said that it was the undercover
officer, Anderson Moran, who threw the first punch.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, before leaving for his upstate trip, Giuliani
commended Detective Vasquez, who he said ``put his life on the line
in the middle of the night to protect the safety and security of
this city,'' but he did not mention the detective's disciplinary
history, which includes drawing his weapon during a bar fight that
he was reportedly involved in while off-duty in February 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani's remarks this weekend stood in contrast to his initial
approach to the case, the third fatal police shooting of an unarmed
man in 13 months, calling on Thursday for the public to try to not
let ``their bias, their prejudices, their emotions, their
stereotypes,'' lead them to any quick and possibly unjustified
conclusions about the case.

</P>
<P>
   Dennis Walcott, president of New York Urban League and a mayoral
appointee to the Police Department's Courtesy, Professional and
Respect Committee, said Sunday that if the mayor wanted the respect
of blacks and others concerned about allegations of police
misconduct, he should have stuck to his original position.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just don't get it,'' Walcott said. ``The mayor at one point
calls for people to suspend judgment and wait for all the facts are
in and then at the same time the mayor and police commissioner
begin the process of demonizing an innocent man killed by a police
officer. He is just creating a bigger wedge between the police and
the community.''
</P>
<P>
   Fields, the Manhattan borough president, said Dorismond's
criminal record was not relevant to the case, because the officers
did not know anything about his past when they approached him
outside the bar.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is totally ridiculous and absurd for him in some way to
attempt to justify the killing of this young man by saying he had a
record,'' Fields said of the mayor. ``When you shoot a person they
are obviously not wearing a badge that shows their past criminal
record.'' She addded, ``It shows a lack of sensitivity and
caring.''
</P>
<P>
   Eric Adams, co-founder of 100 Blacks in Law Enforcement Who
Care, said he was particularly outraged that Giuliani and Safir
released details from Dorismond's criminal record from 1987, when
he was a juvenile and the case file was sealed by the court.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we want to look at criminal records, at 15 I was
arrested,'' Adams said during a rally Sunday outside of One Police
Plaza, the department's headquarters. ``Does that make me a person
who shouldn't be allowed to walk the city? When did it become that
because of an activity at 13, 14, or 15 years old this should cause
you to be shot? For a man to justify that, that is sick.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani said all he was trying to do was ensure that both sides
of the story were told.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are things that unless this is a game of let's blame the
police for everything, the public has a right to know,'' the mayor
said in his Fox interview.
</P>
<P>
   Dorismond's mother, Marie Dorismond, a Haitian immigrant, did
not speak with reporters Sunday. A makeshift shrine to Dorismond,
with 20 sprays of flowers and 16 votive candles, had been set up
outside her home on Parkside Avenue in the Flatbush section of
Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   But on Friday, Marie Dorismond condemned the portrayal of her
son as a repeat offender. ``My son is not a criminal. He has two
children,'' she said on Friday, adding, ``What is this lie?'' in
response to the criminal arrest record released by Safir and
Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   Family members on Sunday said they would address the public at a
news conference Monday afternoon, with other Haitians living in
Brooklyn and the family's lawyer, Johnnie L. Cochran Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Among the stream of visitors Sunday was Abner Louima, whose
assault by police officers in a Brooklyn station house three years
ago caused a sensation. Two officers were convicted in the assault
last year, and three were found guilty this month of covering up
the attack.

COMMENTARY: CONTRASTING ELECTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By WILLIAM SAFIRE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The first great test of a new democracy is not only
in the way its government tolerates opposition, but whether it is
willing to transfer power to that opposition after a fair election.
</P>
<P>
   The new United States faced that test in 1801, after the ruling
party of John Adams and Alexander Hamilton had been beaten in the
popular vote by Thomas Jefferson's Anti-Federalists. It was touch
and go for weeks, as the stunned Federalists tried to make a deal
with Aaron Burr to block Jefferson's presidency. Only secret
patronage concessions, hotly denied, and Hamilton's personal hatred
of Burr caused the party in power to turn over the keys to the
Executive Mansion.
</P>
<P>
   Taiwan passed the same test last weekend. The party in power
ever since Chiang Kai-shek fled China was split by an insurgency.
The opposition party, favoring independence, contended vigorously.
China warned the free Taiwanese of ``blood'' in their future if
they dared vote for the dissident Chen Shui-bian.
</P>
<P>
   That attempted intimidation put Chen over the top. The old
guard, to its credit, will transfer power peacefully. Taiwan thus
proves its democratic strength.
</P>
<P>
   Russia is proving the opposite. Late last year, the kakistocracy
propping up Boris Yeltsin decided not to risk giving up power. To
avert election defeat by the Primakov-Luzhkov party, the ruling
Kremlin crew upset the constitutional schedule. Yeltsin suddenly
stepped down and named Vladimir Putin, a KGB apparatchik, to be
acting president.
</P>
<P>
   By staging this coup, the ruling party was able to have its
candidate in office, with all its powers of patronage and media
control, at election time. Its anointed new leader received a
prestige boost from Britain's Tony Blair and America's Bill
Clinton. A level playing field was averted.
</P>
<P>
   To distract the Russian people from high-level corruption, war
hysteria was whipped up. Chechens aching for self-rule were
designated as threats to Russians in their homes. Power-starved
Russian generals were encouraged to pillage at will.
</P>
<P>
   In this way, the ruling clique not only changed its image from
puffy Yeltsin to hard-eyed Putin, but changed the subject from
venality and economic stagnation to a cost-free victory over the
despised rebels.
</P>
<P>
   Needed was only a symbolic bridge connecting fear of the
Chechens to anger at truth-tellers in the Russian media. The ruling
clique found that in Andrei Babitsky, a Russian Radio Liberty
reporter who filed embarrassing facts from behind battle lines.
</P>
<P>
   Babitsky was arrested and ``exchanged'' by Chechen quislings;
when Western interest made his disappearance awkward, the reporter
was brought to Moscow on trumped-up charges. Putin, as Election Day
neared, then made the connection between the hated Chechens and the
beleaguered Russian press by loudly branding the reporter a
``traitor.'' This plainly implied that any pursuit of truth in a
war zone is treason.
</P>
<P>
   The Kremlin plan was to call a snap election to exploit war
fever. That's how it could renew its power before the extent of
Russian casualties became known and the surge of support for the
militarist Putin ebbed. But Chechen guerrillas in the mountains
have not cooperated; ambushes abound. Polls show Putin popularity
beginning to erode, and a quick vote is in the power clique's
interest.
</P>
<P>
   Though the Kremlin's choice remains far ahead of his main
opponents, the Communist Gennadi Zyuganov and the lonely democratic
reformer Grigory Yavlinsky, Putin hopes to avoid a two-man runoff
by winning over 50 percent of the votes on March 26. Even if he
does, there's this wrinkle in the law: Unless 50 percent of
eligible voters show up on the first round to vote for all
candidates, the election must be repeated.
</P>
<P>
   The Kremlin clique will inflate next week's count by stuffing
ballot boxes. But Harvard's Graham Allison reports from Moscow that
apathy is rampant; even the Communists had trouble rounding up 150
bodies for a Red Square rally. Apparently many Russians are
disgusted at the way they've been had.
</P>
<P>
   We see what comes when rulers don democratic trappings but use
every trick to avoid relinquishing power. As Taiwan's party of
power bows to the will of a victorious plurality, Russia's party of
power perpetuates a fraud on the Russian people. That's the
difference between a successful and a failing democracy.
</P>

COMMENTARY: THE MUD-SLINGERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By BOB HERBERT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ I'm curious. I wonder when it was that the mayor of
New York misplaced his humanity.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the city knows by now that Patrick Dorismond is dead. He
and a friend were just minding their own business, trying to hail a
cab on Eighth Avenue when they had the terrible misfortune to be
approached for no good reason by a hyperactive undercover cop.
</P>
<P>
   Dorismond had given no indication whatsoever that he was
involved in any wrongdoing. But the cop felt the need to bolster
his arrest totals, so he decided to intrude on Dorismond and bug
him about drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Dorismond had no way of knowing he was suddenly in mortal
danger. Angered by what he thought was a street nuisance, he told
the cop to get lost. A scuffle broke out, backups rushed in, and
within moments Patrick Dorismond, just 26, was history.
</P>
<P>
   Such a turn of events would evoke feelings of sorrow in most
people. You wouldn't have to know Dorismond to be moved by the
tragic waste of a young man's life. And you could feel for his two
young daughters, who will grow up without their father.
</P>
<P>
   Dorismond's friend, Kevin Kaiser, was quoted in The New York
Times as saying: ``The last memory I have of this man is him
rolling on the ground, gasping for air, with blood coming out of
his mouth.''
</P>
<P>
   You might read that and think: Well, how can we prevent a
similar awful occurrence? What can we do about this problem of cops
shooting civilians for reasons that elude the average sane person?
</P>
<P>
   You might think that. But your mayor wouldn't.
</P>
<P>
   The first impulse of Rudolph Giuliani and his trained seal of a
police commissioner, Howard Safir, was to try to dig up as much
dirt as possible on Dorismond. The fouler the better. Just smear
this newly dead man and embarrass his family with as much filth as
possible. The worse he looks, the less hideous the shooting will
seem. Never mind that this execrable effort is irrelevant to the
matter at hand. That's the way to minimize the political fallout.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, though he knew Dorismond had never been convicted
of a crime _ only of minor disorderly conduct violations _ Giuliani
nevertheless said: ``When a person has shown a propensity to
violence, a propensity to hitting other people, a propensity to
robbery, and to attempted robbery, and a propensity to being
involved in drug transactions, that doesn't necessarily negate the
whole thing, but these are relevant facts that the people have a
right to know.''
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday he was at it again, sliming Dorismond on national TV.
</P>
<P>
   Try to keep this in mind, even if the mayor can't: The man was
trying to hail a taxi, bothering nobody. The police came out of
nowhere and, for no good reason, began to bother him. Moments later
he was dead.
</P>
<P>
   The anger at the police in New York is growing daily. Instead of
trying to defuse that anger, Giuliani and Safir seem intent on
fanning it into a full-blown rage.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've made us the enemy more than we ever were,'' said a
high-ranking police official I spoke to over the weekend. He said
he and many other dedicated cops are becoming increasingly upset
over the damage done to the department's reputation by some of the
mindlessly aggressive policies imposed by Giuliani and Safir.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no humanistic or humane approach to the service that
we do,'' the official said. ``It's just numbers, numbers, numbers.
All they want is to get the arrest numbers up. And when you look at
Diallo _ when you look at the results of that. And when you look at
what they did to the Street Crime Unit, which was a good outfit.
And when you look at this latest shooting _ this, what's his name,
Dorismond? This all comes from Giuliani's over-the-top,
take-no-prisoners attitude. And you cannot police New York City
like that. It cannot be done.''
</P>
<P>
   There was a mixture of anger and dismay in his tone. ``Giuliani
and Safir are really hurting us,'' he said. ``The damage they've
done to this job _ I won't see the repair of it in my time.''
</P>
<P>
   If the mayor cares about that, he's not letting on. He and Safir
remain committed to policies that push cops who are deficient in
judgment, training and supervision into situations they are not
prepared to handle. Inevitably some of those cops will degrade,
maim and kill the innocent.
</P>
<P>
   To trash the victims of such excesses is really sick.

FOR HIGH-TECH BUILDERS, INTANGIBLES OUTWEIGH BAY AREA'S
HIGH  COSTS
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By HENRY NORR 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
Solectron and Flextronics International, the two local leaders in
contract manufacturing for the high-tech industry, both have
growing networks of production facilities across the country and
around the world. But executives of both companies expect the Bay
Area to continue playing a major role in their operations, despite
the area's high costs.
<P>
   Solectron, far and away the largest company in the category, has
about 30 factories around the world, including major facilities in
Guadalajara, Mexico, and Sao Jose dos Campos, Brazil, as well as in
Ireland, Scotland, France, Germany, Romania, China and Malaysia.
Flextronics operates ``industrial parks'' _ combining its own
production facilities with space for its major suppliers _ in
China, Hungary and Guadalajara, with additional major sites in
Scotland, Sweden, Austria and Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of both companies say their foreign facilities,
including those in developing countries, are just as advanced as
their Bay Area facilities. ``We build buildings that look just like
our factory in San Jose, we train people just as we do in San Jose,
we build canteens and provide food just like we do in San Jose,''
said Flextronics CEO Michael Marks. ``And,'' he said, ``we return
the water we use cleaner than we got it, even though the norm in
some of these places is just to dump wastewater into the sewers.''
</P>
<P>
   But for both companies, and for most of their top-tier
competitors, the Bay Area remains a uniquely important location.
Solectron's Milpitas facility is still by far its largest, and
according to Chief Financial Officer Susan Wang, shipments from the
Bay Area still account for 45 percent of the company's revenues.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts and executives cite several reasons for this region's
continued importance for electronics manufacturing, despite its
high costs. One factor, Wang said, is that the Bay Area offers an
``unparalleled concentration of talent,'' even though the companies
recruit engineers as well as laborers in every country where it
operates.
</P>
<P>
   But the most important advantage of this area, most observers
agree, is that so many high-tech companies, wherever their
headquarters are, develop their products here. Traditionally, most
companies like to keep at least initial production close to their
design centers, so their engineers can quickly diagnose and correct
any problems that surface as production gets under way.
</P>
<P>
   Once product designs and manufacturing processes have been
stabilized, production is often moved to foreign factories to take
advantage of lower costs and proximity to foreign customers.
Nowadays, that dynamic doesn't apply just to simple and technically
unsophisticated products: Flextronics' Marks said his company is
starting to move production of routers to its Guadalajara campus,
and eventually it may even do the same with the servers it builds
for Compaq.
</P>
<P>
   But with new high-tech products continuing to flood into the
market, there should still be plenty of work for Bay Area
facilities. Flextronics' Marks noted that his company has, on
average, rolled out one new Cisco Systems product every three days
for more than three years.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, Wang noted, moving production of some products offshore
may never be worthwhile, especially as product life cycles grow
ever shorter.
</P>
<P>
   ``In volume production, we and our customers both know the
benefits of moving offshore, but we also know the risks,'' said
Solectron's Wang. ``For one thing, it disrupts your supply chain _
even if you can convert to local suppliers, you still have a
complicated transition to manage. Sometimes it's just not worth
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Jabil Circuit of St. Petersburg, Fla., one of Solectron and
Flextronics' top competitors, set up shop in San Jose back in 1984,
according to Beth Walters, vice president of corporate
communications. But until recently, Jabil had only a relatively
modest, 30,000-square-foot facility there. Because of this area's
costs, Walters said, Jabil hesitated to expand it.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, it finally decided to do so, adding additional 170,000
square feet to its plant and boosting total employment there to
700. While acknowledging that ``customers kind of enjoy having you
close by,'' especially at the beginning of a relationship, Walters
downplayed the long-term importance of proximity. ``Once they know
you,'' she said, ``they'd usually rather have you do the project in
the lowest-cost facility, or the one closest to their markets.''
</P>
<P>
   What finally persuaded Jabil to increase its investment in this
area, she said, was the steady stream of high-tech startups here.
``If you're not here, you don't find out about them and they don't
find out about you,'' she said. ``That's why we finally decided we
had to be here.''

 `RAW RECRUITS' ARE PROSPERING IN CONTRACT MANUFACTURING  &HT;     By HENRY NORR 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
Contract manufacturing is often associated with low wages and even
sweatshop conditions, but executives at the industry's top-tier,
tech-oriented companies say these stereotypes have little relevance
to them.
<P>
   Solectron's philosophy, according to the company's chief
financial officer, Susan Wang, is to look for ``raw recruits'' it
can hire at just above minimum wage; in general, she said, the
company aims to keep its base salaries at about the 25th percentile
in each labor market where it operates.
</P>
<P>
   But once hired, she said, Solectron's workers _ or
``associates,'' as the company calls them _ enjoy a variety of
opportunities not available to most low-wage workers. For starters,
they're eligible for bonuses, with no cap, based on their business
unit's success in meeting its targets. Wang called the program ``a
form of profit sharing.'' (Stock options, however, are limited to
engineers and managers.)
</P>
<P>
   In addition, she said, ``we provide a tremendous amount of
training,'' largely through a program called ``Solectron
University,'' which offers courses in everything from soldering to
supervision. Wang noted that the company's chief operating officer
and the vice president in charge of Western U.S. operations
(including California and Washington) both got their start on the
shop floor.
</P>
<P>
   Flextronics CEO Michael Marks tells a similar story. New
recruits at his company's San Jose facility usually start at $6.50
to $7.00 per hour, but move up quickly, and average wages are
between $10 and $11. (In Mexico and Hungary, he said, the company
pays about $1.75 an hour, and slightly more than that in China and
Malaysia.)
</P>
<P>
   In the Bay Area, Marks said, Flextronics' workforce is made up
largely of women, many of them Latino and Vietnamese immigrants.
``That's always been true of manufacturing in this country,'' he
said. ``It's the newcomers who fill the ranks, but then they move
up the ladder.''
</P>
<P>
   Flextronics doesn't have a formal ``university'' like
Solectron's, but it, too, puts a high priority on upgrading a
worker's skills, he said. In China, it offers its workers free
English lessons on Sundays, and at its Guadalajara industrial park
it runs a fully accredited high school.
</P>
<P>
   None of the Bay Area's major contract electronics manufacturers
is unionized, and Amy Dean, executive director of the South Bay
AFL-CIO Labor Council, declined to comment specifically on working
conditions at them, except to note anecdotal reports of health and
safety issues and workers' compensation complaints.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really part of a broader issue,'' she said. ``Outsourcing
is increasingly common throughout the economy. We need to figure
out new ways to represent people in industries like this, benefits
need to be portable, and the government needs to update
unemployment insurance and workers' compensation to reflect this
phenomenon.''

 LORNE MICHAELS BACKS WEBCAST CONCERT SERIES  &HT;     By BENNY EVANGELISTA 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
Call it MTV for MP3.
<P>
   Riffage.com, a Palo Alto firm that uses the popular MP3 online
music format to promote undiscovered musical talent, is teaming
with a college cable network controlled by TV producer Lorne
Michaels to create a series of half-hour TV concerts.
</P>
<P>
   Riffage.com today will announce a deal to co-produce ``Riffage
Live from the Great American Music Hall'' for the Burly Bear
Network, which beams programs by cable to students at schools like
Stanford University and San Francisco State University.
</P>
<P>
   The first show will be Webcast March 28 and repeated on the
Burly Bear Network in mid-April, with the full 13-week series
debuting this fall.
</P>
<P>
   In the past two years, colleges have been the breeding ground
for the MP3 movement, using the format for compressing audio files
to transmit music on the Internet. The MP3 phenomenon has also
provided unknown garage bands and independent artists access to a
global stage previously unattainable unless they caught the ear of
a big record label.
</P>
<P>
   Riffage.com, which has attracted investments from America Online
and BMG Entertainment, is one of several Bay Area startups trying
to stake out a piece of the emerging online music industry.
</P>
<P>
   But Riffage is the first to try using the more traditional
channel of television to showcase artists who are gaining fame
among MP3 fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's converging entertainment,'' said Jason Rubenstein,
Riffage's vice president for live programming. ``As an aggressive
young Internet company, we're going to try to change the rules of
the ecosystem for music.''
</P>
<P>
   Burly Bear, launched in 1994, produces about 12 hours a week of
programming watched by about 500,000 viewers, said Brian Nurenberg,
the network's senior vice president and general manager.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Broadway Video, a New York production company owned by
Lorne Michaels, creator of NBC's long-running variety show
``Saturday Night Live,'' bought a 75 percent stake in Burly Bear
for about $6 million.
</P>
<P>
   The network is available on cable systems reaching about 5
million students at 450 schools from Boston College to UCLA. It
also runs a Web site, at www.burlybear.com.
</P>
<P>
   The company produces offbeat shows, such as ``Half-Baked,'' a
cooking show for dorm-room denizens. And there's the animated
``Kevin Spencer,'' described on Burly Bear's Web site as ``the
8-year-old, chain smoking, alcoholic, sociopath you'll grow to
love.''
</P>
<P>
   Rubenstein believes college students are the perfect audience
for ``Riffage Live.'' Downloading online music has become so
popular an activity among college students that more than 100
universities combatting clogged Internet lines have blocked or
restricted access to Napster, a popular software program that
allows easy sharing of MP3-formatted songs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to hit the audience right between the eyes,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Riffage will split advertising revenues and co-produce ``Riffage
Live'' with Broadway Video, which also produces ``Saturday Night
Live.''

 TECH BUILDERS FOR HIRE  &HT;     By HENRY NORR 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
Manufacturing _ to many the essence of the old economy _ turns out
to be one of the fastest-growing and most lucrative segments of the
new one.
<P>
   At least that's the case for a small group of companies that
specialize in cranking out circuit boards, cell phones and other
high-tech items on contract to the companies who design and market
such products.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past decade the major players in this build-for-hire
business have recorded dizzying rates of growth.
</P>
<P>
   The largest and best known of them, Solectron of Milpitas, has
racked up a compound annual growth rate of more than 53 percent
since 1992, according to Chief Financial Officer Susan Wang. For
fourth-ranked Flextronics International, which is incorporated in
Singapore but has its headquarters in San Jose, the comparable
figures are about 70 percent growth annually over the past seven
years.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street has rewarded these companies and their top
competitors by bidding up their stock prices at a rate even most
dot-coms have to envy. And they've been spared _ even during last
week's sharp Nasdaq sell-off _ the extreme volatility that marks
most new-economy investments.
</P>
<P>
   It's not hard to see why, said J. Keith Dunne, managing director
at Robertson Stephens in San Francisco and a longtime bull on the
contract-manufacturing industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the only sector that's growing as fast as the Internet,''
he said, ``plus it has proven profit potential.''
</P>
<P>
   A decade ago, electronics manufacturing contractors were
perceived mainly as sources of low-wage manual labor _ usually by
immigrant women _ that the likes of Cisco Systems and
Hewlett-Packard considered too unrewarding and even undignified to
bother with.
</P>
<P>
   For smaller contractors there's still some truth to that image,
industry observers say. But over the past decade, Solectron,
Flextronics and a half-dozen or so major competitors have emerged
from the pack to become global giants and technological powerhouses
in their own right.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to expanding U.S. operations, even in high-cost
Silicon Valley, they've built or bought state-of-the-art production
facilities in Mexico, Malaysia, China, Hungary and elsewhere around
the globe.
</P>
<P>
   And they've moved beyond manufacturing into areas like product
design, component qualification, testing and supply-chain
management. In some cases, they have even taken on order
fulfillment and post-sale support: Flextronics, for example, not
only builds Cisco routers, but ships them directly to end users
whose orders Cisco forwards; Cisco never has physical possession of
the products that carry its name.
</P>
<P>
   With their new scope and sophistication, the top tech
manufacturing specialists have taken on a new name: Instead of
contract manufacturers, they now call themselves ``electronics
manufacturing service,'' or EMS, providers.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever they call themselves, they've become key partners for
high-tech companies increasingly determined to focus on their core
competencies, technological innovation and brand building, rather
than physical production. While the outsourcing model first took
hold in the computer and data-networking categories, in recent
years telecommunications companies have also boarded the bandwagon,
especially as they struggle to keep up with skyrocketing demand for
cell phones.
</P>
<P>
   So reliable and efficient have the EMS leaders proven themselves
that many of their customers have lately decided to turn over
management and even ownership of important production facilities to
them. And the companies involved aren't just cyberstartups with no
experience in the real world of production; they're
electronics-industry leaders that have been building their own
products for decades.
</P>
<P>
   Just in the past few months, for example, Solectron _ the only
two-time winner of the U.S. government's prestigious Baldridge
Award for manufacturing excellence _ has acquired facilities from
IBM, Alcatel and Ericsson, among others. For its part, Flextronics
has announced similar arrangements with Ericsson, Cabletron and
Fujitsu Siemens.
</P>
<P>
   Both of the local companies, as well as their fellow EMS giants,
have also been gobbling up smaller contract manufacturers,
component suppliers and design specialists at a rapid rate.
</P>
<P>
   Flextronics, for example, merged in November with the Dii Group,
a Colorado contractor. In January, it bought out Palo Alto Products
International, the company that designed the original PalmPilot and
the newer Palm III and VII models. And this month, it added four
companies with facilities in North Carolina's Research Triangle
Park.
</P>
<P>
   Solectron, meanwhile, acquired Smart Modular Technologies, a
leading maker of memory modules, and Americom Wireless Services, a
Los Angeles specialist in mobile-phone repair.
</P>
<P>
   Altogether, contract manufacturers by most estimates now produce
nearly 20 percent of the worldwide electronics industry's
trillion-dollar total output, and their share is growing by the
month. Flextronics CEO Michael Marks recalls that in 1994, when his
company went public, he predicted that contractors' share could
eventually reach 30 percent, and most observers thought he was
dreaming.
</P>
<P>
   Now he predicts that his industry will soon account for 60 to 80
percent of worldwide electronics production, and this time no one's
laughing. Indeed, Robertson Stephens' Dunne said the consensus
among industry watchers is that 65 or 70 percent is a realistic
target.
</P>
<P>
   Given the size of the electronics market, those projections
translate into opportunities fo staggering dimensions: In today's
market, Dunne notes, an additional 10-percent share means $100
billion in incremental business. And that's not even counting the
likely growth in the electronics pie.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Dunne said, the biggest challenge facing the EMS
industry may be that ``there's more business coming their way than
they can absorb in the near term.''
</P>
<P>
   Flextronics' Marks agrees, focusing particularly on the problem
of finding the talent needed to sustain his company's dizzying
growth. ``Direct labor'' _ blue-collar production workers _ ``is
still somewhat available,'' he said. ``The problem is finding the
engineers and supervisors and procurement people we need, not just
here in the Bay Area but all over the country. It's always been
difficult, but lately it's been damn near impossible.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, he's not worried about growth slowing. ``I just don't see
any plateau, at least in the next three or five years,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Marks, who received bachelor's and master's degrees in
psychology before picking up an MBA at Harvard (where, he says, he
didn't do very well in the one manufacturing course he took),
assumed leadership of Flextronics in 1993. Just last week, Fortune
magazine named him one of six ``Heroes of Manufacturing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been breathtaking, to tell you the truth,'' he said. ``I
never would have imagined.''

TENNESSEE KNOCKS THE CROWN OFF TEETERING CONNECTICUT 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By THOMAS GEORGE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BIRMINGHAM, Ala. _ Out of sync, weaving and bobbing on the
brink, Connecticut could not gain its balance here Sunday. Finally,
it fell flat. Hard. With injured point guard Khalid El-Amin missing
nearly 27 minutes, Connecticut felt its crown slipping throughout
its 40-minute waltz with Tennessee. It was reminded of the
difference a year can make.
</P>
<P>
   Last year Connecticut won it all.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the crown fell off.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Tennessee kicked it off.
</P>
<P>
   The Tennessee Volunteers found a wounded team and licked its
lips. It threw all of its darts on the bulls-eye, shot all of the
marbles out of the ring, played aroused and intense and beat ailing
Connecticut, 65-51, before 16,108 fans in the Birmingham-Jefferson
Civic Center. Tennessee (26-6) advances to the Round of 16, to
Austin, Texas, where it will play North Carolina, an earlier 60-53
winner here over Stanford.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to call it like it is,'' Tennessee Coach Jerry
Green said. ``They aren't the same team without El-Amin. It's
unfortunate for them he wasn't 100 percent. Couple that with the
fact that we played probably our best game of the year.''
</P>
<P>
   For Connecticut, it was an ugly combination.
</P>
<P>
   El-Amin had suffered a high right ankle sprain here Friday in
Connecticut's first-round victory over Utah State. He had undergone
treatment for the last 48 hours attempting to recover, but it was
not to be. In the 13 minutes 17 seconds that he played (6:20 of it
in the first half), he limped noticeably. He grimaced. His game was
gone and he was unable to push off the ankle.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee attacked him. And Connecticut was unable to attack
without him.
</P>
<P>
   El-Amin had been their playmaker, their general for 34 games
this season. Sunday he took two shots, scored two points and had
one assist. Suddenly, in the Huskies' 35th game, they had to find a
way to operate without him.
</P>
<P>
   It was like a car without a steering wheel.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very difficult to take some one who is not just your
point guard but also the focal point of your team in so many ways,
someone you depend on running the offense, and trying to overcome
that,'' Connecticut's warrior center Jake Voskuhl said. ``It was an
adjustment we couldn't make.''
</P>
<P>
   Freshman point guard Tony Robertson tried: He was 1-of-7
shooting with two assists and three turnovers in 33 minutes played.
</P>
<P>
   Freshman point guard Marcus Cox tried: He was 0 for 3 with no
assists in six minutes played.
</P>
<P>
   For Connecticut, with El-Amin unable to go, the head was cut
off.
</P>
<P>
   The body quickly followed.
</P>
<P>
   ``At times it was very evident that they were a team out of
whack,'' said Tennessee center C.J. Black. ``But I don't know too
many teams who can play without their point guard.''
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee forward Vincent Yarbrough said: ``Definitely, they
were kind of lost. It wasn't just that they lost Khalid, but it was
also that they were playing against good competition.''
</P>
<P>
   A team that played 40 minutes of flourishing basketball.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee shot 44.7 percent. It made 16 of 23 free throws. It
made only eight turnovers and created seven steals. Yarbrough
scored 14 points, Black 13 and guard Tony Harris 18 though he shot
only four of 11 from the field. Tennessee led, 32-22, at halftime
and never looked back. It built its lead to as many as 19 points in
the second half. Only a 3-point shot made by Connecticut's Albert
Mouring (17 points) as the final buzzer sounded prevented
Connecticut from finishing with fewer than 50 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``They started the game inside, and then did a nice job of
kicking it outside,'' Jim Calhoun, the Connecticut coach, said of
Tennessee. ``They played a terrific game. Our defense was fine
without Khalid, but our offense struggled tremendously. We depend
on Khalid's energy so much. Khalid is the head of the dragon.''
</P>
<P>
   How much did the Huskies miss him?
</P>
<P>
   Look no further than his penetration all season, his ability to
draw fouls and shoot free throws and create similar opportunities
for others. Minus El-Amin, Connecticut for the entire game shot
four free throws and made four assists. Its points, assists and
steals (one) were season-low totals for Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   Compare that with Tennessee dishing and daring, with its
acrobatic play Sunday _ it sank 16 of 23 free throws and created 15
assists.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today was a tough game,'' Connecticut senior forward Kevin
Freeman said. He fought valiantly and scored 14 points and grabbed
7 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut's string of seven tournament victories was snapped.
This was its worst post-season loss since 1992. It finished with a
25-10 record.
</P>
<P>
   The crown will not be Connecticut's this time.
</P>
<P>
   But Calhoun was proud, anyway, especially of Voskuhl and
Freeman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jake and Kevin are special and they have been a pleasure to
``In four years they had 109 wins, three Big East championships and
a national championship. All they ever wanted to do was win and
help the team. We may have had bigger personalities and brighter
lights, but none more special. I miss them already.'' &QL;

 BIOSCOPE COLUMN: GENE-PATENT OPPONENTS NOT LICKED YET  &HT;     By TOM ABATE 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
San Francisco artist Marilyn Donahue has proposed a simple way for
people to protest the patenting of human genes.
<P>
   She suggests people copyright their own DNA.
</P>
<P>
   ``It probably won't have much legal effect,'' admitted the
former biology researcher turned artist. ``For me, this is really
about making people take an interest in where biotechnology is
going.''
</P>
<P>
   If only President Clinton and British Prime Minister Tony Blair
had consulted Donahue last week, before they tried to call
attention to issue of patents and the human genome.
</P>
<P>
   The two leaders issued a statement promising that public labs
would continue to make gene maps freely available, while agreeing
that private firms can continue to patent genes.
</P>
<P>
   Their pronouncement spooked Wall Street into thinking the
government might ban gene patents, sparked a run on biotech stocks
and wiped out billions of dollars of paper wealth.
</P>
<P>
   Donahue's copyright, in contrast, offers considerable symbolic
bang for less than a buck. She demonstrated her technique Thursday
night before the Coalition of Artists and Life Forms, a San
Francisco group organized by artist Dale Hoyt.
</P>
<P>
   Here's how the copyright works.
</P>
<P>
   Have someone take a snapshot of you licking a first-class stamp.
Enclose the snapshot in a self-addressed envelope, using the stamp
as postage. When the letter arrives, drop it in a file drawer. The
canceled stamp proves when you ``authored'' the saliva sample.
</P>
<P>
   Marilyn Kretsinger, assistant general counsel for the U.S.
Copyright Office, chuckled upon hearing Donahue's idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an interesting protest,'' Kretsinger said.
</P>
<P>
   Her office has never considered whether DNA could be
copyrighted, though Kretsinger doubts licking a stamp meets the
legal test for a copyright, which is meant to protect original,
creative works.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't have any creative control over your DNA,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Donahue isn't the first artist to challenge gene patents. Last
month, British poet Donna MacLean asked her government for a patent
on herself, claiming she is an original invention 30 years in the
making.
</P>
<P>
   Some scientists have also challenged gene patents. Jonathan
King, a molecular biologist at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology, is circulating a petition ( &LR; www.gene-watch.org &LR; ) asking
Congress to ban the practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``The patenting of genes is a new and profound theft of the
human commons,'' King said. ``Genes evolved over time. We inherited
them from our parents, they weren't invented by corporations.''
</P>
<P>
   King said that when U.S. patent laws took effect in 1793, they
embodied the principle that living things could not be patented.
For 140 years, plant breeders tried to get around this ban and get
protection for hybridized plants. In the 1930s, they persuaded
Congress to bestow limited commercial protection on plant hybrids.
The tags hanging from ``patented'' roses in nurseries trace their
origin to those laws.
</P>
<P>
   But King said the plant protections were weak compared with
patents that confer on their holder a 20-year monopoly on the
invention.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in 1980, a U.S. Supreme Court decision lifted the ban on
patenting living things. The case revolved around Ananda
Chakrabarty, a General Electric scientist in the 1970s, who
genetically altered a bacteria so that it could digest petroleum _
a potentially useful tool for cleaning up oil spills.
</P>
<P>
   When Chakrabarty sought to patent his oil-eating microbe, patent
officers, following 180 years of precedent, rejected his
application. Donald Chisum, a law professor at Santa Clara
University, said the case went to the Supreme Court, which voted 5
to 4 that a patent could be granted on ``anything under the sun
that is made by man.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In its natural state it (the bacterium) did not eat oil, he
(Chakrabarty) gave it the appetite,'' said John Doll, chief of the
biotech division at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office in
Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   The patent office interpreted the Chakrabarty decision as
permitting gene patents. ``The logic was that if living organisms
could be patented, small pieces of chemicals isolated and purified
from them should be patentable,'' Doll said.
</P>
<P>
   Isolated and purified are the key words. As Doll explained, the
100,000 or so genes in the human body are clumped inside the
nucleus of every cell. Envision a piece of steel wool, made up of
filaments wound round and round. The entire steel wool would be the
human genome. A gene would be a single tiny snippet.
</P>
<P>
   ``It (the gene) is not just floating around,'' Doll said. ``Man
went in, clipped it out of the genome, isolated it, gave it to us
and said this is what it does.''
</P>
<P>
   After the Chakrabarty decision, biotech firms raced to isolate,
purify _ and patent _ the genes that produced insulin, growth
hormones and blood production factors. These patents allowed firms
like Genentech Inc. in South San Francisco and Amgen Inc. in
Thousand Oaks to create businesses around the drugs that these
patents controlled.
</P>
<P>
   Today, hundreds of genes have been patented, and not just by
private firms. The University of California has 265 gene-related
patents.
</P>
<P>
   Despite opponents like King who want to restore the ban on
living patents, most observers think the gene patents awarded so
far provide a necessary incentive so companies will invest in
developing biotech drugs.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, Paul Billings, a geneticist who serves with King
on the Council for Responsible Genetics, a public interest group in
Cambridge, Mass., supports gene patents that lead to drugs or
diagnostic tests.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, however, a growing concern has arisen that
private firms are employing machines that make it so easy to
isolate and purify genes that only a handful of companies might end
up unraveling the steel wool and patenting large chunks of the
human genome.
</P>
<P>
   What Clinton and Blair hoped to do last week was cheer on the
handful of public labs that have equipped themselves with the same
automated gene-reading machines. These public labs are racing to
discover genes _ and make them public _ before private gene-mappers
can monopolize the genome.
</P>
<P>
   But nobody knows what will happen if the private firms win.
</P>
<P>
   In the midst of a mess so complicated that it almost takes a
science degree to understand, Donahue, the born-again artist who
spent 18 years doing lab research, wants to prod people into
thinking about where all this gene mapping will lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Art makes you stop, look and contemplate,'' Donahue said over
a lunch plate of pommes frites. Legally speaking, she knows her
copyright stunt isn't worth the warm spit on the stamp. But as a
form of participatory art, she thinks it has power.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wouldn't it be amazing,'' she asked, leaning across the table,
``if 10,000 of us came forward? A judge would have to listen to
that.''

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Just two years ago, the NBA was a very hot sports attraction on
network television, the ratings for its playoff finals at times
eclipsing those for baseball's World Series.
</P>
<P>
   But that was the last season for Michael Jordan, the
transcendent sports star of the 1990s, and two years after his last
game the NBA has seen its popularity on network television plummet,
to the despair of its network partner, NBC.
</P>
<P>
   After spending $1.75 billion on rights for four NBA seasons
starting last season _ more than double the previous amount _ NBC
is now suffering through a terrible NBA year, particularly in prime
time, with audiences down by 20 percent. That has been enough to
send NBC's weekly prime-time ratings into a tailspin and its
overall basketball ratings down from 4.3 to 3.6 in a year. That
means the games are seen in approximately 700,000 fewer homes this
season. One week ago, on a Sunday night when the network showed a
game in prime time, NBC recorded the lowest rating for any night in
a season in the network's history.
</P>
<P>
   Now both the league and the network are talking about sharply
cutting back the number of prime-time games next season.
</P>
<P>
   What happened?
</P>
<P>
   Jordan's exit from the court is generally the main reason cited,
since ratings had generally held steady through the end of his
career. But NBA and NBC executives and advertisers mentioned an
array of factors, including the overexposure of NBA games on cable
and local stations, particularly this season; the emergence of
Tiger Woods as the sports star most like Jordan in appealing to
casual sports fans; viewer alienation after the player lockout last
season; and, more fundamentally, the growing tendency of young
players to curtail, or even forgo, college basketball careers.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed the quick movement of college players _ making it
difficult to build widely popular stars for a national audience _
is a marketing problem being blamed for what seems to be the
decline in interest. The regular-season ratings for college
basketball on CBS, the network most associated with the collegiate
sport, hit an all-time low this season, 1.9 (about 2 million
homes), although the NCAA tournament, now in progress, has been
generating ratings about on par with last season.
</P>
<P>
   But with the college game not able to establish stars through
four years of steady television appearances, both levels of the
sport have been affected, said David Stern, the NBA commissioner.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question at all that this is a factor,'' he said.
``There's a building process to exposure for these star players.''
</P>
<P>
   For years the NBA thrived on the regular arrival of pre-marketed
players, said Dick Ebersol, the president of NBC Sports. Jordan,
Magic Johnson and Larry Bird all catapulted to stardom in exciting
final games in the heavily viewed NCAA tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Now, in Jordan's wake, the NBA is increasingly faced with the
task of marketing new stars, many of whom either attended only a
year or two of college, like Allen Iverson of the Philadelphia
76ers and Vince Carter of the Toronto Raptors, or did not go to
college at all, like Kobe Bryant of the Los Angeles Lakers and
Kevin Garnett of the Minnesota Timberwolves.
</P>
<P>
   Both Stern and Ebersol repeatedly called the current season a
``transition year,'' meant to build up the host of new NBA stars
they believe are about to emerge from under Jordan's long shadow.
But the declaration reflects at least as much a hope as a
prediction. Stern said the league recognized that ``We have to get
people exposed to this next generation of stars.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our strong preference would be to have a Tim Duncan and a
Grant Hill come into our league after four years in college,''
Stern said, citing two stars who finished their four years of
eligibility in college. ``But that isn't going to be the case as a
matter of law.'' Young players have established through legal
precedent that they have the right to seek a pro career without
regard to their college status.
</P>
<P>
   The NBA has not even approached the popularity of the collegiate
tournament for its feature games on NBC Sunday nights this season.
The games hit a low a week ago when a total of only about 4.5
million people tuned in from 7 to 9 p.m. on Sunday March 12 to see
games between the Knicks and San Antonio, the teams that squared
off in last year's playoff finals, and _ in other parts of the
country _ Seattle against Toronto, the latter featuring Carter, who
has become the league's latest hope to replace Jordan as a
high-flying scoring talent.
</P>
<P>
   For the season, NBC is averaging only about 5.9 million fans for
its regular season prime-time games, down from 7.4 million last
season. The contrast that may be most jarring to the league is what
is happening to viewing for wrestling, which, on the UPN network,
is averaging more than 7 million viewers in prime time this season.
Even on cable, on the USA Network, wrestling is averaging about 7
million viewers every Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   But Stern said it was not fair to use wrestling as a comparison.
``It's just an entertainment phenomenon,'' he said. ``It's like
`Dawson's Creek' or ``Buffy the Vampire Slayer.'''
</P>
<P>
   The ratings falloff has serious economic implications for NBC
because the audiences are clearly not approaching the expectations
of its advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   Normally advertisers buy time on network programs with a
guarantee of certain audience figures. NBC does not give a formal
guarantee to its NBA advertisers, but there is an understanding
that if the network falls short of expectations it will offer what
are known as ``make good'' advertisements _ free commercials.
</P>
<P>
   Ebersol expressed confidence that enough time can be found in
the normal breaks of games to accommodate the make goods. But
whatever ad time the network gives away free is at least a missed
opportunity. The advertising marketplace is so strong right now
that NBC could sell that time at high prices to new advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Igiel, president of broadcast for Media Edge, a division of
the Young &AMP; Rubicam advertising agency, among several other
executives, pointed to the sheer number of NBA games that an
average television viewer can see every week as one reason the
weekend games have little special appeal. Turner Broadcasting's
cable channels have as many as four games a week, and local
channels like MSG in New York carry a home team's other games, and
cable stations' ratings are down as well. ``There are so many games
and so many teams,'' Igiel said. ``The NBA is all over the place.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The sheer number of teams also means that the star players do
not play as often in every city. The most widely cited geographical
problem facing the league involves the newly designated heir to
Jordan, Vince Carter. NBC has been realigning its schedule to
include his games. He paid off that endorsement by scoring 51
points in his first nationally televised game.
</P>
<P>
   Still, his next game was included in the pair that set a new low
for NBC in prime time (even though he scored 34 points in that
one). One problem cited is the team Carter plays for, the Toronto
Raptors, a team many casual sports fans probably still do not know
is in the NBA. It is also in a city whose local ratings do not even
count. Canadian cities do not factor in U.S. ratings.
</P>
<P>
   ``David Stern needs to make some move to get Carter to Chicago
or New York,'' said Donnie Deutsch, chairman of Deutsch Inc., which
represents such clients as Foot Locker. ``The rest of the league
needs him in a big media market.''
</P>
<P>
   Stern scoffed at that suggestion, saying a city's size is no
impediment to a star emerging. ``A few years ago, Orlando became a
huge team for us,'' he said. ``I just don't buy for a minute that
Vince Carter has to be in a major market.''
</P>
<P>
   What the league needs, both he and Ebersol argued, is simply
more time to get fans entranced with talents like Carter and
Bryant.
</P>
<P>
   Ebersol argued that in a world where every sport now competes
not only with other sports but also with the Internet and endless
other diversions, ``it is more important than ever to have stars.''
He compared it to a production job from early in his career, NBC's
``Saturday Night Live,'' which has risen and waned on the strength
of the stars in its cast. But television, in general, is producing
few big stars, because of the fragmentation of the audience.
</P>
<P>
   From a practical point of view, Ebersol said, the 17 games NBC
has in prime time this year, up from seven last year, are simply
too many. But that is partly a result of the huge 133 percent
increase NBC paid for the rights two years ago. It was forced to
put on more games to try to generate additional advertising
revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Stern said that with all the games that are being aired, the NBA
``is actually being seen by more eyeballs.'' But he said, ``Every
time we do a new television deal we take a look at it. It may be an
interesting time now to take a look at this one.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that in the long term, the NBA will maintain its value
because in a world of so many options for consumers, big sports
events will still be must-see choices that audiences will plan
ahead for. ``We are live, so we are among the last appointment
viewing on television.''
</P>
<P>
   But for the short term, NBC has few answers for its problems
Sunday nights. As one longtime NBC executive put it, ``Right now,
Sunday night is a train wreck.''

 PAC BELL TO OFFER DSL YOU CAN INSTALL  &HT;     By TODD WALLACK 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
It took Pacific Bell six technicians and more than nine hours on
four different days to install Joe Ramos' high-speed Internet line
in Half Moon Bay. On another date, workers simply didn't show up at
all.
<P>
   The installation process didn't go any more smoothly for San
Francisco filmmaker Ronald Levaco, who also ordered a digital
subscriber line, which offers superfast Internet access over
conventional copper phone lines.
</P>
<P>
   Pac Bell workers initially spent six hours struggling to get his
DSL working in his Haight Victorian. After they left, Levaco said
another program wiped out his settings. Levaco hasn't been able to
use his DSL since.
</P>
<P>
   But SBC Communications of Texas, which owns Pac Bell, says it is
on the verge of making DSL installation so simple that most
customers can install the line themselves in 30 minutes to an hour.
</P>
<P>
   In the next few weeks, the phone company plans to update its
software, revamp its &LR;   &LR; manuals and use other technology to
eliminate the need to send technicians to ``the vast majority'' of
customer homes, said Lee Culver, SBC's director of broadband
development.
</P>
<P>
   Customers in the Bay Area will be able to install DSL themselves
starting late this month or early next. To encourage
self-installation, the company plans to eventually charge customers
roughly $100 to $120 if they still want a technician to handle the
task.
</P>
<P>
   Other phone companies, including US West and Bell Atlantic,
already encourage customers to install DSL themselves with similar
financial incentives. (US West says more than 6 out of 7 customers
handle the task themselves.) And AT&AMP;T recently started
test-marketing home installation kits for its high-speed Net
service over cable television lines south of San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, the move could be a boon to Pac Bell and consumers
alike.
</P>
<P>
   Pac Bell customers often gripe about taking time off work to
wait for technicians, who sometimes show up late or miss
appointments altogether.
</P>
<P>
   And eliminating visits could save SBC tens of millions of
dollars a year. SBC says it is typically costs $100 or more to
dispatch a DSL technician to a customer's home, which adds up.
Since SBC plans to sign up 831,000 DSL customers this year and each
customer typically needs two visits, the total cost for
installation visits could exceed $166 million.
</P>
<P>
   But Pac Bell customers who've had trouble with DSL installations
doubted the phone company could make the process smooth enough for
the average customer to handle alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're just bailing on their responsibility,'' Levaco said.
``That's like when you're having trouble with your health service,
so they tell you to do your own colonoscopy.''
</P>
<P>
   Levaco also complained that Pac Bell's current manual is simply
``a thrown-together series of stapled pages.''
</P>
<P>
   And Ramos, of Half Moon Bay, said he didn't receive any manual
at all. Although his DSL works fine, Ramos said he still doesn't
know how to access his Pac Bell e-mail account. And since the
installation, he said he's had trouble shutting down his computer.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Culver insisted the new self-installation manual and
software is better than anything technicians are using today. ``SBC
has gone through extensive ... testing with very real customers in
our labs in Texas and California,'' Culver said.
</P>
<P>
   Some Pac Bell customers already say their installation is a
breeze. Art Allen in Saratoga said the technicians did the job in
30 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   In most cases, Pac Bell says customers will simply need to
insert a new, thicker phone cord (called a filter) into their phone
jacks, plug in a DSL modem, slide a networking card into their
computer slot, start the Pac Bell software and follow the prompts.
</P>
<P>
   The company also plans to set up a special tech support line to
guide customers through the installation process. The support desk
is scheduled to be open seven days a week and remain open as late
as 11 p.m. weekdays.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, SBC will offer the kits on its Web site and through
its customer service phone numbers. But ultimately, SBC hopes to
market the kits through electronics stores as well.
</P>
<P>
   Historically, Pac Bell has installed boxes that split customer
phone lines in two, one part to handle voice calls and a second to
handle the Internet connection. But Pac Bell says it can now do
that electronically from its main offices.
</P>
<P>
   The company will still have to dispatch technicians to do
``inside wiring'' if a customer's computer isn't close to a phone
jack. But generally that isn't a problem, because customers usually
already log on to the Net through their phone before ordering DSL.
</P>
<P>
   SBC says it will launch the self-installation kits in the Bay
Area in the next few weeks, then roll the service out to other
areas. But some phone companies are further ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Bell Atlantic first started letting customers install the lines
themselves in New York last summer, and expanded it to the rest of
its territory along the Eastern seaboard late last year. Nearly 4
in 5 Bell Atlantic consumers now handle DSL on their own, though
some run into problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to say that it goes smoothly for everyone,
because it doesn't,'' said spokeswoman Joan Rasmussen. But she said
customers appreciate the convenience of handling the installation
whenever they want.
</P>
<P>
   US West, which started offering self-installation kits in
October, estimates 86 to 88 percent of customers completed the
task. Another 2 percent of customers order the kits, but wind up
calling in a technician for help.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the glitches, a US West executive said phone companies
couldn't handle the growing wave of DSL orders if they had to
complete every installation themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``You cannot afford the physical resources required,'' said Matt
Rotter, who oversees US West's DSL service. ``It's not
sustainable.''
</P>
<P>
   Both US West and Bell Atlantic also waive the extra installation
fees if a customer tries to install DSL but runs into trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Cable operators, of course, also hope to save money by letting
customers handle the task themselves. Dispatching a cable
technician typically costs between $70 and $140 per visit, said
Richard Holden, an executive at Redwood City's ExciteAtHome, the
nation's largest provider of cable modem service. Cablevision, for
instance, has been aggressively promoting self-installation in New
York City, he said.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T, the dominant cable operator in the Bay Area, also began
test marketing self-installation kits in two Circuit City stores in
Mountain View and Redwood City in November.
</P>
<P>
   Customers can install the service themselves if they live in one
of 13 communities south of San Francisco, though AT&AMP;T hopes to
offer it more widely in the Bay Area this year.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Just two years ago, the NBA was a very hot sports attraction on
network television, the ratings for its playoff finals at times
eclipsing those for baseball's World Series.
</P>
<P>
   But that was the last season for Michael Jordan, the
transcendent sports star of the 1990s, and two years after his last
game the NBA has seen its popularity on network television plummet,
to the despair of its network partner, NBC.
</P>
<P>
   After spending $1.75 billion on rights for four NBA seasons
starting last season _ more than double the previous amount _ NBC
is now suffering through a terrible NBA year, particularly in prime
time, with audiences down by 20 percent. That has been enough to
send NBC's weekly prime-time ratings into a tailspin and its
overall basketball ratings down from 4.3 to 3.6 in a year. That
means the games are seen in approximately 700,000 fewer homes this
season. One week ago, on a Sunday night when the network showed a
game in prime time, NBC recorded the lowest rating for any night in
a season in the network's history.
</P>
<P>
   Now both the league and the network are talking about sharply
cutting back the number of prime-time games next season.
</P>
<P>
   What happened?
</P>
<P>
   Jordan's exit from the court is generally the main reason cited,
since ratings had generally held steady through the end of his
career. But NBA and NBC executives and advertisers mentioned an
array of factors, including the overexposure of NBA games on cable
and local stations, particularly this season; the emergence of
Tiger Woods as the sports star most like Jordan in appealing to
casual sports fans; viewer alienation after the player lockout last
season; and, more fundamentally, the growing tendency of young
players to curtail, or even forgo, college basketball careers.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed the quick movement of college players _ making it
difficult to build widely popular stars for a national audience _
is a marketing problem being blamed for what seems to be the
decline in interest. The regular-season ratings for college
basketball on CBS, the network most associated with the collegiate
sport, hit an all-time low this season, 1.9 (about 2 million
homes), although the NCAA tournament, now in progress, has been
generating ratings about on par with last season.
</P>
<P>
   But with the college game not able to establish stars through
four years of steady television appearances, both levels of the
sport have been affected, said David Stern, the NBA commissioner.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question at all that this is a factor,'' he said.
``There's a building process to exposure for these star players.''
</P>
<P>
   For years the NBA thrived on the regular arrival of pre-marketed
players, said Dick Ebersol, the president of NBC Sports. Jordan,
Magic Johnson and Larry Bird all catapulted to stardom in exciting
final games in the heavily viewed NCAA tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Now, in Jordan's wake, the NBA is increasingly faced with the
task of marketing new stars, many of whom either attended only a
year or two of college, like Allen Iverson of the Philadelphia
76ers and Vince Carter of the Toronto Raptors, or did not go to
college at all, like Kobe Bryant of the Los Angeles Lakers and
Kevin Garnett of the Minnesota Timberwolves.
</P>
<P>
   Both Stern and Ebersol repeatedly called the current season a
``transition year,'' meant to build up the host of new NBA stars

RUTGERS GAINS FINAL 16 AS DEFENSE NEVER RESTS 
</HEADLINE>

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PISCATAWAY, N.J._ Rutgers has prided itself on its defense all
season. But Sunday night against the St. Joseph's Hawks in the
second round of the National Collegiate Athletic Association
women's tournament, the Scarlet Knights outdid themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The second-seeded Scarlet Knights bullied the Hawks, they
outhustled the Hawks, and finally, they beat the Hawks, 59-39, in a
West Regional game to advance to the Round of 16 for the third
straight season.
</P>
<P>
   Rutgers (24-7) will play in Saturday's regional semifinal in
Portland, Ore., where it will face the winner of the game between
third-seeded Mississippi State and 11th-seeded Alabama-Birmingham.
</P>
<P>
   Tasha Pointer scored 16 points for Rutgers and Usha Gilmore
turned in another inspirational performance off the bench, adding
12. Gilmore received a standing ovation from the partisan crowd at
the Louis Brown Athletic Center when she left with the Knights
leading by 57-37 with 1 minute 15 seconds to play.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after, fans began to chant, ``Sweet 16, Sweet 16, Sweet
16.''
</P>
<P>
   Rutgers turned a disciplined St. Joseph's team into a wilted
mess in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   St. Joseph's (25-6), seeded 10th, kept within 4 points in the
first 20 minutes, but a 13-2 run by Rutgers put the already
cold-shooting visitors in a hole from which they could not dig out.
</P>
<P>
   Angela Zampella had 12 points for St. Joseph's and Jana
Lichnerova had 9 points.
</P>
<P>
   St. Joseph's has said it plays in a lot of physical games in the
Atlantic 10 Conference. But by early in the second half the Hawks
began showing the effects of playing against the Knights' bumping,
shadow-like defense.
</P>
<P>
   Tammy Sutton-Brown and Davalyn Cunningham muscled in for
putbacks in a 7-0 surge to extend the Knights' 4-point lead at
halftime into a 30-22 cushion with 15 minutes 35 seconds left in
the game.
</P>
<P>
   Rutgers Coach C. Vivian Stringer kept substituting to help keep
the Knights' energy level up on defense.
</P>
<P>
   In the first half, in which Rutgers scrapped to a 23-19 lead,
nobody was making shots _ inside or outside.
</P>
<P>
   From the beginning, shoulders were crunching, elbows were
flailing and fingers were poking. Ninety seconds into the game,
Jana Lichnerova of St. Joseph's took a finger in the eye while
fighting for a rebound. She began bleeding and left the game for a
few minutes before returning with a black eye.
</P>
<P>
   Each team seemed to test the limits of the referees with each
possession, and each team's shooting percentage suffered for it.
St. Joseph's shot 26 percent and Rutgers 30 percent.

BUSH NOT WIDELY KNOWN AS A REFORMER TEXAS  
</HEADLINE>

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; AUSTIN, Texas _ With the long march to November under way,
Gov. George W. Bush is arguing that his record in Texas proves he
is best suited to bring reform to Washington. He has even coined a
campaign slogan: ``A Reformer With Results.''
</P>
<P>
   Without question, Bush has been a popular governor, yet he is
not widely viewed in Texas as a reformer. Unlike Sen. John McCain
of Arizona, who bucked his own party on issues like campaign
finance and tobacco legislation, Bush is not as confrontational,
nor is he usually identified with sweeping change. His record is
largely built on compromise and his ability to build coalitions
with conservative Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's boldest effort at reform _ his 1997 plan to overhaul the
state's outdated tax code _ failed badly. The governor won plaudits
for his courage but ultimately could not leverage the ``political
capital'' he has promised to use if elected president: He could not
win the support of enough lawmakers in his own party.
</P>
<P>
   On other issues, consumer advocates complain that he often
describes as ``reforms'' actions benefiting the powerful Texas
business interests that have supported him, rather than consumers.
On the campaign trail, for example, he has portrayed himself as a
leader in reforming health maintenance organizations, yet he
resisted two important pieces of patients' rights legislation. And
his claims about the consumer benefits of tort reform _ a package
of bills that sought to curb large jury awards in civil cases _ are
disputed.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's an incremental-change specialist,'' said Bruce Buchanan,
a political scientist at the University of Texas, ``sometimes in a
partisan way, like tort reform, which is a big business issue,
sometimes in a bipartisan way, such as small changes in
education.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, Bush has found success, particularly during his
first legislative session, on initiatives he describes as reforms,
like changes in tort laws, stricter welfare rules, a crackdown on
juvenile crime, and giving more local control to public school
districts. Those efforts won Bush praise from lawmakers in both
parties, but all were popular issues before he took office.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tort reform and all those things, we were already working on
them. It was smart politically for him to take advantage of that,''
said Pete Laney, the Democratic Texas House speaker and one of the
key legislative leaders who forged a bond with Bush early on. ``He
had all those things going on during his campaign, and that was
great politics for him to use those.''
</P>
<P>
   Laney added that `reform' means very different things to
different people. Some of the 1995 tort reforms, for example,
reversed changes made during the `reform' legislative sessions of
the early 1970s, he said. `Reform is pillage and plunder if you're
against it, and it's good government if you're for it,' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Bartlett, a Bush spokesman, said the governor played crucial
roles in the passage of reforms he campaigned on in 1994, as well
as later reform initiatives. Some, like tort reform, might have
died had Gov. Ann Richards, a Democrat, been re-elected, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is able to reach across party lines to bring people
together,'' Bartlett said, adding that reforms ``are the main
reason he almost got 70 percent of the vote for his re-election.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush declared tort reform an ``emergency'' when he took office
in 1995. Business groups had laid the groundwork for the
legislation but Bush's strong support was essential. And many of
these groups were among the governor's biggest campaign
contributors.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers passed seven bills, including a centerpiece measure
that reduced the punitive damages for which businesses and other
defendants might be liable if a jury determined they had committed
wrongdoing. At the same time, the bill raised the level of proof
plaintiffs must show to win such damages.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said the laws helped rid Texas of ``junk and frivolous''
lawsuits, but others say the changes shifted the judicial balance.
</P>
<P>
   Reggie James, director of the &UR;  &LR; Austin office of Consumers Union
said, ``While it was portrayed as a fight between honest businesses
and greedy trial lawyers, the fight was really about businesses not
wanting to be held accountable when they harm consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush has credited tort reform with saving consumers and
businesses nearly $3 billion in insurance premiums, with the
biggest part coming from auto liability rates. But the mechanism
for those savings has come not from Bush's proposals but from a
provision introduced in 1995 by a Democratic legislator requiring
state officials to adjust rates ahead of time to account for the
effects of tort reform, like lower settlements for injury claims.
</P>
<P>
   And some former senior Texas insurance officials contend that
the $3 billion claim is false anyway, and that the biggest
beneficiaries of the new laws are insurers.
</P>
<P>
   ``How they can continue to claim $3 billion in tort reform
savings is baffling to me,'' said Birny Birnbaum, an Austin
consumer advocate who served as the Texas Department of Insurance's
chief economist during the administrations of both Richards and
Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Data from the state show that overall statewide premiums for
auto liability insurance stayed flat following tort reform, before
a slight dip in 1998. But insurers' profits soared because their
annual incurred losses were, on average, lowered by more than $600
million through 1998, the most recent year for which figures were
available. Five years ago, insurers incurred 70.1 cents in losses
for every dollar in premiums; in 1998, losses were 58.2 cents for
every dollar.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Montemayor, the current insurance commissioner and a Bush
appointee, said better driving habits and safer cars had played a
larger role than tort reform in raising insurance company profits.
But he acknowledged that insurers probably had received some
benefits from tort reform in 1996 and 1997, until rates were rolled
back more the next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were a little timid on the front end of this in terms of
the rate rollback because we really did not have a good feel for
the effects of tort reform,'' Montemayor said. But he added that
later ``we corrected that, and more than made up for that.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Two years after tort reform, Bush, arguing that the state taxing
system was unfair and outdated, brushed away concerns that he could
hurt himself politically and proposed the biggest restructuring in
more than three decades.
</P>
<P>
   Texas has property and sales taxes but no broad-based income
tax, and while corporations pay a form of business income tax,
partnerships do not. Bush contended that the state's booming
service-based economy was not paying its fair share, while
homeowners and industries with heavy capital spending paid too
much. He also wanted a more stable and reliable source of school
financing.
</P>
<P>
   His plan was to reduce property taxes, and pay for it mostly by
raising sales taxes and establishing a 1.25 percent tax on a
business' net income, depreciation and labor costs, minus its
capital expenditures, with the first $500,000 exempt.
</P>
<P>
   The plan drew fire from professional groups, including doctors
and lawyers, as well as retailers and other businesses with high
labor costs and low profit margins.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Among the expected winners were petrochemical companies, oil
refiners and other capital-intensive industries _ not a surprise,
perhaps, since Bush's new business tax tracked closely a proposal
offered to the governor by Charls Walker, a former Washington
lobbyist who ran a tax-advocacy organization financed mostly by
capital-intensive industries that favored the Bush plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was essentially a hidden sales tax,'' said Dick Lavine, a
senior analyst with the Center for Public Policy Priorities, a
nonprofit research group in Austin representing low-income
taxpayers. Overall, he said, the plan would take ``an already
regressive system and compound it.''
</P>
<P>
   And other, more powerful people were skeptical. The late
Democratic lieutenant governor, Bob Bullock, privately called the
plan as ``dead on arrival.''
</P>
<P>
   State lawmakers junked the Bush proposal and assembled an
alternative the governor endorsed, but Bush was later unable to
persuade enough Senate Republicans to vote his way as legislators
tried to reconcile differences between the House and Senate
versions. Late in the session, Bush salvaged a $1 billion property
tax cut financed by the state's budget surplus. In 1999, Bush made
no effort to resurrect tax reform, instead seeking _ and getting _
more tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bush could have put his political capital on the line'' to get
the tax plan passed, said Bill White, the former chairman of the
Texas Democratic Party, noting that another governor might have
threatened to campaign against dissenting legislators or made a
broader appeal to the public. But he didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Bartlett, the Bush spokesman, said: ``When times are relatively
calm, it's difficult to persuade people to change. He understood
that going in, and he was ultimately proud of what we did
accomplish.''
</P>
<P>
   It is the tax cuts, not his failure at tax reform, that Bush
mentions on the campaign trail. He has also taken to boasting about
his role in reforming health care in Texas, a role that many in
Austin say is greatly exaggerated.
</P>
<P>
   One commercial for Bush says that while Congress deadlocked over
health care legislation, ``he passed a patients' bill of rights.''
But people involved in the process note that in 1995 Bush vetoed
the first Texas patient protection bill, and two years later he
considered vetoing the most groundbreaking HMO bill that Texas
lawmakers had debated.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he wants to say, `I reformed the tort system,' then that's
fair game,'' said James, the consumer advocate, ``but if he wants
to say he reformed health care, that's a different animal. The
reforms happened despite him, not because of him.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The 1995 patient protection bill included provisions requiring
annual report cards for health maintenance organizations and forced
HMOs to provide necessary emergency-room care. Today, Bush says he
vetoed the bill because of unfair exemptions it gave certain HMOs.
But in his veto proclamation he also mentioned other concerns:
``numerous new regulations on managed care organizations,''
including HMOs, and higher costs for employers.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, the governor instructed the insurance commissioner to
draft rules that covered much of what the bill did. Consumer groups
objected strongly to the veto, but they praised the commissioner's
rules. The issue resurfaced in 1997, when the legislature codified
those rules and passed an expanded patient-protection package.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest battle, though, was over a bill to make Texas the
first state to allow patients to sue for malpractice HMOs that deny
necessary medical care. Bush warned of a veto, and his resistance
brought his staff into conflict with one of his staunchest
Republican allies, Sen. David Sibley, the bill's sponsor.
</P>
<P>
   On the Senate floor, Sibley complained about the governor's
staff, saying, I can't make them happy no matter what I do, unless
I completely gut the bill.'' Sibley did not back away from that
comment in an interview, but he described Bush as a leader on
health care issues, saying he was supportive of the other
patient-protection measures passed in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Some other legislators involved have different recollections.
Patricia Gray, a Democratic House member who sponsored a bill
requiring HMOs to allow women direct access to their
obstetrician-gynecologist without having to first see a
gatekeeper'' physician _ a measure Bush has touted as a key HMO
reform _does not recall the governor, or his staff, providing any
help on the bill. I have no recollection of him being involved
whatsoever,'' Gray said.
</P>
<P>
   That bill's senate sponsor, Florence Shapiro, a Republican, said
Bush's office did weigh in while the bill was in a senate
committee, and that he was supportive.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, lawmakers overwhelmingly approved the right-to-sue
bill, and Bush, who might have faced an embarrassing override vote
had he vetoed the bill, allowed it to become law without his
signature. His spokesman, Bartlett, said Bush became more
comfortable with the bill after provisions were added reducing the
likelihood of a flood of new lawsuits, including a requirement that
disputes first be reviewed by an independent panel.
</P>
<P>
   Kim Ross, chief lobbyist for the Texas Medical Association,
described Bush's evolution on health care issues as a ``baptism by
fire.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He was on a steep learning curve,'' Ross said. ``You have to
give him credit for traveling a pretty far philosophical distance
in such a short period.''

LAVIN'S POSITIVE ATTITUDE INSPIRES BRUINS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ UCLA basketball coach Steve Lavin has made all the
right moves in recent weeks. He tweaked the offense to improve
rhythm and flow. He put the defense in attack mode, and he injected
practice with heavy doses of efficiency and intensity.
</P>
<P>
   But nothing Lavin has done tactically can match what he did
psychologically - or didn't do.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't lose faith.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't dwell on defeat.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't let the Bruins give up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where coach Lavin is really gifted is that when the team was
down after the Arizona trip, he made sure to be up,'' said UCLA
assistant Michael Holton. ``That level of leadership guided us
through the toughest time.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins were swept by the Arizona schools in mid-February and
dropped to 13-11 overall and 4-8 in the Pacific-10. They had lost
six of seven games. Their NCAA Tournament chances were fading. The
players were confused. The fans were angry. The season was in the
balance.
</P>
<P>
   A month later, the Bruins are preparing for Thursday's showdown
against Iowa State - their third Sweet 16 appearance in four years.
They have won eight straight, they pounded Maryland in the second
round,and they are one of the hottest teams in the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   By any standard, it's been a remarkable turnaround.
</P>
<P>
   Well, almost any.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coach Lavin just stayed positive with us, because that's his
personality,'' freshman Jason Kapono said. ``He could be faced with
(hate mail), and he'd find something positive in it. He stayed
confident in us. His message was: `Times are bad and people are
counting us out. But we're a pretty good team.' ''
</P>
<P>
   On the surface, Lavin's message made no sense: the Bruins had
just lost two games by 44 points. Their ballhandling was atrocious.
Their shot selection was awful. They appeared to quit against
Arizona State. They played scared at Arizona. They were alternating
between two offensive philosophies (motion and structure) and two
defenses (zone and man-to-man). They certainly didn't look like ``a
pretty good team.''
</P>
<P>
   But the players had three reasons to believe:
</P>
<P>
   --Lavin had evidence. He gathered the Bruins in their locker
room in Pauley Pavilion and rolled videotape of their victories
over NCAA Tournament-bound teams DePaul, Pepperdine, Purdue and
North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we hadn't had those reference points, it would have been
difficult to keep the guys up,'' assistant coach Jim Saia said.
``But we were able to go to the film and show them.''
</P>
<P>
   --The problems were obvious. UCLA committed 45 turnovers in the
two games and took a slew of bad shots; both flaws led to easy
baskets for the opponents. Correct the mistakes, Lavin implored,
and the outcome would be different.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was so bad, they were laughing at themselves,'' Saia said.
``We were literally handing the other team the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   --The coaches saw what the players (and fans and media) did not
- that the Bruins were improving. They were recognizing defenses
quicker and executing the complicated offense more efficiently.
They were reacting more and thinking less, a sign of evolving
comprehension.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coach Lavin said, `You can't see it, but the staff sees it,'
'' Holton said. ``We were finding ways to counter what the defenses
were doing. We saw their poise and their resiliency improving over
the course of weeks. Coach Lavin told them, `You're right there.
Don't take a step back. Don't leave your game in the desert.'
</P>
<P>
   ``He reduced their focus from the big picture to the small
picture so they had something to feel good about.''
</P>
<P>
   Discouraged, the Bruins jumped on every morsel of optimism
available. Lavin is optimism incarnate.
</P>
<P>
   ``During the down times, coach Lavin was always positive with
us,'' guard Ryan Bailey said. ``He told us there would be brighter
days.''
</P>
<P>
   Those brighter days have arrived.

WHITE HOUSE SEEKS TO CURB USE OF RITALIN, PROZAC, OTHER SUCH DRUGS
BY CHILDREN 
</HEADLINE>
   (SUBS for two-sentence insert in 5th graf.)  
 (Exclusive)  
(mk) 
 By ROBERT PEAR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The White House will announce a major effort on
Monday to reverse a sharp increase in the number of preschool
children using Ritalin, Prozac and other powerful psychiatric
drugs, administration officials said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the initiative, they said, the government will inform
parents and teachers about the risks of such drugs, the Food and
Drug Administration will develop new drug labels, the National
Institutes of Health will begin a huge nationwide study of Ritalin
use in children under the age of 6, and the White House will hold a
conference this fall on the diagnosis and treatment of mental
illness in very young children.
</P>
<P>
   Hillary Rodham Clinton and federal health officials plan to meet
on Monday with parents, psychiatrists, pediatricians,
psychologists, nurses and social workers to discuss the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Then the administration plans to issue a statement declaring
that ``the use of medication is not generally the first option for
a preschool child with a psychiatric disorder.''
</P>
<P>
   In a study last month in the Journal of the American Medical
Association, researchers reported that there had apparently been a
sharp increase in the number of preschoolers taking psychotropic
drugs, particularly stimulants like Ritalin and antidepressants
like Prozac. Ritalin is called a stimulant because it belongs to a
family of drugs that stimulate the central nervous system and
increase a person's alertness and ability to pay attention.
Researchers say that 20 percent of white boys are taking the drug
in some suburban school districts.
</P>
<P>
   The study caused concern among parents and medical experts
alike, and the administration is now trying to address that
concern.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Dr. Steven E. Hyman, director of the National
Institute of Mental Health, said, ``As a rule of thumb, doctors,
psychologists and social workers should attempt to modify the
behavior of a child and deal with family crises before drugs are
prescribed.''
</P>
<P>
   The government has prepared a new guide for parents on the
treatment of young children with mental disorders. ``When
medication is used, it should not be the only strategy,'' but
should be part of an overall treatment plan, the guide says.
Parents and doctors may want to consider behavioral therapy for the
child, family therapy and other techniques to help manage the
child's symptoms, the document says.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said the initiative was inspired mainly
by Hillary Rodham Clinton, who they said wanted to announce some
immediate steps after seeing the immense public concern about the
use of powerful pills to treat toddlers with emotional and
behavioral disorders.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is running for the U.S. Senate in New York, but White
House officials said it would be cynical to believe that her
motives were only political. They noted that for years she has been
interested in children's issues, including the testing and labeling
of drugs for children. Health officials and medical experts said
the government's concern was well founded.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything Mrs. Clinton does is related to her campaign, but
this initiative has substance too,'' a federal health official
said. ``We want doctors and parents to think about these issues.''
</P>
<P>
   In an editorial in the Journal of the American Medical
Association last month, Dr. Joseph T. Coyle, chairman of the
psychiatry department at Harvard Medical School, said that children
with behavioral disorders were ``increasingly subjected to quick
and inexpensive pharmacologic fixes,'' even though ``there is no
empirical evidence to support psychotropic drug treatment in very
young children.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Ritalin carries a warning that says, ``Ritalin should
not be used in children under 6 years, since safety and efficacy in
this age group have not been established.''
</P>
<P>
   Hyman said that the National Institute of Mental Health would
spend $6 million in the next five years to study whether Ritalin
was safe and effective in treating preschoolers with the impulsive,
aggressive behavior traits known as attention deficit hyperactivity
disorder _ the most commonly diagnosed psychiatric disorder in
children.
</P>
<P>
   In the study, Hyman said, hundreds of girls and boys at research
centers around the country will receive Ritalin, behavior therapy
or some combination of the two.
</P>
<P>
   Hyman said that the problem was not simply that children were
being overmedicated, but that they were not being appropriately
evaluated and treated. ``In some communities,'' he said, ``too few
children are receiving medications, just as in other communities,
too many are getting medications.''
</P>
<P>
   Government scientists said that they recognized that drug
therapy could sometimes provide relief to young children. ``If a
kid is engaged in aggressive behavior, self-mutilation, head
banging, and is otherwise uncontrollable, you should try
medication,'' Hyman said.
</P>
<P>
   Certain drugs are widely prescribed for young children even
though they have not been studied, approved or labeled for such
use. The FDA does not regulate the practice of medicine; after a
drug is approved for one purpose, doctors often prescribe it for
other purposes.
</P>
<P>
   The White House said, for example, that some medications used to
treat depression and anxiety disorders in children, like Paxil,
Prozac and Wellbutrin, were not labeled for pediatric use.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the White House said, Zoloft has been approved to
treat obsessive-compulsive disorder in children 6 and older, while
Luvox has been approved for the same condition in children 8 and
older. But both drugs are used in younger children.
</P>
<P>
   Drug labels often do not specify the proper doses for children.
The White House said that the food and drug agency would soon
specify how drug companies should conduct the research needed to
develop ``pediatric dosage information'' that can be included on
the labels of Ritalin, clonidine and other drugs used to treat
hyperactivity and other attention deficit disorders in young
children.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Jane E. Henney, the commissioner of food and drugs, said
that in the last year her agency had sent letters to seven
companies asking them to study the effects of antidepressants in
young people 7 to 18 years old. The government, she said, is
analyzing ways in which research on younger children can be
scientifically and ethically conducted.
</P>
<P>
   Hyman said: ``Lots of mood disorders and anxiety disorders begin
in childhood. But the younger a child is, the more difficult it is
to make a diagnosis of mental disorder with certainty. It is quite
difficult to diagnose attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in
children under 6 because they are usually not articulate, their
brains and behavior are changing rapidly, and they are very
reactive to their environment.''

CHARLOTTA SORENSTAM HALTS STREAK AND SISTER 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ Charlotta Sorenstam emerged from two shadows Sunday,
stopping Karrie Webb's streak of three straight LPGA tour victories
and beating her older sister, Annika Sorenstam, with a final-round
68 to win the first tour event of her career.
</P>
<P>
   Charlotta Sorenstam outplayed Webb, the world's top-ranked
player, down the stretch of the Standard Register Ping tournament
at the Legacy Golf Resort, saving par several times to retain a
one-stroke lead until the last hole, where she sank a short birdie
putt and shared an emotional moment with family members. She saved
the longest embrace for Annika, the winner of 19 tour events, who
has already qualified for the LPGA Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tears of joy,'' Charlotta Sorenstam said.
</P>
<P>
   She finished at 12-under-par 276 to win by two shots over Webb
(70) and by five over her sister, who finished with a 73. Leta
Lindley shot 70 and Carin Koch carded 72 to tie for fourth place at
282.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would have been nice for Karrie to win and match Tiger, but
I still wanted to stop her,'' Charlotta Sorenstam said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I gave it my best shot,'' said Webb, who fell short of tying
Nancy Lopez's record of five consecutive victories in 1978. ``I
still finished second and still had a chance to win. I had good
chances all the way through _ birdie chances on just about every
hole. I didn't make the putts down the stretch. I've made my fair
share of putts, but one day they weren't going to drop, and this
was the week it happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Sorenstam threw down par-saving putts. At No. 13, she
sank a 10-footer after blowing a wedge over the green. At No. 15,
with Webb's ball resting 2 feet from a birdie, Sorenstam salvaged
par with a brilliant sand shot that stopped a foot from the hole
and prevented a two-stroke swing.
</P>
<P>
   Now tied at 11 under par, she made par again with an 8-foot putt
at No. 16 after Webb hit the shot that arguably cost her the
tournament. Webb put her approach shot in a bunker and faced a
tricky lie in the sand. But she bladed her next effort past the
flag stick to the back fringe, chipped 20 feet past the hole and
missed the putt coming back. ``I just hit a shank,'' Webb said.
</P>
<P>
   The bogey left her one stroke behind with two holes left. Both
players made par at No. 17, before Webb hit into a bunker at No. 18
and watched as Sorenstam clinched her victory with a birdie.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't have a chance, but she played awesome,'' a tearful
Annika Sorenstam said of her sister. ``I'm so proud of her. She's
always been in my shadow, and now she's broken through. I'm more
happy for her because I know what she has gone through, with
everyone comparing her to me. I just wanted her to play her own
game because I knew she was good enough to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Fortunes changed quickly as Webb and the Sorenstam sisters
approached the turn.
</P>
<P>
   Charlotta Sorenstam seemed unflappable as she reached 11 under
par and took a brief four-stroke lead with a birdie at the par-5
eighth hole. Webb answered immediately, rolling in a 6-foot putt
and dropping to eight under. At the par-4 ninth, Charlotta
Sorenstam hit her tee shot into a bunker and took bogey.
</P>
<P>
   Webb made an easy par on that hole, then sank a 6-footer for
birdie at No. 10 to cut the lead to one stroke.
</P>
<P>
   They matched birdies again at the par-5 12th, before Webb tied
her with a short birdie putt at No. 15.
</P>
<P>
   Annika Sorenstam, bidding for her second straight victory, never
recovered from consecutive bogeys at Nos. 9 and 10.
</P>
<P>
   She made one birdie and one bogey coming home, but missed
several other opportunities. It was a surprising slide for her
considering she has won 14 of 23 tournaments in which she has had
the final-round lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Charlotta just made some great shots,'' Webb said. ``She was
solid as a rock. Her putts, they didn't hit the lip and go in. They
were dead center all day.'' &QL;

 &HT;    U.S. district judge bars release of Waco re-enactment video
 &HT;    By Mark England
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT HOOD, Texas _ Once again Sunday, at about 11 a.m., tanks
rolled not far from Waco while overhead aircraft recorded their
actions.
</P>
<P>
   In about three hours, the court-ordered test at Fort Hood to
determine whether flashes on an infrared video taken at Mount
Carmel on April 19, 1993, were caused by gunshots or glint was
over.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Walter S. Smith Jr. of Waco, however, barred
release of the video. The court-appointed expert, Vector Data
Systems Ltd., will release its report on the test video in about a
month.
</P>
<P>
   Houston attorney Mike Caddell had promised to release the tape
to the media today. Caddell is the lead attorney in a
wrongful-death lawsuit filed against the government by surviving
Branch Davidians and relatives of those who died at Mount Carmel.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can talk about it,'' Caddell said at a press conference
outside Fort Hood's main gate. ``We'll still give you our analysis.
We just won't be able to show you the tape.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither Caddell nor Michael Bradford, U.S. attorney for the
Eastern District of Texas, said they had any inside knowledge of
what the test will show.
</P>
<P>
   However, both men expressed confidence it will support their
view of events.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the tape comes out I'm confident it will be so different
from the tape of the 19th that it will put this issue to rest,''
Bradford said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only explanation they've offered for the flashes is glint
from debris,'' Caddell said. ``I know we're not going to get
flashes from debris that looks like the flashes from the 19th.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Bradford and Caddell were supposed to receive digital
copies of the video for study late Sunday. They will release their
analysis of the test video and how it compares with the
Forward-Looking infrared (FLIR) video from Mount Carmel sometime
Monday .
</P>
<P>
   Buses took observers, but no media, to a remote site at Fort
Hood about 15 miles from the front gate, according to a Fort Hood
public information officer. Smith, Special Counsel John Danforth,
congressional investigators and members of the Texas Rangers were
among those in attendance.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a part of the base that was lonely, desolate and took
us about an hour to get to,'' Caddell said. ``We had to go through
three checkpoints.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradford said he was concentrating too intently on the test
protocol to sum up the atmosphere at the site.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we were all trying to see if the test was carried out
in accordance with the protocol,'' Bradford said. ``Those were the
issues I was thinking about rather than anything else.''
</P>
<P>
   The test was scheduled to start at 10:30 a.m. Sunday. But it
took until after 11 a.m. for the temperature to warm up over 65
degrees, one of the test protocols. After lying on the ground for
20 minutes, eight shooters arose and went to a spot where there was
an M-16 rifle, a CAR-15 rifle, two 9 mm MP-5 submachine guns (one
suppressed), a Remington automatic shotgun, a Browning 88 9 mm
pistol, a M60 machine gun and an MK-19 automatic grenade launcher.
</P>
<P>
   Caddell said the last two weapons, which were supposed to be
used at the conclusion of the test, were late additions to the
start of the test.
</P>
<P>
   The shooters fired single shots first at a target 10 yards away.
Later, they also fired at a 30-yard target. When the shooters
finished, the protocol called for them to place their weapons down
and go to the rear of a Bradley fighting vehicle and a combat
engineering vehicle. From inside the Bradley, a shooter armed with
an M-79 grenade launcher was to appear, stand next to the vehicle
and fire two ferret rounds of tear gas, two M-651 rounds and two
flashbang rounds at the farthest target.
</P>
<P>
   Both the beginning and end of the test were developed to
determine whether people can appear invisible to the FLIR camera.
Plaintiffs had argued that the reason no people are seen in the
Mount Carmel FLIR is that they may have worn FLIR-resistant
clothing or they may have been on the ground and their body
temperature reflected that of the soil. The shooters Sunday wore a
variety of camouflage outfits, including a sniper outfit with
vegetation adornment and a Noxex flight suit, which was won by
members of the FBI's hostage rescue team.
</P>
<P>
   However, Caddell said Sunday that government agents can be seen
in the original FLIR. He promised to release photographs today
Monday proving his claim.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides tried to frame what they see as the key question to
be answered by the analysis of the test video.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first issue is can we see people in the tape,'' Bradford
said. ``As you know, the people firing weapons were wearing the
clothing that it's been alleged will make you invisible on the FLIR
tape.''
</P>
<P>
   Caddell saw it differently.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the comparative analysis that will be the most
meaningful is whether the flashes were generated by gunfire or
trash,'' he said. ``Which one most looks like the flashes from the
FLIR of April 19th. Don't let this be about people. That's not the
real debate.''
</P>
<P>
   The press conference Sunday had a subplot. Davidian Clive Doyle,
who was injured in the fire, vented anger at Caddell, whom he
claimed had written letters to Davidians asking them to drop out of
the case. Doyle is represented in the lawsuit by Ramsey Clark, a
former U.S. attorney general.
</P>
<P>
   Caddell denied the charge, although he told Doyle that he
wouldn't divulge his correspondence with clients.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to comment on confidential attorney-client
communications,'' Caddell said. ``That's not appropriate and you
know it.''
</P>
<P>
   Doyle also was frustrated that Caddell wanted to stage a
re-enactment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have a lot of confidence in the re-enactment,'' Doyle
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Branch Davidians and their lawyers exposed to the public
... that the initial FLIR shows gunfire. They're out here to prove
it doesn't.''
</P>
<P>
   At the end of a long drawn-out day, Caddell said there was one
bit of humor. The FBI's so-called Nightstalker plane, which carried
the FLIR camera and was called top secret by the government in
fighting the re-enactment, buzzed the test site after it was over.
</P>
<P>
   ``So all that hurrah about classified information and we
couldn't see the Nightstalker apparently went out the window,''
Caddell said.

RIVAL BUSINESS-POACHER REACHES INTO NEW JERSEY 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By CHARLES V. BAGLI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BETHLEHEM, Pa. _ After years of luring New York City jobs and
companies across the Hudson River with promises of cheap real
estate, lower taxes and tax breaks, New Jersey now finds that an
interloper on its western flank is wooing manufacturers,
distributors and back offices to the Lehigh Valley of northeastern
Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of companies based in New Jersey have moved at least some
of their operations across the Delaware River to a 30-mile stretch
of corn fields, turkey farms and dormant steel mills encompassing
Easton, Bethlehem and Fogelsville.
</P>
<P>
   Improving on a page from New Jersey's playbook, Pennsylvania
state officials and Lehigh Valley Economic Development Corp. are
offering even cheaper real estate, even lower taxes and even more
tax breaks.
</P>
<P>
   While New Jersey has chased blue-chip marquees from the New York
Yankees to the New York Stock Exchange, the Lehigh Valley has
opened its network of 42 industrial and corporate parks to all
companies large and small, well known and obscure.
</P>
<P>
   Fully one-third of the 216 companies that moved to Lehigh Valley
or expanded there over the last four years were from New Jersey or
New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hunter has become the hunted,'' said Linda Dow, a real
estate consultant for Insignia/ESG who has advised clients like
Aiwa America Inc. and Organon Inc. on moves to the Lehigh Valley.
``Many Fortune 500 companies are now considering the Lehigh Valley
as a true alternative, not just a stalking horse for a better deal
in New Jersey.''
</P>
<P>
   The companies may not be as glamorous as Goldman, Sachs, and few
companies are moving their headquarters from New Jersey, but they
are moving other operations.
</P>
<P>
   After scouring New Jersey for a new regional distribution
center, Aiwa, the consumer electronics manufacturer based in
Mahwah, N.J., took a look at the Lehigh Valley, where it found
helpful officials and a less expensive deal.
</P>
<P>
   The company moved into a new 407,000-square-foot building in
Allentown, Pa., in May 1999 and pulled out of three smaller
distribution centers in its home state.
</P>
<P>
   Vertek Corp., a software and computer network provider based in
Murray Hill, N.J., opened a $6.5 million service center in
Bethlehem in 1999 that is expected to employ 170 people. The
company received $600,000 in job training grants and tax credits
from the state.
</P>
<P>
   Organon, a pharmaceutical company based in West Orange, N.J.,
opened a small distribution center in Allentown in 1986 and has
expanded three times, most recently in 1999 when it added a
packaging plant.
</P>
<P>
   Russell Stanley, of Red Bank, N.J., opened a manufacturing plant
in Allentown in 1999 for plastic drums used by the food and drug
industries.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've targeted northern New Jersey and New York and specific
industries,'' said Sara Anderson-Greer, vice president of marketing
for Lehigh Valley Economic Development Corp. ``We're actively
marketing the area, meeting with site advisers and building an
infrastructure to accommodate them.''
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to the war between the states. It makes little
difference that the governors of all three states are Republicans.
Like their counterparts in California, Alabama and Minnesota, the
governors and the local development corporations are chasing jobs
and political glory.
</P>
<P>
   No one has made a more concerted effort than Gov. Tom Ridge of
Pennsylvania and officials in the Lehigh Valley, where even the
giant Bethlehem Steel works, where 30,000 steelworkers once labored
over the coke ovens and steel furnaces, is being converted into a
1,600-acre office and industrial park.
</P>
<P>
   The parks allow companies to build almost immediately after
signing a deal for office space, a warehouse or a manufacturing
plant. Employers can then tap into a network of a dozen technical
schools, colleges and universities in the valley for trained
employees. Local economic development officials and the governor's
``action team'' aggressively court companies, acting as promoters
and expediters.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Bachenberg, founder of DBS International, which designs and
supplies computer hardware for business customers, recently moved
his company to Bethlehem from Flemington, N.J., after he received a
$1.05 million low-interest loan from the state to buy an existing
building. As it turned out, three-quarters of his staff already
lived in Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   Like the owners of many small and medium-size businesses in New
York and New Jersey, he had felt ignored by officials who were more
interested in large employers with hundreds of employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here the local government welcomed us with open arms,'' said
Bachenberg, whose company has 30 employees. ``We closed on the
purchase of our building in the morning, we had a building permit
by noon and they started renovations that afternoon. In New Jersey,
we'd still be waiting for a permit.''
</P>
<P>
   For a variety of reasons, taxes, real estate and labor costs are
lower in Pennsylvania. State officials have added further
enticements or ``tools,'' ranging from tax credits and job training
to cash grants from the governor's discretionary opportunity fund.
</P>
<P>
   Companies that move to one of the year-old Keystone Opportunity
Zones, like the one in Lehigh Valley, may not have to pay any state
or local taxes for up to 12 years.
</P>
<P>
   According to local real estate executives, the state is close to
deals for two major projects, offices for a major pharmaceutical
company with about 350 jobs and an old-line insurance company, both
based on the east side of the Delaware River.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we've got a toolbox that's as good as anybody's,''
said Sam McCullough, secretary of the Pennsylvania Department of
Community and Economic Development. ``We're doing our best to make
sure Pennsylvania gets its share or more. We're trying to create an
environment that makes it easier and much more profitable to move
into Pennsylvania.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Gerald Janssen, senior vice president at the New Jersey
Department of Commerce and Economic Growth, was not fazed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We bump into them at different economic forums nationally,''
Janssen said. ``They're aggressive, but all the states are
aggressive and looking for their fair share of jobs. We don't see
anything to be alarmed about.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the state had done very well with its own toolbox of
incentives, which he said was one reason the investment banks from
New York had been building back-office space in Jersey City.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey's Business Employment Incentive Program offered new
and expanding companies steep rebates on employee income taxes,
which are often worth millions of dollars, though many corporate
executives complained that New Jersey did not offer subsidies to
existing businesses with fewer than 300 jobs.
</P>
<P>
   The Regional Plan Association, anti-tax groups and many
economists contend that special tax breaks or subsidies are not a
major factor in the decision of any company to relocate and are
therefore a waste of resources. Aiwa, for instance, did not get any
tax breaks. A company may move to be closer to its customers, its
employees or a generally lower-cost environment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The subsidies can turn out to be give-aways,'' said James
Hughes, dean of the School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers
University. ``In many cases, you're providing a bonus for someone
who would've taken the same course of action anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Some state officials agreed but argued that the competition for
jobs was so fierce that they could not unilaterally disarm.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless you can have an armed truce among all the states,''
Janssen said, ``everybody has to continue to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   So, like big-game hunters, Pennsylvania and New Jersey officials
swap tales about the trophies on their respective walls:
Pennsylvania attracted 216 companies to the Lehigh Valley alone in
the last four years, which accounted for 21,000 jobs and $1 billion
in investment.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey counters with numbers showing that 116 companies
moved to the state in 1998 _ 50 from New York and 17 from
Pennsylvania _ and were expected to generate 10,600 jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the companies are remarkably similar to those moving
from New Jersey to Pennsylvania: manufacturing and distribution
centers, as well as the investment banking jobs in Jersey City,
N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Corporate border-hopping dates from the early 1900s, when silk
manufacturers in Paterson, N.J., fled to Pennsylvania one step
ahead of union organizers.
</P>
<P>
   But the opening of Interstate 78 in 1989 provided a fast entry
to the Lehigh Valley, and when the economy picked up in the
mid-1990s, New Jersey companies began barreling down the highway to
Allentown and Bethlehem, where the industrial parks had been under
construction for years. New York is 90 minutes away; Philadelphia,
60 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the patterns of development would be a heck of a
lot different if we abolished each and every subsidy,'' Hughes
said.
</P>
<P>
   Many builders expect even more interest from New Jersey
companies when Pennsylvania extends Route 33 from Interstate 80 to
Interstate 78.
</P>
<P>
   ``I consider the Lehigh Valley an extension of the New York
metropolitan area,'' said Jim Petrucci, an industrial developer
active on both sides of the Delaware River. ``The ready land is the
single most important economic tool. If you can come in and build
quickly, it presents a tremendous opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   Liberty Property Trust, a national developer, has built 8
million square feet of space in Lehigh Valley, the horizontal
equivalent of the World Trade Center, and more is on the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the distribution market is going to continue to
grow,'' said Peter Eppy, executive vice president of SJB
Properties, a developer active in the Lehigh Valley as well as
Jersey City and Parsippany, N.J., ``and I think the office market
will be a big growth area.''

EX-GOVERNOR OF MASSACHUSETTS CASTS EYES ON ALBANY
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: N.Y., Mass., Tenn., N.C.)   (jw) 
 By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It might seem hard to imagine what significance the
life of Sam Houston, the legendary 19th-century Southern statesman,
might have for a blue-blood Yankee like William F. Weld, the former
Massachusetts governor who is now a lawyer and venture capitalist
living on Manhattan's Upper East Side.
</P>
<P>
   But with Weld, who was born on Long Island, back in New York and
talking about running for governor here in 2006, the comparison
made perfect sense to his friend Lamar Alexander, the former
governor of Tennessee, who immediately promised to send him a Sam
Houston biography.
</P>
<P>
   If he were to run and win, Weld would become the only American
to serve as governor of two different states other than Sam
Houston, who was governor of Tennessee from 1827 to 1829 and
governor of Texas from 1859 to 1861. And the similarities would not
end there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only was he governor of two states, but he resigned from
both of them on principle,'' Weld said, smiling as he recounted a
recent telephone conversation with Alexander. ``I said, `Oh,
really; he was a quitter like me.' And Lamar said, `Yes, but a
quitter on principle.' &UR;  &LR; ''
</P>
<P>
   Weld did not exactly quit the Massachusetts State House on
principle, but rather out of restlessness. After a failed bid to
unseat Sen. John F. Kerry in 1996, he resigned to pursue a curious,
ill-fated quest to become ambassador to Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   When that collapsed _ his nomination quashed by a fellow
Republican, Sen. Jesse Helms of North Carolina, who opposed Weld's
liberal views on social issues _ he joined a Boston law firm,
McDermott, Will &AMP; Emery. Late last year, he was asked to head the
firm's New York office.
</P>
<P>
   It is a job in which Weld professes to be content, even as he
talks openly about the possibility of a return to public service in
time for the 2006 governor's race _ the first one he would be
eligible to enter after meeting the state's five-year residency
requirement.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very comfortable niche right here,'' he said in an
interview in his small corner office overlooking Rockefeller
Center. But he has never had much patience for comfort. He quit his
first law firm, for example, dropping off partner track to join the
staff of the House Judiciary Committee during the Watergate
hearings.
</P>
<P>
   Already, he has begun to surface in Republican circles at the
highest levels, most recently last month at a fund-raising strategy
session at the ``21'' Club in Manhattan with supporters of Gov.
George W. Bush, including Gov. George E. Pataki.
</P>
<P>
   But while he did register to vote in New York in time for the
presidential primary on March 7, he has not yet taken an active
role in local politics and did not join state Republicans for a
rally after the Bush victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been in airplanes for the last week,'' he said a few
days after the primary, recounting recent business trips: ``Palm
Beach, Nashville, Chicago, New York, Boston, New York, Boston, New
York.''
</P>
<P>
   Weld said he expected his role to be limited to fund-raising for
the near future. He is a Bush campaign ``Pioneer,'' the campaign's
designation for those who have helped raised more than $100,000 for
the Texas governor. He said he had also offered to make telephone
calls on behalf of Bush.
</P>
<P>
   From his days in Massachusetts, Weld is well armed to help his
friends, with a ready list of about 30,000 dependable campaign
contributors who supported him in the past.
</P>
<P>
   He is also planning to lend a hand to the bid of Mayor Rudolph
W. Giuliani o f New York for U.S. Senate. ``There are not too many
people who can go on TV and say, `You know, I am a friend of
Hillary Rodham's for 25 years standing but I am telling you we have
got to have Giuliani in there,' '' he said. He is planning to
organize a fund-raising dinner for Giuliani in Boston, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Weld and the mayor have been friends since the mid-1980s, when
Giuliani was associate attorney general at the Justice Department
and helped Weld be appointed as U.S. attorney in Massachusetts.
They campaigned with each other in their previous races.
</P>
<P>
   ``I frankly love the idea of Rudy getting down there in the
Senate and chewing on everybody's leg,'' Weld said. ``He would not
let people get away with the palaver and chaff that passes for
political speeches in Washington these days.''
</P>
<P>
   If Bush went on to win the White House, Weld said he would be
unlikely to accept a post in the administration. ``It's too soon,''
he said. Even if he were eligible to run for governor in 2002, Weld
said he might not be ready.

</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, William Floyd Weld spends his days exploring
venture capital investments and contemplating leveraged buyouts of
education companies. While he is a trained lawyer _ Harvard Law
School, Class of 1970 _ and a former federal prosecutor, his role
now is as a power broker and rainmaker.
</P>
<P>
   He is also at work on his third political mystery novel. ``I
like to range from side to side, law, business, writing, and I
don't have to travel to avoid being bored,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   If and when he decided to return to government, he said he would
set his sights on Albany and a job that would fit his background
and interests. ``It would be a kind of a waste to run for an office
where the upstate and suburban experience would not be all that
relevant,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, New York is a far more natural place for Weld than
Boston or Cambridge, where he still owns a home. He is a namesake
of William Floyd, one of four signers of the Declaration of
Independence from New York, and he grew up on his family's 600-acre
farm in Smithtown, on Long Island.
</P>
<P>
   His great-grandfather, Francis Minot Weld, founded the
white-shoe Manhattan investment bank of White, Weld &AMP; Co., which
was bought by Merrill Lynch in 1978. His wife, Susan Roosevelt
Weld, also a native New Yorker, is a great-granddaughter of
Theodore Roosevelt.
</P>
<P>
   It is unlikely that Weld, by the end of his career, will have
held as many public offices as his new hero, Sam Houston, who, in
addition to being governor twice, was attorney general in
Tennessee, president of the Texas Republic, a congressman and
three-term U.S. senator. All this, as well as having been an Army
officer, diplomatic attache to several Indian nations and the
runner-up for the presidential nomination of the National Union
Party in 1860. But it would be out of character for Weld not to try
to come close.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sam Houston got bored just like you,'' Lamar Alexander told
him in their phone conversation. ``He went to live with the Indians
and he hunted game and chased Indian princesses.'' To which Weld
replied, ``Maybe the Oneontas or the Oneidas would take me in
upstate. They have some pretty good revenues from gaming and I'm
pro-gaming, and this business of 100 percent hunting game and
Indian princesses doesn't sound all bad.''

BERTRAND FOX, 92, AN ECONOMIST AND SECURITIES EXPERT AT HARVARD 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By PATRICK McGEEHAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bertrand Fox, an economist and expert on the securities industry
who taught for more than 20 years at the Harvard Business School,
died March 14 at his home in Lexington, Mass. He was 92.
</P>
<P>
   Fox, who lived in Lexington for 45 years, was the business
school's director of research from 1953 to 1968.
</P>
<P>
   During that time, he redirected the school's research, which had
relied almost exclusively on case studies, toward more systematic
analysis, said J. Keith Butters, who was a close friend and fellow
member of the school's faculty.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a very ticklish assignment because it involved
challenging a lot of vested practices,'' Butters said. Fox managed
it by ``being tactful and absolutely fair and careful in everything
that he did,'' Butters said.
</P>
<P>
   Drawing on expertise he developed as an adviser to a group of
investment banks that the federal government sued unsuccessfully on
antitrust grounds, Fox later reintroduced investment banking to the
Harvard curriculum. In 1967, he became the first person to hold the
Jacob H. Schiff Chair of Investment Banking; 12 year earlier, he
had been the first to hold the Edsel B. Ford Chair of Business
Administration.
</P>
<P>
   In 1984, 10 years after he retired from its faculty, Harvard
Business School gave Fox its Distinguished Service Award. After
leaving Harvard, Fox worked as a consultant with the Cambridge
Research Institute until he retired in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   Fox, who was born in Wisconsin, studied mathematics and
astronomy at Northwestern University, where he was a quarterback on
the football team and a member of the track team. He went on to
earn a doctorate in economics at Harvard, then taught economics at
Williams College.
</P>
<P>
   During World War II, Fox was director of the Military
Requirements Division of the War Production Board. In that role, he
helped the United States government decide how to allocate
resources between the war effort and the domestic economy. From
1958 to 1962, he was director of research for the United States
Commission on Money and Credit.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Patricia; a sister, Gertrude Tuttle,
of Tacoma, Wash.; four sons, Philip of Grosse Pointe, Mich., Thomas
of Washington, Kenneth of Englewood, Colo., and Peter of Palo Alto,
Calif.; two daughters, Ann Gulbransen of Sharon Center, Ohio, and
Joan Fox-Bow of Yorktown Heights, N.Y.; and eight grandchildren.

POWER AUTHORITY SET TO CHOOSE BUYER OF TWO REACTORS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Miss., Va.)  (lb) 
 By DAVID W. CHEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The New York Power Authority is expected to choose on
Monday between two out-of-state companies fiercely bidding for the
authority's two nuclear plants, setting the stage for what would be
the largest sale of nuclear plants in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks the proposed sale of the Indian Point 3 plant,
in Westchester County, and the James A. FitzPatrick reactor, in
Scriba on Lake Ontario, has attracted spiraling bids and
counterbids, analyses and counteranalyses, from the two suitors,
Entergy Nuclear, of Jackson, Miss., and Dominion Resources, of
Richmond, Va.
</P>
<P>
   While each company claims that its offer is superior, this much
seems clear: The winning bid will amount to at least $806 million
and also represent the largest sale of a public asset to a private
buyer in New York state.
</P>
<P>
   Entergy has long had the inside track; for months it was the
only company negotiating with the authority for the plants, until
Dominion made a bigger, unsolicited bid in February. Still, Michael
A. Petralia, a spokesman for the authority, said Sunday that the
board of trustees would weigh both proposals equally and choose one
at a meeting Monday in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expect that the trustees will take action, absolutely,''
Petralia said.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, the decision is likely to be subject to much
scrutiny and second-guessing.
</P>
<P>
   Last week the authority released a brief analysis by J.P. Morgan
stating that both proposals were excellent and that they ``by far
exceed any previous nuclear asset sale in the United States in
terms of dollars per kilowatt of capacity.''
</P>
<P>
   But for months, numerous state legislators and watchdogs of
nuclear power have criticized the authority for failing to make the
privatization process as competitive as possible.
</P>
<P>
   They say that after the recent radiation leak at Indian Point 2
_ Indian Point 3's privately owned next-door neighbor _ and the
swift deregulation of utilities, such a major decision affecting
taxpayers and the environment should be made as prudently and
openly as possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is so important because it is by far, by orders of great
magnitude, the largest sale of a publicly held asset in New York
state,'' Assemblyman Richard Brodsky, D-Westchester, said Sunday.
Brodsky, who is chairman of the Assembly Committee on Environmental
Conservation, said, ``There is no reason on God's earth that this
deal should close tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   The New York Power Authority was never really supposed to be in
the business of nuclear power; its original mandate was to foster
economic development and improve energy efficiency. In the 1970s,
though, it became involved in nuclear power after a struggling
Consolidated Edison built Indian Point 3, in Buchanan, but sold it
to the authority before it opened.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the authority and Con Edison, which runs Indian
Point 2, have described themselves as ``mom and pop operators.''
But in recent years, with utility deregulation taking hold, both
Con Ed and the authority have sought to sell their plants to
companies that are interested in accumulating nuclear plant sites _
like Entergy, which has five, and Dominion, which has two.
</P>
<P>
   About two years ago, Entergy approached the Power Authority, a
quasi-independent agency, about buying Indian Point 3 and the
FitzPatrick reactor, said Jerry W. Yelverton, the chief executive
of Entergy Nuclear. The two later began negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 14, the power authority announced that it had
tentatively agreed to a deal: $638 million for the plants, and $168
for nuclear fuel stockpiles, spread over seven years. In addition,
the power authority agreed to pay for most of the costs of
decommissioning the plants when Entergy officials conclude that
they have reached the end of their useful, or profitable, life.
</P>
<P>
   Yet controversy shadowed the deal. Brodsky, with fellow
Democratic Assemblymen Paul Tonko of Montgomery County and Albert
Vann of Brooklyn, criticized the Power Authority for not opening
the process to competitive bidding. They said that the state, and
by extension, all electricity customers, might not be getting the
best price.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the legislators, coupled with some nuclear-power
watchdog groups, complained about the power authority's failure to
make public a detailed financial analysis of the bid.
</P>
<P>
   Then came Dominion.
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 24, the company, which is the parent company of Virginia
Power, made an offer for the two plants with an unsolicited bid of
$686 million, and $171 million for nuclear fuel stockpiles, for a
total of $857 million, or $51 million more than Entergy's offer.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the New York Power Authority gave the two companies
until March 10 to submit new bids. So when March 10 rolled around,
each company, naturally, proclaimed its offer to be the better one.
</P>
<P>
   Dominion sweetened the pot by saying that it would pay a total
of $946 million for the plants, an increase of $89 million.
Dominion also offered its full corporate resources as collateral
against any unforeseen decommissioning costs, unlike its
competitor, which is relying on its Entergy Nuclear subsidiary, a
limited liability corporation, and not the parent company in New
Orleans, as collateral.
</P>
<P>
   But above all, Dominion said that it was simply offering more
money.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you ought to focus on is the dollars that the citizens of
New York state receive,'' said Thos. E. Capps, Dominion's chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Entergy did not change the cash component of its original
proposal: $806 million. Instead, it announced a new bid of $1.12
billion through an increase of $314 million in projected benefits
like paying more money to decommission the plants and selling more
electricity at below-market prices to the authority.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Entergy said it should be rewarded for the
substantial investments in money and time spent on putting together
its offer.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to look at the overall, broader package for the state
of New York,'' Yelverton said.
</P>
<P>
   In the last few days, the two companies have offered competing
economic models and projections. The latest have Dominion saying it
can provide $1.52 billion in cash and speculative benefits, and
Entergy up to $1.42 billion.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The power authority, meanwhile, has tried to stay out of the
fray, releasing only the analysis by its consultant, J.P. Morgan.
But one thing that should be noted, Petralia said, is that either
offer would pay off the remaining $316 million in debt on Indian
Point 3. (The FitzPatrick plant is paid for.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever is decided is going to be a tremendous benefit to the
state,'' Petralia said.
</P>
<P>
   To date, few nuclear plants have actually changed hands, and
when they do, it is usually from one private company to another.
Moreover, out of the 100 or so plants still operating in the
country, the power authority sale may well be the first one
involving the privatization of a publicly run nuclear plant, said
Edward Smeloff, executive director of the Pace Law School Energy
Project.
</P>
<P>
   So the fate of the power authority's plants may well provide a
road map on what may eventually happen with the two Millstone
plants in Connecticut, as well as to the beleaguered Indian Point 2
plant.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's important because it gets New York state out of
the business of owning a nuclear plant, and I think that, from a
large policy perspective, is the right thing to do,'' Smeloff said.

ROGER LONGRIGG, 70, WRITER OF COMIC NOVELS 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Roger Longrigg, a prolific British novelist who often wrote
under pseudonyms, male and female, died on Feb. 26 at the Phyllis
Tuckwell Hospice in Farnham, Surrey, England. He was 70.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of death was not announced, The Associated Press
reported.
</P>
<P>
   Longrigg had a career in the business world as creative director
for an advertising agency and made his debut as a writer in 1956
with ``A High-Pitched Buzz,'' the first of several comic novels
about that world. In addition to the 12 novels he wrote under his
name, which included ``Love Among the Bottles,'' ``The Jarvington
System'' and ``The Babe in the Wood,'' he turned out more than 35
other books, writing variously as Laura Black, Ivor Drummond, Frank
Parrish and Rosalind Erskine, among other pseudonyms.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Passion Flower Hotel,'' which became a best seller in
1962, described its author, Rosalind Erskine, as a 15-year-old at a
girls' boarding school where the students operated a brothel for
the entertainment of visitors from a nearby school for boys. The
book later became a German film that starred Nastassia Kinski.
Writing as Domini Taylor, Longrigg was also the author of ``Mother
Love,'' a 1983 novel that became a BBC mini-series starring Diana
Rigg and David McCallum. He also wrote books about horse racing and
fox hunting.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, the novelist Jane Chichester, and
three daughters.

SO IT'S BEST TO AVOID CYBERSTICK OF McSORLEY, TOO? 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TOM HOFFARTH  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ As sports video games strive to become more and
more realistic, the players who they aim to duplicate on the screen
can't help but be a bit more frightened at the prospects.
</P>
<P>
   Will they someday be replaced altogether?
</P>
<P>
   Calm down.
</P>
<P>
   Ian Laperrier, the Kings' resident video-game expert, tried out
the new Sega game ``NHL 2K'' for Sega Dreamcast in the players'
lounge at the team's practice facility in El Segundo recently and
was left almost speechless.
</P>
<P>
   Which in itself is a pretty frightening thing to imagine.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they first started coming out with these games, everyone
skated the same, looked the same ... but now it's getting scary,''
Laperrier said. ``I recognize myself on the game, all the little
details like how I skate. I'm not like Luc Robitaille - I'm not the
fastest guy - and that's how I am on the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Laperrier then shook his head.
</P>
<P>
   ``What are they going to do to improve these games in five
years?''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe all that's left is to tweak the goalie moves, suggests
another Kings gamer, Jamie Storr, who has the game as well and
squared off against Laperrier the other day.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough to get all the goalie moves to look real
</P>
<P>
   the equipment never looks right,'' said Storr, the team's No. 2
goalkeeper. ``It's almost too hard to get that. But this game seems
to get the closest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I also find it pretty difficult to play. At least, it's very
hard to score.''
</P>
<P>
   A goalie should appreciate that. But the fact is, in the
evolution of NHL video games, ``NHL 2K'' probably has come closest
to matching a real game - meaning scoring isn't supposed to be
easy.
</P>
<P>
   More than 1,000 motion capture images are what make the realism
burst out on the screen (100 alone for the goalies), along with the
high resolution that the Dreamcast system already brings. All 27
arenas are available to play on.
</P>
<P>
   Other highlights of the game include the option of putting teams
in one of several game jerseys - the Kings can even suit up in
their 1967 bright yellow pajamas. And the advanced offensive
settings allow for three styles of play: passive (positional),
normal and aggressive.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings up fighting. The controllers allows for ducking,
grabbing, jabbing and a hard punch during a scrap, but you can
avoid a fight by pressing the A button three times at the start, so
if the other players drop their gloves, they get the penalty and
you don't.
</P>
<P>
   But the game directions also warn you that if you hang onto the
puck too long, you'll get flattened by a defenseman.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the best description is from a review that appears in the
April issue of Playboy magazine: ``(This game) is so good, it
hurts.''

EDITORIAL: DEADLINES, DATABASES AND DNA 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Sunday, March 19:  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George Pataki wants to tap the potential of DNA evidence to
help solve crimes, and his instinct is surely right. The power of
the technology was illustrated when biological evidence found at a
crime scene 20 years ago was shown to match a DNA sample taken
recently from a jailed robber for inclusion in New York's newly
expanded DNA database. But Pataki's two new legislative proposals
are so broad as to warrant concern. The Legislature needs to
proceed with caution.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki's first bill would eliminate the statute of limitations
for 16 felonies, including rape, manslaughter, aggravated sexual
assault, robbery, burglary, second-degree arson, illegal firearm
sales, gang assault and aggravated assault on a police officer.
Murder is already exempt. The idea is to keep cases open so
prosecutions are not foreclosed if evidence from unsolved crimes
turns out to match DNA profiles in the state's expanding database.
</P>
<P>
   There is a strong case for abolishing deadlines in cases of rape
and other violent sexual assaults where semen tests can now
identify the assailant with reasonable certainty by his DNA code.
Indeed, a suspect's DNA profile in this narrow band of cases should
be a sufficient identifier for a prosecutor to obtain a ``John
Doe'' warrant _ the novel approach taken by a Milwaukee prosecutor
last fall and by Manhattan prosecutors last week to prevent the
prosecution deadline in rape cases from expiring. A change in the
law to lift time limits on prosecutions based on matching existing
rape evidence with developing DNA databases makes sense.
</P>
<P>
   But the case for completely lifting the present five-year
statute of limitations for a long list of other felonies, where the
biological evidence found at the crime scene typically is not
definitive, is not persuasive. DNA evidence is an important law
enforcement tool. But it is not a magic bullet that overrides
traditional concerns about fairness, and the ability of defendants
to muster evidence in their defense, that were behind time limits
in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the five-year limit does not appear as inflexible as
the governor makes out. In an important decision last year, the
state's highest court, the Court of Appeals, held that the time
limit in a serious felony case can be extended up to another five
years when the police are diligent yet cannot discover a suspect's
whereabouts because his identity remains unknown.
</P>
<P>
   The governor's second bill would require every person convicted
of a state crime to provide a biological sample for a state
database. At some point, it may make sense to broaden sampling. But
Albany approved a law vastly expanding its DNA databank just last
August to include about 30,000 people convicted of the most common
and violent felonies. Their testing is not yet completed, and the
state crime lab already has a backlog of DNA samples. If the
governor is truly serious about maximizing the crime-solving value
of DNA, his first priority is to shore up existing lab capacity to
solve the present backlog problem, and to educate police detectives
in how to identify and properly handle DNA samples at crime scenes.

REX EVERHARD, WHO ACTED IN 26 BROADWAY SHOWS, DIES AT 79

<P>
   Rex Everhart, a character actor who appeared in 26 Broadway
productions including ``1776,'' in which he played Ben Franklin,
and ``Working,'' for which he received a Tony Award nomination,
died on March 13 at a hospice in Branford, Conn. He was 79.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was lung cancer, said his wife, Claire Richard
Everhart.
</P>
<P>
   Everhart, who started his theater career in 1939, worked in
regional and repertory theaters including the Phoenix Theater, Yale
Repertory Theater and seven seasons at the American Shakespeare
Festival in Stratford, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   Reviewing the Shakespeare Theater's production of ``The Comedy
of Errors'' in The New York Times in 1963, Howard Taubman wrote,
``Rex Everhart handles the two Dromios with unfailing comic
gusto.'' And in 1964, reviewing ``Much Ado About Nothing,'' Taubman
said that as the constable Everhart ``somehow pries a grin out of
us even when we know every simple-minded joke that is coming.''
</P>
<P>
   The actor's television career, which started back in days of
live broadcasting, included series, plays, films, soap operas and
commercials. Appearing in 16 feature films, Everhart was most
recently the voice of Maurice in the Disney movie ``Beauty and the
Beast.'' Having made his 1955 Broadway debut in ``No Time for
Sergeants,'' Everhart's other Broadway shows included ``Anything
Goes,'' ``Rags'' and ``Woman of the Year.
</P>
<P>
   Everhart was born in Wateska, Ill., and received a degree in
theater at the Pasadena Playhouse and bachelor's and master's
degrees at New York University. He lived for 37 years in Westport,
Conn.
</P>
<P>
   Everhart and his wife, also an actress, met in 1960 when they
were in the Broadway musical ``Tenderloin.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his wife, Everhart is survived by his daughter,
Degan, of Baltimore, and a granddaughter.

PEPPERDINE FALLS TO OKLAHOMA STATE

<P>
   BUFFALO, N.Y. _ It was a crazy dream to begin with. The fact
that it lingered ever so tantalizingly never changed that.
</P>
<P>
   A colorful, headband-wearing, retro-Afro-looking basketball team
from a small, strict college in Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   A new coach with a reputation to mend.
</P>
<P>
   Both in need of the other. Their paths crossing, improbably.
Together they travel further then any team in school history,
shocking the nation and capturing its heart all at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, it was crazy all right.
</P>
<P>
   But the NCAA Tournament is safe haven for such audacity,
practically daring teams to dream so wishfully.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there's a catch. It can end at any time.
</P>
<P>
   For Pepperdine, that moment came Sunday. Oklahoma State was
responsible, halting the Waves' record-breaking season in a 75-67
second-round East Regional victory before 19,351 at HSBC Arena.
</P>
<P>
   It ends the Waves (25-9) hopes of reaching the Sweet 16 for the
first time in school history. As far-fetched as that appeared a few
weeks ago, it actually seemed possible after they beat Indiana on
Friday in the first round.
</P>
<P>
   There was disappointment afterward, but also a sense of
accomplishment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody knew who we were when we came out here, but we found
out who we were,'' Pepperdine coach Jan van Breda Kolff said. ``Now
it's up to the younger guys to build on the tradition we started.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday was quite a contrast from Friday, when Pepperdine blazed
to a 77-57 win over Indiana. The Waves could only flicker against
Oklahoma State, its offensive rhythm choked off by the Cowboys'
quick, rugged defense.
</P>
<P>
   Oklahoma State (25-6) now moves on to the Sweet 16. The Cowboys
play Seton Hall on Friday in Syracuse, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   The Waves return home to Malibu, frustrated with the result but
much more popular then when they left. Their win over Indiana was
an awakening. All of a sudden people were interested in the players
with the crazy hairdos, eclectic personalities and free-spirited
brand of basketball.
</P>
<P>
   There was intrigue about van Breda Kolff, exiled after six years
at Vanderbilt, reborn in Southern California. Van Breda Kolff is
responsible for the Waves' contagious, uptempo style after shelving
former coach Lorenzo Romar's grind-it-out offense. The Waves took
to it immediately. The fans at the East Regional embraced it, too.
</P>
<P>
   When Pepperdine walked off the floor Sunday, many in the arena
stood and applauded.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coach mentioned in the locker room that when we first got here
(there were only) two Pepperdine fans, our (athletic director) and
his wife,'' Tezale Archie said. ``Three days later half the
building is chanting for us. So definitely, we made a statement.''
</P>
<P>
   The Waves had loftier goals then introducing the country to
their fun-loving style, though. They felt all along they could beat
Indiana and whoever else stood between them and the Sweet 16.
</P>
<P>
   There were opportunities to do that against Oklahoma State, but
inconsistent shooting (42 percent) ruined the chance for a decisive
run to take control.
</P>
<P>
   The effect was two-fold. The Waves never got on a roll, and
their full-court press, which is triggered by made baskets, was
rarely a factor.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt if we could keep the press on, it would wear them
down,'' van Breda Kolff said. ``Unfortunately, we just couldn't
make a shot.''
</P>
<P>
   Brandon Armstrong had 19 points but was only 3 of 10 from the
field. Kelvin Gibbs made just 2 of 10 shots.
</P>
<P>
   Pepperdine was 27 of 64 overall, offsetting Nick Sheppard's 13
points on 5-o-6 shooting.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got all the looks we wanted, we just didn't knock them
down,'' said Archie, who had a career-high 14 assists.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys broke it open with a 14-4 run to make it 65-50 with
3:59 left. Joe Adkins did most of the damage, connecting on two
3-pointers.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's Joe. He's done it four years here,'' Cowboys point
guard Doug Gottlieb said. ``When we need a bucket and he's open,
it's going in.''
</P>
<P>
   Adkins' offense was crucial. Pepperdine surrounded Desmond
Mason, the Cowboys' leading scorer, forcing him to surrender
possession most of the time. Mason finished with just 13 points,
five off his usual pace.
</P>
<P>
   It was a calculated risk by the Waves. By swarming Mason, it
allowed Adkins (18 points) and Fredrik Jonzen (21 points) more room
to work.
</P>
<P>
   Jonzen, a 6-10 center, made 7 of 13 shots, many on layups when
Oklahoma State found open seams in Pepperdine's pressure defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``If somebody is going to spread their defense you can't be
content just to get the ball across the midcourt line,'' said
Cowboys coach Eddie Sutton. ``You've got to attack the basket and
take it through the defense.''
</P>
<P>
   Pepperdine made one last push over the final minute, getting two
steals, a 3-pointer from Armstrong and two from Archie to make it
72-67 with 45.9 left.
</P>
<P>
   But Pepperdine never scored another point.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're disappointed we didn't win this last game because our
goal was to make it to the second round,'' forward Tommie Prince
said. ``But we were happy that we were here and that we made a
little noise.''
</P>
<P>
   A lot of noise.

EDITORIAL: POLITICAL EARTHQUAKE IN TAIWAN
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Monday, March 20:
</P>
<P>
   By ending more than five decades of Nationalist Party rule and
electing the opposition candidate, Chen Shui-ban, as its next
president, Taiwan has taken an important new step in its democratic
evolution. But it may also have inaugurated a period of potentially
dangerous uncertainty in its relations with mainland China.
Beijing's recent military threats toward Taiwan were aimed
primarily at defeating Chen, who first entered politics as an
advocate of Taiwanese independence.
</P>
<P>
   As a presidential candidate, Chen wisely toned down his
pro-independence views. He should now move quickly to affirm that
he does not seek any change in Taiwan's existing political status.
Beijing should respond by ending its military threats and opening a
dialogue with Chen after he takes office in May.
</P>
<P>
   China's initial reaction over the weekend to Taiwan's election
was relatively measured, with Beijing saying that it will judge the
new leader by his words and actions rather than by his past
positions. That suggests that a heightening of tensions across the
Taiwan Strait is not inevitable. But if a new crisis is to be
avoided, leaders in both Taipei and Beijing will need to behave
responsibly in the weeks ahead. Washington, which risks getting
drawn into any new conflict, needs to play a calming role. The
Clinton administration is right to press both sides to soften their
rhetoric.
</P>
<P>
   Nationalist rule in Taiwan dates back to the military
dictatorship of Chiang Kai-shek. After the Chinese Communists
seized control of the mainland in 1949, Chiang's defeated forces
fled to Taiwan. They imposed decades of harshly repressive martial
law. But beginning in the late 1980s, Taiwan's political system
began opening up. Most of the changes were instituted by Lee
Teng-hui, a native-born Taiwanese who won the island's first
democratic presidential election four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   But Lee's new policies, and his efforts to give Taiwan a more
independent diplomatic profile, badly split the Nationalists and
contributed to the defeat of his chosen successor, Vice President
Lien Chan. The Nationalist vote was further diluted by the
independent race run by James Soong, a former party stalwart.
Demonstrations by angry Nationalists forced Lee to agree Sunday to
step down as party chairman in September.
</P>
<P>
   During the campaign, Chen sensibly promised that he would take
no steps to declare Taiwan's independence unless the island came
under military attack. But unfortunately he went further, arguing
that a declaration of independence was unnecessary since Taiwan was
already fully sovereign. Such clever wordplay may have paid
electoral dividends for Chen, but it needlessly plays into the
hands of mainland militarists. Beijing is already looking for
reasons to declare that Taiwan has broken with the notion that
there is only one China.
</P>
<P>
   Preserving the one-China formula remains the surest basis for
maintaining peace across the Taiwan Strait, and with it Taiwan's
democratic and capitalist way of life. Beijing should recognize
that its goal of reunifying China should be pursued exclusively by
peaceful means.

MANAGING THE WORLD'S WATER 
</HEADLINE>
  (jw) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Monday, March 20:
</P>
<P>
   The most precious fluid on earth is not oil, but water. There
are few challenges as important as conserving the world's usable
water and supplying clean drinking water and water for irrigation
to those who need it. Yet this work is not getting done. Humans are
depleting the earth's store of usable water at a rate that will
soon threaten our food supply. Poor water management already kills
millions of people a year and condemns hundreds of millions to
hunger.
</P>
<P>
   The technology exists to solve these problems. Providing slums
with drinking water and sanitation, for example, is easy to do and
a cost-effective way to prevent deaths and disease. But because
those who suffer are poor, their access to water is rarely a
political priority. There is an opportunity for progress now in the
Netherlands. More than 100 water ministers from around the world,
along with thousands of water experts from villagers to scientists,
have gathered there. The conference will be useful if it can
persuade governments and the international banks to pay more
attention to conservation and fair distribution of water.
</P>
<P>
   Half the people in the world have no sanitary way to dispose of
human waste, and 1.3 billion do not have safe water to drink. At
least 4 million people die each year of water-related disease, and
water-borne diseases account for 90 percent of all infectious
diseases in the developing world. The United Nations estimates that
providing clean water and sanitation for everyone would require an
additional $9 billion a year. No other investment would buy more
health for less money.
</P>
<P>
   Paradoxically, governments need to begin charging a market price
for water based on usage, ending the subsidies so common in the
third world. This would do more than spur conservation. Designed to
help the poor, subsidies have ended up hurting them. They are so
costly that governments do not build pipes into the relatively
powerless rural areas or the settlements of poor people that ring
most third-world cities. As a result, many slum dwellers must buy
their water from itinerant peddlers. Some pay a quarter of their
income for water.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the water humans use goes to crop irrigation. One reason
so many people go hungry is that irrigation is a luxury generally
reserved for wealthy farmers, consigning poor farmers to
unnecessarily low yields. Bangladesh provides one example that it
does not have to be this way. In the last 20 years the government,
aid agencies and the private sector have drilled millions of
shallow tube wells, some for drinking water and some for
irrigation. More than a million farmers now use an $8 foot-treadle
pump, which allows even the poorest to use the wells for
irrigation. These wells and pumps not only have helped the country
to become self-sufficient in rice production, but have saved
millions of people from disease and death.
</P>
<P>
   In other countries, however, many small farmers cannot dig wells
deep enough because the water table has been depleted by large
landowners with powerful pumps using more water than is naturally
replaced. Thirty years from now, the amount of water needed to
produce our food will rise by at least half, and may even double.
Yet we are already depleting many of the lakes, rivers and aquifers
most important for food production, including China's Yellow River,
the Nile and the Ganges.
</P>
<P>
   In 1980, the United Nations set a goal of safe drinking water
for all by 1990. Because of the international prodding, about 2
billion new people received clean drinking water over the
subsequent 14 years. A new commitment is urgently needed to spread
these health gains, help poor farmers and conserve the world's
precious supply of usable water.

DECIDEDLY DIFFERENT `TITUS' TAPS COMIC'S TROUBLED LIFE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL GOODYKOONTZ  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic

<P>
   Titus, a new comedy from Fox, is clever, funny and troubling.
</P>
<P>
   Not your normal combo. And not your normal sitcom. Even while
you're laughing at former stand-up comic Christopher Titus and his
twisted relationship with his father, you can't escape the
question: When does the comedy end and the therapy begin?
</P>
<P>
   ``This show is my real life,'' Titus said back in January.
</P>
<P>
   OK, maybe not exactly. Titus' real father has been married six
times; his TV father, hilariously played by Stacey Keach, only
five. His real-life mom, who was insane, is dead. His TV one _ also
insane _ is alive.
</P>
<P>
   The pain of growing up in this emotional whirlwind is what Titus
mines _ successfully _ for com edy in the show.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being from a dysfunctional family means nothing rattles me,''
Titus says in one episode. ``Hey, once you've driven a drunk father
to Mom's parole hearing, what else is there?''
</P>
<P>
   The thing that makes you laugh instead of wince is the
remarkably blame-free way Titus _ the real and the TV versions _
presents all of this.
</P>
<P>
   ``To write the show,'' Titus said, ``you had to have gone past
it and seen the positive aspects of what ever your life was. . . .
You're never going to see us go to a real sappy place of `look what
happened to me.' It's great to laugh about it because then it blows
it away. It turns it into a joke instead of what life was.''
</P>
<P>
   See what I mean? You don't know whether to hug the guy or charge
him $125 an hour for listening.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, jokes about alcohol, corporal punishment, mental
illness and the like won't go over big with everyone. Titus and
Jack Kenny, one of the show's executive producers, sounded
prepared.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, you have to laugh at something,'' Kenny said. ``If
you're not laughing . . . then you may as well just do a drama, and
we're not doing drama. We'll try to be democratic in our political
incor rectness.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not poking fun at'' sensi tive subjects, Titus said.
``It's my life, so we're not poking fun at it. And you know what
else? If it's picketed, I'll join the picket. It is what it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is, over the course of an entire episode, a little tiring.
The downbeat sarcasm, however clever, makes a half-hour seem twice
as long.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Titus is different from traditional comedies, and that
counts for a lot.
</P>
<P>

President Clinton's hotel during his stay in the area. Three
decades after its war of independence against Pakistan ended,
Bangladesh remains one of the world's poorest nations. U.S.
officials claim that Clinton is simply making a day trip to
Bangladesh on his way to five days in India and a short pause in
Pakistan. But many locals fear that Clinton is coming not just to
shake hands but to make money on what some feel is a small fortune
in natural gas suspected within the region. (Barry Bearak/The New

Hasina, 53, daughter of the slain leader Sheik Mujibur Rahman. Gen.
Ziaur Rahman, was a military dictator who praised and rewarded the
confessed killers of Hasina's father. The dictator was assassinated
by army officers in 1981. ``There is no personal clash or enmity

`GOLDEN DOLLAR' ELUSIVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By KERRY FEHR-SNYDER 
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The U.S. Mint says there are 350 million in circulation, but the
new dollar coin is turning out to be as elusive as a vending
machine that accepts your crumpled currency.
</P>
<P>
   The good news is that's about to change. The ``golden dollar''
should start showing up any week now, mint spokesman Michael White
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes awhile for them to get into the pipeline,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The first transaction nationally involving the new coin was at a
Wal-Mart Supercenter in north Scottsdale, when a cashier gave one
to a Mesa girl as change when she was buying a gift for her
grandparents. That was Jan. 27, a day after the coin was shipped
from the mint to the Federal Reserve.
</P>
<P>
   White predicts that the new dollar coin will be more successful
than the Susan B. Anthony dollar because it's easier to distinguish
from a quarter (a criticism on the Susan B.) and because it's being
distributed through major retailers, getting it into cash drawers
immediately.
</P>
<P>
   The new coin, bearing the likeness of Sacagawea, the Shoshone
guide for explorers Lewis and Clark, has a plain edge, a wider
border and a golden color.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did extensive testing to see that you can pick it out from
other change and found people had no problem,'' White said.
</P>
<P>
   In February, the mint sent 100 million coins to Wal-Mart stores
around the country and another 100 million to Federal Reserve
Banks, which sold them to commercial banks based on demand.
</P>
<P>
   This month, it shipped another 100 million to the Federal
Reserve and 50 million more to smaller financial institutions known
as correspondent banks.
</P>
<P>
   But finding the coin is difficult. Banks around the Phoenix area
have received very few.
</P>
<P>
   One place that still reports a stock is the same Wal-Mart that
made that first transaction. The store, near Hayden Road and Frank
Lloyd Wright Boulevard, routinely makes change with the coins, said
David Lamp, the store's co-manager.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the stores are about out of them, so some people come
to our store specifically for the coin,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But if you think you're going to stock up on the coins, think
again. Wal-Mart has set a $10 limit per customer on the coins.
</P>
<P>
   Lamp, a coin collector, also warned customers not to consider
the dollar coins as a collector item.
</P>
<P>
   White, of the mint, agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expect by the 14th week of manufacturing, we'll hit 500
million coins,'' he said. ``It took 14 years for the Susan B. to
hit that amount.'' &QL;

DECIDEDLY DIFFERENT `TITUS' TAPS COMIC'S TROUBLED LIFE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL GOODYKOONTZ  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Titus, a new comedy from Fox, is clever, funny and troubling.
</P>
<P>
   Not your normal combo. And not your normal sitcom. Even while
you're laughing at former stand-up comic Christopher Titus and his
twisted relationship with his father, you can't escape the
question: When does the comedy end and the therapy begin?
</P>
<P>
   ``This show is my real life,'' Titus said back in January.
</P>
<P>
   OK, maybe not exactly. Titus' real father has been married six
times; his TV father, hilariously played by Stacey Keach, only
five. His real-life mom, who was insane, is dead. His TV one _ also
insane _ is alive.
</P>
<P>
   The pain of growing up in this emotional whirlwind is what Titus
mines _ successfully _ for com edy in the show.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being from a dysfunctional family means nothing rattles me,''
Titus says in one episode. ``Hey, once you've driven a drunk father
to Mom's parole hearing, what else is there?''
</P>
<P>
   The thing that makes you laugh instead of wince is the
remarkably blame-free way Titus _ the real and the TV versions _
presents all of this.
</P>
<P>
   ``To write the show,'' Titus said, ``you had to have gone past
it and seen the positive aspects of what ever your life was. . . .
You're never going to see us go to a real sappy place of `look what
happened to me.' It's great to laugh about it because then it blows
it away. It turns it into a joke instead of what life was.''
</P>
<P>
   See what I mean? You don't know whether to hug the guy or charge
him $125 an hour for listening.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, jokes about alcohol, corporal punishment, mental
illness and the like won't go over big with everyone. Titus and
Jack Kenny, one of the show's executive producers, sounded
prepared.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, you have to laugh at something,'' Kenny said. ``If
you're not laughing . . . then you may as well just do a drama, and
we're not doing drama. We'll try to be democratic in our political
incor rectness.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not poking fun at'' sensi tive subjects, Titus said.
``It's my life, so we're not poking fun at it. And you know what
else? If it's picketed, I'll join the picket. It is what it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is, over the course of an entire episode, a little tiring.
The downbeat sarcasm, however clever, makes a half-hour seem twice
as long.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Titus is different from traditional comedies, and that
counts for a lot.
</P>
<P>
   Next patient! &QL;

SETON HALL INSPIRED BY INJURED PLAYER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By VINCENT BONSIGNORE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUFFALO, N.Y. -- On paper, the biggest upset Sunday could have
been Seton Hall's 67-65 overtime victory over second-seeded Temple.
</P>
<P>
   The eventual result became even more improbable after the
Pirates lost their best player, Shaheen Holloway, because of a
badly sprained ankle eight minutes into the game.
</P>
<P>
   Holloway was X-rayed at a Buffalo area hospital, then returned
in a wheelchair, watching the second half from the sideline.
</P>
<P>
   Seton Hall is hopeful Holloway will play this weekend against
Oklahoma State.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I went down I was afraid this was going to be my last
college game,'' Holloway said. ``I don't know what's going to
happen now, but it's great that we advanced.''
</P>
<P>
   Incoming: The future is bright for Pepperdine. In addition to
bringing back underclassmen Brandon Armstrong, Craig Lewis, Kelvin
Gibbs and David Lalazarian, they'll also get top recruits Robert
Turner (Anaheim Western High) and Will Kimble (San Bernardino
Pacific). Turner is a 6-7 swingman who should make an immediate
impact. Kimble is a 6-9 forward.
</P>
<P>
   Pepperdine coach Jan van Breda Kolff is hopeful the Waves will
soon land some others.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very excited with the players we're involved with,'' van
Breda Kolff said.
</P>
<P>
   Four times Three Oklahoma State coach Eddie Sutton has taken two
schools to the Final Four (Arkansas and Oklahoma State) and four to
the Sweet 16. But it never gets old. In fact, with all the media
attention and hoopla now, Sutton considers today's Sweet 16 almost
as significant as getting to the Final Four was 15 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   This year he wanted to get there for players like Doug Gottlieb
and Desmond Mason, a pair of seniors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to get to the Sweet 16 because I told them they were
good enough to get there,'' Sutton said.
</P>
<P>
   Sutton has an interesting approach, breaking the tournament into
three,four-team mini tournaments.
</P>
<P>
   Win two games and move on.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't worry about the Final Four, you have to worry about
your next opponent,'' Sutton said.

KINGDOME MEMORABILIA GETS ANOTHER CHANCE AT BAT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROBERT L. JAMIESON JR.  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a brick building near Pioneer Square, Elizabeth Furlow hunts
for ghosts of the Kingdome.
</P>
<P>
   She slips inside a dimly lit storage room and locks eyes with
Jack Lelivelt, the late baseball manager for the Seattle Rainiers.
It's love at first sight. ``I'd like to take him,'' she says,
studying contours of the bronze plaque honoring the minor league
coach who led the Rainiers to two championships 60 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Furlow is part of a cadre on a mission to save Kingdome
memorabilia and souvenirs. The nostalgic pursuit has taken on
greater importance given the imminent demise of the landmark
stadium on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Historians say relics from the Kingdome _ including the Lelivelt
plaque, which was once housed in a stadium museum _ will provide
learning tools for future generations to study the sports and civic
life of Seattle in the late 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of items linked to the Dome _ from ticket stubs to a
wood architectural model of the stadium to old photographs of the
Seattle Metropolitans, Seattle's World Hockey Champions in 1917 _
have been cataloged, packed up and placed in five storage rooms.
</P>
<P>
   The rooms, haunted by history, are a collector's dream: a framed
football jersey of Steve Largent, the Hall of Fame Seahawks
receiver; an old control panel for the Kingdome's scoreboard; a
baseball, blackened by age, that was used in an 1886 game; a
duplicate NBA trophy commemorating the Sonics's 1979 championship
season in the Dome.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are items that 50, 100 years from now people will look
at and say one thing _ Kingdome,'' said Furlow, curator of
collections for the Museum of History and Industry in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want things that are evocative,'' she said. ``Things that
will help people understand the Kingdome and its relevancy to
Seattle history.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the items will be donated to three places _ the Museum
of History and Industry, the Washington State Historical Society in
Tacoma and the University of Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Remaining relics and mementos will be made available to the
public during an auction this spring, said Carol Keaton, a
long-time Kingdome employee whose work has made it possible for the
items to find new homes. She has been stockpiling stuff since
December.
</P>
<P>
   Everything in the storage room is connected _ directly or
indirectly _ to the Dome. For example, the Lelivelt plaque was part
of old Sick's Stadium in south Seattle before it found a place in
the Kingdome museum. (Lelivelt led the Rainiers to Pacific Coast
League championships in 1939 and 1940.)
</P>
<P>
   Ticket stubs and media passes, framed in a glass and wood case,
are the result of more than 3,000 events in the 23-year history of
``Stonehenge in Seattle,'' as the Dome was dubbed.
</P>
<P>
   Some items were literally attached to the stadium. ``Now these I
remember!'' exclaimed Feliks Banel, a deputy director at the Museum
of History and Industry, who grabbed the back of an orange Kingdome
seat. The color, he said, signified the Kingdome's 300 level _
popularly referred to as the cheap seats. He let loose a knowing
chuckle. ``The nosebleeds.''
</P>
<P>
   Furlow and Banel have made two previous trips to the storehouse
of memories, which sits in a building shadowed by the Kingdome.
</P>
<P>
   Their booty has included a ceiling tile that fell from the
interior roof of the Kingdome in 1994, a patch of artificial turf
and all four bases from opening day of 1999 _ the Mariners' last
season in the Dome. These items, which are on display at the museum
in the 2700 block of 24th Avenue East, are popular.
</P>
<P>
   Last year the museum generated about $20,000 in revenue. But in
little more than a week since the museum opened its Kingdome
collection, more than $4,000 has flooded in, in part because a
museum gift shop is selling pieces of Kingdome turf, T-shirts and a
sample of field dirt as part of a $40 ``Implosion Pack.''
</P>
<P>
   One recent afternoon, Keaton stepped into a storage room and
pulled out a piece of clothing _ a silk Haori coat presented in
1921 to Roscoe ``Torchy'' Torrance, a UW baseball player, during
the baseball team's tour of Japan.
</P>
<P>
   During that trip, the UW players had a brush with history.
Keaton said that one of the Japanese translators for the team was a
man who went on to bigger things _ Hirohito.
</P>
<P>
   As Keaton rummaged through one of the storage rooms, her eyes
darted to another item _ a baseball signed by members of the 1969
Seattle Pilots baseball team.
</P>
<P>
   Her eyes darted again, locking onto a 1920 letterman jacket of
All American Husky football player Charles O. Carroll, who later
became a prosecuting attorney for King County. ``I'm going to have
to get in touch with his family today,'' Keaton whispered to
herself.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of monetary value, Keaton said, the items ranged from
``dime store to expensive.'' In terms of nostalgia, she called them
``priceless,'' and she hopes some of the mementos could be used in
a time capsule at the new football/soccer stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Furlow and Banel, connoisseurs of history both, relish stepping
into the warehouse, which they likened to passing through a time
machine.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Kingdome was a big civic gathering place,'' Banel said.
``It was one of the few places to have hosted four major sports _
football, baseball, soccer and basketball. Stadiums these days are
not made to serve so many purposes.''
</P>
<P>
   Furlow came to Seattle from Gainesville, Fla., in 1992. ``To me,
the Kingdome is as much part of the Seattle skyline as Mount
Rainier or the Space Needle. As soon as you see it,'' she said,
snapping her fingers, ``you think Seattle.''
</P>
<P>
   During a visit to the storage rooms last week, the pair hauled
away a bulky IVC 500A TV camera, which went out of style in the
1980s, as well as an aluminum bench; both items could soon be on
display at the museum. Furlow took a fan program from this year's
Seahawks-Miami Dolphins game, which was the final public event in
the stadium, and Kingdome computer screensavers, which the museum
plans to sell as souvenirs.
</P>
<P>
   ``History moves so quickly,'' Banel said. ``Usually you get
something, and it takes a few years before it becomes part of an
exhibit. But items we took a week ago are already on display.
People want to see it _ they want to see it now.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the relic hunters called it quits for the day, an item
caught their attention _ a large green mat with words in white
letters that struck an ironic note given what is to come.
</P>
<P>
   ``Welcome to the Kingdome,'' the mat read.

WIN PUTS STARS' CUP AIM IN FOCUS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JENNIFER FLOYD 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ A playoff berth has been clinched by the Stars, likely
the No. 2 seed. Forty wins have been achieved for a franchise-best
fourth consecutive season. Only New Jersey has done likewise.
</P>
<P>
   The power play, the goal scorers, the goalie and the defense all
look to be coming together after a season that can be described as
tumultuous on its good days and hellish on its worst.
</P>
<P>
   So why, then, after a 5-3 thumping yesterday of potential
first-round opponent San Jose, did the Stars not sound like a team
on the top of its game?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe because the Stars don't think they are.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's still another level yet,'' Stars winger Brad Lukowich
said. ``You can't feel that it's there. It's like it's right there,
that next step to be taken.''
</P>
<P>
   They're playing really well.
</P>
<P>
   They say they can play better.
</P>
<P>
   They know, if they're going to repeat as Stanley Cup champions,
they will have to.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody wants to do more,'' Stars defenseman Darryl Sydor
said. ``It's just the little things we're trying to work on in our
own zone. I think we're taking little baby steps. Work on this,
work on that, get our power play going, keep our penalty kill
going, that's what keeps us going.''
</P>
<P>
   They're pretty close. Or, at least, they look to be after what
they did to San Jose.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars scored five goals, including four in a row after San
Jose took a 1-0 lead. The Stars had four in their four previous
games against the Sharks.
</P>
<P>
   ``As of late, the guys have been playing offensive hockey more
and more and putting the puck in the net, and that's good to see,''
said Stars goalie Ed Belfour, who made 32 saves in his second game
back after missing five following his arrest March 8.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas' usual suspects, Mike Modano and Jamie Langenbrunner,
scored. Add Brett Hull to that group, too. He got his second goal
in as many games. He has 608 goals in his career, tying him for
10th on the all-time list with Dino Ciccarelli and putting him two
behind his father, Bobby.
</P>
<P>
   Even Lukowich scored. His first goal as a winger turned out to
be the game-winner.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're playing well,'' Langenbrunner said. ``We're starting to
get things going.''
</P>
<P>
   Langenbrunner had two by himself, including a short-handed goal
to knot the game at 1-1. Not bad for a guy that until just a little
bit before game time wasn't going to play. His pinched nerve in his
neck flared up after Saturday's 2-2 tie with Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a tough stretch we've had, and I was feeling it,'' said
Langenbrunner, who received therapy on his neck and decided to
play.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars finished a stretch of five games in eight days. They
were undefeated in that stretch. They scored 18 goals. Not that
goals haven't been easy to come by against San Jose lately. The
Sharks have allowed 17 goals in their past four games. Not even
their three goals, including two by captain Owen Nolan, could save
them against the Stars.
</P>
<P>
   ``It still boils down to great defense, whether you like it or
not,'' Sharks coach Darryl Sutter said. ``I think you can look at
the last four games and see what our goals against were. That
doesn't win you many games.''
</P>
<P>
   Stars coach Ken Hitchcock couldn't agree more. He said defense
has been a key reason for the back-to-back-to-back-to-back 40-win
seasons for Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've shown even though we've had a lot of players go through
here we've had that constant competitive nature about our group,''
Hitchcock said. Which is why as good as the Stars are playing now,
they say it isn't good enough.
</P>
<P>
   For proof, they needed only to look to Saturday's game against
Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could've really won big,'' Hitchcock said. ``We missed five
or six open nets. We were kind of tee-hee heeing, and we weren't
mad. That's the wrong attitude. We should've been really mad and
beared down.''
</P>
<P>
   No, that they saved for yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   The Sharks felt the wrath for the Stars' inability to close on
the Blackhawks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like `OK guys, we can leave everything out. Empty the
tank today,' '' Lukowich said. ``Whatever is left in the tank. We
were pretty empty as it was.''
</P>
<P>
   They've got four days to fill it up and another step to take.

VENTURE CAPITAL MARKET BOOMING IN SEATTLE AREA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN COOK  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   When George Clute founded Olympic Venture Partners in 1982, the
banker turned venture capitalist had to travel out of state to find
promising new start-up companies to fund.
</P>
<P>
   ``There just weren't enough quality deals in Seattle,'' said
Clute, whose Kirkland firm invested about 60 percent of its first
$25 million fund in California companies.
</P>
<P>
   Things have certainly changed. Partners at Olympic now spend
more time crossing the 520 bridge than buzzing down to San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``The volume of projects and incredible depth of what is going
on in Seattle is so much beyond what it was a few years ago,'' said
Chad Waite, a partner at Olympic.
</P>
<P>
   Venture capital, the gasoline that fuels technology,
communications and biotechnology start-ups, is growing at a furious
pace in the state. Privately held Washington companies pulled in
$1.2 billion in 1999, more than a 200 percent increase over the
prior year. Only New York, where companies attracted $1.8 billion,
had a faster growth rate.
</P>
<P>
   More money is on the way. And some say the Seattle metropolitan
area, where new home-grown venture funds are popping up like tulips
in the Skagit Valley sun, could become the fastest growth region in
the country for venture investments this year.
</P>
<P>
   Since December, more than $1 billion in new capital has been
raised by local venture capital firms.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Ignition Corp., a Bellevue investment firm created by
former Microsoft and McCaw Cellular executives, began with $140
million in backing. Maveron, founded by former investment banker
Dan Levitan and Starbucks chief executive Howard Schultz, announced
a $340 million fund earlier this month. Madrona, a Seattle venture
capital firm and early backer of Amazon.com, pulled in $250 million
in December. And Voyager Capital is expected to announce a $212
million fund this month with 70 percent of the money to be invested
in Pacific Northwest companies.
</P>
<P>
   What does all of this new money mean?
</P>
<P>
   Those who follow the local high-tech economy say it could create
an even bigger technology boom in Seattle. After all, venture
investments have played a part in building nearly every one of
Seattle's publicly traded technology companies, from Amazon.com and
HomeGrocer.com to Avenue A and BSquare. And although not all of the
$1 billion will be invested locally, a good portion of the money
could find its way into Seattle start-ups.
</P>
<P>
   The huge amounts of money being pooled in Seattle during the
past few months is a bit mind-boggling for old-time venture
capitalists like Clute. Partners at the firm's Carillon Point
office used to joke that they saw every business plan in town. Now
they can hardly keep up with the entrepreneurial activity. The firm
received about 1,200 new business plans last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have moved from single A ball into the major leagues,''
said Clute, whose firm raised a $150 million fund in December.
</P>
<P>
   With all of the new money, Seattle is on pace to surpass New
York this year as the fastest growth region in the country for
venture investments, said Kirk Walden, national director of venture
capital research at PricewaterhouseCoopers.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of oceans are being fished out, and Seattle is fresh
water,'' Walden said. ``Historically, Seattle has been a player in
the technology area but not necessarily in the financial area. ...
It is one of the natural places for the more formal venture capital
infrastructure to expand.''
</P>
<P>
   Walden says once the infrastructure is in place with ``half a
dozen brand name VCs,'' Seattle area entrepreneurs will come out of
the woodwork.
</P>
<P>
   ``It can act as a catalyst to get people to make that leap to
entrepreneurship,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Washington, the 15th most populous state, already leads the
nation in the formation of new companies. The rate of new company
growth is more than 20 percent higher than in California, according
to a report released earlier this month by the Washington
Technology Center. But Washington, the report found, has lagged
behind in the creation of venture capital funds to support those
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Entrepreneurs have had to jump on commuter flights to San Jose,
San Francisco and New York if they wanted to raise money or seek
advice for their emerging businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle's new crop of venture investors wants to plug up that
deal drain. ``The market opportunity (for new Seattle firms) is why
not fund Washington state companies with Washington state venture
funds,'' said Enrique Godreau, a managing director at Voyager
Capital.
</P>
<P>
   But it is not just local funds establishing a presence in
Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Mohr Davidow Ventures, a Menlo Park, Calif.,
venture capital firm with stakes in Brocade Communications and
Onvia .com, announced that it would establish a branch office in
Seattle to be closer to the booming technology community here.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Northwest has the entrepreneurs, the ideas and the
infrastructure necessary to be the next venture hotbed,'' said
Nancy Schoendorf, co-managing partner of the firm. ``MDV's strategy
of active involvement in the earliest stages of the business
require us to have a local presence.''
</P>
<P>
   Garage.com, a Palo Alto, Calif., company that links
entrepreneurs with investors, set up a Kirkland office last year.
Other Silicon Valley venture firms, such as Draper Fisher
Jurvetson, Oak Investment Partners and Red Leaf, are partnering
with Washington venture capital firms to ensure they get into the
early stage deals in the Northwest.
</P>
<P>
   Not every Silicon Valley money manager, however, feels the need
to have an office here. Kleiner Perkins Caufield &AMP; Byers, an
investor in local companies such as Blue Nile, HomeGrocer.com and
Amazon.com, says it has no plans to open offices outside the San
Francisco Bay area. Neal Dempsey, a venture capitalist at Bay
Partners in Cupertino, said his firm, an investor in Bellevue-based
Wavtrace, would probably set up offices in Austin, Texas, or San
Diego before coming to Seattle. Still, the University of Washington
grad and native of Tacoma admits that Seattle's venture capital
community is booming and ``finally getting its just due?''
</P>
<P>
   Tony Audino has watched the venture capital infrastructure
develop in Seattle up close: first as a Microsoft manager then as a
co-founder of Voyager Capital. Audino, whose firm has backed Avenue
A, NetPodium and Tegic Communications, believes Seattle is
beginning to feel the effects of the venture capital boom.
</P>
<P>
   ``This area has the opportunity to be the No. 2 technology
center in the country because of the market leaders here in
software, telecommunications, e-commerce and streaming media,''
Audino said.
</P>
<P>
   But Audino also knows that it is important to have links to the
movers and shakers in California's technology community. That's a
big reason why Voyager Capital has hired a Stanford grad to set up
a branch office in Silicon Valley this summer.
</P>
<P>
   In Seattle, more money means more competition. With talented
entrepreneurs leaving established companies like Microsoft, AT&AMP;T
Wireless and RealNetworks, Bill McAleer, a managing director at
Voyager Capital, predicts that Seattle venture capitalists will end
up competing vigorously to get into hot deals. The current
collaborative environment, where venture investors pass on hot tips
to other investors, could disappear, McAleer said. The new funds
also will continue to specialize in certain segments such as
business-to-business e-commerce or wireless communications in order
to differentiate themselves in an increasingly crowded market, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the strategy for the venture capital funds, the new
money pouring into the area is good news for entrepreneurs. For
those with a track record and a hot idea, venture dollars are
plentiful.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Sperry can attest to that. The former chief executive of
publicly traded Primus Knowledge Solutions, Sperry is now quickly
building a second start-up in Pioneer Square by the name of Acadio.
He has had no problem raising money from local investors and
venture capital firms to get the company off the ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an incredible place to raise money,'' said Sperry,
whose firm set out to raise a second venture round of $15 million
this winter and is expected to close on more than $30 million this
month.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Tobias, founder of Seattle-based Loudeye Technologies,
said he is a big believer in the venture capital process. His
company, which raised $72 million in an IPO on Wednesday and now
has a market value of more than $1 billion, owes much of its
success to an early partnership with Olympic Venture Partners. A
former Microsoft manager, Tobias said money was not what he was
looking for when he started his streaming media company three years
ago. He needed the support, contacts and expertise of a local
venture capitalist.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had the choice to go down to the Valley to raise money, but
I didn't because I wanted someone to be actively involved early on
in the daily running of the business,'' Tobias said. ``I couldn't
get that from a Bay Area firm.''
</P>
<P>
   Tobias, who has invested his own money in several local venture
firms, said it is about time that Seattle established a strong
venture capital infrastructure to support local entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are getting to the point where there's enough competition
among venture funds to give entrepreneurs a lot of opportunities
rather than a handful,'' he said.

<P>
   BUFFALO, N.Y. _ The sting from Pepperdine's 75-67 loss to
Oklahoma State in the second-round NCAA Tournament on Sunday was
beginning to fade a bit as the postgame media session wrapped up.
</P>
<P>
   There was a sense of pride for Tezale Archie, Tommie Prince,
Nick Sheppard and Brandon Armstrong as they filed out of the news
conference.
</P>
<P>
   They came to Buffalo hoping to bring attention to the Waves'
nationally obscure program. They did so by routing Indiana in the
first round and keeping up with Oklahoma State in the second.
</P>
<P>
   People took notice, and one in particular wanted to make sure
they were aware of that. So a lone clap started as the Waves left
the interview room. A one-man ovation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sorry about that,'' Pepperdine coach Jan van Breda Kolff said
to no one in particular.
</P>
<P>
   It was van Breda Kolff, the Waves' first-year coach, who was
applauding.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I am most proud about is the guys on this podium and the
guys inthe locker room,'' van Breda Kollf said. ``I've been
coaching for awhile and playing for awhile, and winning and losing
never gets old. Most of the time when you lose you are very
disappointed and you're usually madat yourself and players. This is
one of the few times in my career that there are no ill-effects. In
all my years of basketball, this is the team I've most enjoyed
being around on a day-to-day basis.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a mutual feeling. All along the Waves have talked about van
Breda Kolff's impact. When he took over from Lorenzo Romar last
spring, van Breda Kolff replaced Romar's slow-down offense with an
uptempo, attacking system, giving them the freedom to play a style
they enjoyed more.
</P>
<P>
   He also let them express their individuality, allowing them to
grow their hair out and wear headbands.
</P>
<P>
   The players flourished, winning a school-record 25 games and
advancing to the second round of the NCAA Tournament for the first
time since 1982.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's great the way coach van Breda Kolff has supported
us all the way,'' Tommie Prince said. ``He has been behind us
during the whole situation and has prepared us for each game. He
made sure that we were well prepared for anything we faced.''
</P>
<P>
   Archie, Sheppard and Prince graduate this year, leaving the
program to van Breda Kolff and underclassmen like Armstrong, Kelvin
Gibbs, Craig Lewis and David Lalazarian.
</P>
<P>
   After this weekend, there is something to build on.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe we can start a dynasty,'' Archie said.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe.

STAPLES CENTER EXECS MIGHT FIND IT A HARD SELL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MICHAEL ROSENTHAL  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Tim Leiweke, president of Staples Center, sees the
new downtown arena as the biggest, baddest sports and entertainment
venue on the planet. If not now, certainly in the near future.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Staples must stage mega-events to claim its place
among the Madison Square Gardens of the world and nothing is bigger
than a major fight.
</P>
<P>
   The Oscar De La Hoya-Shane Mosley matchup on June 17 - the first
such fight - will be formally announced today at news conference at
the arena, the kickoff of a promotional blitz to sell the event and
boxing to the people of Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   And if the promotion goes well (read: if the event sells out)
this could be just the beginning.
</P>
<P>
   Leiweke said he'd like to stage one or two big fights a year at
Staples and promote boxing cards at other venues in the Los Angeles
area and beyond. That could include Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   He mentioned the Forum and the Olympic Auditorium as possible
venues in L.A.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the resources and experience to do a lot things,''
Leiweke said. ``The key is that this event goes well. It will
increase our appetite to do other things in boxing.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, two things must occur if Staples is to dive head first
into boxing: Fans must buy into the June 17 event and the state
must agree in the long run to cap its tax of the live gate at
$50,000, as opposed to 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Can anyone sell 19,000-plus seats for a boxing card in this
town?
</P>
<P>
   Such a thing seems unfathomable in light of the recent past. In
the past two decades, a crowd of 5,000 for boxing at even the
biggest arenas has been deemed a reasonable success.
</P>
<P>
   Put simply, boxing is a very hard sell.
</P>
<P>
   However, this one might be different. This might be the most
compelling matchup in Los Angeles since Muhammad Ali fought Ken
Norton at the Forum in 1973 for several reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, De La Hoya doesn't have the name recognition of Ali
but he's the biggest thing going at the moment. Plus, Mosley is an
exceptional fighter whom many believe will beat De La Hoya and he's
also from the L.A. area. He grew up in Pomona, De La Hoya in East
L.A.
</P>
<P>
   The tickets also are priced as low as $50, inexpensive by boxing
standards and affordable for the common fan.
</P>
<P>
   Add to that what is expected to be a monstrous marketing
campaign and the fact that the glitzy arena is a magnet in itself,
and the house just might be packed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal is to sell out and we'll use all our resources to
make sure we do,'' Leiweke said. ``There's a tremendous buzz and we
haven't even announced the fight yet.... I don't think it's going
to be an issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything we've seen this week makes us believe this is the
hot ticket.''
</P>
<P>
   Leiweke and promoter Bob Arum, with whom Leiweke appears to be
developing a close working relationship, have said the tax cap is
key to the future of boxing here.
</P>
<P>
   If the De La Hoya-Mosley card sells out, ticket sales will total
about $8 million - a $400,000 tax burden at 5 percent. And that's
not including a 3 percent city tax.
</P>
<P>
   Under those circumstances, why should Arum do business here when
New York has a cap?
</P>
<P>
   A few government officials have said they'll do what they can,
others have been more pessimistic. Leiweke is hoping common sense
ultimately carries the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a sport where (everyone involved) fights for every penny,
that could be a deal killer,'' Leiweke said. ``...It's a sensible
argument: The cap guarantees that this fight and others will
generate tax revenue that wasn't generated before.
</P>
<P>
   ``Otherwise, 100 percent of nothing is nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   The fight probably will draw at least 15,000 fans, perhaps more,
which means Staples could lost some money.
</P>
<P>
   However, money isn't the principal issue at the moment. A crowd
that size, particularly if it creates the kind of energy Leiweke is
hoping for, might be a good enough foundation on which to begin
rebuilding boxing in this town.
</P>
<P>
   We'll never see the regular shows that that so enthralled L.A.
fans up until the early 1970s but we might see our share of the big
ones.
</P>
<P>
   Leiweke and Co. are very determined.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want HBO, TVKO, Top Rank, the boxers, the media that covers
the event to walk out of here and say, `That's as good a boxing
match, as good a boxing facility, as good a boxing market as any in
the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our No. 1 priority is to put Staples on the map. And bringing
major championship boxing to L.A. is part of that.''
</P>
<P>
   More Staples: The fight could fall between the sixth and seventh
games of the NBA Finals if the Lakers make it that far.
</P>
<P>
   If that happens, it would seem the fight would get buried in the
basketball hype.
</P>
<P>
   Leiweke isn't worried. OK, the fight probably wouldn't get the
play it might otherwise. At the same time, media from around the
world would bein L.A. for the NBA series and would certainly file
reports on the fight.
</P>
<P>
   Plus, the combination of the Finals and the fight might create
an unforgettable stir.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would create one of the greatest weekends of sports ever,''
Leiweke said. ``Think about what that will do for the city, for
downtown.''
</P>
<P>
   No regrets: Dan Goossen, David Reid's promoter, has no regrets
about pitting his fighter against Felix Trinidad on March 3.
</P>
<P>
   Trinidad was losing after six rounds but knocked Reid down four
times in the second half of what turned into a brutal beating. Many
believe Reid - with only 14 fights behind him - lacked the
experience to cope with Trinidad.
</P>
<P>
   ``Make the call and you're successful and you're a genius. Make
the same call and you're not successful and you're an idiot,''
Goossen said. ``I'd make the same decision again.
</P>
<P>
   ``David had enough experience in the first half of the fight,
didn't he? He was able to execute the game plan even with 14
fights. His experience wasn't what changed the fight - it was the
one punch in the seventh round (that knocked him down for the first
time). That changed the direction of the fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had the ability to win that fight.''
</P>
<P>
   Some have suggested that Reid, previously unbeaten, will have
difficulty bouncing back from such a beating in terms of
confidence.
</P>
<P>
   Goossen said he's not worried.
</P>
<P>
   ``All great champions have lost and come back,'' he said. ``Look
at Tommy Hearns in his first fight with Ray Leonard or Leonard with
Roberto Duran. The great ones are able to overcome such losses and
achieve great success.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I think David showed he's capable of beating one of the
top fighters in the industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Goossen said he has no time table but would like to get Reid
back into the ring as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
   TV twist: ESPN2's ``Friday Night Fights'' has scheduled a first
in televised boxing this Friday: Analyst/trainer Teddy Atlas will
work the corner of his fighter and do TV analysis at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   Cameras will follow Atlas into the locker room of Elviro Muriqui
as the undefeated fighter prepares for his six-round bout against
Dan Sheehan and then to ringside, where Atlas will instruct Muriqui
between rounds and comment on the fight as it happens.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is to give the viewer an idea of what goes on behind
the scenes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will give my fighter instruction with everyone watching and
listening, so there will be a risk here. If something doesn't go
smoothly, it will highlighted,'' Atlas said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But, I'll be honest in my assessment with my fighter and for
the viewer.''
</P>
<P>
   Watch your language, Teddy.

LAKERS BEAT KNICKS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ With a giddy commissioner in the stands, the NBC
marketing machine in overdrive and enough star power on the floor
to start a new galaxy, the NBA turned loose its Fantasy Finals on
Sunday afternoon. But just as the spotlights burned brightest came
the sudden, unexpected blackout.
</P>
<P>
   A Shaq-out, actually.
</P>
<P>
   Shaquille O'Neal made a mockery of the much-anticipated showdown
at sold-out Madison Square Garden, scoring 43 points and powering
the Los Angeles Lakers to a decidedly routine 92-85 victory over
the New York Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   So much for the sizzle of a possible Finals preview, on the
NBA's grandest stage, with the league's marquee names playing
before a dozen stars (Spike Lee, Ice Cube, a Baldwin brother among
them) at courtside.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought the game lost energy,'' said Lakers coach Phil
Jackson. ``We were able to do kind of the mundane things to take
all of the excitement and the energy out of the game and get the
ball into Shaq, and he performed at a very high level.''
</P>
<P>
   For the ever-dominating Lakers (55-12), dull is good. Another
presumed test is brushed aside.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we sent a message to ourselves, more so than them,''
said Derek Fisher, ``that we can come into the mecca of basketball
against a good defensive team, a good basketball team as a whole,
and get a win. We didn't play perfect basketball, we didn't make
all our shots, we shot terrible from the free-throw line. We still
figured out a way to get it done.''
</P>
<P>
   That proved to be as simple as feeding O'Neal, over and over and
over. Even with a sore right hamstring, even against Patrick Ewing,
O'Neal met little resistance, hitting 18 of 31 shots from the field
and 7 of 13 from the foul line to surpass the 40-point plateau for
the fourth time in the last seven games.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal appeared to wince a couple times, and asked out for a
short breather late in the third quarter, but if he's playing with
pain, ``I can't tell,'' said Glen Rice. ``If he is, he's doing a
great job of hiding it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been playing just unbelievable basketball,'' Rice said.
``You got a guy playing like that, you gotta continue to keep going
to him, and we're gonna go for that ride with him.''
</P>
<P>
   Easy decision. And a satisfying result for a Lakers team with
its eyes squarely on June, where the Knicks might be waiting for
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it gets to that point, it will definitely give us a lot of
confidence,'' said Kobe Bryant, ``knowing that we can come in here,
a tough place to play, and win.''
</P>
<P>
   That was in doubt for only a half. Despite 24 points from
O'Neal, the Lakers trailed at halftime, 44-43, as the Knicks
enjoyed a 31-20 rebounding advantage and held Bryant and Rice in
check.
</P>
<P>
   But Bryant pumped in 17 of his 24 points in the second half and
combined with O'Neal to build an 11-point lead by the end of the
third. The Knicks never got closer than six points in the final
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kobe has been playing fabulous since the All-Star break,''
O'Neal said. ``We're going to be the one-two punch for a long time
to come. We're playing pretty good together right now. I'm proud of
Kobe.''
</P>
<P>
   No other Laker scored more than six points (Rice, Robert Horry)
as the team struggled to a 42.5 percent shooting day. But the
Lakers attacked the glass in the second half (outrebounding New
York, 28-15) and used their vaunted defense to hold the Knicks off.
</P>
<P>
   Ewing made just 6 of 20 shots for 12 points. Allan Houston
scored 20 points on 7-of-17 shooting. And Latrell Sprewell, guarded
primarily by Bryant, finished with 13 points.
</P>
<P>
   The teams meet again in two weeks at Staples Center, after which
they can ponder the ultimate rematch - ``I think the NBA would like
that very much,'' Bryant said of a Finals meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are certainly the team to beat,'' Knicks coach Jeff Van
Gundy said of the Lakers. ``At the same time, I think that in a
series they become tougher because of the dominance of O'Neal and
great team defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``How that plays out from here I don't know. But certainly and
clearly, they are the best team at this point of the year.''

VENTURE CAPITAL MARKET BOOMING IN SEATTLE AREA 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   When George Clute founded Olympic Venture Partners in 1982, the
banker turned venture capitalist had to travel out of state to find
promising new start-up companies to fund.
</P>
<P>
   ``There just weren't enough quality deals in Seattle,'' said
Clute, whose Kirkland firm invested about 60 percent of its first
$25 million fund in California companies.
</P>
<P>
   Things have certainly changed. Partners at Olympic now spend
more time crossing the 520 bridge than buzzing down to San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``The volume of projects and incredible depth of what is going
on in Seattle is so much beyond what it was a few years ago,'' said
Chad Waite, a partner at Olympic.
</P>
<P>
   Venture capital, the gasoline that fuels technology,
communications and biotechnology start-ups, is growing at a furious
pace in the state. Privately held Washington companies pulled in
$1.2 billion in 1999, more than a 200 percent increase over the
prior year. Only New York, where companies attracted $1.8 billion,
had a faster growth rate.
</P>
<P>
   More money is on the way. And some say the Seattle metropolitan
area, where new home-grown venture funds are popping up like tulips
in the Skagit Valley sun, could become the fastest growth region in
the country for venture investments this year.
</P>
<P>
   Since December, more than $1 billion in new capital has been
raised by local venture capital firms.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Ignition Corp., a Bellevue investment firm created by
former Microsoft and McCaw Cellular executives, began with $140
million in backing. Maveron, founded by former investment banker
Dan Levitan and Starbucks chief executive Howard Schultz, announced
a $340 million fund earlier this month. Madrona, a Seattle venture
capital firm and early backer of Amazon.com, pulled in $250 million
in December. And Voyager Capital is expected to announce a $212
million fund this month with 70 percent of the money to be invested
in Pacific Northwest companies.
</P>
<P>
   What does all of this new money mean?
</P>
<P>
   Those who follow the local high-tech economy say it could create
an even bigger technology boom in Seattle. After all, venture
investments have played a part in building nearly every one of
Seattle's publicly traded technology companies, from Amazon.com and
HomeGrocer.com to Avenue A and BSquare. And although not all of the
$1 billion will be invested locally, a good portion of the money
could find its way into Seattle start-ups.
</P>
<P>
   The huge amounts of money being pooled in Seattle during the
past few months is a bit mind-boggling for old-time venture
capitalists like Clute. Partners at the firm's Carillon Point
office used to joke that they saw every business plan in town. Now
they can hardly keep up with the entrepreneurial activity. The firm
received about 1,200 new business plans last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have moved from single A ball into the major leagues,''
said Clute, whose firm raised a $150 million fund in December.
</P>
<P>
   With all of the new money, Seattle is on pace to surpass New
York this year as the fastest growth region in the country for
venture investments, said Kirk Walden, national director of venture
capital research at PricewaterhouseCoopers.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of oceans are being fished out, and Seattle is fresh
water,'' Walden said. ``Historically, Seattle has been a player in
the technology area but not necessarily in the financial area. ...
It is one of the natural places for the more formal venture capital
infrastructure to expand.''
</P>
<P>
   Walden says once the infrastructure is in place with ``half a
dozen brand name VCs,'' Seattle area entrepreneurs will come out of
the woodwork.
</P>
<P>
   ``It can act as a catalyst to get people to make that leap to
entrepreneurship,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Washington, the 15th most populous state, already leads the
nation in the formation of new companies. The rate of new company
growth is more than 20 percent higher than in California, according
to a report released earlier this month by the Washington
Technology Center. But Washington, the report found, has lagged
behind in the creation of venture capital funds to support those
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Entrepreneurs have had to jump on commuter flights to San Jose,
San Francisco and New York if they wanted to raise money or seek
advice for their emerging businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle's new crop of venture investors wants to plug up that
deal drain. ``The market opportunity (for new Seattle firms) is why
not fund Washington state companies with Washington state venture
funds,'' said Enrique Godreau, a managing director at Voyager
Capital.
</P>
<P>
   But it is not just local funds establishing a presence in
Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Mohr Davidow Ventures, a Menlo Park, Calif.,
venture capital firm with stakes in Brocade Communications and
Onvia .com, announced that it would establish a branch office in
Seattle to be closer to the booming technology community here.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Northwest has the entrepreneurs, the ideas and the
infrastructure necessary to be the next venture hotbed,'' said
Nancy Schoendorf, co-managing partner of the firm. ``MDV's strategy
of active involvement in the earliest stages of the business
require us to have a local presence.''
</P>
<P>
   Garage.com, a Palo Alto, Calif., company that links
entrepreneurs with investors, set up a Kirkland office last year.
Other Silicon Valley venture firms, such as Draper Fisher
Jurvetson, Oak Investment Partners and Red Leaf, are partnering
with Washington venture capital firms to ensure they get into the
early stage deals in the Northwest.
</P>
<P>
   Not every Silicon Valley money manager, however, feels the need
to have an office here. Kleiner Perkins Caufield &AMP; Byers, an
investor in local companies such as Blue Nile, HomeGrocer.com and
Amazon.com, says it has no plans to open offices outside the San
Francisco Bay area. Neal Dempsey, a venture capitalist at Bay
Partners in Cupertino, said his firm, an investor in Bellevue-based
Wavtrace, would probably set up offices in Austin, Texas, or San
Diego before coming to Seattle. Still, the University of Washington
grad and native of Tacoma admits that Seattle's venture capital
community is booming and ``finally getting its just due?''
</P>
<P>
   Tony Audino has watched the venture capital infrastructure
develop in Seattle up close: first as a Microsoft manager then as a
co-founder of Voyager Capital. Audino, whose firm has backed Avenue
A, NetPodium and Tegic Communications, believes Seattle is
beginning to feel the effects of the venture capital boom.
</P>
<P>
   ``This area has the opportunity to be the No. 2 technology
center in the country because of the market leaders here in
software, telecommunications, e-commerce and streaming media,''
Audino said.
</P>
<P>
   But Audino also knows that it is important to have links to the
movers and shakers in California's technology community. That's a
big reason why Voyager Capital has hired a Stanford grad to set up
a branch office in Silicon Valley this summer.
</P>
<P>
   In Seattle, more money means more competition. With talented
entrepreneurs leaving established companies like Microsoft, AT&AMP;T
Wireless and RealNetworks, Bill McAleer, a managing director at
Voyager Capital, predicts that Seattle venture capitalists will end
up competing vigorously to get into hot deals. The current
collaborative environment, where venture investors pass on hot tips
to other investors, could disappear, McAleer said. The new funds
also will continue to specialize in certain segments such as
business-to-business e-commerce or wireless communications in order
to differentiate themselves in an increasingly crowded market, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the strategy for the venture capital funds, the new
money pouring into the area is good news for entrepreneurs. For
those with a track record and a hot idea, venture dollars are
plentiful.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Sperry can attest to that. The former chief executive of
publicly traded Primus Knowledge Solutions, Sperry is now quickly
building a second start-up in Pioneer Square by the name of Acadio.
He has had no problem raising money from local investors and
venture capital firms to get the company off the ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an incredible place to raise money,'' said Sperry,
whose firm set out to raise a second venture round of $15 million
this winter and is expected to close on more than $30 million this
month.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Tobias, founder of Seattle-based Loudeye Technologies,
said he is a big believer in the venture capital process. His
company, which raised $72 million in an IPO on Wednesday and now
has a market value of more than $1 billion, owes much of its
success to an early partnership with Olympic Venture Partners. A
former Microsoft manager, Tobias said money was not what he was
looking for when he started his streaming media company three years
ago. He needed the support, contacts and expertise of a local
venture capitalist.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had the choice to go down to the Valley to raise money, but
I didn't because I wanted someone to be actively involved early on
in the daily running of the business,'' Tobias said. ``I couldn't
get that from a Bay Area firm.''
</P>
<P>
   Tobias, who has invested his own money in several local venture
firms, said it is about time that Seattle established a strong
venture capital infrastructure to support local entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are getting to the point where there's enough competition
among venture funds to give entrepreneurs a lot of opportunities
rather than a handful,'' he said.

KINGDOME MEMORABILIA GETS ANOTHER CHANCE AT BAT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROBERT L. JAMIESON JR.  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a brick building near Pioneer Square, Elizabeth Furlow hunts
for ghosts of the Kingdome.
</P>
<P>
   She slips inside a dimly lit storage room and locks eyes with
Jack Lelivelt, the late baseball manager for the Seattle Rainiers.
It's love at first sight. ``I'd like to take him,'' she says,
studying contours of the bronze plaque honoring the minor league
coach who led the Rainiers to two championships 60 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Furlow is part of a cadre on a mission to save Kingdome
memorabilia and souvenirs. The nostalgic pursuit has taken on
greater importance given the imminent demise of the landmark
stadium on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Historians say relics from the Kingdome _ including the Lelivelt
plaque, which was once housed in a stadium museum _ will provide
learning tools for future generations to study the sports and civic
life of Seattle in the late 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of items linked to the Dome _ from ticket stubs to a
wood architectural model of the stadium to old photographs of the
Seattle Metropolitans, Seattle's World Hockey Champions in 1917 _
have been cataloged, packed up and placed in five storage rooms.
</P>
<P>
   The rooms, haunted by history, are a collector's dream: a framed
football jersey of Steve Largent, the Hall of Fame Seahawks
receiver; an old control panel for the Kingdome's scoreboard; a
baseball, blackened by age, that was used in an 1886 game; a
duplicate NBA trophy commemorating the Sonics's 1979 championship
season in the Dome.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are items that 50, 100 years from now people will look
at and say one thing _ Kingdome,'' said Furlow, curator of
collections for the Museum of History and Industry in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want things that are evocative,'' she said. ``Things that
will help people understand the Kingdome and its relevancy to
Seattle history.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the items will be donated to three places _ the Museum
of History and Industry, the Washington State Historical Society in
Tacoma and the University of Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Remaining relics and mementos will be made available to the
public during an auction this spring, said Carol Keaton, a
long-time Kingdome employee whose work has made it possible for the
items to find new homes. She has been stockpiling stuff since
December.
</P>
<P>
   Everything in the storage room is connected _ directly or
indirectly _ to the Dome. For example, the Lelivelt plaque was part
of old Sick's Stadium in south Seattle before it found a place in
the Kingdome museum. (Lelivelt led the Rainiers to Pacific Coast
League championships in 1939 and 1940.)
</P>
<P>
   Ticket stubs and media passes, framed in a glass and wood case,
are the result of more than 3,000 events in the 23-year history of
``Stonehenge in Seattle,'' as the Dome was dubbed.
</P>
<P>
   Some items were literally attached to the stadium. ``Now these I
remember!'' exclaimed Feliks Banel, a deputy director at the Museum
of History and Industry, who grabbed the back of an orange Kingdome
seat. The color, he said, signified the Kingdome's 300 level _
popularly referred to as the cheap seats. He let loose a knowing
chuckle. ``The nosebleeds.''
</P>
<P>
   Furlow and Banel have made two previous trips to the storehouse
of memories, which sits in a building shadowed by the Kingdome.
</P>
<P>
   Their booty has included a ceiling tile that fell from the
interior roof of the Kingdome in 1994, a patch of artificial turf
and all four bases from opening day of 1999 _ the Mariners' last
season in the Dome. These items, which are on display at the museum
in the 2700 block of 24th Avenue East, are popular.
</P>
<P>
   Last year the museum generated about $20,000 in revenue. But in
little more than a week since the museum opened its Kingdome
collection, more than $4,000 has flooded in, in part because a
museum gift shop is selling pieces of Kingdome turf, T-shirts and a
sample of field dirt as part of a $40 ``Implosion Pack.''
</P>
<P>
   One recent afternoon, Keaton stepped into a storage room and
pulled out a piece of clothing _ a silk Haori coat presented in
1921 to Roscoe ``Torchy'' Torrance, a UW baseball player, during
the baseball team's tour of Japan.
</P>
<P>
   During that trip, the UW players had a brush with history.
Keaton said that one of the Japanese translators for the team was a
man who went on to bigger things _ Hirohito.
</P>
<P>
   As Keaton rummaged through one of the storage rooms, her eyes
darted to another item _ a baseball signed by members of the 1969
Seattle Pilots baseball team.
</P>
<P>
   Her eyes darted again, locking onto a 1920 letterman jacket of
All American Husky football player Charles O. Carroll, who later
became a prosecuting attorney for King County. ``I'm going to have
to get in touch with his family today,'' Keaton whispered to
herself.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of monetary value, Keaton said, the items ranged from
``dime store to expensive.'' In terms of nostalgia, she called them
``priceless,'' and she hopes some of the mementos could be used in
a time capsule at the new football/soccer stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Furlow and Banel, connoisseurs of history both, relish stepping
into the warehouse, which they likened to passing through a time
machine.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Kingdome was a big civic gathering place,'' Banel said.
``It was one of the few places to have hosted four major sports _
football, baseball, soccer and basketball. Stadiums these days are
not made to serve so many purposes.''
</P>
<P>
   Furlow came to Seattle from Gainesville, Fla., in 1992. ``To me,
the Kingdome is as much part of the Seattle skyline as Mount
Rainier or the Space Needle. As soon as you see it,'' she said,
snapping her fingers, ``you think Seattle.''
</P>
<P>
   During a visit to the storage rooms last week, the pair hauled
away a bulky IVC 500A TV camera, which went out of style in the
1980s, as well as an aluminum bench; both items could soon be on
display at the museum. Furlow took a fan program from this year's
Seahawks-Miami Dolphins game, which was the final public event in
the stadium, and Kingdome computer screensavers, which the museum
plans to sell as souvenirs.
</P>
<P>
   ``History moves so quickly,'' Banel said. ``Usually you get
something, and it takes a few years before it becomes part of an
exhibit. But items we took a week ago are already on display.
People want to see it _ they want to see it now.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the relic hunters called it quits for the day, an item
caught their attention _ a large green mat with words in white
letters that struck an ironic note given what is to come.
</P>
<P>
   ``Welcome to the Kingdome,'' the mat read.

DRYSDALE'S DERBY HOPES BEGINNING TO MULTIPLY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARCADIA, Calif. _ The only time Neil Drysdale went to Churchill
Downs with plans to start a horse in the Kentucky Derby, the colt
named A.P. Indy bruised a hoof and had to be scratched on the
morning of the race.
</P>
<P>
   This time, Drysdale might be able to bring a spare.
</P>
<P>
   The English-born, Hollywood Park-based trainer, already
polishing one Derby contender in San Rafael Stakes winner War
Chant, displayed a second in the $250,000 San Felipe on Sunday when
Fusaichi Pegasus turned back The Deputy and left Anees a rusty
third at Santa Anita.
</P>
<P>
   Fusaichi Pegasus ($4.60), ridden confidently by Kent Desormeaux,
won the 1 1/16-mile race by three-quarters of a length in 1:42.66
without being whipped, satisfying the curiosity a $4 million horse
with bandages on all four ankles is bound to inspire.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't got there yet,'' Drysdale, with characteristic
caution, said of the May 6 Kentucky Derby. ``When we go into the
(starting) gate, we'll know we got there.''
</P>
<P>
   But after becoming the first trainer to win the two major Santa
Anita Derby preps with different horses, Drysdale can at least plot
his path to Louisville.
</P>
<P>
   He said Irving and Marjorie Cowan's War Chant, 3 for 3 after
leading the San Rafael gate to wire on March 4, will use the April
8 Santa Anita Derby as his steppingstone to Churchill.
</P>
<P>
   Avoiding an intrabarn clash, Drysdale said Fusaichi Pegasus,
owned by retired high-tech executive Fusao Sekiguchi of Tokyo, will
go to the Wood Memorial at Aqueduct or the Blue Grass Stakes at
Keeneland. Both races are April 15.
</P>
<P>
   Fusaichi Pegasus, 3 for 4 after winning his first try at the
stakes level, was bought at a Kentucky yearling auction for $4
million. Drysdale said the four wraps are merely precautionary,
``because he's such a big,heavy horse.''
</P>
<P>
   A.P. Indy cost $2.9 million. After Drysdale scratched him on
Derby day, he went on to win the 1992 Belmont Stakes and the Horse
of the Year title.
</P>
<P>
   Drysdale's failure to run a horse in the Derby is the glaring
hole in a quarter-century career that has earned the 52-year-old a
spot on the 1999 and 2000 Hall of Fame ballots.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, back east: California connections did well in New
York too on Sunday as favored Red Bullet and jockey Alex Solis
outfinished Bobby Frankel-trained Aptitude to win the $200,000
Gotham Stakes at Aqueduct by a half-length. Red Bullet, owned by
Santa Anita chairman Frank Stronach, is unbeaten in only three
starts.
</P>
<P>
   The 1-mile Wood is next for the top two. They may have to face
Fusaichi Pegasus.
</P>
<P>
   Notes: In a winner's-circle presentation ceremony, Mike Smith
thanked his fellow jockeys for voting him the 50th George Woolf
Award recipient, which annually honors a rider for his career and
character. ``You inspired me to be not only the best rider I could
be, but also the best person I could be,'' said the two-time
Eclipse Award winner, whose mother and brother traveled from New
Mexico to Santa Anita for the occasion. ... Wheelaway, the
favorite, won the Tampa Bay Derby. ... Although Drysdale is the
first trainer to win the San Rafael and San Felipe with different
horses, Bruce Headley (Variety Road, 1986) and Jerry Fanning
(Desert Wine, 1983) won both with one horse.

   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL MULLER  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bill Muller's takes a quick looks at some current magazine
issues and a popular website:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; ``CONSUMER REPORTS'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ladies and gentlemen, start your engines! It's time for this
magazine's most-stolen issue _ rating the cars. This one is kept
locked in the public library's hermetically sealed bunker, only to
be checked out with three forms of ID, a blood sample and a
security deposit including, but not limited to, your first born. Of
course, this issue is well worth the trouble, rating every vehicle
from the Audi TT (isn't that cute?) to the Volvo S80 (less boxier
than ever!). Arizona drivers, of course, will skip straight to the
Sports Utility Vehicle section (we counted 45 SUV models alone),
even if the most rugged terrain they ever traverse is the ABCO
parking lot. The magazine goes high-tech this time around, rating
the car Web sites, from CarsDirect (www.carsdirect.com), which
allows you to ``build your own car'' (actually, just add extras),
to Kelley Blue Book (www.kbb.com), which pegs resale prices for
used cars. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; ``DISCOVER'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's definitely Science Lite, but the April issue includes a
couple of interesting pieces. The cover story details the discovery
of ancient Roman ships near the Leaning Tower of Pisa, in the
Tuscany region of Italy. Researchers have found the remnants of at
least 17 ships dating from around 200 B.C. to A.D. 500 and yielding
a number of artifacts, including incense burners, oil lamps, fish
hooks, sewing needles and numerous amphorae _ large earthen jars
used to transport goods around the Mediterranean. There's also an
interesting story on the world's ``deadliest carnivore'' a
half-mongoose, half-cloud leopard called a fossa, which lives in
Madagascar and apparently spends much of its food budget on Lemur
Helper. Our intrepid explorers actually manage to catch one of
these slick dudes, and then pass the tranquilized cat around for
polaroids. Way to be ecosensitive, dude.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; ``GOLF'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There is a strong message emanating from this magazine, and that
message is: ``We want to sell you some really expensive golf
clubs!'' Or a luxury car. Or both. Still, this issue includes some
interesting features, including an 18-hole ``course'' on everything
from repairing divots to teaching your kids to play. Of course,
like most articles in the magazine, some of these helpful hints
double as ads _ many of the ``solutions'' involve buying cool stuff
or going to a ritzy resort. If you really want to ruin your swing,
consult some of the technical-sounding instructions in the back,
with lines like ``the upper spine is farther from the target than
the lower spine.'' Uh huh. And the ball is rolling through the
desert. There is also a fun feature that names the nation's 10 best
public courses. Arizona made the list, with Apache Stronghold in
San Carlos. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; ``THE NEW YORKER'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Includes one of those great articles that keep you coming back
for more _ a feature story on the top writer for ``The Simpsons,''
a former ``Harvard Lampoon'' staffer named George Meyer. It is
Meyer who writes many of the lines that are quoted from the wildly
successful series. Even his fellow writers stand pretty much in awe

with way too much television. There is also a well-done piece by
political correspondent Joe Klein which notes that John McCain
spent much more time adopting a posture of indignance than actually
explaining his positions. He says McCain plowed his jet into the
George W. Bush aircraft carrier, crippling both campaigns. &QL;

<P>
   Bill Muller's takes a quick looks at some current magazine
issues and a popular website:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; ``CONSUMER REPORTS'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ladies and gentlemen, start your engines! It's time for this
magazine's most-stolen issue _ rating the cars. This one is kept
locked in the public library's hermetically sealed bunker, only to
be checked out with three forms of ID, a blood sample and a
security deposit including, but not limited to, your first born. Of
course, this issue is well worth the trouble, rating every vehicle
from the Audi TT (isn't that cute?) to the Volvo S80 (less boxier
than ever!). Arizona drivers, of course, will skip straight to the
Sports Utility Vehicle section (we counted 45 SUV models alone),
even if the most rugged terrain they ever traverse is the ABCO
parking lot. The magazine goes high-tech this time around, rating
the car Web sites, from CarsDirect (www.carsdirect.com), which
allows you to ``build your own car'' (actually, just add extras),
to Kelley Blue Book (www.kbb.com), which pegs resale prices for
used cars. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; ``DISCOVER'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's definitely Science Lite, but the April issue includes a
couple of interesting pieces. The cover story details the discovery
of ancient Roman ships near the Leaning Tower of Pisa, in the
Tuscany region of Italy. Researchers have found the remnants of at
least 17 ships dating from around 200 B.C. to A.D. 500 and yielding
a number of artifacts, including incense burners, oil lamps, fish
hooks, sewing needles and numerous amphorae _ large earthen jars
used to transport goods around the Mediterranean. There's also an
interesting story on the world's ``deadliest carnivore'' a
half-mongoose, half-cloud leopard called a fossa, which lives in
Madagascar and apparently spends much of its food budget on Lemur
Helper. Our intrepid explorers actually manage to catch one of
these slick dudes, and then pass the tranquilized cat around for
polaroids. Way to be ecosensitive, dude.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; ``GOLF'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There is a strong message emanating from this magazine, and that
message is: ``We want to sell you some really expensive golf
clubs!'' Or a luxury car. Or both. Still, this issue includes some
interesting features, including an 18-hole ``course'' on everything
from repairing divots to teaching your kids to play. Of course,
like most articles in the magazine, some of these helpful hints
double as ads _ many of the ``solutions'' involve buying cool stuff
or going to a ritzy resort. If you really want to ruin your swing,
consult some of the technical-sounding instructions in the back,
with lines like ``the upper spine is farther from the target than
the lower spine.'' Uh huh. And the ball is rolling through the
desert. There is also a fun feature that names the nation's 10 best
public courses. Arizona made the list, with Apache Stronghold in
San Carlos. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; ``THE NEW YORKER'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Includes one of those great articles that keep you coming back
for more _ a feature story on the top writer for ``The Simpsons,''
a former ``Harvard Lampoon'' staffer named George Meyer. It is
Meyer who writes many of the lines that are quoted from the wildly
successful series. Even his fellow writers stand pretty much in awe
of him. ``I would rather make George Meyer laugh than win an
Emmy,'' a colleague notes. Meyer, who traces his comedic roots back
to ``Mad'' magazine, culled his craft working for David Letterman
and Lorne Michaels. Writer David Owen does a nice job drawing Meyer
out, getting him to describe a less-than-idyllic childhood filled
with way too much television. There is also a well-done piece by

PENGUINS NIP RANGERS, 5-4 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH _ Jaromir Jagr celebrated his return to the
Pittsburgh Penguins with three assists on Sunday night. But as big
a pain as Jagr was to the New York Rangers, one of their former
teammates proved to be even deadlier to their playoff hopes.
</P>
<P>
   Aleksei Kovalev, traded to the Penguins in November 1998 in a
deal for Petr Nedved, scored his 21st goal of the season and
assisted on three others, including the tying goal, as the Penguins
rallied for a 5-4 victory.
</P>
<P>
   The Penguins, who triumphed after squandering three one-goal
leads, claimed sole possession of seventh place in the Eastern
Conference, with 74 points. Montreal, idle on Sunday, dropped to
eighth (the final playoff spot) with 73 points. With just eight
games left in their regular season, the Rangers are ninth with 72
points, followed by Buffalo with 71 and Carolina with 70.
</P>
<P>
   Kovalev and Jagr formed a joint wrecking crew on Sunday night.
Each right wing assisted on goals 43 seconds apart early in the
third period _ Martin Straka's second of the game at 6 minutes 19
seconds, tying it at 4-4, and Jiri Slegr's game-winner at 7:02.
</P>
<P>
   Kovalev, one of the heroes of the Rangers' 1994 Stanley Cup run,
tied a career high with his 4 points on Sunday night. In 13 games
against the Rangers, Kovalev has 6 goals and 8 assists. Jagr,
meanwhile, seemed to be getting stronger with every shift.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Richter returned in goal after sitting out the Rangers'
last two games because of a sore left knee that has bothered him
since the All-Star Game break. But Nedved (bruised ribs) and Jan
Hlavac (left hip pointer) _ two-thirds of the Rangers' vaunted
Czech line _ each missed their second straight game.
</P>
<P>
   And the Penguins, who had beaten the Rangers here, 3-1, eight
days earlier without their top two scorers, were back at full
strength.
</P>
<P>
   Jagr was back after missing the last 12 games. Jagr, who now
leads the league in scoring with 88 points even though he had only
played 55 games, was playing for the first time since Feb. 21, when
he injured his left hamstring against Tampa Bay. Five days before
that, Jagr had been kneed in the left thigh by Buffalo's Mike Peca.
Complications from the charley horse that resulted from Peca's hit
kept Jagr out of the Pittsburgh lineup until Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   Jagr responded with a pair of second-period assists. It was
obvious he was not fully recovered, but his presence seemed to
motivate the Penguins, who scored just 3:13 into the game.
</P>
<P>
   The goal came not from Jagr's newly formed Czech line, which had
Josef Beranek at left wing and Jan Hrdina at center, but from a
setup by Kovalev.
</P>
<P>
   Straka, who was standing alone in the slot, took a centering
pass from Kovalev and beat Richter inside the right post. And for
the fifth consecutive game, the Rangers had allowed the game's
first goal, this time on the third shot.
</P>
<P>
   At least it had not come on the first shot, something that had
happened to the Rangers in their last two games. But Pittsburgh did
have the first seven shots of the game.
</P>
<P>
   In Saturday's 3-2 victory in Philadelphia, the Rangers kept the
Flyers at bay in the third period, even though New York failed to
register a shot on goal for the final 14:35. On Sunday night, the
Rangers did not record their first shot until 7:23 had elapsed,
meaning that they had gone without a shot for the equivalent of
more than a period.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers, who were 0 for 9 on the power play over their
previous three games, went 0 for 3 on the power play during the
first period, including the 1:29 of 5-on-3 action.
</P>
<P>
   They made it 1-1 on a goal from their checking line, Eric
Lacroix's clumsy backhander from just off the crease beat
Jean-Sebastien Aubin at 16:46.
</P>
<P>
   And then it became a shootout.
</P>
<P>
   Janne Laukkanen blasted a power-play one-timer from between the
two circles and almost at the blue line at 5:29 of the second. At
13:35, Mike York blasted a slap shot from the right circle that
beat Aubin for York's 23d goal.
</P>
<P>
   Kovalev gave the Penguins their third one-goal lead at 16:27,
beating Richter with the teams skating four on a side. The Rangers
answered with goals 13 seconds apart. Valery Kamensky scored his
13th of the season, and fifth in his last 5 games, at 17:50,
sweeping the rebound of a Kim Johnsson shot past Aubin from off the
right post. And then John MacLean pounced on a loose puck in the
slot after Brian Leetch had pin-balled the puck into the offensive
zone. MacLean's shot went through Aubin's legs at 18:03.
</P>
<P>
   After rallying three times from one-goal deficits, the Rangers
took a 4-3 lead into the final period.

SIERRA CLUB: WYLY ADS `FIRST SALVO IN GENERAL ELECTIONS' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE YOZWIAK  
   
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   didates, environmentalists most fear Texas Gov. George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   For them, the $2 million in attack ads by Bush backers on the
environmental record of Arizona Sen. John McCain were sheer
hypocrisy _ and false to boot.
</P>
<P>
   The pre-Super Tuesday primary ads were paid for by Bush
supporter and fellow Texan Sam Wyly, a billionaire businessman who
is pushing clean energy after contributing to lawmakers who have
voted to weaken the federal Clean Air Act.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could think of no better way to get the public's attention
. . . than to launch our cause in the key primary states where the
eyes of the world were focused,'' said Wyly, chairman of his
family's newly formed ``Republicans for Clean Air.''
</P>
<P>
   Wyly cited these goals: cleaner, renewable energy from solar,
wind, water and natural gas; pollution controls on older,
coal-fired power plants; and awareness of clean-air issues within
the Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   But if the recent ads were any gauge for the future, Republicans
for Clean Air will be more about generating spin than eliminating
smog.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore can expect special interests to spend
millions to tar him in the same way Wyly did McCain, said Daniel
Weiss, political director of the 600,000-member Sierra Club. It's
the nation's most politically active environmental group, having
itself spent nearly $100,000 to criticize Bush's environmental
record, and more than $1 million in campaign contributions Bush has
received from polluting industries.
</P>
<P>
   ``One could look at this (Wyly) ad campaign not as the last ads
of the primaries but the first salvo in the general election,''
Weiss said, ``as Bush and his supporters attempt to paint his brown
record green.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Sierra Club research, Texas leads the nation in
toxic releases, toxic air emissions from industries, toxic chemical
accidents and cancer-causing pollution, and it is home to Houston,
which last year surpassed Los Angeles as the nation's ``smog
capital.''
</P>
<P>
   Sierra Club president Carl Pope urged Wyly to pull the ads
because they ``paint a false picture of Gov. Bush's poor record
governing the most polluted state in America.''
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, President Clinton rode to a second White House
term with the mantra: ``Medicaid, Medicare, education and the
environment.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Nov. 7 general election, Gore's major points of division
with Bush will be: gun control, abortion rights, campaign-finance
reform and _ again _ the environment.
</P>
<P>
   The Wyly campaign ads brought to the fore both campaign-finance
reform and the environment, though not necessarily in the way Wyly
wanted.
</P>
<P>
   The ads criticized McCain and praised Bush but did not overtly
say ``Vote for Bush.'' Still, by running the ads in the key primary
states of New York, Ohio and California the week before the March 7
primaries, their timing brought into question their legality.
</P>
<P>
   Such an ad blitz, if done with the cooperation of the Bush
campaign, could be in violation of campaign-finance laws, and the
ads' failure to properly disclose their sponsors could be in
violation of Federal Communication Commission rules, according to
Roy Fletcher, deputy campaign manager for McCain.
</P>
<P>
   ``So far as we have been able to determine, this organization
(Republicans for Clean Air) has no legal existence other than as a
front for the Bush presidential campaign,'' Fletcher wrote in a
March 2 letter to the enforcement division of the FCC.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, Republicans for Clean Air put out a press release
revealing their identities. On March 8, the day after the
primaries, Wyly mailed copies of the ads and a letter explaining
his group to reporters nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are rolling out the welcome mat to all Americans who care
about the good cause of clean air. This is only our first week, and
our family is the first to join. But we intend to build a permanent
nationwide Republicans for Clean Air advocacy organization,'' Wyly
said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush maintained that his campaign had no prior knowledge of the
Wyly ads. Yet the commercials were funded by the same folks who
have been some of Bush's biggest campaign donors.
</P>
<P>
   Wyly and his brother, Charles, gave Bush a total of $210,000 for
his 1994 and 1998 gubernatorial races. Charles Wyly is a Bush
``Pioneer,'' that is, one of 200 wealthy individuals who have
pledged to raise at least $100,000 for Bush's presidential race.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's backers linked the placement of the Wyly ads to Tony
Fabrizio, who they said also placed ads last year slamming
publisher Steve Forbes in the name of the ``Republican Leadership
Council,'' which the McCain camp identified as a Bush campaign
front.
</P>
<P>
   ``For Bush . . . to claim ignorance of these ads is far beyond
incredible,'' said McCain 2000 campaign manager Rick Davis. ``It
miserably fails the political sniff test.''
</P>
<P>
   Sam Wyly called the ads ``issues advocacy advertising,'' the
first action financed by Wyly following last month's $7.9 billion
sale of Sterling Software and Sterling Commerce, software and
e-commerce businesses that Wyly co-founded.
</P>
<P>
   The Dallas-based Wyly got his start in the mining and
oil-refining businesses. Today, Wyly wears many hats: chairman of
Michaels Stores, the nation's largest chain of arts and crafts
stores; the founder of Maverick Capital, a hedge fund with several
billion in assets; and chairman of Green Mountain Energy, which he
describes as the nation's leading retailer of environmentally clean
electricity, serving 100,000 customers in California and
Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   And, according to the Sierra Club, Wyly and his family have
contributed more than $200,000 to ``dirty air'' members of
Congress. The latest Wyly ad campaign, the environmentalists say,
is filled with half-truths.
</P>
<P>
   As the Wyly ad showed a photo of smokestacks against a clear
dawn, the voice-over said, ``He (Bush) led one of the first states
in America to clamp down on old, coal-burning electric power
plants.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Sierra Club, citing published sources, said Bush's
``clamp-down'' was a voluntary plan, written by industry; that only
33 of the 166 biggest industrial plants in Texas have volunteered
to participate, and of those only three have taken steps to cut
emissions.
</P>
<P>
   The Wyly ad showed a photo of Bush over a background of green
fields, as the narrator says, ``Bush clean-air laws will reduce air
pollution more than a quarter-million tons a year.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Sierra Club's analysis shows Bush's actions would reduce
pollution by less than half that amount.
</P>
<P>
   ``The frightening thing for democracy,'' said the Sierra Club's
Weiss, ``is that we've never seen a small set of individuals spend
so much money trying to defeat one candidate and get another
candidate elected.''
</P>
<P>
   But the worst is yet to come, Weiss predicted.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Wyly brothers will be the tip of the soft money iceberg''
in the 2000 presidential election. &QL;

JOHNSON TAKES HARD LOOK AT HIS ROSTER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   VERO BEACH, Fla. _ With the organization lacking depth at the
minor-league level, Los Angeles Dodgers manager Davey Johnson said
he's willing to do the unconventional to protect the depth at the
major-league level.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said he'd prefer to carry six outfielders and six
infielders, straying from the usual combination of five outfielders
and seven infielders.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that he still intends to carry three players with
experience at the shortstop position, providing 24-year-old Alex
Cora is the starter.
</P>
<P>
   And with Cora the leading candidate at shortstop, it appears
Kevin Elster and the versatile Jose Vizcaino will be backup
infielders. In the outfield, F.P. Santangelo and Geronimo Berroa
are in line for the fifth and sixth outfielder jobs. Gary Sheffield
and Shawn Green are locks in the outfield while Todd Hollandsworth
and Devon White remain close in the race for center field.
</P>
<P>
   Berroa, who began his career as a first baseman, impressed the
Dodgers with his bat. He's hitting .364 this spring, and could
provide power off the bench.
</P>
<P>
   Santangelo was signed to play outfield. He's also played 20
innings at second base this spring and should be Mark
Grudzielanek's main backup.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I can't be an everyday player because they already have
the outfield,'' Berroa said. ``I prepared myself to be a reserve
player. I can be used to give one of those guys a day off, or I can
be ready as a pinch hitter. That's what I'm ready for.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Dodgers opt to go with six outfielders and six
infielders, including the three shortstops, two catchers and 11
pitchers, it could leave the club with some tough decisions, namely
regarding what to do with Dave Hansen.
</P>
<P>
   Hansen was 13 of 48 (.271) as a pinch-hitter last season, and
was Johnson's first choice in that role. But the Dodgers added more
options off the bench during the offseason, and since the
organization lacks outfield depth at the minor-league level,
Johnson wants to keep the outfielders with the big-league club.
</P>
<P>
   Gagne's chance going?: Rookie right-hander Eric Gagne has an
important start today against Florida. After three miserable
outings, Gagne's spot as the No. 4 starter is coming into question.
Gagne's allowed 15 earned runs in 8 innings and opponents are
batting .415 against him. He's also walked six.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always start slow in spring training,'' Gagne said. ``This
is typical. People at home are like, `What's wrong?' But this is
how I pitch.
</P>
<P>
   As it's working out, Gagne may be battling Carlos Perez for the
final spot in the rotation rather than Orel Hershiser competing
with Perez.
</P>
<P>
   Perez has a 10.00 ERA and opponents are hitting .341 against
him. Hershiser's ERA is 2.77 and opponents are hitting .239. And
only Kevin Brown and Chan Ho Park have thrown more innings than
Hershiser, who's thrown 13.
</P>
<P>
   In another twist to the pitching, Johnson said Mike Judd, Jeff
Williams and Hershiser would pitch in ``camp'' games beginning
today while Perez starts Wednesday against Montreal. Originally,
Hershiser was going to start that game with Perez relieving.
</P>
<P>
   Odds and ends: The Dodgers looked into canceling today's game at
Florida because mumps has broken out at the Marlins camp. But after
consulting with team doctors, Johnson said the trip will be made.
``The doctor also told me if anybody can't remember if they're
vaccinated for mumps, don't go. I don't think I'll tell them that
because I wouldn't have anyone to go. But I don't think there's any
danger,'' Johnson said.... After receiving three stitches in his
left pinkie after injuring it on a head-first slide Friday,
Sheffield said he sees no problem with being ready for the April 3
opener in Montreal. Sheffield could return to the lineup next week
if the swelling dissipates in his finger.... The Dodgers optioned
pitcher Jamie Arnold, outfielder Kevin Gibbs and catcher Angel Pena
to Triple-A Albuquerque. Pena, who has lost 20 pounds since
reporting to camp at 262, impressed Johnson. ``Of all the guys in
camp, I was impressed with (Pena) and the way he went about his
business and the pride he took in his catching and his work ethic.
It showed in his performance,'' Johnson said.... The club also
reassigned left-hander Rick DeHart and outfielder Brent Cookson to
minor-league camp.

BOEING STRIKE IS OVER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAUL NYHAN  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The longest engineering strike in the history of The Boeing Co.
is over.
</P>
<P>
   Striking Boeing engineers and technical workers Sunday said it
was time to return to work, voting by a more than two-to-one margin
to accept the company's latest offer and end a 40-day strike.
</P>
<P>
   The vote capped an unprecedented walkout by between 15,000 and
18,000 engineers and technical workers that backed up airplane
deliveries, slowed key defense work and took a chunk out of the
company's stock price.
</P>
<P>
   The striking workers begin returning this morning at 9 a.m.,
though the company agreed to give workers who need it as long as
two weeks to leave other jobs or commitments.
</P>
<P>
   ``The technical community has found its strength and its voice
and we intend to continue to use it in powerful and positive
ways,'' said Charles Bofferding, executive director of the Society
of Professional Engineering Employees in Aerospace.
</P>
<P>
   Both camps were feeling increasing pressure as the strike
entered its second month. Boeing customers were beginning to cancel
flights while union members were facing mounting financial
concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both sides saw that this thing was about to escalate,'' said
Richard Trumka, the secretary-treasurer of the AFL-CIO, who both
said said played a key role in brokering an agreement in
Washington, D.C., last week.
</P>
<P>
   The engineers approved the contract by a vote of 3,825 to 1,526
or 71.5 percent in favor; technical workers approved it by 3,042 to
1,259 or 70.7 percent margin.
</P>
<P>
   Now that the two sides have settled their differences, they face
the daunting task of eliminating a backlog of work. They must also
repair relations between union members and management and between
those who crossed the picket lines and those who didn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have got to get back to a family,'' Bofferding said.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing must also untangle the snags on its production lines, in
its laboratories and elsewhere that the absence of most of its
engineers and technicians created. The company only recently
rebounded from production line problems that dogged it in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, Boeing executives were still assessing the damage of the
strike and they could offer their initial estimate as early as
tomorrow, the Associated Press reported.
</P>
<P>
   Although union negotiators unanimously endorsed the contract
offer, and sold it to their members all weekend, it wasn't always
an easy sale.
</P>
<P>
   Resistance to the proposal fueled a desire for a greater show of
respect and better compensation from Boeing, some union members
said. They complained that they spent 40 days in the rain, sleet
and occasional sunlight for a contract that did little more than
preserve the status quo.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't accomplish anything,'' said Omar Zubi, an engineer
at Boeing's Renton plant who has spent three years at the company.
``If you take my jacket and I take it back I did not win.''
</P>
<P>
   But, others said they wouldn't gain much by staying on the
picket lines for another two weeks or longer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both sides could have sustained significant further damage,''
said Craig Buckham, the president of the union.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the raft of concessions that Boeing made during the
last round of talks helped win over a majority of the striking
workers.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the union fought off the company's drive to impose
healthcare premiums on engineers and technical workers. During the
last three months, Boeing executives repeatedly stressed the move
was a vital part of their plan to control expenses.
</P>
<P>
   The company also boosted the amount in guaranteed raises it was
willing to offer every year. Under the contract, technical
employees are guaranteed a four-percent raise in the first year, a
three-percent raise in the second and a three-percent raise in the
third.
</P>
<P>
   Engineers would receive at least a three-percent raise every
year.
</P>
<P>
   The company provided additional money for merit raises,
employees with special skills, such as software engineers, and
promotions.
</P>
<P>
   Union leaders also secured a bonus for members. But the size and
structure of the payments left many members disappointed or angry.
</P>
<P>
   The company promised workers $1,000 if they ratified the pact.
But, workers would need to hit two separate airplane delivery
targets to collect another $1,500.
</P>
<P>
   Once Boeing makes 225 deliveries this year, employees would
receive another $500. And they would collect an additional $1,000
if the company hits its target of 491 airplane deliveries by Dec.
31.
</P>
<P>
   The payments, however, fall far short of the bonuses that Boeing
handed to members of the International Association of Machinists
and Aerospace Workers last year. Those payments averaged $4,400.
</P>
<P>
   Other key provisions include:
</P>
<P>
   Allowing employees to cover same-sex domestic partners under
Boeing's medical benefits plan. No time is set for implementation.
</P>
<P>
   Boosting pension contributions to $50 per month from the current
$40 level.
</P>
<P>
   Creating a joint union-executive leadership council to examine
health care, quality efficiency and a host of other issues.
</P>
<P>
   As workers prepared to return to the job this morning, they were
unclear as to what management's priorities would be.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be everything at once,'' said Rick Plunkett,
contract administrator for the union.

MCCAIN FACES HOT SEAT IN SENATE; VETERANS ANGRY OVER HEALTH PLAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PAT FLANNERY  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In returning to the U.S. Senate, John McCain of Arizona will
rejoin the national battle over health-care benefits for thousands
of veterans and current members of the military.
</P>
<P>
   McCain is sponsoring legislation to address complaints about
TRICARE, the military's experiment in managed care that has been
roundly criticized by active duty military and retirees alike.
</P>
<P>
   As it was during the GOP primaries, however, that the
politically active retiree community is divided over McCain's role
in the debate. &QL; 
 &UR; LOYALTY TO CAUSE CHALLENGED &QL; 
While the powerful Military Coalition has praised McCain for his
efforts on behalf of its constituents, others are challenging
McCain's loyalty to the cause of restoring lifetime health-care
benefits to career military people.
</P>
<P>
   Terry Slough, 60, of Huachuca City, an Army special forces
retiree who served in Vietnam, accused McCain and other early
TRICARE supporters of betraying a government promise to provide
lifetime health care to military retirees.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did what we were expected to do _ and now we get the
shaft,'' Slough said.
</P>
<P>
   Slough's comments have been echoed by other retirees whose
benefits eroded and free health care disappeared after reform
legislation was ushered through Congress in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Although McCain has long been considered an advocate for
veterans, the hot-button issue of health care cost him some of
their votes during the presidential primaries. One group, the
Coalition of Retired Military Veterans, based in South Carolina,
repeatedly broadsided McCain during the race and backed his rival,
Texas Gov. George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; AIDE'S MOTIVES QUESTIONED &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Its gripe with McCain: he helped craft legislation establishing
TRICARE, and he did it with the help of an aide whose motives they
suspect. &QL; 
The onetime aide, David McIntyre, 37, wrote some of the proposals
that became part of TRICARE before leaving McCain's staff in August
1993 to join Blue Cross Blue Shield of Arizona. There, he put
together a corporation composed mostly of Blue Cross organizations
to bid on a contract to manage TRICARE's health maintenance
organization in 16 central and Southwestern states including
Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   The new company, TriWest Healthcare Alliance, won the $2.5
billion contract in June 1996. Headed by McIntyre, its bid was
challenged by a local competitor. The challenge was withdrawn when
TriWest negotiated a financial settlement and offered the
competitor a subcontract.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can tell you categorically that TriWest did not request any
type of congressional or senatorial intervention with the
Department of Defense,'' TriWest spokesman Bob Wolfersteig said.
``It would probably be the kiss of death if we got any sort of
senatorial interference.''
</P>
<P>
   That hasn't prevented top officers of TriWest and Blue Cross
from being politically active: they and their spouses have
contributed $18,000 to McCain's campaigns since 1997, according to
a database maintained by the Center for Responsive Politics.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FACTIONS SPLIT ON MCCAIN &QL;
</P>
<P>
   James F. Gunn, a retired Marine heading the Coalition of Retired
Military Veterans, believes McCain has lost credibility with some
retirees because of his role in promoting a health program that
many find offensive.
</P>
<P>
   Yet retired Air Force Col. Paul Arcari, director of government
relations for the 400,000-member Retired Officers Association, said
McCain has been ``a solid, consistent supporter of the uniformed
services community.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's easy to point a lot of fingers and blame people for
something that looked like a great idea at the time,'' Arcari said.
``But you can't blame any one person.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain's office did not return phone calls seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   As a member of the Senate Armed Services committee, McCain, a
former Navy flier and ex-prisoner of war, was among a number of
lawmakers in both chambers who haggled to forge the new military
health-care system. Based on a test program dating to the late
1980s, it was incrementally imposed in annual defense authorization
legislation between 1991 and 1994. It has been tinkered with ever
since.
</P>
<P>
   The Defense Department hired contractors in 11 &UR; regions to manage
a network of physicians and hospitals to provide private care
supplementing the shrinking number of military health-care
facilities. Costing roughly $17 billion a year, the military system
serves as many retirees as active service members.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; IMPROVEMENT IS TOP PRIORITY &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It has been so widely criticized that Gen. Henry Shelton,
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, vowed to make its
improvement a top priority in the coming budget year.
</P>
<P>
   ``During the past six years, they've torn the guts out of the
military health care system,'' complained retired Air Force Col.
Bruce Mikesell of Maryland, who has helped lobby Congress on the
issue.
</P>
<P>
   Until the early 1990s, lifelong health care for military members
was assured. Free care was available at military facilities. If
members went off base, the Civilian Health and Medical Program of
the Uniformed Services (CHAMPUS) covered 80 percent of costs.
</P>
<P>
   Dependents and retirees got free care at military facilities on
a space-available basis, and they could use CHAMPUS for private
care until age 65, when they moved onto Medicare rolls. Even then,
they were still eligible for free care at military facilities.
</P>
<P>
   By the early '90s, however, the system was forced to retool amid
spiraling health-care costs, deep cuts in defense spending, a
shrinking military and base closures. Military health facilities
were going out of business, crowding those that remained and making
access a huge issue for many of the insured. &QL; 
 &UR; VETERANS LOSING OUT ON CARE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In most cases, retirees were squeezed out of free care because
there was no longer space. Privatization became the buzzword.
</P>
<P>
   TRICARE offers three options: a traditional 80-20 insurance plan
for active military, and 75-25 coverage for retirees; a slightly
less expensive preferred provider plan operated through a network
of private caregivers; and the cheapest option, a health
maintenance organization administered by contractors through
TRICARE's network of providers. The latter uses remaining military
facilities and a network of private providers.
</P>
<P>
   Active service members and their families have free enrollment
in the HMO and pay nominal co-payments only if they go to private
physicians instead of military facilities. Even so, they face
numerous bureaucratic obstacles, key among them that the HMO
network is not available in some parts of the country or overseas.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, retirees and their dependents must pay to belong to
any of the plans. Often, the cheapest HMO option isn't available,
and since most military medical facilities are jammed year-round,
free care at military facilities is largely gone. In most regions
of the country, retirees over 65 also are forced to leave TRICARE
and go onto Medicare rolls, losing pharmacy benefits and reducing
coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after TRICARE was enacted, retiree organizations sued,
saying they'd been promised free lifetime benefits. A federal judge
ruled last year that only Congress could rectify the problem. The
U.S. Supreme Court has now been asked to review the case.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CONGRESS LOOKING AT CHANGES &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The House and Senate Armed Services committees are considering
legislation to make the plans cheaper _ or free _ and more
accessible for everyone.
</P>
<P>
   Other bills would make affordable or free prescription drugs
readily available, cut TRICARE bureaucracy and help retirees over
65 find alternatives to Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   The Military Coalition supports legislation sponsored by McCain
restoring free lifetime care to retirees who enlisted before
mid-1956 and giving retirees over 65 the option of enrolling in an
HMO or joining the civilian Federal Employee Health Benefits
Program.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Slough, the Huachuca City vet, wonders why McCain
and other lawmakers didn't see the disaster looming when TRICARE
was launched in the early '90s. He thinks the system's only effect
was to fatten health care contractors at the expense of those who
gave their best years to the military.
</P>
<P>
   Now living with debilitating effects of advanced-stage diabetes,
Slough is in danger of losing his legs. He refuses to seek medical
care under TRICARE. He buys his drugs in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will die before I pay again for something I already
earned,'' Slough said. &QL;

GONZAGA SHOWS IT'S NOT MERELY A CINDERELLA STORY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TUCSON, Ariz. _ Are there any more questions about Gonzaga? Can
there be?
</P>
<P>
   Are there any more doubts?
</P>
<P>
   Any more jokers who can't get off this Cinderella nonsense, such
as, for instance, CBS, which was seen displaying an ``If the
slipper fits ...'' graphic during its broadcast Saturday?
</P>
<P>
   What the so-called experts should really start doing is talking
about this Gonzaga team as one of the most tough, skilled,
versatile, fun and disciplined squads ever to hit the NCAA
hardwood.
</P>
<P>
   They aren't a Cinderella surprise. They're the poster boys for
what happens when skilled, athletic, hungry and determined
basketball players meld as a team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, some teams don't get along as much as ours does. It's a
shame,'' forward Casey Calvary said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a real fun sport when you really like your teammates and
everybody gets along and you are kind of rolling. That's why we've
had success.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if we'd have lost, we still wouldn't have been arguing
amongst ourselves. We just never do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Surely the nation's growing legion of Zag fans would have been
pleased if Gonzaga had managed to ``merely'' slip by St. John's.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, what the Zags did against the fellas from the big, bad
Big East was nothing less than a textbook dress-down.
</P>
<P>
   With a killer game plan and impressive execution, the Zags
showed they were far more than senior guard Richie Frahm getting on
a hot shooting streak or Matt Santangelo bailing them out with his
clutch play.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the Zags relentlessly attacked St. John's with an
inside-out game that, well, has helped turn the West Region inside
out.
</P>
<P>
   Are the Zags now the favorites in the West?
</P>
<P>
   The Zags play Thursday against Purdue, while LSU and Wisconsin
will join them from Salt Lake City after Arizona was crushed by the
Badgers and St. John's was drilled by the Zags Saturday, 82-76.
</P>
<P>
   But don't ask Gonzaga any of that stuff about who's the favorite
because you know what these guys are going to say:
</P>
<P>
   This coming weekend in Albuquerque at the West Region Finals is
a four-team tournament and that's the only way to look at it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're happy to be here. Happy to be a 10 seed or whatever,''
senior center Axel Dench said. ``There are 16 teams left and now
it's a more level playing field, but it doesn't matter.''
</P>
<P>
   No, it doesn't matter. Not now, not after Dench teamed up with
Calvary on Saturday and displayed an inside power game that
completely overwhelmed St. John's.
</P>
<P>
   When Calvary went to the bench with two quick fouls early in the
first half, Dench was a revelation.
</P>
<P>
   He called for the ball. He backed down in the post and found
little resistance from a St. John's team whose lack of height
became a glaring weakness and worse when they made no adjustments.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzaga coach Mark Few said his 6-10 Australian center has been
the difference over the last month and half.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we hit that little lull late in the league season, he
started to understand that we needed his physical presence
inside,'' Few said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's always had that nice 3 and, typical of an overseas
player, he always prefers to filter out there and explore that. He
did that again (against St. John's). I had to pull him out and
explain he's spending far too much time in the perimeter and we
needed him to slide in there and start going to work.
</P>
<P>
   ``To his credit, he did. And that might be as big a change as
we've had from the dog days of February to right now. He's become a
force.''
</P>
<P>
   With Calvary getting so much attention for his strong play
inside, Dench, too, realized he could ratchet up his power game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got beat by a couple of teams we shouldn't have,'' Dench
said. ``They just out-muscled us and the coaches challenged us to
not look to the referees for any help. During practice, we
literally beat each other up. Hey, no referees are calling fouls
here. So come game time, if I get the ball inside and no one sinks
down, if I get fouled, I get fouled. You have to answer the call.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a three-weapon attack with Richie, Matt and Casey
and I kind of slip in and have two big games. So now people have to
say, `Oh, now they have four weapons.'''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't just on the offensive end of the floor, either. St.
John's continued to run the same schemes the entire game.
</P>
<P>
   Dench said he was surprised by St. John's eventual level of
frustration.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure if it was a team thing, but we kind of countered
their offense and found out how to shut that down,'' Dench said.
``But they continued to run the same offense, which kind of
surprised us. I said, `Well, if you're just going to keep running
into a brick wall, then we'll just happily let you keep doing
that.' Even when we took the lead, they didn't change things and
it's like `Hey, that's your loss.'
</P>
<P>
   ``When we're clicking, we're helping down. We're rotating
around. We can do some damage on man-to-man and plus the zone.
We've got that working finally.''
</P>
<P>
   Now Dench and the inside-out game that the Zags executed so
successfully against St. John's is heading down to New Mexico,
where someone reminded Dench that fellow Australian Luc Longley
played college hoops.
</P>
<P>
   For the Zags, a repeat of Dench's game against St. John's could
come in handy against Purdue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I forgot that Luc went down there. But yeah, if his mojo is
still down there and working, I'll rub my head on the ground and
try and get some of that going for me,'' Dench said.
</P>
<P>
   Knowing the Zags, they'll all rub their heads in the dirt with
Dench. The team that gets down and dirty together usually has a
good time winning. Or at least that's the case when it comes to the
Zags.

   TEMPE, Ariz. _ Jim Edmonds was voted by the fans as the Anaheim
Angels franchise's all-time center fielder, and now it seems he
might actually get to wear the team's uniform this season.
</P>
<P>
   Amid rampant speculation that he would be traded to the New York
Yankees, Edmonds was approached Saturday morning by Angels general
manager Bill Stoneman, who wanted to clear the air and let Edmonds
know where he stood.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been hearing things from everybody other than me,''
Stoneman said. ``I thought it was important to talk to him so he
could get it straight from me. Hopefully it was helpful. He said
thanks at the end. I could tell he certainly welcomed the
opportunity to talk.''
</P>
<P>
   Edmonds has been in Arizona for more than a month, waiting and
anticipating, but nothing's happened. The Angels break camp in less
than two weeks, and Edmonds now has to be ready for the chance
he'll play the season in Anaheim and enter free agency afterward.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really never thought I was going to leave. You guys tell me
that,'' Edmonds said to reporters. ``I really didn't have a thought
either way. I come here and play every day until something happens.
I haven't tried getting an apartment in New York or tried selling
my house.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he would be happy to remain in Anaheim for the 2000
season, Edmonds said: ``I don't have a choice. I'll be happy
wherever I play. I'm just going to play the next six years then
settle down with my kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Stoneman said he understands all the speculation can be a
distraction to a team. But he said he thinks the players and
coaching staff have handled it well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Remarkably so,'' he said. ``I don't know how distracted some
of them have been. I know one in particular has been rumored daily.
I didn't realize how distracted he was.''
</P>
<P>
   But making a trade for trade's sake is not what he's about,
Stoneman said. Yes, the Angels need pitching. Yes, the have more
outfielders than they need. But ...
</P>
<P>
   ``My job is to improve the ballclub, not shuffle people
around,'' he said. ``Pitching is very difficult to obtain in
trades. If there's something we can do that helps us, we'll do
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Yankees executives have decided to hold off making a
trade for Edmonds, at least for now. During a dinner meeting last
Thursday, Yankees officials voted they would not give up either
pitcher Ramiro Mendoza or infielder Alfonso Soriano for Edmonds.
And Stoneman isn't likely to settle for less than a package that
includes at least one of them.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees believe that the longer they wait, the further the
price for Edmonds will fall. But Stoneman doesn't buy into that
theory.
</P>
<P>
   ``In general terms, when a trade happens, it will happen when
it's something that will help our ballclub,'' he said. ``I'm not
worried about the timing, other than if it helps us. Then yeah,
we'll do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Hill roughed up:Angels starter Ken Hill gave up six runs and
nine hits in four innings as the Angels fell to the Chicago White
Sox, 16-3, Sunday afternoon at Tempe Diablo Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Mike Scioscia, however, said he saw positive signs from
Hill and believes Hill will be fine when he makes his opening day
start against the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kenny's velocity was very good, and his command at times was
good,'' Scioscia said. ``I think Ken's on track.''
</P>
<P>
   The loss was the Angels' (8-11) fifth in a row, but Scioscia,
again, is not expressing concern.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not downplaying losing like that, but we're seeing
positive things from key guys,'' he said. ``We set out spring
training with a definite plan. We target the last seven or eight
games to try to get our 'A' lineup out there and go hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Ortiz to throw: Pitcher Ramon Ortiz will throw off the mound
this morning for the first time since he was diagnosed with a
slight tear of the labrum in his right shoulder. If all goes well,
Ortiz will throw another bullpen workout before starting in a game
again, probably this weekend or early next week.
